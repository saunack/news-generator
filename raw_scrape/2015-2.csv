1,12,2015,Towards peace in the House,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s >confabulations last Friday with Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh on the long-pending >Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill, a few hours after he >struck an unusually conciliatory note on the floor of Parliament, signalled a dramatic change of style. Gone was the air of aggression, the taunting tone, and the reminder that his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, >had won an election last year . Mr. Modi’s new mild manner seemed to be an acknowledgement that a majority in the Lok Sabha is not enough, and he needs to build a consensus to give his government’s legislative agenda a chance. A year and a half after he came to power, the Prime Minister has begun to realise that no matter how handsome a mandate the electorate might have given the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, barring the budget — that can get by with support only from the Lok Sabha — all other laws need the backing of both Houses. >Recent setbacks in the Assembly elections have also dimmed the chances of the NDA significantly increasing its numbers in the Rajya Sabha. The government needs to negotiate with the Opposition to get its bills passed. Else, the government risks attracting the phrase ‘policy paralysis’ in its second year, and thereby parallels with the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance in its eighth. The parallel has cautionary value: once UPA-2 lost the lines of communication with the Opposition, it lost control of its political narrative.
After his Lok Sabha triumph, Mr. Modi had shown disdain for Parliament and the parliamentary process, barely attending the House and refusing to answer tough questions on the floor of the House, when sought. Citing rules, he refused to concede to the Congress the position of Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, even as he kept his engagement with the Opposition to the minimum. Indeed, he sought to implement at the Centre a model that had seen him virtually bypassing the Gujarat State Assembly in the years that he was Chief Minister: a look at the records show the Assembly, as in most other States, barely functioned; and whatever legislation had to be passed was done with minimal debate. That is clearly not possible in Delhi, where the levels of scrutiny — and resistance — are much higher. More important, a Central government must reckon with the Rajya Sabha, and courtesies need to be extended in one House to be reciprocated in the other. Now, with the economic reforms stuck, and the electorate having spoken twice this year overwhelmingly against the BJP, first in Delhi and more recently in Bihar, the Prime Minister appears to have finally read the writing on the wall. Mr. Modi made a good beginning on Friday, but he needs to continue in the same way, engaging the Opposition even as he sends out a message of inclusion, tolerance and plurality by checking the hotheads in his party, if he wishes to make a success of the rest of his tenure.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/towards-peace-in-the-house/article7933711.ece
1,12,2015,End the stand-off,"The >brief detention of 13 Indian border guards by the Nepali police on Sunday is yet another example of the deteriorating relations between the two countries. Nepali authorities of the Armed Police Force (APF) say India’s Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) guards illegally crossed the border with weapons, while Indian officials say the guards had inadvertently stepped into the neighbouring territory while chasing “smugglers”. The crux of the situation is, the differences between India and Nepal that have led to a >two-month blockade at the border are now having a direct impact on the close cooperation and trust that the SSB and APF soldiers have shared for decades, and this marks a dangerous turn. It will require urgent discussions at every level of the military and civilian leadership on both sides to now bring this situation to a resolution, clear the protestors to the largest extent possible on the Nepali side, and clear the backlog of trucks that have been piling up on the Indian side since September 23 so ordinary Nepalis can receive much-needed fuel, food, medicines and other essential supplies. While some trucks have been released in the past few weeks, they are by no means enough, and all of Kathmandu now sees long serpentine queues for every commodity. Regardless of relations at present, it is unacceptable for India to stand by, especially as the days and nights grow colder, without moving in to help Nepal. Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, has warned that more than three million children under the age of five in Nepal now face the risk of death or disease in winter.
This will by no means be easy. The government of Prime Minister K.P. Oli could start simply by pushing through the amendments that his predecessor, Sushil Koirala, had cleared in the Cabinet. The government had also started talks with Madhesi leaders to reach a consensus on constitutional amendments that would bring the country back to normalcy. But talks collapsed last month, following which the government started police action against the protesters, which actually made matters worse. Prime Minister Oli’s obsession with blaming India for all problems Nepal is facing serves as an excuse for his government’s inability to find a solution. India too must face the fact that all its attempts at intervention in the Constitution process have come a cropper. It is time for diplomacy rather than a dogmatic stance, as bad relations with Nepal will begin to seep into every sphere of bilateral ties, as they have already begun to taint the relations between the border security forces. Eventually, whatever the resolution, India can only deal with the government in Nepal; it cannot engage any of the political groups there directly. Nor is it fighting a popularity contest inside Nepal. A stable, peaceful democratic Nepal is in India’s best interests. For this to be realised, both nations should first give up the confrontationist approach, and work together to resolve the impasse over the Constitution in Nepal.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/end-the-standoff/article7933712.ece
2,12,2015,No diplomacy by stealth,"The >Paris handshake between Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is indeed a welcome, and unexpected, moment that could ‘change the climate’ of the relationship. They had >last spoken in Ufa in July — though they shared the same stage at the UN in September, they only managed a wave across the room. This is far from the vision that Mr. Modi had himself laid out at the start of his tenure, one where neighbours would try to meet without occasion, and engage to sort out bilateral issues, when possible. The stop-start nature of the Prime Ministers’ meetings have had an impact on talks at every level of engagement, and even the meeting of the Directors General of Military Operations they agreed to five months ago has not yet materialised. Other issues on which a resolution is required remain, and which have now been pending for three years. These include the implementation of a liberalised visa regime, upgradation of trade checkpoint infrastructure at the international border and the Line of Control, and other measures such as bank facilities to further trade that Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Sharif have spoken of. India’s concerns about Pakistan giving free rein to terrorists like Hafiz Saeed and establishment support to terror groups, too, remain. While Delhi has stuck to its principle of not taking substantive talks ahead until it sees action from Pakistan on terrorism, it is heartening to note that basic trade between the two countries, business visits and civil society conferences have not been barred. The Prime Ministers met in Paris even as the government must make a decision on whether to allow their cricket teams to play in Sri Lanka. It must be remembered, that like the other issues, playing cricket too is a commitment already made by Indian officials, and India stands to be penalised if it does not keep the BCCI’s contract with the Pakistan Cricket Board.
All these steps will be particularly important in creating an atmosphere for a productive visit by Mr. Modi to Islamabad in 2016, when he has accepted an invitation to attend the SAARC summit. However, none of it will be possible without a sustained and transparent process of engagement. Since this government took office, India’s Pakistan policy has been marked by stealth, surprise and secrecy — whether it was the invitation to SAARC leaders, the cancellation of Foreign Secretary-level talks, the confabulations between the Prime Ministers in Kathmandu last November, dispatching the Foreign Secretary to Islamabad this year, the Ufa engagement, or everything else that followed. It is time to unveil what the government plans to do on Pakistan. If non-engagement was an option, the Prime Ministers would not have shaken hands or talked confidentially in Paris. If engagement is the only way forward — as it most certainly is — then it must be done by taking the people into confidence, not by keeping them in the dark about each new initiative, that seems to evaporate as soon as it is brought to light.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-diplomacy-by-stealth/article7937726.ece
2,12,2015,Time to abolish criminal defamation,"The >observation by the Supreme Court that political leaders should not take criticism as a personal insult highlights a particular kind of intolerance that is rarely referred to in the ongoing debate on the subject: the inability of public figures to tolerate criticism and their repeated resort to criminal defamation proceedings to stifle adverse comment. Nothing exemplifies this as much as the 100-odd prosecutions launched by the government of Tamil Nadu against politicians and the media. The court’s remark came in the context of several of cases of defamation reaching its portals in recent years. Under Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, the law of criminal defamation is routinely set in motion within days of the publication of reports that are even remotely critical of her governance. It is always initiated by the public prosecutors on behalf of the Chief Minister and members of her Cabinet. It is needless to emphasise that criminal defamation has a chilling effect on free speech and undermines public interest by coercing the media to observe self-censorship and self-restraint. Sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalise defamation in India, have been challenged in the Supreme Court, but so far there is little hope that the State will give up the use of this weapon against adverse coverage. It also showed questionable zeal in >going up to the highest court just to obtain the police custody of Kovan, a folk singer >arrested on ‘sedition’ charge, indicating a dangerously illiberal attitude. The Union government has contended, much to the disappointment of proponents of the freedom of expression, that these sections do not have any chilling effect on free speech.
Democratic opinion in many countries is veering around to the view that defamation should be treated as a civil wrong and should not be pursued as a criminal case, and that the state has no compelling interest to protect the reputation of its individual servants by prosecuting alleged offenders. In 2011, the Human Rights Committee of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights called upon states to abolish criminal defamation, noting that it intimidates citizens and makes them shy away from exposing wrongdoing. Its misuse as an instrument of harassment is pervasive in India. Often, the prosecutor’s complaint is taken at face value by courts, which send out routine notices for the appearance of defendants without any preliminary examination whether the offending comments or reports come under one of the exceptions spelt out in Section 499. Thus, the process itself becomes the punishment. It is internationally recognised that there ought to be some proportionality between the status and influence of public officials and how far they could be defamed. The higher the officials are the greater will be their resources to set right any impairment of their image, using their wide reach and influence over the public. It is time India’s lawmakers scrapped criminal defamation from the statute book.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/time-to-abolish-criminal-defamation/article7937728.ece
3,12,2015,Dark clouds & a silver lining,"Making extensive preparations for rare, extreme situations is neither easy nor economical. Both the Tamil Nadu administration and the residents of Chennai and its neighbouring districts were not ready for the relentless spells of rain after the >North-East monsoon set in , flooding homes and offices, roads and malls. Ordinarily, the worry for Chennai is a weak monsoon with deficit rainfall that leaves little water for drinking purposes and irrigation. But, over the last 30 days, the government and the people were dealing with the ill-effects of an unusually active monsoon that seemed intent on overcompensating for the deficit years with >record rainfall . Even as the city returned to some sort of normalcy after one torrential downpour, it had to contend with >another spell of rain . Displacement, traffic jams, power cuts, rising prices, and scarcity of food, the woes just would not end for the people of Chennai. The situation was especially bad for those in the relatively new residential areas in the suburbs where, in recent years, real estate growth was given priority over planned development. Also, more than the amount of rainfall, Chennai was hit badly by the overflow of water from reservoirs and breaches in lakes and tanks, and the flooding of water channels that were already choked with silt and refuse. With an unprecedented discharge of water, Chennai’s rivers have shown no respect for the bridges and the roads, effectively cutting off people and places on one bank with the people and places on the other bank. With bus and suburban railway services becoming inoperable, Chennai had to rely heavily on the >new Metro line and the Mass Rapid Transit System.
But the rains were not all about doom and gloom. The government did remarkably well in rescue and relief efforts, quickly requisitioning the >deployment of the armed forces to evacuate people in flooded areas and engaging in elaborate rehabilitation work. In the end, even Opposition leaders readily praised the relief measures taken up in challenging circumstances. The distress brought about by the rain also revealed the >remarkable strength and character of the people in the city and the affected districts, with NGOs supplementing the efforts of the government, and public- spirited individuals taking up relief work, spending time and resources in reaching out to those left stranded. The Hindu is privileged to be a part of these efforts. Social networks were full of messages offering help or information on where help would be available. Malls and private schools and colleges too opened their doors to the flood victims. A radio taxi service provider, under criticism for failing to arrange cabs, >offered free boat services . Clearly, the civic solidarity was in evidence everywhere, with volunteers helping to ferry the aged and the sick, and distribute food packets and warm clothes. Without a doubt, this has been the silver lining in the dark clouds over Chennai over the last few weeks. The lessons learnt during this extended disaster should result in a hard look at existing policies on urban planning, and a short-term revamp of the inadequacies in the civic infrastructure of urban areas.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Dark-clouds-amp-a-silver-lining/article10030130.ece
3,12,2015,On hold and accommodative,"The central message of Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan’s > latest decision to leave interest rates unchanged, and stress that the monetary stance remains “accommodative”, is that neither an economic recovery nor inflation trends are entrenched enough at the moment for more decisive action. That the signs are far from reassuring on both the key fronts that inform the central bank’s policy rationale is abundantly evident from the data on hand. External demand continues to remain weak — with global growth and trade becalmed by an anaemic Euro area, a slowing China and a U.S. economy coping with an accumulation of inventory, year-low consumer confidence and a strengthening dollar. On the domestic front, while early results from the RBI’s survey of order books, inventories and capacity utilisation point to an uptick in new manufacturing orders in the second quarter, other indicators, especially from the sizeable rural economy, are far from reassuring. Consumption demand in the villages and smaller towns in agrarian heartlands has been weakened by two consecutive deficient monsoons, and the overall outlook for agricultural growth, as a result of deficient rains, appears at best moderate. The latest Nikkei’s Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index, compiled by Markit, independently buttresses the central bank’s concern over the sustainability of the recovery as it shows demand and output continued to soften in November to damp manufacturing growth to the slowest pace in 25 months.
Data on the prices front is equally unnerving. Retail inflation as measured by the consumer price index accelerated for the third successive month in October, pushed up by a sharp increase in food costs. Initial indications of rabi sowing, coupled with low reservoir levels, also squarely lay the onus on astute supply management by the government to help minimise any shortfall in winter crop output and the resultant risk to prices. And taking a benign oil price environment for granted, given the potential for geopolitical shocks from the volatile Middle East, has its own inherent hazards. More significantly, the RBI has for the moment opted to trust the government’s commitment to its fiscal consolidation goals in its calculus of the inflationary impact of the > Seventh Pay Commission’s proposals . Voluntary budgetary restraint, the central bank believes, will offset the impact on aggregate demand from higher wages and rents. That this assumption is only partly predicated on good faith is evident in the comment in the policy statement that the implementation of the pay panel’s recommendations will “be a factor in the Reserve Bank’s future deliberations”. Dr. Rajan has his task cut out as he focusses on unclogging the monetary transmission pipeline at banks. With only about half of the 125 basis points cut in the policy rate > conveyed to borrowers, the RBI is racing to ensure that a clean-up of lenders’ balance sheets can help free up funds toward productive credit flows. For now though, it will be a vigilant watch at the RBI.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/on-hold-and-accommodative/article7941931.ece
4,12,2015,Ending politics of remission,"The >verdict of a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court on legal questions relating to grant of remission to life convicts exposes the haste with which the Tamil Nadu government acted in February 2014 in >seeking to release the seven persons serving life terms for plotting to assassinate Rajiv Gandhi in 1991. The court’s finding that the Central government has primacy in according remission to life convicts in a case of this nature is a political setback to Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. It was apparent that she wanted to be seen as a champion of Tamil rights rather than the stern opponent of terrorism that she was believed to be. In token compliance with a statutory requirement, she wrote to the Centre, giving just three days’ time for its opinion on their release. Alarmed by the thought of Rajiv Gandhi’s killers being freed, the then United Progressive Alliance government rushed to the Supreme Court to stall the process. Thus, the humanitarian question whether convicts who had only been accessories in the LTTE’s assassination plot should languish in prison even after 23 years was converted into a political issue. It became embroiled in technical questions that were referred to a Constitution Bench. The validity of the Tamil Nadu government’s decision will be decided separately by a regular bench.
However, the larger significance here is that the court has barred State governments from invoking their statutory remission power for the premature release of those sentenced by a High Court or the Supreme Court to a specified term above 14 years without remission. It has rejected the theory that every convict, even those facing life-long incarceration, will have to be offered a ‘ray of hope’, placing the interests of the victims of murder above those of the perpetrators. It indicates that those whose death sentences are altered to life terms will have to spend the rest of their life in prison. At the same time, it has kept a small door open for life convicts by declaring that one who had got the benefit of commutation of death sentence to life is not barred from getting remission from the executive. In any case, it has said the constitutional powers of the President and the Governor for grant of clemency remain untouched. The State government will now have to get the concurrence of the Centre in cases investigated by Central agencies before it can use its power of remission to release convicts. Also, the sentences they are undergoing must be for crimes relating to subjects falling under the Union government’s executive powers. The court rejected the idea that a State government can remit prison terms on its own without following the prescribed procedure. A lesson to be drawn from this episode is that the release of prisoners ought to be dealt with on merits on a case-by-case basis by following statutory procedures and not through whimsical or partisan acts of political misadventure.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ending-politics-of-remission/article7945711.ece
4,12,2015,Myanmar’s best hope,"Aung San Suu Kyi’s >meetings with Myanmar’s President Thein Sein and military chief General Min Aung Hlaing, nearly a month after her party’s resounding election win, are highly significant, given the tumultuous civil-military relations in the Southeast Asian nation. Ms. Suu Kyi had reportedly asked for these meetings immediately after the polls. But the delay had triggered some concerns over whether the still-powerful military would accept the election result and let her National League for Democracy form the next government, which is expected to assume office on March 31. A presidential spokesperson later allayed the concerns, saying both leaders had discussed a “smooth transition and transfer of power to the newly elected government”. While the military-backed government’s reassurance that it is committed to political transition is welcome, the process of transition and building a constitutional framework for the new government could turn out to be a cumbersome process. That is mainly because the military is unlikely to be willing to cede full control to the civilian government. The military-written Constitution bars Ms. Suu Kyi from becoming the President because her children are not Burmese, and it reserves key Ministries, including defence, interior and border security, for the military. Gen. Aung Hlaing has already said there would not be any change in the Constitution to let Ms. Suu Kyi become the President. She has, on the other hand, vowed to lead the government “whether or not” she is the President.
Ms. Suu Kyi is the best hope Myanmar has at this point of time. She is a stout democrat and widely popular, and her party has a legitimate mandate to lead the country, which faces several problems from poverty to ethnic conflict. One of the reasons the military agreed to a transition to a more democratic set-up was the realisation that it could not rule the country with an iron fist forever. Despite years of suppression, the political opposition has been resolute. Besides, the internal dynamics of the Myanmar society remain fragile. The Rohingya community, Muslims castigated as illegal immigrants, have been widely discriminated against by sections of the Buddhist majority. The government’s efforts to end the civil war with ethnic groups through negotiated agreements were only partially successful as rebels in the region bordering China refused to sign ceasefire pacts in October. The country also faces a huge economic challenge. What Myanmar needs now is a leader who can unify the people and take the country to a new era of social and political democracy. A large number of people inside and outside the country believe that, under the circumstances Ms. Suu Kyi may be the best person to take up the challenge. But the question is whether the generals would let her do it. For her part, Ms. Suu Kyi needs to be more forthright in articulating an inclusive agenda, for example vis-à-vis the Rohingya, that addresses ethnic tensions, and gives democracy in Myanmar a stronger chance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/myanmars-best-hope/article7945712.ece
5,12,2015,Funding holds the key at Paris,"As the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases among individual countries, India is >under pressure at the Paris Climate Change conference to commit itself to a future trajectory of low emissions. All countries with a significant role in the accumulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which leads to global warming, have made voluntary pledges that are aimed at the stabilisation of global temperature rise below 2° Celsius. India’s own >Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) promise to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030, over 2005 levels. A base agreement of this coalition of the willing is now possible at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change conference, but problems lie ahead. Among the contentious issues is monitoring and verification of performance, which would inevitably be linked to grant of funding that is vital to help affected communities adapt to the impact of climate change. The colossal losses arising from the Chennai deluge underscore the importance of access to funds for adaptation. On the other hand, a five-year monitoring period from 2020, when the pledges go into effect, would ratchet up the pressure tremendously. With such high stakes, it is vital that India continues its strong cooperation with the G77+China bloc, which has been >aggressively pursuing the principles of equity and differentiated responsibilities, and simultaneously engage the developed world as the negotiations move into the high-level segment next week.
The dichotomy of ambitions on halting dangerous climate change has been evident at Paris, with the most vulnerable island states and the least developed countries expecting rising targets for emissions cuts to keep global temperature rise below 1.5° C, and liberal funding from rich nations. But even with sincere implementation of the 157 INDC submissions from 184 countries (including the European Union member-states) which cover about 94 per cent of carbon emissions, the global temperature is expected to rise beyond the target. India also has to contend with the growing movement to persuade investors to withdraw from companies using polluting fossil fuels including coal, and tax these fuels at higher rates to consumers. Moreover, although it has the largest emissions, China has won plaudits with its pledge to peak coal use in 2020, and all greenhouse gases by 2030, something that India cannot. For developing countries in Paris, however, the real challenge is to enshrine in the agreement strong provisions for funding that have been promised but not delivered in the past. Many of them have submitted their INDCs with funding as a condition, and India has estimated a staggering $2.5 trillion as its climate finance requirement until 2030. By contrast, the total cross-border flows of funds is calculated to be $2.2 billion. It will take a great deal of diplomacy and commitment to bridge the gulf in Paris.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/funding-holds-the-key-at-paris/article7949572.ece
5,12,2015,Fighting IS with air strikes alone,"With British jets >having started bombing Islamic State locations in Syria, four of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council have formally joined the war against the jihadist group. The United States, France and Russia are already in the fray. But despite persistent bombing by these countries over the past few months, IS still holds on to the territories it controls. Will Britain joining the war change the script? Prime Minister David Cameron himself warned against quick expectations. He said it’s a “complex” war and that the country has to be “patient and persistent”. But the real problem that the war against IS faces is not the campaign being less persistent; it’s that there is no coordinated strategy among the nations fighting the jihadists. Syria’s skies are already crowded. The downing of the Russian aircraft by Turkey over the Syrian border last month exposed the faultlines of the anti-IS war. Countries involved in the war are also competitors for geopolitical gains and they have divergent views towards the future of Syria. For example, the Americans want Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to go, while the Russians are the main backers of the regime, saying the only sustainable alternative to IS is restoring the Syrian statehood.
Does Prime Minister Cameron have a strategy to address these complexities? Or is his only plan, as that of his allies in the West, to target the group from the air? He did not lay down a comprehensive strategy in the British Parliament while seeking the support of Members of Parliament for the air strikes. His claim that there are 70,000 rebels ready to fight IS on the ground is far from convincing. Who are these rebels? Syrian rebel groups are hardly united, and in tough battles in the past they fled, leaving the territories and the weapons they got from Mr. Assad’s enemies to the hands of IS. Those who faced down IS on the ground were the Kurds. But Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) that is formally part of the U.S.-led coalition against IS, is bombing the Kurdish rebels on the Syrian border. Besides, how will Mr. Cameron’s government respond to allegations that Turkey was complicit with IS by facilitating the group’s trade in oil? The ground situation is so complicated that it is irrational to believe that sending a few more bomber jets into the Syrian skies would weaken IS. Of course, the war against IS needs air cover. But it should be in a supplementary role. The main fight has to take place on the ground and for that, the coalition needs coordination among the forces fighting IS, including the Syrian and Iraqi national army. Without such a coordinated strategy, air strikes would only play into the hands of the jihadists.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fighting-is-with-air-strikes-alone/article7949573.ece
7,12,2015,Speed up relief efforts,"Disasters bring out either the best or the very worst in people and organisations. Chennai, in the days immediately after the worst phase of the November-December floods, saw both in equal measure. Even as public-spirited individuals and voluntary organisations joined the administration in mounting rescue and relief operations to help the city recover from the shock of the flash floods, petty politicians and miscreants revealed a dark side of the city: where others saw threats to life and property, they saw opportunities for self-promotion and self-aggrandisement. Strangely, instead of helping the government in reaching relief material to the victims of the floods in good time, many of the lower-level functionaries of the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam seemed more intent on gaining political mileage for the party and for their leader, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. >Images of Ms. Jayalalithaa were sought to be stuck on relief packages, leading to pile-up of relief materials and avoidable delays in their distribution; State transport corporation buses that were ordered to ply free of charge for four days greeted passengers with an image of the Chief Minister. Far from managing efficiently the humanitarian crisis building up, the administration’s efforts looked as if they were no more than a part of a public relations exercise in an election year. Of course, ruling party workers were not the only ones to blame. For every person attempting to convey essential information through the social media, there were at least two others spreading panic through misinformation and rumour-mongering. Criminals too took advantage of a city in crisis mode by cheating people and looting houses.
Worse, State government officials were often directionless in dealing with the crisis. There was little by way of coordination between the armed forces and the local bodies, resulting in deployment of personnel in areas where the flood situation was not serious, and in delay in reaching areas that required help the most. Some of the Army officers supervising the relief operations suspect that they were deliberately misled so that VIPs in posh localities could be rescued ahead of worse-affected commoners. Clearly, the administration was too centralised in its operations to be truly effective in a crisis situation. Power supply is yet to be restored in several parts of the city even after the flood waters receded as officials were waiting for instructions from political higher-ups. Ms. Jayalalithaa did an aerial survey of the city and periodically issued statements and made appeals to the Centre for help. But things were not moving on the ground, other than in terms of distribution of food. After having managed the earlier spells of rain remarkably well, the administration just folded up when the water channels overflowed after the full force of the rain was felt on December 1. As the crisis grew in proportion, the government machinery slowed down almost to the point of stillness. Somewhere along the way, the political leadership of the State must have decided it was easier to try to counter the negative publicity rather than manage the crisis. But without resolving the serious flood-related issues confronting the people of Chennai and the surrounding northern districts, there can be no public relations victory for the government.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/relief-efforts-for-tn-floods/article7955207.ece
7,12,2015,Why Ms. Selja’s story matters,"Just days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached out to his predecessor, Manmohan Singh, and Congress president Sonia Gandhi in a conciliatory move to avert a deadlock in Parliament, the Rajya Sabha had reverted to its old normal. And if whatever goodwill was generated by that meeting last Friday now appears to be so much water under the bridge, the treasury benches must interrogate their own. The cause for fresh adjournments was former Union Minister >Kumari Selja ’s statement on Wednesday that she had been asked her caste at a temple in Gujarat’s Dwarka; and the response by BJP Ministers was a playbook of ways to make a House not function. That there was a defence by the government was surprising enough, given that Ms. Selja’s disclosure simply required an inquiry into her specific experience and, more importantly, into the larger prevalence of caste and gender discrimination. It was also disproportionate, even intimidatory. Senior Union Ministers charged her with bringing up “manufactured problems” and pulled out her remarks from the visitors’ book at Dwarka’s big temple to cast doubts about the veracity of her remarks. In the event, the Ministers accepted Ms. Selja’s clarification that the question about her caste was posed at a smaller temple in Dwarka, and variously withdrew or regretted their statements. There the issue now simmers on a slower burn, and the Congress may well use the faultiness to go on the hunt for other subjects to corner the government on.
However, the disquiet over the government’s handling of Ms. Selja’s intervention is wider than its effect on the orderly conduct of Parliament. Her identity, as a woman and, significantly, >as a Dalit , was not incidental to the resonance of the question at Dwarka. Temple entry has been an integral part of social reform in India, and was made a mobilising plank in the national movement by Mahatma Gandhi. The Constitution gives the state immense power to enforce and make laws for “throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus”. Ms. Selja’s recollection that she was asked about her caste at a time when she happened to be a Union Minister is not just a reminder that free temple entry is still a work in progress — but also that for all the power and privilege that may attach to an individual, there remains the overhang of the older oppressive hierarchies of caste, if not always in operation but definitely in atmospherics. Whatever the specifics of Ms. Selja’s personal encounter, it must serve as a call to Parliament to strengthen the law to end restriction to temple entry on account of caste and gender.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/on-caste-discrimination-and-kumari-selja/article7955208.ece
8,12,2015,Test of political will on GST,"The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government has rolled up its sleeves for the ongoing winter session of Parliament in a bid to guarantee the passage of the Constitution amendment Bill that will usher in a Goods and Services Tax. The government, which has staked a lot of political capital on ensuring that the April 1 target deadline for the implementation of GST is met, has moved to try to build a consensus through a combination of political outreach and an internal reappraisal of some of the contentious features of the tax measure.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi met his predecessor Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi to court bipartisan support for the legislation in the Rajya Sabha, where the Congress still has the upper hand. And the government has said it hopes to continue talks with the Opposition to reach an understanding. Separately, a panel headed by Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian has recommended the government make some modifications to its proposals that are seen as helping to pave the way for a resolution of the political deadlock over the Bill.
Among key suggestions are that the government drop the proposed additional 1 per cent levy on inter-State sales over and above the GST rate, and that alcohol and petroleum products be included in the ambit of the tax. Crucially, however, the panel shied away from endorsing the Congress’s demand for writing into the statute an explicit cap of 18 per cent on the standard rate of tax. Dr. Subramanian reasoned it would be unwise to limit the future freedom of the political process by laying down the minutiae of policy. This could well end up being a bone of contention.
For both the government and the Congress, a lot now rides on the political calculations the two sides make ahead of a clutch of State elections due next year. On test will be the sagacity and statesmanship of their respective leaders. A Congress spokesperson was emphatic that the onus of finding a resolution to the differences lay with the government. The party stands by its core demands that include the introduction of robust accountability measures.
The party claims that the government’s efforts to communicate with the Opposition have been high on atmospherics and low on substance. It is now time both sides rose above partisan considerations. That the implementation of GST will help reduce the cascading impact of the prevailing multiplicity of taxes has been well-established. The projected benefit to the economy from an expected improvement in administration and compliance of the indirect tax regime is also fairly beyond doubt.
The challenge will remain in warding off incipient inflationary pressures in the early stages of the implementation of the tax, and enlightened politics is needed here. Both the Congress, which had once championed the GST, and Prime Minister Modi need to show the political will to get this key reform measure passed to create a common market that could spur growth.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/parliament-winter-session-and-passage-of-gst/article7958667.ece
8,12,2015,Amber signal on Delhi pollution,"The Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi has announced a slew of measures to address the >very poor air quality and pollution in the nation’s capital. It is, in principle, a largely welcome move that could push the needle for anti-pollution measures to be adopted by other Indian cities as well. These are possibly the most significant steps taken after the introduction of Compressed Natural Gas-powered vehicles in the city that are widely accepted as having helped reduce pollution. (However, it is debatable if they will together have the kind of effect the CNG shift had.)
The benefits of this emphasis by the government on regulations to address the city’s alarming air pollution levels will depend on the manner of implementation as well as other concomitant actions. The announced measures include the closing down of two thermal power plants, pushing the entry time of trucks into the city late into the night, the advancing of the cut-off date for Euro-VI emission norms, among others.
But the proposal that has predictably received the most attention is the one on >regulating private vehicle use by means of licence plate restrictions. These curbs, that are to be implemented temporarily from January 1, 2016, will allow private four-wheelers and two-wheelers access to Delhi’s roads only on alternate dates based on even/odd licence plate numbers. Cities such as Bogota, Beijing, Mexico City and Paris have implemented such restrictions in the past, amongst other reforms to decongest vehicle traffic and to reduce air pollution through expanding public transport and zoning certain areas as “low emissions only”.
Licence plate restrictions by themselves are >somewhat problematic : all private vehicles are treated equally, irrespective of their purpose and the fuel they use. To mitigate this, the Delhi government has relaxed the restrictions in the case of emergency use. Other exceptions such as car-pooling by multiple commuters should have also been considered. The larger point is that, without a concomitant expansion and improvement in public transport, the introduction of licence plate restrictions could only have a limiting effect.
The state of public transport in Delhi is relatively better than in most metropolitan cities in the country, with the capital enjoying a privileged position in the fiscal scheme of things. But despite that, the public transport system is still not fully equipped to handle the consequent increase in the number of commuters that could possibly occur due to the restrictions in place. Easing and expanding public transport must be the Delhi government’s priority.
The government had recently discontinued the Bus Rapid Transit System — instead of addressing its design problems and furthering its intended purpose of decongesting routes for public transport and enticing private vehicle users to shift. The licensing regulations must be part of a package of well-sequenced and thought-out steps if they are to be more than a traffic decongestion measure.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/aaps-measures-on-curbing-delhi-pollution/article7958668.ece
9,12,2015,Securing the pace of India-Pakistan talks,"External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj’s > touchdown in Islamabad marks a decisive moment in the Narendra Modi government’s Pakistan policy. While she is in Islamabad ostensibly for a conference on Pakistan, it is clear from the flurry of meetings that bilateral engagement is back on track. After 18 months of starts and stops, New Delhi has taken a considered position to re-engage with its most difficult relationship in the neighbourhood, a decision that must be lauded. It is also clear that some lessons have been learnt from the past.
First, the meetings have been held without hype or announcement, with expectations being kept low. Second, after the Paris meetings between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, as well as the Bangkok meeting between the National Security Advisors and Foreign Secretaries of both countries, the joint messaging in Islamabad and Delhi has been kept unified and simple. Finally, both sides have managed well the opposition within their own flanks over the reasons for the re-engagement; very few discordant voices have been heard from the military establishment in Rawalpindi or the BJP’s headquarters and the party’s Sangh Parivar allies, the kind that marked previous engagements.
It is to be hoped that all talks from this point onwards will follow the same path, building from one meeting to the next, until they produce concrete results. A start would be the announcement of a structured set of meetings to be held on a regular basis between officials at different levels that will protect the process from disruptions. Next, it is important that the confidence-building measures already agreed to, on trade and visa liberalisation, are implemented at the earliest. Finally, the way forward on Jammu and Kashmir and terrorism, the two lasting issues between India and Pakistan, must be charted out. This is by no means the first government to attempt to do all of this. Others, including some with more experience, tried and failed.
The Modi government would therefore be well-advised to strike a different path and be more forthcoming, in public, on just why they are meeting and what they hope to achieve. Despite his famous speech on “breakfast in Amritsar, lunch in Lahore and dinner in Kabul”, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh didn’t articulate just where his talks with the Pakistan government on Kashmir had led, until it was too late to shape public opinion about them.
Mr. Modi must explain his vision for peace with Pakistan and what has spurred this new round of negotiations, especially since none of the conditions for talks that he and his Cabinet Ministers had spoken of over the past few months has been met. In Pakistan, the way forward should be even clearer: end support to all terror groups, especially those who seek violence against India. While it is hardly possible to put behind the decades of bad blood between the two countries any time soon, it is possible to pause, and to envisage a new chapter in relations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/securing-the-pace-of-indiapakistan-talks/article7962355.ece
9,12,2015,How India cleared the Test,"India’s victory over South Africa in the > recently concluded Test series was remarkable not just for the margin, but also the manner. South Africa has been world cricket’s most formidable touring team this decade. Indeed, its ascent to the top was built on not suffering a single series defeat overseas in nine years. India, moreover, has had its problems with South Africa. Where Australia’s attacking style often drew India’s stirring best in response, something about South Africa’s controlled method appeared to inhibit India, diminishing it.
The 3-0 triumph that Virat Kohli’s men scripted this season was only India’s third win in 12 series against South Africa, and the first since 2004. To so comprehensively outplay a bogey team, which also happens to be ranked No. 1, merits high praise. It must be mentioned, however, that South Africa lost spearhead Dale Steyn in the first Test, depriving Hashim Amla of the services of perhaps the finest fast-bowler ever in subcontinental conditions (90 wickets in Asia at the astonishing rate of one every 40 balls). For a side still coping with the departures of Jacques Kallis and Graeme Smith, giants instrumental in South Africa’s success, it proved an insurmountable loss.
But South Africa’s troubles do not detract greatly from the achievements of India, itself a side in transition. Nor does the fuss over the pitches. There is not anything underhand about making capital of home advantage — as long as it does not unfairly tilt the balance between bat and ball. Of the three surfaces on which India gained victory, a case can be made only against the Nagpur wicket: it’s a case the International Cricket Council (ICC) is currently sitting in judgment on.
It is important instead to acknowledge India’s accomplishment, for there appears a significant shift in thinking. Mr. Kohli’s comment after the win in New Delhi that bowlers were the “bosses” in Test cricket did not receive much attention; but for a country besotted with batsmen, it was momentous. There has also been an increased urgency to push for victory. Mr. Kohli traced the onset of the resurgence to the tour of Australia where the team “showed character even in defeats. We were always on the opposition's heels”.
The subsequent 2-1 win in Sri Lanka further strengthened the belief. The most heartening aspect of the performance against South Africa was its wholesome nature. R. Ashwin rose magnificently to the challenge of being lead spinner again. But the support he received from Ravindra Jadeja, Amit Mishra and the faster bowlers was just as vital. Ajinkya Rahane topped the batting charts, but there were important runs from everyone in the line-up.
The spirit of the team was perhaps best exemplified by the fielding; seldom has the commitment to winning together been this apparent. The authorities in India must now use this platform not just to strengthen the Test side, but also to put in practice a programme of outreach to draw back spectators to the five-day game.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/on-the-test-series-win-against-south-africa/article7962356.ece
10,12,2015,The Gandhis must face the courts,"Whatever be the merits of the charges against the principal office-bearers of the Congress party in the ‘National Herald’ case, > it is an issue that has to be settled in a court of law, and not in the wider political arena, much less in Parliament. If the Congress believes there has been no wrongdoing in the transactions related to the acquisition of Associated Journals Private Ltd. by Young Indian, a non-profit company in which the party's president, Sonia Gandhi, and vice-president, Rahul Gandhi, are the main shareholders, it must simply choose the judicial route to establish their innocence. The Delhi High Court order upholding the trial court summons to both of them, along with other directors of Young Indian, is based on what it sees as prima facie evidence of criminality. The best way to deal with the situation is to face it legally. When Subramanian Swamy first questioned the legality of the transactions, it was the Congress that challenged him to take Ms. Gandhi and her son to court. “It is for those who make allegations to prove their charges,” the party had said in 2012. It cannot then turn around now and say that the entire proceedings amount to political vendetta. Even if there is a political motive, the party’s president and vice-president have to provide answers to the questions that have arisen from the trial court summons and the High Court’s refusal to intervene. To disrupt Parliament on an issue that involves no larger public interest goes against all democratic norms, and it cannot be justified on any count. Indeed, to speak of political vendetta following a court summons is to cast aspersions on the very independence of the judiciary.
A look at the facts of the case does make one doubt whether AJL could not have protected its shareholders’ interests by liquidating some of its assets in order to return its loan to the Congress. The floating of Young Indian, described by the court as a ‘special purpose vehicle’, does cast some suspicion. At the same time, the weak point in Dr. Swamy’s case seems to be the absence of any identifiable victim who has been cheated or whose funds have been misappropriated. After all, the various assets of AJL still stand in its name and the shareholders of Young Indian, which being a Section 25 (non-profit) company, cannot get any dividend or profit out of the company’s rental income. The Congress will have to believe in its own contention that there was no ‘entrustment’ in the first place for anyone’s trust to be breached and that no one claims to be deceived or cheated. But the judicial process will have to be faced squarely without resort to political theatre. The charges of cheating and criminal breach of trust against the Congress leaders will have to be countered only through the legal route.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sonia-and-rahul-summoned-in-national-herald-case/article7966764.ece
10,12,2015,Trumpeting bigotry,"American politics touched a new low this week when Donald Trump, a frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, called for a “ > total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States”. Mr. Trump’s controversial remarks in the past, including offensive statements about undocumented Mexican immigrants being rapists, insults to war veterans and sexist attacks on women in the media, drew expected criticism from Democrats and other liberals. Yet, this time even fellow Republican candidates and mainstream Republican Party heavyweights distanced themselves from Mr. Trump’s views on Muslims. The property mogul’s comment contradicts, morally if not legally, the > First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which requires that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof”. Islamophobia in the U.S., which surged after the 9/11 terror attacks, appears to be on the rise again. This time it is coterminous with soaring worldwide anxiety about Islamic State, which has been linked to the Paris terror attacks of November and last week’s shooting in San Bernardino, California. Little wonder then that the numerically significant cohorts of the U.S. conservative fold are lapping up Mr. Trump’s incendiary, divisive proposal. Their support is manifested in the one polling trend that has baffled campaign analysts, Mr. Trump’s evergreen lead over all other candidates, which shows no sign of withering in the face of his increasingly reckless provocations. After this week’s foray into apparent bigotry, a rolling five-day poll by Reuters placed his support vote at 35.6 per cent, giving him a comfortable lead over Florida’s Senator Marco Rubio, a distant second at 14.9 per cent.
> The Trump phenomenon begs questions both tactical and strategic. Tactically, he has made a stark choice in the matter of battle-versus-war and it could well win him the Republican nomination. His steady march to the far right of American politics is a safe bet that he will emerge, or has already emerged, as the favourite of those who championed the cause of the Tea Party, of immigration hawks, pro-lifers, white supremacists, gun-lovers and all manner of conservatives. However, that leaves the rest of America unaccounted for, especially the elusive median and swing voters. Unless Mr. Trump abruptly changes tack post-nomination, a move that could prove politically costly in itself, he may have handed the Democratic nominee, likely to be Hillary Clinton, the keys to the Oval Office next year. Beyond the nomination battle, the broader strategic link between the rise of IS and the worldwide proliferation of Islamophobia is paramount. Perhaps mindful of this link, Ms. Clinton has moved in exactly the opposite direction, towards the political centre. She has taken a firmer stand against IS than President Barack Obama did, yet spoken expansively about fostering an attitude of inclusiveness. Depending on which paradigm prevails, post-2016 America will either continue to welcome minorities to its shores, or emerge as a source of recruitment propaganda for extremists.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/donald-trumps-bigotry-and-the-american-presidential-elections/article7966765.ece
11,12,2015,Stay the course on Pakistan talks,"The agreement by India and Pakistan to resume structured talks, >seven years after the composite dialogue was stopped following the Mumbai terrorist attacks, marks a dramatic improvement in bilateral relations. Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi >met his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif in Paris on the sidelines of the Climate Conference on November 30, both sides have moved fast to tackle the key challenges that are holding back talks. The breakthrough was achieved at the National Security Adviser-level discussions held in Bangkok on December 6. On the face of it, both sides have signalled that they are ready for a give-and-take approach. Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, both in Opposition and so far in government at the Centre, had opposed any resumption of dialogue without “concrete action” by the Sharif administration on the Mumbai attacks of 2008. For the Pakistanis, mention of Kashmir is a key issue. Mr. Sharif came under sharp criticism at home over the Ufa statement of July which had omitted any reference to Jammu and Kashmir. However, in the joint statement issued in Islamabad on Wednesday, Pakistan has given assurances on an “early completion of the Mumbai attacks trial”, and “resolved to cooperate to eliminate” terrorism. India, on the other side, has agreed to include Kashmir on the dialogue agenda.
Despite the agreement to resume talks, guarded optimism must be the dominant mood in New Delhi. It’s the Modi government’s Pakistan moment. Eighteen months after it came to power, a period that saw an increase in border skirmishes and high-decibel rhetoric, the government finally appears to have realised that there is no alternative to bilateral talks in engaging with Islamabad. While the constructive steps the government has taken in the last 10 days, something which it failed to do in the past 18 months, are really commendable, it has to be realistic about the challenges ahead. Mr. Modi is venturing into a path his predecessors had tested and retreated from. The Manmohan Singh government had tried to kick-start stalled discussions through the “resumed dialogue” process, which met with the same fate of the composite dialogue following the killing of Indian soldiers almost three years ago. In the past, every time there was forward momentum in India-Pakistan ties, there were attempts by non-state and extra-state actors on the Pakistan side to derail the process. Though it’s too early to predict the outcome of the comprehensive dialogue, it can be certainly seen that the proposal, which will have all the “pillars” of the India-Pakistan relationship, including economic ties, people-to-people contacts and high-level interaction, is a promising beginning. Both sides have time to build a strong foundation of renewed engagement before Mr. Modi goes to Islamabad next September. The agenda is wider this time. What is needed, and crucial, is the political will to stay the course irrespective of the challenges, and avoiding playing to the gallery. New Delhi particularly has to internalise the logic of growing the constituency for peace within Pakistan, in India’s own national interest, and therefore desist from unnecessary attempts at points-scoring.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bilateral-talks-between-india-and-pakistan-resume-after-seven-years/article7971936.ece
11,12,2015,The law and the celebrity,"When celebrity status is in conflict with the law, public sentiment will revolve around two narratives. The narrative of power and wealth would suggest high status is a burden, a disadvantage before the judiciary because judges will be chary of being seen as favouring them. The more popular narrative, however, is that the slow criminal justice system is always skewed in favour of celebrities. It will include folk wisdom that even the otherwise fair and strict judiciary will cave in to power and pelf. When an occasional verdict brings down a famous personality, it will be seen as a victory for the citizen and a blow for justice. May 6, 2015 saw such a moment when Mumbai sessions judge D.W. Deshpande handed down a five-year prison sentence to Bollywood star Salman Khan in a hit-and-run case. But cynicism took over before the day was out when he was given bail. Now, before the year is out, a clean acquittal has been recorded in the Bombay High Court, and faith in the justice system has been rocked again — or reaffirmed, depending on which of the two narratives one subscribes to. For the rarefied world of Mumbai stars and socialites, a superstar can do no wrong, and even if he does, the gravity of his offence should be balanced with whatever charitable or humanitarian work he may have done, and the most lenient course adopted. The judge, in this milieu, is a lonely man who has to apply the law and pass a verdict without being swayed by either the status of the individual involved or public opinion.
The judgment of Justice A.R. Joshi >acquitting Khan may be sound in law. Yet, it is likely to revive cynicism about the administration of criminal justice in the country. It raises a host of questions, not least of which is about who killed Nurullah Sharif in the September 2002 incident. The judge has termed a key eyewitness, Ravindra Patil, a police bodyguard who is now no more, unreliable. Has it now been accepted that it was Ashok Singh, the actor’s driver who claimed responsibility in the latter stages of the trial, who was driving the car that night? If so, is he going to be proceeded against? However, the questions are not limited to the judgment. The police have been exposed for their shoddy investigation. An honest investigation is unlikely to have resulted in doubts being cast on as basic an aspect as the identity of the person at the wheel. Crucial lapses in the handling of the blood samples have been recorded. The judge has ruled that it was not proved either that Khan was driving the car or that he was drunk. Why then does the verdict raise uncomfortable questions? It may be because after three recorded convictions, Salman Khan is yet to be punished.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-salman-khans-acquittal-in-the-hitandrun-case/article7971937.ece
12,12,2015,Headway with David Headley,"The ostensible reason for the prosecution agreeing to the > grant of judicial pardon to Pakistan-born American operative David Coleman Headley is to strengthen its case against Sayed Zabiuddin Ansari alias Abu Jundal, charged with involvement in the conspiracy behind the deadly Mumbai terrorist attacks of November 2008. The real purpose, however, is that India would like Headley to testify on and establish before a Mumbai court what he has already admitted before a trial court in the United States and to a team of the National Investigation Agency from India in June 2010: the role of state and non-state actors in Pakistan in planning and carrying out the Mumbai terror strikes. Headley is now a prosecution witness. The sessions court in Mumbai trying Abu Jundal has pardoned Headley in return for his promise that he would make a full and true disclosure of all that he knows about the entire conspiracy. Headley had done much of the reconnoitring of targets for the team of assailants who executed the 26/11 plot. Last month, he was formally included as a co-conspirator in the case, and he has now been accepted as an approver. His testimony would be adequate for the court to convict others involved in the plot, as the law on evidence in India is that “an accomplice shall be a competent witness against an accused person”. Headley’s conduct so far indicates that as a witness during the trial he may speak credibly about the role of the Lashkar-e-Taiba and its handlers in the Pakistani intelligence establishment.
It is indeed a positive development that Headley appeared, albeit in a virtual sense, before an Indian court for the first time. He is serving a 35-year prison term in the U.S. after admitting to his role in a conspiracy to murder and maim people in Mumbai. In terms of his plea bargain before a U.S. court, the 55-year-old former U.S. agent cannot be extradited to India or Pakistan, but he is also obliged to testify “in any foreign judicial proceedings held in the United States by way of deposition, video conferencing or letters rogatory”. However, it is an irony of sorts that the development coincides with the resumption of talks between India and Pakistan, as the earlier ‘composite dialogue’ had been stopped precisely because of the Mumbai attacks. The question that may arise is whether the move to strengthen the prosecution case, and through that, India’s case against Pakistan’s role in the 26/11 attacks, will adversely impact the resumed bilateral dialogue. The answer, hopefully, will be in the negative. After all, in their recent joint statement both countries condemned terrorism and affirmed their commitment to eliminating it. Trials relating to the incident have been going on concurrently in both countries, with the proceedings on the Pakistan side moving quite slowly. Expediting the judicial proceedings and taking them to their logical conclusion will not be inconsistent with the resumption of the dialogue.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Headway-with-David-Headley/article10045599.ece
12,12,2015,"Illiberal law, roll it back","Scan Haryana’s statistics on key social indicators, and the picture that emerges is dispiriting. For example, in this State of rich farmers and networked urban centres, 41 per cent of Scheduled Caste men have not cleared class 8; and 68 per cent of SC women have not made it to class 5. Roughly 45 per cent of rural households do not have a toilet, and among SC households that figure rises to 55 per cent. Put together, it is a picture of failure of the government to fulfil the part of the essential contract that binds state and citizens: to provide the rule of law and social services. It was, therefore, an odd call to action by the Haryana government earlier this year when it passed the Haryana Panchayati Raj (Amendment) Act to debar exactly these citizens failed by the state from standing for panchayat elections. In a web of disqualifications, the full exclusionary potential of which is still not precisely calculated, the law debars from contesting men who have not completed matriculation, women who have not cleared class 8 (with the corresponding qualifications for SC men being class 8 and for SC women class 5), people who haven’t paid arrears for specified agricultural loans or electricity bills, and those who do not have a functional toilet at home. The law was challenged in court, and on Thursday > the challenge was set aside by the Supreme Court.
It is unlikely that the government will file a review petition, given that the Bharatiya Janata Party is in power in Haryana and at the Centre. However, the case against the law must be made politically, and emphatically so. For one, what the courts have done is to uphold the power of the State legislatures to enact such laws — it follows that civil society must persuade political parties to rethink such qualifications, and to repeal the amendment in Haryana specifically and desist from introducing such legislation in other States. A liberal democracy must of necessity refrain from certifying who may contest elections to represent the people. It is dangerously illiberal to debar citizens from contesting elections when they are able to fulfil their responsibilities as panchs, or legislators, as the case may be. Indeed, curbs on particular categories of people, instead of individuals in breach of particular laws, from contesting elections carries the imprint of authoritarianism, and such restrictions have predictably been popular with military juntas, from Pervez Musharraf’s Pakistan (only college graduates could contest) to present-day Myanmar (the bar on those with foreign nationals as spouses or children is obviously targeted at Aung San Suu Kyi). For yet another State in India to join their ranks, even if it is for panchayat elections, is a setback for the world’s largest democracy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-the-supreme-court-verdict-on-haryana-panchayat-law/article7977306.ece
14,12,2015,Hope on climate & a long road ahead,"The > Paris Agreement on climate change > marks a milestone in preserving the earth’s environment and provides a floor on which to build ambition and action. It is the outcome of a long struggle by millions of citizens around the world, aided by the weight of scientific evidence linking severe, more frequent weather events such as cyclones and droughts to man-made greenhouse gas emissions. The 195 country-parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change — besides Palestine which joined in Paris — have acknowledged that global climate action can no longer be postponed. While their adoption of the Agreement has created history, the sum total of national pledges by 189 nations will be unable to stop climate change that is already happening. As the UNFCCC acknowledges, these pledges will not be able to keep temperature “well below 2 degrees C” compared to pre-industrial levels, leave alone the > aspirational target of a 1.5° C limit. It is also important to remember that there is a long window before the promises on emissions cuts go into effect in 2020, a period during which developed nations would continue to emit large volumes of greenhouse gases. Given such a background and its responsibility as a legacy polluter, the richer half of the world, which secured the support of vulnerable and poor nations in Paris, must use the Agreement to liberally share its prosperity and technology. It would be perverse if the climate pact is viewed as a business opportunity to fuel a wave of growth for a few.
The signal from Paris is clearly for a shift away from polluting fossil fuels such as coal and oil to renewable energy, and the adoption of smart policies and innovative technology. Like all other countries, > India is now required to periodically report on its targets and performance under the Agreement, and update its Nationally Determined Contributions by 2020. This will need the active involvement of all States and wide consultations — more so for the 175 gigawatt renewables revolution, including 100 GW from solar, to meet the 2022 target. The Centre should consider enacting a strong climate change law that harmonises policies nationally, beginning with energy, buildings, transport, water, agriculture and urban development. The question of adaptation to climate change and addressing loss and damage looms large for India, given the regular cycles of crippling droughts, devastating flooding and lost livelihoods. There is not much to look forward to here in the Agreement, which speaks of raising finance with $100 billion a year base by 2020, an amount that is grossly inadequate for the scale of catastrophic events witnessed worldwide. The hope is that the Paris Agreement will, as a binding covenant, spur civil society to raise the pressure on leaders to improve upon it every year, adding clear commitments for the developed nations to cut their emissions in favour of the developing countries and raise financing significantly.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/paris-agreement-on-climate-change/article7983555.ece
14,12,2015,Setback for Venezuela’s socialists,"The socialists of Venezuela, first led by the late > President Hugo Chávez and then by President Nicolás Maduro, have had a near-total hegemony over power for the past 17 years. But the >results of the parliamentary elections held on December 6, in which the centre-right opposition secured a ‘supermajority’ with 112 seats out of the total 167, demonstrate that the socialist narrative which Chávez painstakingly built over the ruins of West-backed dictatorships and the failures of free-market capitalism has started losing its grip over the Venezuelan voters. Though an opposition victory was expected, their performance was better than even the most optimistic forecasts. With a two-thirds majority in the legislature, the opposition now has the strength to remove Supreme Court justices, pass laws and even draft a new Constitution, a move that could end Mr. Maduro’s presidential tenure. What has led to such a huge defeat of the socialists? The Venezuelan election comes close on the heels of the defeat of the leftist candidate, Daniel Scioli, in the Argentine presidential election. But it would be premature to see these two elections as part of a larger trend in South America of the resurgence of the Right. Rather, what the Argentine and Venezuelan stories tell is that the Left parties in these countries are paying a political price for the troubles in the economy.
In Venezuela, the socialists draw legitimacy and support from the government’s pro-poor welfare policies. Chávez’s redistributive policies had lifted millions out of poverty and boosted real income, helping the ruling party establish itself among the vast majority of the country’s poor. But this programme, largely funded by oil revenues, came under enormous strain when crude prices tumbled — compared to $115 a barrel in June 2014, it is now less than $40 a barrel — in the global market. Chávez’s original plan was to diversify the economy. But he did not face any imminent economic threat as oil prices were relatively high during his tenure. Mr. Maduro’s administration, which blamed the opposition for the economic worries of the country, however, failed to devise an alternative plan to let the ‘Bolivarian revolution’ stay afloat. Other economic and structural problems, such as high inflation, shortage of essential goods and poor infrastructure made matters more difficult for him. More important, Mr. Maduro lacks the political sharpness and charisma of Chávez, who, despite his combative style of politics, remained a highly popular father figure of the nation during his term. He was also a unifying force within the Socialist Party where growing rifts are now challenging Mr. Maduro’s authority. The election result is a wake-up call for the socialists. It is undisputed that the system that Chávez built has benefited millions of Venezuelans. But Mr. Maduro and his team need to refocus their energy on strengthening it, rather than simply blaming the opposition for every challenge they face.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/venezuela-parliamentary-elections-setback-for-venezuelas-socialists/article7983556.ece

Despite India being one the world’s largest economies, it accounts for only about 1 per cent of Japan’s imports, exports and direct investments abroad. The proposed bullet train link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad, which will have access to a soft Japanese loan of $12-15 billion at a concessional interest rate of 0.1 per cent, will cement economic cooperation further. Besides, this suits well Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s agenda of building quality infrastructure in the country. The civil nuclear cooperation deal, after five years of talks, marks a complete reversal of the policy Japan adopted towards India after the Pokhran nuclear tests in May 1998. Tokyo, which considers itself a champion of non-proliferation, had suspended much of its aid after India’s nuclear test. The deal, however, can be seen as a Japanese seal of approval to India’s status as a nuclear-armed state.
To be sure, enhanced economic and energy cooperation will benefit both countries. Japan has capital and skill whereas India has huge untapped potential. What they need is a clear road map, which, as the recent official exchanges show, is in the works. But at the same time, India should be wary of the great game going on in Asia. It may not be a coincidence that Japan is shedding its historical pacifist foreign policy, which helped its rise as an economic giant in Asia, at a time when its tensions with China are on the rise and the United States has been “pivoting” towards Asia. The American strategy appears to be to build an alliance in Asia to contain the rise of China. Japan, Washington’s strongest ally in Asia, is obviously one of the pillars of this “pivot” strategy. It is hardly a secret that both the American and Japanese establishments want India to “swing” towards their alliance. Mr. Abe had earlier written about the strategic need to forge a “democratic security diamond” with the U.S., Australia and India. This is the challenge India’s policymakers would face while deepening the country’s partnership with Japan further. New Delhi should get its economic and strategic priorities right and state them clearly. To script its own rise, India should build strong ties with each power, instead of aligning with any particular bloc. The country will gain more from everybody’s rise rather than joining some geopolitical alliance that is not in its primary interest.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/shinzo-abe-in-india-cautious-cooperation-with-japan/article7987950.ece
15,12,2015,Get smart on diesel cars,"The National Green Tribunal’s decision to > bar the registration of new and old diesel vehicles in Delhi till its next hearing on January 6 comes as a blow — though a temporary one for now — to passenger vehicle manufacturers. Automobile-makers have, in recent years, been building (from scratch, in a few cases) and scaling up their production capacities for diesel cars, driven by the surge in demand for diesel-powered vehicles as the fuel was subsidised and far cheaper than petrol. The differential between petrol and diesel prices has narrowed substantially since the government commenced the deregulation of diesel pricing in 2013, and diesel now is only 22 per cent cheaper than petrol. But diesel vehicles, including the sport utility vehicles, or SUVs, that are ubiquitous status symbols in the National Capital Region and beyond, now constitute 50 per cent of the auto industry’s passenger car sales. That vehicular exhaust from diesel cars, SUVs and freight trucks has been identified as one of the major contributors to the alarming levels of particulate matter in Delhi’s atmosphere is well-established. The tribunal has asked the Delhi and Central governments to decide whether a more permanent injunction prohibiting the registration of diesel vehicles in the NCR would be advisable, given the “serious contribution of vehicular pollution” to the city’s air quality. Separately, the Supreme Court is set to hear on December 15 an independent plea to ban diesel vehicles in Delhi.
Industry has reacted predictably, terming the move as unfair and discriminatory, and calling for a more holistic solution, while questioning the overall policy approach to diesel. With most of them investing to upgrade their technology to meet the more stringent BS-V (Bharat Stage-V) standards due in 2019, they suggest fleet modernisation to replace the older commercial transport vehicles, considered an equally major source of polluting exhaust emissions. Rating agency ICRA expects the share of diesel vehicles in annual auto sales to decline to 30-35 per cent by 2017 as the price difference between diesel and petrol narrows further. That may not help much in Delhi, the nation’s largest urban market for cars and SUVs. By way of comparison, the U.S. has decided to curb emissions from vehicles by moving towards higher fuel efficiency standards for new cars, though economists say it may only encourage people to drive even more. India is pursuing similar goals, but as Volkswagen’s ‘defeat device’ to rig emission tests for diesel vehicles shows, governments aren’t capable of enforcing such norms efficiently. In the backdrop of the latest climate change commitments and the toxic air that hangs over Delhi, it could be an opportune moment for Indian policymakers to use the tools of behavioural economics to alter people’s commuting preferences. Tax and other fiscal incentives to shift both freight haulage and public road transportation to cleaner CNG- and LPG-based technologies is one thing. But it’s perhaps time to take a bolder step and levy a hefty green tax on diesel-fuelled private vehicles and SUVs.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ban-on-diesel-cars-in-delhi/article7987948.ece
16,12,2015,Peace in the pipeline,"After being called a pipe dream for decades, the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline came one step closer to reality on Sunday, with the >groundbreaking ceremony at the Turkmen town of Mary attended by leaders of the TAPI countries. The pipeline, that is set to cross over 1,700 km, through Herat and Balochistan before reaching the Indian Punjab border, and will draw from the world’s second largest natural gas field of Galkynysh, comes full of promise. To begin with, it will reopen a historic route that reconnects South Asia to Central Asia, in the way it was before the British Empire sealed it off. It will also bring India and its neighbours much needed energy at competitive pricing, and could easily supply a quarter of Pakistan’s gas needs, about 15 per cent of India’s projected needs, as well as Afghanistan’s requirements, by the time it is completed in the 2020s. This is a growing need, and even if India is able to source energy from other countries like Iran and further afield, both the proximity and abundance of Turkmenistan’s reserves, that rank fourth in the world, will make it an attractive proposition. At a time when China has already secured nearly half of its energy requirements from the region, and is working on the $400 billion Russia-China gas pipeline, India has no time to lose in securing its interest in Central Asia. Finally, the TAPI pipeline gives this fractured region a reason to work on a project together as well, and it is hoped the shared stakes in TAPI’s success will ensure that India, Pakistan and Afghanistan find ways of cooperating on other issues as well.
However, the project faces the challenge of terrorism today. Unless the pipeline is secured from the Taliban that operates on both sides of the Durand Line, and from militant groups operating in Pakistan, it is hard to see how the TAPI dream can go beyond the groundbreaking ceremony. “By coming this far, we are overcoming a history of doubt and scepticism,” said Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani at the ceremony. Certainly, the fact that the TAPI, pushed by Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimohamedov, was able to bring leaders of three countries with relations as complicated as India, Pakistan and Afghanistan share is itself remarkable. To envisage a $10 billion project that traverses all three countries with all the bad blood between Afghanistan and Pakistan, and Pakistan and India, is ambitious as well. If it can manage to loosen the tight bonds between terror groups and their sponsors in Pakistan, who ought to see where their own interests lie, it will achieve the impossible; something no amount of pressure, cajoling and threat from India, Afghanistan and other countries has been able to effect in Pakistan thus far. The only way the project will be actualised is if the leadership of all four member-countries don’t just dwell on the world that exists today, but the region as it can be: connected, cooperative, peaceful and prosperous.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tapi-project-peace-in-the-pipeline/article7992806.ece
16,12,2015,"Splendid decade, but miles to go","There is now no doubt that the last 10 years were a time of extraordinary human development in India. When the World Bank decided to raise its global poverty line from $1.25 a day (in Purchasing Power Parity, or PPP, terms) to $1.90 in October and update the data for countries, it showed among other things that India had witnessed the fastest-ever decrease in the percentage of its population below the poverty line between 2009 and 2011. The United Nations Development Programme’s >Human Development Report released this week re-establishes this point. India’s Gross National Income more than doubled over the last 15 years, from $2,522 (PPP) to $5,497 between 2000 and 2014, putting it into middle income status. This economic growth translated into better human development outcomes as well; India’s Human Development Index value went from 0.462 to 0.609 between 2000 and 2014, a far higher increase than in the previous 15-year period. This was driven by improved economic growth and increase in life expectancy as a result of improved health care, and less so from improvements in educational outcomes, which have been harder to achieve, especially for women. Similarly striking is the story that emerges from India Health Report: Nutrition 2015 released by the Public Health Foundation of India last week. Child undernutrition, which had been declining slowly when data were last available in 2006, has begun to fall at historically high rates; between 2006 and 2014, stunting rates for children under five declined from 48 per cent to 39 per cent, translating into 14 million fewer stunted children, and declines in wasting translated into seven million fewer wasted children. These are extraordinary achievements.
Of course, India must not rest on these laurels. The UNDP report also showed that when inequality is factored in, India loses nearly 30 per cent of its HDI values, meaning that outcomes vary substantially by class, caste and gender. If India’s women were their own country, they would be 30 ranks lower on the HDI than the country as a whole is now, with far worse educational outcomes dragging them down. Indian women are at a particular disadvantage in the workforce; the high proportion (up to 39 per cent of GDP by one estimate) of unpaid care work that falls on women alone pushes them out of the workforce, resulting in one of the world’s lowest female labour force participation rates. The 2015 HDR, which is based on the theme of work, highlights just how vulnerable and ill-prepared for the future the majority of the Indian workforce is, and without a social protection blanket. The PHFI report also shows that India’s national successes mask massive inter-State variability; moreover, gender inequalities are possibly having an impact on children’s nutritional outcomes. Coming at a time when there is a fear of social sector budget cuts, these reports show that India must build on its human development successes with better redistributive justice.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/human-development-index-splendid-decade-but-miles-to-go/article7992807.ece
17,12,2015,"Tactless raid, unsavoury fallout","There may be some questions of propriety arising from the > CBI raids on Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office, but the development need not have been followed by the unsavoury political war that has broken out between the Aam Aadmi Party and the BJP — indeed, between the Delhi and Central governments. The agency could have displayed greater tact while conducting the searches in the Delhi Secretariat, aimed at Mr. Kejriwal’s Principal Secretary > Rajender Kumar, as it has given the impression that the Chief Minister’s office was also searched. It is normal for a raided spot to be closed to the media, but by keeping Mr. Kejriwal out of his office the CBI has given room for speculation that his office was also searched. It may be difficult to fault the agency for conducting the search without any forewarning, but in a federal set-up, searching the premises of a serving Chief Minister will always be looked at with suspicion, especially when the incumbent is not the subject of a probe. In September, there was a > CBI raid on Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh, but he had been under investigation and there was no room for any oblique motive to be alleged, except by painting it all as political vendetta. > Mr. Kejriwal’s claim that the documents seized included a ‘file movement register’ pertaining to the period November 15-December 15, 2015, if true, could give credence to his charge that the investigation is not confined to Mr. Kumar’s decisions during the period from 2007 to 2014. But his grievance that he is being targeted in the name of a probe against his Principal Secretary requires more proof. Meanwhile, perceptions of the use of the CBI for political ends by governments persists.
> Mr. Kejriwal’s outburst against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling him a “coward” and a “psychopath”, was unbecoming of a serving Chief Minister. Such bluster makes one wonder whether he sees the irony of questioning an investigation, given the unlimited powers he had sought for a Jan Lokpal. There is, however, no doubt that Mr. Kejriwal has been quick to see the raids as an opportunity to nominate himself as a national face of the > anti-Modi political coalition. Being in confrontation over a principle of governance with powers greater than himself has been part of Mr. Kejriwal’s strategy of giving his politics a mobilising edge. And now as the >AAP looks to expand its electoral footprint in the Punjab Assembly elections, having politicians from other parties ranged behind him on a series of issues will certainly help. For its part, even if they had been unaware of the impending raids, the response of BJP spokespersons and Ministers could not have been more self-defeating. Politically, they have allowed Mr. Kejriwal to take the fight to them on his terms and put them on the defensive — the onus is now on them to explain the federal spirit that informs their equation with Opposition governments in the States.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/delhi-secretariat-raids-tactless-raid-unsavoury-fallout/article7996969.ece
17,12,2015,Cautionary signals from the export slump,"The protracted slump in merchandise exports, which rounded out a 12th straight drop in November, is a cause for serious concern. The sharp, almost 25 per cent, contraction in the overseas shipment of goods from a year earlier to $20 billion signals there is more to this extended contraction than just the global economic weakness that has cast its shadow across trade worldwide. While the slide in commodity prices, including that of oil and petroleum products, has contributed to the decline in the value of exports in dollar terms, of greater worry is the continuing fall in demand for Indian engineering goods, and leather and leather goods. The leather sector has been hurt by a combination of economic weakness in Europe, increased competition and poor infrastructure. The theme of infrastructure hobbling the country’s trade competitiveness has been an enduring one with the problems of power availability and inadequate road and port connectivity still continuing to dog exporters, especially the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) that together accounted for more than 44 per cent of India’s exports in the last fiscal year. The MSME sector also provides employment on a sizeable scale, including in semi-urban and rural areas, and the export slowdown is sure to result in widespread labour distress that can only weigh on savings and consumption in the broader economy. The slowdown also reflects on the low level of value-addition being achieved by India’s exporters, as is evident in the widening trade deficit with China — itself coping with declines in both exports and imports. While the main exports to the northern neighbour are low value-added commodities such as cotton, copper alloys and iron ore, the imports include machinery, electrical equipment and electronics that have resulted in the trade gap surging 32-fold to $48.5 billion in the decade through March 2015.
The export slowdown is at the same time both a symptom and a potential trigger for domestic economic weakness. Any effort to improve business competitiveness through reforms, including in areas such as labour and credit markets, especially for the MSME segment, can surely give a fillip to the overall environment. The Make in India programme, if pursued cogently, can also serve as a springboard for enhancing skills and technologies that can over time help reverse and possibly boost both volumes and the value of overseas shipments. Also, the monetary and fiscal authorities need to be mindful of the fact that the rupee — while having weakened against the dollar, thus appearing to offer a price advantage to exporters — has actually appreciated in real terms against a trade-weighted basket of 36 currencies, making India’s exports less competitive. For this reason, the Reserve Bank of India needs to continue its close vigil over inflation. Finally, even the pharmaceuticals sector, where exports have grown, can ill afford to be complacent as the U.S. and Europe tighten regulatory oversight of generics and manufacturing processes in India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/cautionary-signals-from-the-export-slump/article7996970.ece
18,12,2015,Fed’s liftoff ends uncertainty,"The U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to finally start normalising interest rates, by > raising the fed funds rate by one quarter of a percentage point, has emphatically ended the uncertainty over the direction the world’s largest economy is headed in. Seven years after the Fed embarked on its record monetary expansion — by beginning a programme of bond purchases and cutting its >benchmark rate to near zero — to provide a stimulus in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. central bank has signalled that the American economy has definitely turned the corner. Fed chair Janet Yellen’s categorical assertion that the decision “reflects our confidence in the U.S. economy” and that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sees the economy on a path of sustainable improvement, should give comfort to investors worldwide that a key engine of the global economy is now ticking. Simultaneously, the Fed held forth the reassurance that its stance remains accommodative to support the recovery and help return inflation to the targeted level of 2 per cent. The widely anticipated decision should now infuse some much-needed optimism across both developed and emerging markets, especially at a time when global trade is stagnant and commodity prices continue to remain depressed as demand from China’s slowing economy stays muted. If history is any guide, previous tightening cycles from the Fed both in 1999 and in 2004 were coterminous with increased capital flows into emerging markets as economic growth in the U.S. spurred demand for goods and services in the developing and exporting nations. But conditions, as some economists point out, are different this time, with the majority of emerging market currencies more expensive than they were 11 years ago on an inflation-adjusted, trade-weighted basis. The immediate reaction in India’s markets was positive on Thursday as both stocks and the rupee ended stronger. And with adequate foreign exchange reserves accumulated as a bulwark against any sudden, sharp capital outflows, the Reserve Bank of India and Governor Raghuram Rajan — who had been calling for a gradual end to global easy money — appear well-prepared to deal with any exigencies, should they arise.
That the road ahead could still be anything but smooth and straight for both the global economy and the emerging markets is also amply evident in the language contained in the Fed’s communication. The FOMC statement made it clear that “economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases” in the benchmark rate. This is shorthand for saying that interest rates are likely to inch up and over a longer duration rather than mount a well-spaced and clearly graded timetable of staircase steps. With China’s surprise yuan devaluation of August and the resultant turmoil still fresh in memory, Chinese policymakers, along with the monetary authorities in Japan, the United Kingdom and the European Union, would be closely tracked. For Indian companies, new overseas loans are likely to start getting costlier, and the appreciation of the dollar could roil corporate balance sheets as debt-servicing gets more expensive.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/us-federal-reserves-liftoff-ends-uncertainty/article8000874.ece
18,12,2015,Inviting trouble in Kerala,"Petty local rivalries have combined with national-level politicking to create an embarrassing situation for Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy: after being invited to preside over a function where Prime Minister Narendra Modi was to unveil the statue of former Chief Minister R. Sankar, >Mr. Chandy was asked to stay away by the organisers, who have formed an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party. Whether or not this was done at the behest of senior leaders of the BJP, it is clear that the organisers, the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam, a Hindu backward class outfit, will need to take a major part of the blame for putting the Kerala Chief Minister in an awkward position. But, neither the BJP nor the Prime Minister’s Office could have been unaware of the decision to keep the Chief Minister out. While the statue unveiling was a private function, and the Chief Minister was not required to be invited, it was highly improper to have asked Mr. Chandy to skip the function citing silly excuses after having first invited him. Both the SNDP and the Congress can lay claim to the political legacy of Sankar who served in leadership capacities in the two organisations. But with the SNDP moving towards the BJP, the fight for Sankar’s legacy seems to have got complicated in recent times. Over the days leading up to the unveiling of the statue, the Sangh Parivar had attempted to dig up information about Sankar’s links with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in his formative years. Evidently, for both the SNDP and the BJP, to have a Congress Chief Minister preside over the function would have diminished the political dividends that could be expected from projecting Sankar as a Hindu, backward class Ezhava icon. Whatever the excuses given by SNDP leader Vellappally Natesan to Mr. Chandy, the fact remains that a Congress Chief Minister on the dais would have been politically inconvenient for the SNDP and the BJP.
Not surprisingly, the controversy saw both the Congress and the Left parties on the same side, with former Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) describing the withdrawal of the invitation to Mr. Chandy as an insult to Kerala as a whole. Both formations have suffered erosion in their support base following the rise of the BJP in Kerala on the back of the growing influence of the RSS. The alliance with the SNDP has given the BJP greater reach ahead of next year’s Assembly election, and leaders of other parties have remarked that the SNDP is acting as a feeder organisation for the BJP. Without doubt, the SNDP-BJP alliance would see some social and political churning in Kerala. As it seeks to expand its base, the RSS-BJP combine is evidently moving beyond seeing the Left parties as the prime enemy. In the past, RSS sympathisers had overtly and covertly backed the Congress against the Left Democratic Front. That phase now seems to have ended.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/chandy-in-modi-function-inviting-trouble-in-kerala/article8000875.ece
19,12,2015,Unseemly turn in Arunachal Pradesh,"The saddest aspect of the political turmoil in Arunachal Pradesh is that its key actors have revived unedifying practices that one would have thought the Indian polity had left behind some years ago: dissident ruling party legislators joining hands with their political rivals to bring down an elected government, holding parallel or unauthorised Assembly proceedings, and the Governor playing a partisan role. The conduct of Governor J.P. Rajkhowa in the ongoing crisis facing the Nabam Tuki government, set off by a group of ruling Congress MLAs revolting against his leadership, is questionable. In S.R. Bommai in 1994, the Supreme Court decided that the only place for determining whether a Chief Minister has lost his majority is the floor of the House, and not the Raj Bhavan. When it appeared that Mr. Tuki had lost the support of many of the legislators, the Governor could have either asked him to prove his majority when the Assembly met on January 14, 2016, or, if the matter brooked no delay, requested him to advance the session for the same purpose. There was no justification for the Governor to advance the session to December 16 on his own, and a legitimate question arises whether the Constitution permits such action. In another partisan act, he sent a message to the House to take up ‘Resolution for removal of the Speaker’ as the first item on the agenda.
The Congress has been ruling the State with the support of 47 MLAs in the 60-member Assembly, but 20 ruling party legislators have rallied under former Minister Kalikho Pul and joined hands with the 11-member Bharatiya Janata Party group in a bid to unseat Mr. Tuki. They accuse the Chief Minister of financial mismanagement and corruption. In a pre-emptive move against the rebels convening the Assembly on the Governor’s order, the government locked down the legislature building and the Speaker disqualified 14 out of the 20 dissidents to bring down the number required for a majority. Disqualification under the anti-defection law is subject to judicial review and the rebels could have challenged the Speaker’s decision. Instead, showing unseemly hurry, the Deputy Speaker, a dissident himself, ‘revoked’ their disqualification. All the rebels, along with the BJP and independent MLAs, held a sitting of the ‘Assembly’ at a makeshift venue, and ‘removed’ the Speaker and then the Chief Minister through a ‘no-confidence motion’. With the Guwahati High Court keeping in abeyance all the decisions taken at the rebel ‘session’, and sharply questioning the Governor’s action in convening the Assembly, the rest of the crisis may play out in a courtroom. Nevertheless, it would be a travesty of democracy if the current crisis results in the imposition of President’s Rule without Mr. Tuki being given an opportunity to prove his majority on the floor of the House. The Centre should avoid any impression that constitutional norms will not be respected while handling the issue.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unseemly-turn-in-arunachal-pradesh/article8005321.ece
19,12,2015,The challenge from France’s far-right,"The >failure of Marine Le Pen’s Front National to win even a single region in this month’s elections in France demonstrates that the majority of French voters are not yet ready to let the far-right party join governance. Had Ms. Le Pen’s anti-migrant, anti-European party seized at least one of the regions, it would have had dramatic consequences for the French polity. However, the election results, as the Socialist French Prime Minister, Manuel Valls, himself had pointed out, are hardly a cause for triumphalism. The FN had done remarkably well in the first round of the elections, held weeks after the November 13 Paris terror attacks in which 130 people were killed. The party captured 28 per cent of the vote and came top in six out of 13 regions in that round. This alarming rise of the FN had forced the two mainstream parties — Nicolas Sarkozy’s centre-right Republicans and President François Hollande’s Socialists — to enter into a de facto deal. The Socialists had even withdrawn their candidates from two regions to support the Republicans against the FN. It took increased voter turnout and tactical voting by the main parties to deliver the final blow to the FN in the second round of elections.
> Also read:The warnings from France’s far-right
However, the FN’s political momentum appears undiminished. What was an untouchable xenophobic far-right party on the fringes of French politics is now a force that cannot be ignored. In the regional election, it received more votes than ever before, and the number of its regional councillors tripled to 316. Ever since she took the reins of the party, Ms. Le Pen has been trying to “mainstream” the FN without changing its basic ideological premises. She isolated the overtly anti-Semitic, racist wings of the party, and projected the FN as a nationalist force with tough views on security, terrorism and migration. The rising security challenges in the wake of the terrorist attacks, the inflow of refugees fleeing the conflicts in West Asia and North Africa, and persistent economic slowdown and the crippling austerity policies of the government that have strengthened calls for protectionism have all helped Ms. Le Pen sell her sectarian narrative to a large section of French society. The way the mainstream parties blocked the FN in the election is commendable. But it’s not a sustainable strategy. If the material conditions that helped the FN grow continue to persist, how long can the Socialists and the Republicans keep them away from power through tactical voting? This is the biggest challenge French politicians face. If left unchecked, the influence of the far-right sections could redraw the French political landscape, endangering the values of liberty, equality and fraternity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/france-regional-elections-the-challenge-from-frances-farright/article8005322.ece
21,12,2015,Not quite Congress’s 1977 moment,"The new turn in a long-pending case involving allegations of misuse of funds of the Indian National Congress >to buy Associated Journals Ltd (AJL) , a firm that published the National Herald, a now defunct publication linked to the party, has put the spotlight on the Gandhis. For, between them, >Sonia and Rahul Gandhi are the main shareholders of Young Indian Pvt Ltd (YIL), the Section 25 company of which AJL is now a subsidiary. The charge is that the Gandhis, along with other directors of YIL, “fraudulently” acquired assets, largely AJL-owned countrywide real estate. The Congress’s defence is that YIL is a charitable company and that none of its directors has made any profit — in short, that they hold it in trust for the party both for charitable purposes and to restart a newspaper. The Congress has sought to project the legal proceedings as an instance of political persecution by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, by linking it to Subramanian Swamy, who pursued the case. The BJP-led government at the Centre, on its part, has tried to distance itself from the issue, stressing it is part of the judicial process in which it has no hand. Whatever the motivations, if any, the case must now necessarily be settled in court, and the Congress needs to fight it legally. Even so, the National Herald case has today indisputably acquired a political dimension.
With Sonia and Rahul Gandhi’s appearance in court on Saturday, >the Congress is seeking to revive memories of the arrest of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in October 1977 on charges of abuse of power brought forward under the Janata Party government. That became something of a defining moment of Indira Gandhi’s stint out of power, and she used it to mobilise her defeated party and revive sympathy for the Congress amongst the people, heralding a political comeback. Today, in the party, even though there is agreement that the National Herald case has acted “as a catalyst for party workers to be activated”, very few as yet believe that it is enough to set it on a path of revival. For that, the entire Congress organisation has to be overhauled, a new and vigorous leadership installed in the States to revive moribund units, and a clear strategy articulated, with a comprehensive national vision and purposeful plan for Parliament. Even the decision on whether Sonia Gandhi will be replaced as president of the party by Rahul Gandhi is on hold, ensuring that the uncertainty in the party continues. The show of party solidarity with the Gandhis when they appeared at Delhi’s Patiala House court was evidently genuine, drawing from a feeling that the future of the Gandhis is inextricably linked to the future of the Congress. It would be unfortunate, however, if the Congress party expended too much political capital on this and restricted its mobilisation to the case against its president and vice-president. Not only were the specifics of the charges against Indira Gandhi in 1977 different, that was a different news ecosystem. The half-life of a political opportunity is now much shorter.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-national-herald-case-not-quite-congresss-1977-moment/article8011042.ece
21,12,2015,Justice that is rehabilitative,"A mature society will not give in to popular clamour and overturn sound legal principles and social norms that underpin its justice system. The popular outrage over the > release of a juvenile convict in the December 2012 Delhi gang rape case after a three-year term in a Special Home is understandable, but it is just plainly wrong to demand that his detention should continue. It is a misplaced view that juveniles who fell only a few months short of adulthood in the eye of law and were convicted for heinous crimes such as murder and rape should be tried as adults. Nor is it legally tenable to argue that an ‘unreformed’ convict should not be released back into society on completion of the maximum permissible stint in a home for juveniles in conflict with law. In fact, child-convicts growing into adulthood while being kept in a reformatory institution are ripe for rehabilitation. It will be a greater crime to force them to spend further time in special homes or put them in prison along with adult criminals. It is futile now to seek to establish that the former juvenile released now was the most brutal among the group that committed the gang rape. To say this is not to lose one’s sympathy for the > grieving parents of the young rape victim who subsequently died. None can afford to forget the crime that brought forth an unprecedented outpouring of anger and made the whole country introspect about the way it treats its women.
The Delhi High Court has taken the correct view by refusing to stay the convict’s release. It has taken note of the provisions for post-release rehabilitation, especially through an individual care plan for his reintegration with society. The Juvenile Justice Board should also receive quarterly follow-up reports for two years from the child welfare officer, probation officer or the NGO concerned. Claims that the stay in the Special Home had had no effect on him and that he had been ‘radicalised’ during his confinement in the Special Home appear to be desperate arguments by an unconvinced society to stall his release. Children fall foul of the law mainly because of neglect, abuse and poverty. There are no innate human propensities that magically transform cherubic children into unregenerate criminals beyond redemption. The whole object of juvenile law in India is to preserve the scope for rehabilitation and prevent recidivism. There is a pending Bill in Parliament that seeks to carve out a separate category of child offenders in the age group of 16 to 18 involved in heinous crimes and transfer them to regular criminal courts. It would be a retrograde step to enact this provision, even though other clauses in the Bill contain many progressive aspects for children in need of care and protection. It is the wider society that will really benefit from rehabilitative justice for child offenders and their transition to responsible adulthood.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-the-release-of-juvenile-justice-that-is-rehabilitative/article8011044.ece
22,12,2015,Rajya Sabha’s winter of disquiet,"Parliament has suddenly been galvanised into action, and the >Rajya Sabha is now to take up for discussion amendments to the Juvenile Justice Act. On Monday, the Supreme Court, wisely, refused to stay the release after three years of detention of one of the men involved in the gang rape of December 16, 2012 who had not turned 18 at the time of the horrific crime. It is a sign of falling standards that a resolve by parliamentarians to take up anything at all for deliberation is notice-worthy. But >Rajya Sabha > MPs must pay heed to the disquiet that they are echoing a mob-like frenzy in signing up to the amendment to reduce the age of juvenility, without enough reflection on why crime by young people puts different responsibilities for rehabilitation on a society. The Rajya Sabha is on test today not only for the urgency with which it takes note of the sentiment on the street — it will be judged for the sense of proportion it brings to the subject and the evenness with which its members grapple with the distinction between retribution and rehabilitation, between collective responsibility for the country’s young and abdication of the vulnerable. In a larger sense, too, in 2015 the Rajya Sabha has been asked to make a case for its institutional relevance, and how the House rises to the challenge would have implications for the assertiveness of Parliament as a whole.
The numbers are dismal. According to data compiled by PRS Legislative Research, a Delhi-based think tank, as of December 18 the Rajya Sabha had wasted more than half its available hours in the winter session. Question Hour had functioned in the House for only 15 per cent of the allotted time — in contrast to 88 per cent in the Lok Sabha. The numbers do not reflect the initiatives taken by the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, Vice-President Hamid Ansari, in trying inventive ways to keep the deliberative and questioning spirit alive. Over his two terms he has, for instance, got the House to take up questions even if the MP against whose name it had been listed was absent, and to reschedule Question Hour to a quieter time of day — but to little avail. Discipline apart, of late there has been criticism of the Rajya Sabha’s capacity to hold up non-money bills passed by the Lok Sabha. This obviously draws from the ruling NDA’s numerical disadvantage in the House. Critics overlook the essential need for a permanent House in a country as diverse as India — to ensure continuity as a check against sudden changes in government and agendas, and to reflect the voice of States in this federal polity. If anything, the lack of numbers should propel the ruling party to reach the extra inch across the aisles in the Lok Sabha, to agree to have its Ministers put to more stringent questioning, even to interest Opposition MPs by adopting Prime Minister’s Questions, and, most importantly, to loosen the debate-snuffing restrictions of the anti-defection law and allow bipartisan coalitions to be built around specific pieces of legislation. In India’s unique form of bicameralism, the key to unlocking a stand-off in one House inevitably lies in the other House. Just as the way to institutional strength lies in empowering individual MPs.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-the-winter-session-of-parliament-rajya-sabhas-winter-of-disquiet/article8014705.ece
22,12,2015,Right moves on the Soccer League,"For all the flutter that the >Indian Super League (ISL) has managed to create so far, a thrilling finish of the kind witnessed on Sunday, when >Chennaiyin FC defeated FC Goa 3-2 in the final , seemed just apt. That the match was turned on its head with barely seconds remaining, even as it ensured a fairy-tale end, brought out in good measure the vagaries of sport in general and the quirkiness of football in particular. If Goa thought it had done enough to drag itself past the finish line when it took the lead with three minutes left, it was not to be. It showed, yet again, how a momentary lapse in concentration can damage fortunes in high-pressure situations. If anything, only the unsavoury incidents which followed the final whistle marred what was a fierce but evenly contested tie. On the match itself there might not have been much to write home about. The flair and zest displayed by both teams in their run to the final was seen only in patches. But final matches, in which caution is often the watchword and avoiding mistakes is paramount, have a tendency to turn out the way this one did. However, there can be no doubting that the league’s two best teams contested the final. Goa scored a league-high 29 goals to enter the knock-outs while Chennaiyin, in addition to the 25 goals scored, also had the best defensive record, conceding only 15.
After a successful opening season, there was a fair amount of scepticism as the second season got under way two months ago. For, the sophomore’s test is perhaps the toughest to pass. In spite of the bad press owing to the national team’s capitulation in the World Cup qualifiers, it can indeed be said that the ISL has managed to not lose its sheen. As Chennaiyin FC’s manager Marco Materazzi said on the eve of the final, “I hope that everyone sees the difference. All of us have done well to raise the level. Last year it took 19 points to reach the play-offs. This year it is 22. I hope the improvement keeps happening. If it does, we will be the happiest people.” It also helped that, unlike the previous season, the cream of Indian football including captain Sunil Chhetri participated. Also, other Indian players under the tutelage of coaches such as the legendary Zico and Materazzi himself have blossomed. Having said that, there is still room for considerable improvement. The tournament must be scheduled in such a way that ISL matches do not run parallel to India’s international forays. The two are meant to complement each other, ultimately leading to the uplift of both. Zico’s repeated call for a single league, as against two separate entities in I-League and ISL, with very limited, but extremely good foreign players, is to be considered. The Brazilian great’s wealth of coaching experience in developing nations coupled with his standing in world football does merit that.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-the-indian-super-league-right-moves-on-the-soccer-league/article8014710.ece
23,12,2015,Ominous signals from Ayodhya,"That the Ramjanmabhoomi movement was more political than religious in nature was evident from its very beginnings in communal frenzy and bigotry. And that the demand for the construction of a > Ram temple in Ayodhya at the site where the >Babri Masjid stood would become more strident with every approaching general election was a foregone conclusion. Even so, the offloading of truckloads of pink sandstone at the premises of the >Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) in Ayodhya this month adds a new element of provocative divisive politics in Uttar Pradesh, which goes to polls for the Legislative Assembly in a little over a year’s time. The elaborate ritual performed on the stones, the ‘shila puja’, is in itself an indication of the symbolism sought to be evoked with the arrival of every batch of stones. Already, about one half of the total requirement of the stones necessary for the building of the temple is lying at the premises, but the offloading of each truckload is celebrated as an event in time marking the journey to the construction of the temple at the >Babri Masjid site . Although the VHP insists that the entire exercise is a routine affair, the fact that this is the first time in eight years that such activity is happening gives it an ominous colour.
Issues relating to the site, whether a Ram temple was pulled down or modified to build the Masjid, and who could claim ownership of the plot of land believed by some sections of Hindus to be the birthplace of Ram, are still part of an unresolved legal dispute after the Supreme Court stayed an order of the Allahabad High Court that split the disputed site in three parts. With the restoration of status quo ante, no construction is possible at the site. By making preparations for the construction of a temple without waiting for the court verdict, the Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas, a trust run by the >VHP , is clearly attempting to whip up communal passions over the dispute. Although the Samajwadi Party government of Akhilesh Yadav put the law and order machinery on alert, in such tension-charged atmosphere it would take no more than a few rumour-mongers to disrupt communal peace. However, with the Bharatiya Janata Party in power at the Centre, senior leaders are a lot more circumspect, not wanting to be seen as defying court orders. Indeed, the BJP is at present fighting under the cover of the VHP, assuming that any political gains from communal tensions over the issue would accrue to it, but the cost would be borne by the VHP alone. But the BJP is mistaken if it thinks it can harness the demons the VHP unleashes. Hate campaigns have a life of their own, and could spiral into unstoppable violence. The Ayodhya dispute should be left to the courts of law to adjudicate on. There can be no room for political games to stir communal passions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-ayodhya-temple-ominous-signals-from-ayodhya/article8018720.ece
23,12,2015,Spain’s vote against the status quo,"The results of Sunday’s parliamentary election in Spain are the strongest challenge yet to the post-Franco political order that has been dominated by the country’s two major parties — the centre-right Popular Party and the Socialist Workers Party. In the post-Franco years, the motto of the Spanish political class was ensuring a democratic transition, checking the military’s overreaching influence, rebuilding the country’s damaged international reputation and creating a relatively prosperous society. This socio-political project held sway for nearly four decades, with the established parties championing it. But the European economic crisis, which particularly hit Spain hard, and the conservative response of the main political parties towards the crisis, along with a generational change in Spanish society, seems to have ruptured the status quo. The two main parties have failed to win a simple majority. The Popular Party of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy won 123 seats in the 350-member Parliament, while the Socialist Workers Party secured only 90 seats. Both saw an erosion of popular support, while emerging parties, the radical-left Podemos and the liberal Citizens party, made huge gains. They won 69 and 40 seats, respectively.
The performance of Podemos, which was formed only in January 2014, is particularly impressive. The party led by Pablo Iglesias has a strong anti-austerity policy and has called for a new politics of people’s participation. They could resonate with the young voters easily as the austerity policies adopted by the government are taking a toll on their lives while the economy is still struggling. Joblessness among the youth is dangerously high, at 47 per cent. But during the campaign Podemos faced a “Syriza problem”. Its rivals said if the radical-left party won, it would push Spain into a Greece-like crisis. Unlike in Greece, the Spanish Socialists are not completely discredited among their support base. Podemos had actually toned down its radical rhetoric during the campaign to present itself as a responsible Leftist force that can deal with the economic challenges of Spain. But they still could not crack the rural vote base of the Socialists. The Citizens party, on the other side, is also critical of the establishment, but it doesn’t have any alternative economic agenda to offer, which limits its scope of growth. So there’s no clear winner. The transition is likely to be chaotic. One possible outcome of the election would be the formation of a weak coalition government. The Left parties have said they would block the Popular Party from forming a government again. The Socialists and Podemos are reportedly in talks. But both groups have divergent views on key issues, beginning with the economic policy. Even if a coalition is put together, it’s unlikely to solve Spain’s main problems. Another scenario is a fresh election in a few months. In either case, the churn in Spanish politics will continue until a clear leader emerges out of the present chaos.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-spain-parliamentary-election-spains-vote-against-the-status-quo/article8018721.ece
24,12,2015,An opportunity missed at Nairobi,"The Nairobi Ministerial Conference of the > World Trade Organisation concluded last week after negotiations stretched into an unscheduled fifth day as delegates from the rich nations, emerging market economies and the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) sought to hammer out an agreement acceptable to all. The final declaration, while helping salvage the primacy of the WTO as the arbiter of international trade rules, left the LDCs and the emerging nations, especially India, trying to count their gains as the U.S. and EU celebrated the outcome that quietly cast aside the > Doha Development Agenda. That member-countries may be prepared to make sacrifices was apparent from the outset after Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, in his opening remarks, cited 2015 as a year in which nations demonstrated ‘unparalleled’ cooperation in agreeing on collective approaches to the pressing problems facing humanity. His references to the ‘successful’ International Conference on Financing for Development, the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the ‘historic’ Paris agreement to combat climate change, heightened delegates’ anxiety to conclude a deal. The fact that the WTO body was meeting for the first time in Africa also meant that both developed countries and emerging market economies like India were wary of being seen as deal-breakers. And the surge in bilateral, regional and plurilateral trade agreements, including the most recent Trans-Pacific Partnership, cast its shadow too. The result is a modest one, with the key takeaways being the decisions to end all farm export subsidies and liberalise global trade in information technology products.
From > India’s point of view , the Nairobi declaration was disappointing on multiple fronts. From its relative pre-eminence among emerging market economies with the principled position on sticking to the > Doha agenda, India has returned with very few, if any, of its demands met. There is no concrete agreement on a special safeguards mechanism to protect farmers in the developing countries against sudden import surges, and no short deadline for a permanent solution on public stockholding for food security purposes. And the lack of an unambiguous reaffirmation of the Doha Development Agenda means new issues of interest to developed countries, including competition policy, government procurement and investment are now open for negotiations. The lessons are clear. While negotiators from the developed countries came fully prepared to defend their strategic aims, India’s leadership faltered for want of a clear-cut strategy. For the future, the government needs to broaden its preparation: by holding wide-ranging meetings on WTO-related issues with all stakeholders in a bipartisan manner, renewing and strengthening its ties with the developing and LDC economies to protect the development agenda, and finally bolstering its pool of trade negotiators by picking the best and brightest trade experts and lawyers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-wto-meeting-in-nairobi-an-opportunity-missed-at-nairobi/article8022370.ece
24,12,2015,Law-making amid moral outrage,"Legislators acting in response to moral outrage seen on television and during street protests and being apparently influenced by the importunate gaze of victims of crime from the gallery, does not augur well for sound law-making. It may not be right to characterise the quick passage of the > Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Bill in the Rajya Sabha as a hasty move because it has already been passed in the Lok Sabha in May 2015. The draft too had been slightly modified before that, based on a February 2015 report of a standing committee of Parliament. Yet, it is difficult to overcome the impression that some members may have been gripped by a bout of moral panic after the release of the youngest convict in the Delhi gang rape of December 2012. The seeming sense of urgency was undoubtedly influenced by a section of the media demanding ‘justice’ after the convict was released from a Special Home on completing his three-year term there. An impression is sought to be created that the country’s collective conscience demanded that a tough law be enacted to ensure that juvenile convicts committing heinous crimes do not get away with light sentences. An edifying aspect of this legislative episode is that there are enough voices around that understand that restorative justice is best ensured for this underclass by addressing the fundamental problems that create juvenile offenders in society in the first place, by ensuring universal access to education and social care for all children.
The Bill, which contains progressive aspects such as streamlining adoption procedures and extending the law’s protection to orphans and abandoned children, still suffers from the problems highlighted by the parliamentary panel. The government, unfortunately, did not accept the view that children in a particular age group being subjected to the adult criminal justice system will violate their right to equality under Article 14 and the objective of protecting children in Article 15(3) of the Constitution. It, however, dropped a clause that provided for treating those who had committed crimes before reaching the age of 18 but were apprehended after they turned 21, agreeing that it was unconstitutional. It extended the period of preliminary assessment (the original draft called it ‘inquiry’) by the > Juvenile Justice Board to determine whether a juvenile offender should be sent for rehabilitation or tried as an adult, from one month to three months. The board’s assessment will still be subject to judicial review and may set off litigation over whether one 16-year-old was let off lightly or another was wrongly sent to an adult court. Such decisions may also be influenced by the prevailing public mood. It would have been wiser to have let the law stand in conformity with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which advocates equal treatment of all children under the age of 18. The difference between sober assessment and mercurial action cannot be more starkly emphasised.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-passage-of-juvenile-justice-bill-lawmaking-amid-moral-outrage/article8022371.ece
25,12,2015,Judicial overreaction,"The > initiation of criminal contempt proceedings against Booker Prize-winning writer Arundhati Roy by the Bombay High Court appears to be an excessive reaction to adverse comment. Judges are expected to be uninfluenced by occasional criticism relating to their judicial orders, especially by journalists and writers who are not parties before them. It behoves the superior judiciary to ignore remarks on court proceedings and orders made out of activist zeal. In times when both mainstream and social media are full of observers, critics, commentators and detractors, courts ought not to be unduly sensitive to outspoken critics, subject of course to the rule that the criticism is fair and does not attribute motives to judges or malice to judicial functioning. Ms. Roy is no stranger to the long arm of the court’s contempt jurisdiction. The Supreme Court sentenced her to one day in prison for criminal contempt for ‘scandalising the judiciary’ through some remarks in 2002. A few years earlier, in 1999, the Supreme Court decided to be lenient towards her and her associates in the Narmada Bachao Andolan for their comments on court orders. “[T]he court’s shoulders are broad enough to shrug off their comments,” the Bench had remarked then, in a measure of how the court’s dignity is better served if it takes routine criticism in its stride and moves only against vicious and tendentious remarks or actions that bring the judiciary into disrepute or ridicule.
Ms. Roy’s article in a magazine relating to the arrest and denial of bail to G.N. Saibaba of Delhi University does not appear entirely to fall under such a category. The political sympathies reflected in the article for the wheelchair-bound lecturer are quite obvious, but it is not possible to discern any wilful contempt for judicial processes in its expression of concern for his freedom, health and well-being. Unfortunately, Justice A.B. Chaudhari sees in the piece a “gameplan” to obtain an order of bail “knowing fully well that the plea was turned down by the Sessions Court as well as a Single Judge of this Court.” While initiating action against Ms. Roy for criminal contempt, he seems to have read too much into an article sharply critical of the government and the police that relates only indirectly to the judiciary in its comparison of instances of those who got bail (Babulal Bajrangi, Maya Kodnani and Amit Shah) and those who did not. The majesty of the court ought to be any judge’s concern, but it is inconceivable why an author’s “nasty” language against the government and the police should be. The conclusion that her article, prima facie, tends to interfere in the administration of justice merely because it appears to argue that Mr. Saibaba is entitled to release is unfortunate. While safeguarding the judiciary’s reputation and dignity, courts of law should not be seen as stifling free comment and suppressing political dissent. The power of contempt should be used sparingly and that too, only against those wilfully subverting justice, and not against critics of the state.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-criminal-contempt-proceedings-by-bombay-hc-against-arundhati-roy-judicial-overreaction/article8026159.ece
25,12,2015,Cess proceeds in a black hole,"The National Democratic Alliance government has just introduced a cess of > 0.5 per cent on all taxable services for the Swachh Bharat campaign. In February 2016, it will introduce a 2 per cent cess on airfares for all domestic flyers except those flying to remote locations, and international travellers. This cess is meant to fund losses that airlines may incur in connecting to hinterland locations. The Central government loves cesses, partly because it doesn’t have to share the proceeds with State governments. It has been levying them for several important causes including primary education, secondary education, road development, the welfare of construction workers and beedi workers, clean energy, research and development and universalisation of telecom coverage, among several others. But good intentions often pave the road to hell, as is evident from the fact that over Rs.1.4 lakh crore of cess proceeds lie unutilised and inadequately accounted for in the government’s books. Take, for example, the case of the Secondary and Higher Education Cess paid by all income tax payers that has yielded over Rs.64,000 crore between 2006 and 2015. Not a rupee of that has been spent, while hundreds of students now fork out more for higher education since the government has discontinued the non-National Eligibility Test fellowship. That the government has failed to even set up a fund to pool the proceeds shows the lack of planning that precludes and follows the levy of a cess. So is the case with the proposed airfare cess. The government is yet to identify routes that the cess would subsidise, or spruce up the many defunct civil airports.
The point of a cess is that the money it generates can only be used for the designated purpose so it can be an effective policy tool in theory. But if the money isn’t spent for the designated purpose, as the audit report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India tabled in Parliament has shown, it just stagnates and distorts the economy further: the additional tax brings down real incomes without any accompanying gain in socio-economic indicators as targeted. Then there is the question of whether a given cess is needed at all. Most reasons cited for levying a cess, such as purposes of education, are important enough for direct budgetary allocations — as happens in the developed world. So the government can simply raise the tax rate rather than impose multiple cess levies. But with the Fourteenth Finance Commission increasing States’ share of the common pool of resources, cesses are tempting for the Centre to shore up its own finances. If it wants to keep complicating the taxation system for good intentions, the government should start disclosing a deployment plan to achieve the intended outcomes from cess collections before imposing the next such levy on citizens.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-nda-governments-cess-on-taxable-services-for-the-swachh-bharat-campaign-cess-proceeds-in-a-black-hole/article8026160.ece
26,12,2015,A bold & laudable initiative,"To achieve the impossible, it is precisely the unthinkable that must be thought,” wrote a famous novelist. To that end, Prime Minister > Narendra Modi’s unannounced visit to Kabul and surprise stopover in Lahore is certainly as unthinkable as it is a transformational moment for India. While several Indian Prime Ministers have attempted to turn ties with Pakistan into something more neighbourly, nothing defines good neighbours more than Mr. Modi’s “dropping in” for tea to wish his counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, on his birthday and to give his good wishes for his grand-daughter’s wedding. With the two visits on Christmas day, bringing together India’s interest in engaging both Afghanistan and Pakistan, he has also reclaimed the ‘SAARC moment’ of his swearing-in ceremony in 2014, which many had called a masterstroke at the time. What is perhaps the most surprising is not just that Mr. Modi decided to make the stops, but that they come at the end of a year when relations with both Afghanistan, over talks with the Taliban, and Pakistan, over LoC firing and the NSA talks, were very troubled. Mr. Modi has ensured that a curtain has been drawn on those troubles, and a new beginning will be made in the new year. Not just that, by making the journey from Kabul to Lahore, he has transformed Afghanistan from a battlefield between India and Pakistan into a facilitator of good relations. The road ahead is certainly perilous. Relations with Pakistan have often seen setbacks far worse than the strides in ties. The Kargil war followed just such a bold initiative by Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the Lahore bus, and Manmohan Singh’s sustained talks on Kashmir with President Musharraf, who he invited for a cricket match to India to restart talks, went awry after a series of attacks. However, if Mr. Modi were to dwell only on those perils, there would be no way of moving forward, and he has been wise to take the high road to peace over the low road of discordant ties with Pakistan. The two foreign secretaries should build on this breakthrough at their meeting scheduled for mid-January.
If Mr. Modi’s move towards Pakistan represents a maturing and progression of his position, then the Congress party’s attack on the Lahore visit represents a churlish regression in its position. It is surprising that the main opposition party has chosen to criticise Mr. Modi for everything its own Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, risked so much for during his tenure. In 2007, many were aghast when Dr. Singh said he dreamed of a time he could have breakfast in Amritsar, lunch in Lahore and dinner in Kabul. With a few modifications, Mr. Modi, who is now the biggest beneficiary of the previous government’s sagacious Pakistan policy, has achieved that dream, in reverse.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-narendra-modis-surprise-visit-to-lahore-a-bold-laudable-initiative/article8029381.ece
26,12,2015,Do right by India’s real NRIs,"Every detail of the latest story of abuse of Indian workers in West Asia is both horrifying and painfully emblematic of the condition of Indian migrants to these countries. Three men from Kerala paid an agent to get them employment in Yemen, but they were taken to Saudi Arabia instead. They were trained electricians but were made to work in a brick factory. They were beaten by their employer with a wooden plank for refusing to do the work, the torture captured on camera and sent home to their families. Theirs is far from the first such story of entrapment, deceit and abuse. In October, a woman worker from Tamil Nadu said that her Saudi employer had tried to chop off her hand when she tried to escape. In September, a video emerged online which seemed to show the abuse of an Indian construction worker by his Saudi supervisor. Journalists investigating the construction of the 2022 FIFA World Cup infrastructure in Qatar found Indian workers were among those living in cramped accommodation for low wages and long hours under often exploitative contracts. Earlier this month External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj told Parliament that there were over 7,400 complaints of exploitation made by Indian workers in Gulf countries in 2015 alone.
There are over 6 million Indian workers in West Asia, forming a quarter of the region’s total expatriate workforce, including 2.8 million in the UAE, 1.8 million in Saudi Arabia, and over half a million each in Qatar, Kuwait and Oman. (Money repatriated to India from the Gulf countries was $32.7 billion in 2014, compared to $10 billion from the U.S.) The International Labour Organisation estimates that many of the 600,000 workers in the region who are victims of forced labour are Indian citizens. In fact, the chain of exploitation begins at the recruitment and migration stage in India, as was the case with the men from Kerala in Saudi Arabia — a police officer in fact put them in touch with the agent. The Ministry of External Affairs is aware of the problem; and Ms. Swaraj has been quick to respond to outrage over such incidents, offering help and support. However, there has not yet been a lasting fix to the problem; recruitment remains largely unregulated, India’s push for higher wages remains unfulfilled, and protections for Indian workers once they discover the nature of their employment are often difficult to come by. Many of these workers are leaving behind impoverished lives, and might not always be in a position to assert their rights in the hope of a better life for their families. These are India’s real NRIs — in numbers and in terms of remittances and investment in their home countries. India must do better by them.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-abuse-on-indian-workers-in-west-asia-do-right-by-indias-real-nris/article8029383.ece
28,12,2015,New energy in old friendship,"“Should old acquaintance be forgot”, asks the famous song Auld Lang Syne, traditionally sung at the year’s end. Prime Minister Narendra >Modi’s visit to Russia last week, much in the manner of the song, was as much about reassuring a “strong and reliable friend of India”, as he referred to Russia, as it was about chalking out new avenues for future cooperation in defence, energy and space. These avenues are well- charted, with the annual summit between both countries giving a consistent direction on all bilateral agreements, but relations have flagged in the past few years. This year the summit itself had to be put off several times for one reason or another, and it was finally held on Christmas-eve, which was the last possible window before Russia shuts down for holidays. In contrast, India’s relationship with the other world power, the United States, has seen a dramatic year, particularly in military engagement. From U.S. President Barack Obama’s visit to New Delhi as chief guest at the Republic Day parade, when India and the U.S. signed their first military agreement outside South Asia as a maritime cooperation agreement, firming up of more military exercises and joint development of defence equipment, visits by top U.S. generals, and the first-ever visit by the Indian Defence Minister to an American military base — all have given the impression that India is abandoning its traditionally neutral strategic space.
While Prime Minister Modi’s visit may not have resulted in overturning that impression entirely, it has served as a major boost to the outlook on India-Russia ties in the future. First, a series of defence acquisitions announced in the works will put Russia back on top of military suppliers to India, a spot taken by the U.S. and Israel for more than five years. Second, the deal for 200 Ka-226T Kamov helicopters will become the first big Make in India project, which has tended to be only a slogan thus far. Third, by investing time in the CEO summit that included several Indian players in the energy and defence sector, Mr. Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin have shown a desire to involve the private sector in areas that only saw government-to-government deals. This move is the most significant: despite the close friendship the two have fostered, the immense goodwill the people of the two countries share and the major dependence the Indian military has on Russian hardware, bilateral trade ties have always been poor, and even today languish below $10 billion. Russian and Indian industry’s interest and investment will give what the leaders referred to as the old friendship’s “new energy”. An energy that will also bolster India’s plans for new ties with Central Asia, and more recently, in the trips Mr. Modi made straight after his Moscow visit, with Afghanistan and Pakistan.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/new-energy-in-old-friendship/article8034329.ece
28,12,2015,Opposition for opposition’s sake,"It must have caused the Congress party great political discomfort to watch Prime Minister Narendra Modi make a surprise >stopover in Lahore, exude bonhomie with his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, and behave as if he could will India towards better ties with Pakistan without help from anyone else. What the Congress-led government failed to do for ten years between 2004 and 2014, despite the good intentions of its Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, the Bharatiya Janata Party and its Prime Minister, Mr. Modi, seem able to do with ease: take the initiative in visiting Pakistan and set the agenda for talks with Pakistan. The Congress is free to rue its missed opportunities, and, maybe, even blame a combative BJP-headed opposition for the unimaginative and constricted foreign policy vis-à-vis Pakistan in that decade. But what it should not do is undermine the efforts of Mr. Modi as he sets about doing what it would have liked to have done by itself. Of course, Mr. Modi can be faulted for the U-turns in India’s South Asia foreign policy. But the time for such criticism is not now, when he and his government are moving ahead in the right direction. The sudden boost to ties with Pakistan might have been ‘unpredictable’, as Congress leader Anand Sharma saw it, but ‘predictability’ is no virtue either. Also, it is of no great consequence if the visit was prearranged days in advance or was the result of an impulsive decision. What matters is what ensues from Mr. Modi’s sudden overtures to Pakistan. If the relations move up a level or two, and the surprise visit helps build greater trust between the two countries, then it would have served its purpose. The visit can be termed ‘frivolous’ only if the end results do not go beyond wishing Mr. Sharif on his birthday or greeting his granddaughter on her wedding. To be dismissive of the Modi-Sharif meeting even without giving it a chance to bear fruit betrays the political nervousness of the Congress more than anything else.
That, during its years in power, the Congress took its cautionary instincts on Pakistan to an absolute extreme was obvious. Indeed Prime Minister Singh did not get the necessary support from his party or his Cabinet colleagues when he tried to take the initiative in resolving outstanding issues with Pakistan — most spectacularly, on the Sharm el-Sheikh joint statement. This might have had to do with the fear of the BJP, then in opposition, taking political advantage of any normalisation of relations with Pakistan by projecting it as a sell-out. But without doubt, Prime Minister Singh was seen as apolitical by the Congress leadership, and was not given a free hand in taking initiatives of the kind that Mr. Modi has. The Congress should seriously introspect about the need to place national interest above petty political calculations. For his part, Prime Minister Narendra Modi too must reach out to take opposition leaders into confidence on his vision for India-Pakistan talks — else, bipartisan consensus on such a crucial issue will remain elusive, with populist grandstanding continuing to threaten the country’s strategic and foreign policy challenge.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/opposition-for-oppositions-sake/article8034328.ece
29,12,2015,Hunger brews in Bengal’s tea estates,"North Bengal’s tea estates are witnessing an unfolding human tragedy as more deaths of tea garden workers were reported this month from the region. With the industry as a whole struggling from soft prices and a drop in output as climate change affects rainfall and weather conditions across the country’s tea-growing regions, several estates are reportedly being unofficially shut, leaving thousands of hapless workers in the lurch. And even at gardens that are operating, living conditions for the predominantly female workforce are said to be precarious, with access to housing, sanitation, healthcare and drinking water far from adequate. A delegation of the State Assembly’s Standing Committee on Labour that visited four tea estates cited malnutrition as an apparent cause for the recent deaths of workers and said the State government was not doing enough to resolve the crisis. Separately, an international fact-finding mission headed by the Global Network for the Right to Food and Nutrition that visited tea gardens in West Bengal and Assam earlier this month painted a grim picture of extremely low wages driving thousands of families to hunger and malnutrition. With a majority of the labour landless, tribal migrants who have little to no other skills to help them find gainful work, the closures and unpaid wages in many estates are spurring a surge in the incidence of starvation. While West Bengal’s Labour Minister this month told legislators the government was providing jobs under the MGNREGA, medical vans and midday meals to workers at the closed tea gardens, and challenged opposition members to prove the deaths were due to starvation and not natural causes, there is a tacit admission that there is a crisis requiring the State’s intervention. The Minister’s comment that none of the death certificates show starvation as the cause of death is tragically ironic since acute hunger and dehydration leave a person too weak to work or even stir out seeking food or water as alms. The victim ultimately dies of organ failure or an opportunistic infection that the body can’t fight.
The bleak situation of these workers starkly highlights the absence of a social security net for rural workers, and specifically labour in the plantation sector. Unless governments both at the Centre and the State develop adequate mechanisms to safeguard the basic needs of non-unionised workers in vulnerable sectors such as the plantations, all efforts at labour law reform will be quite vacuous and bereft of any meaning to the key factor of economic productivity: the worker. Rising above partisan political considerations, the West Bengal government needs to act urgently to address the crisis and, if warranted, take strong legal action against the managements of tea estates that have landed their workers on the brink of starvation and death. A longer-term rehabilitation and re-skilling package is also required to help labour at the defunct estates find alternative work, and measures must be taken, separately, to rejuvenate this key employment-providing sector.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/hunger-brews-in-bengals-tea-estates/article8037582.ece
29,12,2015,Letting startups scale up,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s >announcement on Sunday that the government will unveil, in January, a comprehensive plan to help make India the world leader in startups is noteworthy. A part of the plan is to link all the IIMs and IITs, central universities and National Institutes of Technology via ‘live connectivity’. The move is expected to assist aspiring entrepreneurs plug into a network of incubators, mentors and angel investors and provide them the ambience to try out their business ideas in the real world. The startup policy is expected to, among other things, make it easier to start and exit a business, allow flexible hiring for new firms in their first three to five years, and provide incentives for financiers, especially domestic funds, as 90 per cent of startup financing currently comes from foreign venture capital funds. The government’s hopes of making India a serious contender to Silicon Valley may seem aspirational, but are also driven by the realisation that India needs many more new enterprises to create 10 million jobs for the youth entering the workforce each year. Apps and services apart, India needs startups in manufacturing, industrial design, agro-based food processing and renewable energy among some of the key sectors. Many Indian startups have made a mark this year with valuations in billions of dollars. The home-grown Flipkarts and Snapdeals have resiliently taken on the global e-tailing giant Amazon, so far. But many of these Indian success stories, more than 65 per cent of startups, have left the country to operate from places like Singapore.
This exodus is not because India doesn’t foster innovation per se. Google CEO Sundar Pichai, in fact, remarked that the constraints people work with in India inspire more creativity and make their ideas more useful for the world. Indian entrepreneurs — from the small-scale factory owners in the 1970s and 1980s to the Bombay Club barons who resisted liberalisation in the 1990s — have a history of successfully adapting their business plans to adversarial regulatory regimes. That startups blossomed in the past few years was not related to the UPA government’s policy or lack thereof. They came up despite the government. Certainly, targeted interventions for startups would help. The mandatory use of Aadhaar for registering a new micro, small or medium enterprise could, for instance, be done away with. Similarly, angel investments by domestic financiers should not be treated as taxable income in the hands of a startup. Clearances and patents should be expedited, and crowd-funding allowed. Most importantly, the labyrinth of regulations and compliances that even startups that attain scale end up being subjected to — making business sense for them to leave India — has to be addressed. It is here that the new policy must deliver. As Mr. Pichai said, the ease of doing business has improved, but it needs to get a ‘whole lot better’ for India to meet its true potential.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/letting-startups-scale-up/article8037581.ece
30,12,2015,Only for the rich?,"Sometimes, when the state is faced with a legal challenge to its policy, all it needs to impress the judiciary is to make a suitably pious claim. Kerala, a State that accounts for nearly 14 per cent of the country’s liquor consumption as well as one that boasts of 100 per cent literacy, has managed to convince the highest court in the land that its policy of restricting bars that serve liquor to five-star hotels will bring down drinking. It has successfully claimed that if liquor is made prohibitively expensive, the State’s youth would be “practically compelled to abstain from public consumption of alcohol”. The court has accepted its argument that its objective was to prohibit all public consumption of alcohol, and that the only reason it made an exception in favour of five-star hotels was in the interest of tourism. The court sees no arbitrariness or caprice in this, saying even if it appears that there may be close similarities between five-star hotels and four-star or ‘heritage’ hotels, it is the preserve of the government to differentiate between them. The judgment strikes at the root of non-discriminatory treatment under the Constitution merely on the ground that the issue involved is the business of liquor. At one point, it recognises that a right to trade in liquor exists, and that once the State permits it any restriction on it has to be reasonable. Yet, it goes on to hold that a moratorium on other categories of hotels is not arbitrary or unreasonable because the potable liquor business, given supposed public health concerns, is res extra commercium, or a “thing outside commerce.”
The reasoning behind the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold Kerala’s latest liquor policy is twofold. First, it unexceptionably roots its verdict in the rule that courts ought to be wary of interfering in policy matters. Secondly, and somewhat controversially, it accepts a discriminatory classification in favour of five-star hotels. The exception on the ground of tourism is quite curious because tourists, both foreign and domestic, are not drawn from the upper echelons of society alone. The court notes that no one is barred from upgrading their hotels to five-star grade, yet it seems to have accepted a contention by the government that it was not allowing bars in four-star hotels because three-star hotels may get themselves upgraded to four-star status! While total prohibition may be a laudable objective and one of the Directive Principles of State Policy, it is doubtful whether confining drinking to homes and private spaces by itself will bring down consumption. In a non-permissive society, it may only result in converting drinking into a covert activity, a phenomenon requiring policing and also bringing corruption in its wake. The verdict places a heavy burden on the State to rehabilitate those left unemployed by the closure of hundreds of bars, as well as to make its policy succeed. It also needs to ensure that the sweeping discretion conferred on it to differentiate between classes of licensees is not misused for any extraneous considerations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/only-for-the-rich/article8042338.ece
30,12,2015,Short-sighted hike in U.S. visa fee,"The Barack Obama administration’s decision to raise the visa fee for skilled professionals seeking temporary work in the U.S. is set to hit Indian companies in the IT sector. Nasscom, the trade association, puts the expected losses at about $400 million a year. The development comes in the run-up to the 2016 presidential elections when fear-mongering about American jobs ‘going to foreigners’ inevitably becomes part of the political rhetoric. The $1.8-trillion tax and spending bill, which authorises the doubling of the fee for certain categories of H1B and L1 visas to $4,000 and $4,500, respectively, and was signed into law by Mr. Obama, has raised concerns in India. Just as capital-surplus countries pitch for easier entry for their capital, India — with over 65 per cent of its 1.25 billion people below the age of 35 — makes the case for free labour movement. Although India has the options to take retaliatory steps or move the World Trade Organisation’s dispute settlement panel, the best course would be to amicably resolve the issue at the diplomatic level. To successfully challenge the increase before a WTO panel, India will have to prove the discriminatory nature of the fee hike on Indian firms vis-à-vis their competitors from other countries. That is challenging since some Indian IT majors such as Infosys have said the American move will not impact the sector much. Taking tit-for-tat steps would mean killing the goal of boosting bilateral trade from $100 billion today to $500 billion in the next few years.
American and Indian policymakers need to focus on the larger picture. Just as a labour-surplus India, a nation with high poverty levels (with almost 300 million people, close to the entire population of the U.S., living on $1 a day), will need to gradually ease restrictions on capital inflows, a capital-rich U.S. with a looming labour shortage (due to the growing retiree population) will have to look at removing curbs on labour mobility sooner than later. U.S. authorities and lawmakers must also realise that their own corporations trust Indian IT service providers not just for their quoted rates but for their ability to get the job done. More importantly, as a Nasscom report of September 2015 points out, India-based IT companies providing services to American businesses and other customers invested over $2 billion between 2011 and 2013, and paid $22.5 billion in taxes to the U.S. Treasury in those years; in fact, they supported more than 411,000 direct and indirect jobs in the U.S., including 300,000 held by U.S. citizens and permanent residents. In this period, over 120,000 Americans benefited from philanthropic activities by Indian IT companies, which focussed on educating more Americans in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) skills. Such contributions apart, the U.S. must absorb the larger point it often makes to others: a globalising world seeks greater interdependence, and not higher walls.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/shortsighted-hike-in-us-visa-fee/article8042339.ece
31,12,2015,A stand against reason,"Risk-taking, possible grievous injury and testing the limits of physical and mental exhaustion have always been part of competitive sport, and the resultant tension has held the imagination of participants and spectators alike. But the participants have a choice in partaking in the risk and are aware of the consequences — intended or unintended — of their actions even as they engage in the sport with adequate precautions and take steps to mitigate unnecessary risks. Jallikattu, the popular bull “taming” sport conducted every year during the “Pongal season” in Tamil Nadu, also engages young participants and spectators in a violent and irrational risk-taking endeavour, requiring the taming of a raging bull at the risk of even fatal injury. Yet the bull itself is a “silent” participant, goaded into frenzy in this “sport” and subjected deliberately to gruesome injury in the process. The rush of adrenaline, in fact, drives participants to abandon caution, and many get gored, resulting in violent injuries and even deaths. Spectators are not spared either as the temporary barricades that separate them from the bull run are mostly weak and unsteady. Jallikattu might be a popular tradition having evolved from a single man-bull combat in the past to the random spectacle that it is today, but that it is both irrational and against animal rights is beyond question.
In a judgment last year, the Supreme Court for this very reason had banned jallikattu along with bullock cart races in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, ignoring the argument for tradition and “culture”. It is unfortunate, therefore, that the Tamil Nadu government has urged the Centre to pass legislation — even through the route of promulgation of an ordinance — to amend the laws for the conduct of jallikattu. Surprisingly, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar has responded positively to this request. Traditional belief systems and customs have been invoked by proponents of jallikattu to seek revocation of the ban. Only those aspects of the customary rituals that put the well-being of participants and animals at disproportionate risk were considered in the Supreme Court decision in banning jallikattu. It would have been appropriate for the Tamil Nadu government to absorb this reasoning and explain it to rural youth who have complained about the loss of their traditional “sport”; instead, it has acceded to irrational demands and sought to have the ban overturned. Dominant political forces in the State of Tamil Nadu had, in the previous century, sought to contest irrational tradition by espousing rational values. The ideological decay and loss of fervour in promoting such values is evident in the recent plea made by the State government and the support this has received from opposition parties. The festive atmosphere during Pongal and the traditions of community bonding and competition can still be easily retained without the irrational practice of jallikattu.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-stand-against-reason/article8045947.ece
31,12,2015,Good sense on LPG subsidy,"The National Democratic Alliance government’s decision to limit the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) subsidy to those earning Rs.10 lakh or less per year is one of those rare moves that will be cheered by economists and the poor alike. The decision makes eminent sense — why should the well-to-do be subsidised? Politically, the decision will win the government a lot of points with the poor, who will hopefully be the beneficiaries of the savings made by limiting the scope of the subsidy. The more the government saves, the more it can spend on expanding the reach of LPG connections among those who currently do not have one. And given that the effect of removing this subsidy will, at current prices, mean an increase in the LPG bill of a household consuming 12 cylinders a year by just a little more than Rs.2,200, or about Rs.188 a month, it is not going to receive brickbats from that section of society either. The message is clear: if you are not going to give up your LPG subsidy on a voluntary basis, then it will soon be compulsorily taken away from you. The government’s Give It Up campaign has encouraged 57.5 lakh beneficiaries of the LPG subsidy to opt out. But that clearly is not enough, considering there are 16.35 crore LPG consumers in the country. However, the government is still opting to trust the people, with the declaration of income above Rs.10 lakh being a voluntary move at the moment. The assumption is that once the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas gets its hands on the full list of people declaring an income of above Rs.10 lakh a year from the Income Tax Department at the end of this financial year, this leeway will also be removed. (Technically, the subsidy is being removed for those who earn more than Rs.10 lakh, or whose spouse does.)
And it should, given the economic merits as well of such a move. At the moment, the government’s revised estimates show that it spent as much as Rs.2.66 lakh crore on subsidies in 2014-15. With such a large subsidy bill, it is imperative to fix the two major problems plaguing most subsidy schemes in India: leakages and mis-targeting. Leakages refer to the phenomenon where the subsidy does not reach the intended recipient due to corruption, pilferage or a variety of other causes. This has been quite successfully addressed via the government’s decision to transfer the subsidy payments directly to the recipient’s bank accounts, something made easier with the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana. The decision to limit the LPG subsidy by income groups is an attempt to address the mis-targeting problem. By doing this, the government is trying to ensure that the subsidy is only going to go to those who need it. The hope is that rather than using the resultant saving simply to shore up the budget deficit, the Centre will use it to ensure that LPG connections are provided for those who still depend on firewood and kerosene stoves.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/good-sense-on-lpg-subsidy/article8045948.ece
1,1,2016,In search of an alliance,"As it faces another poll in West Bengal, five years after the All India Trinamool Congress ended its 34-year rule, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has brainstormed on ways to revive its sagging political fortunes at its party Plenum in Kolkata, the first after 1978. The last few years have been forgettable for the party that once enjoyed considerable clout at the national level. At no point of time did it hold power in States other than West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura, but the CPI(M) was seen as a party of intellectuals and made substantive interventions on policy matters, right from influencing India’s academic discourse on history to mounting a powerful challenge to the India-U.S. nuclear deal in 2008. However, with the electoral loss in West Bengal, this stature has taken a beating. While the party insists that this Plenum is not about its Bengal poll tactics but about making its organisation fighting fit, the fact remains Bengal will have to be the starting point for the CPI(M) becoming fighting fit. The party will have to reconsider its tactics on the ground in contending with the Trinamool Congress. Even some of the CPI(M)’s staunch supporters believe that the party might suffer another defeat at the hands of Mamata Banerjee if it does not swallow pride and enter into an alliance with the Congress. The dilemma is not just ideological: whatever the nature of its relations with the Congress in Bengal, the CPI(M) will have to necessarily fight the grand old party in Kerala. The political rhetoric in Bengal will have to be very different from that in Kerala. Incidentally, both States go to elections at the same time in 2016.
Even if the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front wins in Kerala, where it appears to be ahead of a dispirited Congress right now, another loss in Bengal could put a question mark on the party’s long-term future, and seriously erode its national-level presence. The issue of alliance is not the only existential dilemma of the party in a rapidly changing political landscape. The CPI(M) seems to have lost its grip even on Bengal’s villages and its urban poor. And as the success of the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi shows, there is space for an urban politics focussed on issues of equity and welfare. The CPI(M), which has lost the support among all its traditional support bases, appears unable to break free from the old mindset of engaging with the geopolitics of the Cold War era. The promise of an egalitarian society, unaccompanied by any radical programme for change, no longer holds the same appeal. Its jargon — terms like ‘neoliberalism’, ‘imperialism’ and ‘scientific socialism’ — may also not have any resonance beyond a few campuses in India. The party will need to reinvent itself, directly speaking to the livelihood concerns and social insecurities of the working classes, the weaker sections and women. Without finding a way of intervening on issues of immediate concern to the people, the CPI(M) cannot hope to win back its core supporters — or recover its historical role of framing larger concerns about liberty and constitutionalism, a role no other party has quite the same aptitude for.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/In-search-of-an-alliance/article13973345.ece
1,1,2016,Caution on Free Basics,"‘Free’ and ‘altruism’ are words that generally have a positive ring to them. But it’s clear that social media behemoth Facebook’s Free Basics programme, which it pitches as an altruistic endeavour to provide the have-nots a bridge to the Internet for free, fails to evoke such a feel. Not without reason, though. For starters, as critics have repeatedly pointed out, there is a huge difference between being a gateway to the Internet and being a gatekeeper to the Internet, and Free Basics worryingly has all the makings of the latter. So, it does have the potential to trap subscribers in the metaphorical “walled garden”, what with the immensely popular Facebook thrown into the free mix of offerings. That the whole package is offered free hardly surprises anyone with even a little knowledge of how business models in the digital world work. Free, by the way, is a business model that delivers returns in an unconventional way. There might be many variations of it but basically it is about accumulating millions and millions of new users by offering products free, in the hope that the build-up could be milked for revenue in the years to come. That’s the same tactic many start-ups use to show “traction” while pitching to big moneyed venture capitalists.
And where do you find an unrestricted Internet economy with millions yet untapped? Yes, India. There can be very little doubt that the haves-have-nots digital divide in India is stark, and needs to be bridged as soon as possible. Credit is due to Facebook for identifying this need and bringing a sense of urgency to addressing it. Credit is also due for the way its young founder Mark Zuckerberg has fought doggedly for the idea’s acceptance. It is close to a year now since he launched Internet.org, the earlier avatar of Free Basics, in India. And during this period, there has never been a dull moment in the exchanges between the critics of Free Basics and Facebook. As it stands, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, the regulator, has asked Facebook’s Free Basics partner in India, Reliance Communications, to put the service on hold. The social media giant, showing little sign of backing off, has done all that it can (tweaked its dimensions, launched a comprehensive advertising campaign, and got its charismatic founder to pen articles) to get political and social acceptance to the idea. It’s both impressive and unsettling at the same time when one thinks about how a corporate, valued at over $300 billion, can spend so much money and effort on a controversial project that is not even avowedly a pure business venture. The problem has reached the doorsteps of policymakers. They have to not only decide the fate of services such as Free Basics but also find ways to deliver digital equality fast. For, Free Basics can’t be an excuse for the failures of the state in delivering universal access.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Caution-on-Free-Basics/article13973344.ece
2,1,2016,Mr. Kejriwal’s challenge,"Arvind Kejriwal has always projected himself against the might of the establishment to give his message a rallying edginess. He did so as an activist of the Right to Information campaign and subsequently against corruption — and unexpectedly, a year into his second stint as chief minister of Delhi, the old against-all-odds, anti-establishment manner continues to inform his style of governance. His politics, by all appearances, thrives on this. More significantly, by persisting with the David-vs-Goliath messaging, Mr. Kejriwal has framed questions of Centre-State relations and of equity and delivery of basic services in coordinates that have resonance in all of India. As Chief Minister, Mr. Kejriwal has been in constant combat with the Lieutenant Governor and the Prime Minister, an engagement that has often become too personal. But the extraordinary power-sharing in Delhi accentuates the debate on the Centre’s reluctance to cede more ground to Chief Ministers in India’s rapidly federalising polity. As Mr. Kejriwal told the The Hindu this week in an exclusive interview, characteristically combining the personal and the institutional: “I’m the quarter-sized Chief Minister of a half-State, he (PM Modi) is the ruler of the country. Why is he after me?” Mr. Modi has rewritten the prime ministerial protocol too in relation to Chief Ministers by his appearance of being in constant electoral campaign, and more substantively by his NITI Aayog-led reforms. But it is in Delhi, a Union Territory and not yet a State, that the cut and thrust of the PM-CM face-off is playing out most anecdotally.
The tussle between Mr. Kejriwal and the Centre has many parts. There is the question of who should have the last word on appointment of officers and disciplinary action. He has alleged larger destabilising design in the decision of bureaucrats to go on mass leave this week. He has taken the fight to Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley after a key bureaucrat in the Chief Minister’s office was raided by the Central Bureau of Investigation. He has grounded this combativeness with a politics of equity, promising to share civic services with Delhi’s periphery and less privileged segments. The current traffic decongestion plan — as a strategy — has had a dramatic impact in highlighting hazardous air pollution, and puts the VIPs’ exemption against an entire city’s participation. But what is of concern is that the Modi-Kejriwal face-off is affecting the city administration. In effect it denies the Chief Minister a chance to give a permanent shape to his policies or provides him an alibi to evade doing so. Either way, Mr. Modi will have to find a way to normalise the Delhi-Centre relations. For his own sake, as the asymmetry suits Mr. Kejriwal politically. But more importantly, to return the federal spirit to India’s governance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mr.-Kejriwal%E2%80%99s-challenge/article13975244.ece
2,1,2016,Revive NATGRID with safeguards,"The Central government’s decision to revive NATGRID (National Intelligence Grid) is a welcome move in the fight against terrorism, but it calls for caution and nuanced planning in the way it would be structured. According to the existing plan, NATGRID will become a secure centralised database to stream sensitive information from 21 sets of data sources such as banks, credit cards, visa, immigration and train and air travel details, as well as from various intelligence agencies. The database would be accessible to authorised persons from 11 agencies on a case-to-case basis, and only for professional investigations into suspected cases of terrorism. NATGRID was among the ambitious slew of intelligence reforms undertaken in the wake of the Mumbai attacks of November 2008. Like NATGRID, most of these proposed reforms in the security establishment have not fully materialised, yet again serving as a reminder that India’s memory is embarrassingly short.
In a data-driven, digitised world, it would be foolhardy to ignore the power of big data and its potential to provide real time tip-offs and predictive intelligence to deal with the terrorist threat. Over the last two decades or so, during which the post-Cold War chaos resulted in many violent non-state actors setting up shop, the very digital tools that terrorists use have also become great weapons to fight the ideologies of violence. Social media and other platforms have become recruitment sites and propaganda machines for terrorist groups, and formal banking channels are used as much as informal ones to transact terror funding. In those same oceans of information are trends and information that could avert terrorist strikes. However, appreciation of the power of digital databases to tackle terror must be accompanied by deep concern about their possible misuse. The Snowden files are just one pointer to the widespread misuse in recent years of surveillance capabilities to compromise individual privacy and even violate national sovereignty. Increasingly, there is also academic evidence to show that states are applying excessive force and surveillance to tackle terrorism. The NATGRID’s efforts must be placed against these realities before the government rushes into reviving it. When so much sensitive information about individuals is available on a single source, the potential for its misuse would dramatically go up. The poor track record of the Indian security and intelligence agencies on individual privacy and liberty must be kept in mind as the National Democratic Alliance government tries to nurture NATGRID, which has failed to take off despite the aggressive push by the previous United Progressive Alliance government. The overdue initiative to revive NATGRID must therefore be accompanied by action on the even longer-pending need to have effective oversight of intelligence agencies by Parliament or an eminent group.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Revive-NATGRID-with-safeguards/article13975243.ece
4,1,2016,Stay the course after Pathankot,"Within the short space of a month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government have gone through the entire cycle of India-Pakistan ties, as they have played for the past two decades ever since the two countries agreed to a composite, structured dialogue between them. There has been talks about talks, talks about terror, a brief moment of euphoria with gestures of renewing ties from the leaders, followed by an attack. While >Mr. Modi’s Lahore landing was certainly bold, it has not yet proven to be the game-changer that perhaps he too hoped it would be. Instead, the same kind of terrorist attack that has always accompanied India-Pakistan engagement hit Pathankot in the early hours of Saturday. As with similar attacks in the past, it should not surprise anyone if the terrorists came from Pakistan, and belonged to an anti-India group the Pakistani army has neatly sidestepped in its otherwise fairly successful crackdown on terrorists in the past year. Frustrated by their inability to hurt India, the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) and others have tried to retain their relevance by instead >targeting the India-Pakistan dialogue process time and again. By not calling off talks immediately after the attack, the Modi government seems to have indicated it will not allow these groups the satisfaction of achieving those aims. A sustained dialogue is the only fitting answer to terrorist groups and to their handlers inside the Pakistan establishment who wish to destabilise the peace process. In fact, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj told Parliament last month that >India would not “be provoked by saboteurs who want to stop the dialogue process in one way or another”.
Going forward, the talks process must be further insulated from the ‘veto’ of these forces. First, the foreign secretaries must move quickly to set up a timetable of meetings of all the secretaries in the two countries involved in the comprehensive dialogue. The process will receive momentum if India and Pakistan agree to a resolution on what are often called the “low-hanging fruit” of issues such as visas, confidence building measures on the Line of Control, water issues and the Sir Creek dispute. The more issues they are able to agree on, the greater their chances of addressing the single largest issue that holds back ties today, that of terrorism. On this, it is for Pakistan to show its good intentions, by acting against the JeM and LeT, both in court and on the ground in Punjab where they run extensive militias. India must stay the course it has set in the past month, including >during the National Security Adviser talks, where it has delivered its message firmly, but quietly, with no hint of the one-upmanship that can hamper engagement. These actions will pave the road that was opened by the two Prime Ministers on Christmas day, allowing them to slice through the proverbial Gordian knot on India-Pakistan ties, rather than having to disentangle the ends that constantly threaten to strangle peace in the subcontinent.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Stay-the-course-after-Pathankot/article13979269.ece
4,1,2016,Bangladesh’s Islamist challenge,"The death sentence handed out to two students last week for the > murder of a secular blogger in Bangladesh marks the first major verdict in a string of cases related to the killings of writers in the South Asian nation. Ahmed Rajib Haider, 35, was hacked to death by machete-wielding attackers in February 2013. The judge at a fast-track court found that the two students and another man were guilty of murder and convicted another five people on lesser charges. > Haider’s murder had opened a new phase of violence in Bangladesh’s contemporary history. A number of secular writers have been targeted by Islamists ever since. In 2015 alone, five writers were killed in the country. Bloggers are victims of an ongoing conflict between the country’s secular establishment and Islamist factions. The Awami League government’s decision to open a trial of the war crimes committed during the country’s 1971 liberation war did not go down well with Islamists. The conviction of some of the leaders of the opposition parties such as the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami made matters more complicated. Extremist sections are steadfastly opposed to the trial, but they lack the political capital to build a popular resistance against it. Therefore, they turned towards violent protests against the war crimes trial, which created serious law and order problems in the country.
It was against this background that right-wing fringe groups such as the > Ansarullah Bangla Team started targeting writers. The bloggers, who consistently campaigned against the war criminals and demanded their executions, invited the wrath of Islamists. The government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had initially faced criticism for not doing enough to stop violence against writers. Now, with a relatively fast conclusion of the trial of Haider’s murder case and the passing of the highest possible punishment to the convicts, the government appears to be upping the ante against the Islamists. The government’s resolve to bring the attackers to book is timely. But at the same time there are questions over the worsening security situation which allows the extremists to carry out attacks and, more important, the government’s increased reliance on the death penalty to address the Islamist threat. Dhaka’s primary challenge is to prevent any such incidents taking place again. Islamists have apparently issued a “hit list” of bloggers, threatening to kill them all. Given the recent cycle of violence, Thursday’s verdict could trigger more attacks by extremist groups. The government should not lower its guard. As regards the death penalty, it is worth noting that the > hanging of war criminals has done little in weakening Islamist politics in the country. Even in the case of bloggers murders, long prison terms would be ideal which would not only strengthen the government’s moral position in this conflict with Islamist radicals, but will also weaken the latter’s narrative that the state is waging a war against them. Bangladesh needs a comprehensive strategy to fight Islamists, because the latter’s target is not merely writers, but the country’s secular polity itself.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Bangladesh%E2%80%99s-Islamist-challenge/article13979268.ece
5,1,2016,Dress code by judicial diktat,"Seeking to preserve the ‘spiritual ambience’ in temples by prescribing a dress code for worshippers may appear to be a laudable objective. However, courts of law should be cautious about framing their own rules in the guise of passing judicial orders. A fiat from the Madurai Bench of the > Madras High Court prescribing the sort of clothing that devotees should wear while visiting temples has come into effect in Tamil Nadu from January 1. A single judge decided on November 26, 2015 that to curb the wearing of “improper clothing” by temple-goers, a dress code was “inevitable”. Even though what was before him was only a petition for permitting a folk cultural performance on the premises of a village temple, he impleaded the State Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department as a respondent and proceeded to prescribe an interim dress code straightaway. > The code, that sets down dhotis or pyjamas with upper cloth, or formal trousers and shirts, for men, and saree or half-saree with blouse, or churidars with upper cloth, for women, and any fully covered dress for children, will be in force until the State government decides on implementing a code on the lines given in the court order. The department has now decided to appeal to a Division Bench against the single judge’s order. It has rightly taken the position that the order was not in consonance with the Tamil Nadu Temple Entry Authorisation Act, 1947, which permits individual temples to frame rules relating to attire based on their own customs and traditions.
It is true that many places of worship belonging to all religions do have and enforce some sort of attire for worshippers and visitors. There are temples that insist that male devotees should be bare-bodied above the waist while inside their precincts, and many that allow only dhotis and bar trousers. However, these restrictions are framed by temple authorities based on local tradition and customs. The acceptability of the worshippers’ clothing is decided by local circumstances and ought not to be based on external decree, much less through a judicial diktat. In Tamil Nadu, tens of thousands of temples do come under the State government through the HR & CE Department, but that does not automatically mean that >a writ of mandamus can be issued by the court to the authorities without sufficient cause or any public law principle. There is nothing to show that public authorities had failed to do their duty of protecting the ambience of temples all over the State. The judge’s code may not be unduly restrictive, but it raises the question whether there is any religious rule linking dress with devotion. It is not clear why the prescription is gender-based, when some kinds of apparel — shirts and trousers, for instance — are worn by both men and women. Judicial activism undoubtedly furthers public interest, but it is equally important that it is not used to impose a particular world view on the public.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Dress-code-by-judicial-diktat/article13981102.ece
5,1,2016,Time for a national security doctrine,"By restarting dialogue with Pakistan and acting with diplomatic restraint following the Pathankot attack, the Narendra Modi government has wisely differentiated between the Pakistan government and non-state actors. The challenge thrown up by the >terrorist attack on the Pathankot air force base is to evolve India’s national security doctrine to include its response to non-state actors. While carrying on diplomatic engagement with Pakistan, India needs a firm strategy to deal with terrorist threats that are now the prime challenge to the state. Political consensus must be evolved, in a publicly transparent manner, to reflect the complex challenge facing the country, detail its thresholds, interests that would be protected at any cost and response calibration vis-à-vis armed aggression. The doctrine must be accompanied by a national security strategy that spells out the command and control structures for meeting eventualities such as terror strikes, so that last-minute goof-ups such as those >that have been evident at the Pathankot airbase are not repeated. In the absence of such a clearly articulated consensus, India’s response is qualitatively linked to the government of the day, its key leaders and their personal ability, or inability, to understand and appreciate security challenges.
The proposed security doctrine must be anchored in the foundational values of the Constitution. India enjoys Westphalian sovereignty, which grants it exclusive right to its domestic affairs and security but also comes with a huge bundle of responsibilities. India still has no written national security doctrine, and whatever is practised as the doctrine, and strategy, is vastly inadequate. The political class across the spectrum needs to come together > to define India’s permanent interests. It is time to move on from the unwritten grand >strategy of working only towards the political unity and preservation of India to a written doctrine that defines India’s role in the world and its commitment to protecting the life, liberty and interests of its people. After every terrorist attack, there are shallow attempts by the establishment to fit episodic responses into academic frameworks and proposals for security establishment reforms, but in no time things go back to default mode, until the next terrorist attack. The recurring terrorist attacks are not just a humiliation for the country but also a nightmare that is repeatedly disrupting daily routines and taking away precious lives. The very foundations of India’s security establishment need to be reformed if a robust national security doctrine is to be implemented. The intelligence agencies are cloaked in mystery, and with no credible external audit. Given the opacity of these agencies, intelligence alerts often emerge that have no credibility. In the process, >credible intelligence inputs, such as the one about Pathankot, are not treated with enough seriousness. The agencies that are to provide security cover and neutralise terrorist threats do not have a cohesive command and control structure. It varies according to who is in control in New Delhi. It is time to finally show that India can be more than a functional anarchy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Time-for-a-national-security-doctrine/article13980984.ece
6,1,2016,Bridging cricket’s credibility deficit,"The committee headed by former Chief Justice of India R.M. Lodha has not disappointed cricket fans who favour a thorough overhaul of cricket administration in the country. Under intense judicial scrutiny ever since the betting scandal hit the Indian Premier League in 2013, the Board of Control for Cricket in India has been seen by many as a cosy club of individuals who treat the various regional units as part of their personal fiefdom. The >BCCI suffered from a serious credibility deficit as cricket-lovers were convinced that the businessmen and politicians who run the cash-rich body in an opaque manner were not working entirely in the game’s interest. The Supreme Court appointed the Lodha committee last year to suggest ways to rid cricket administration of its many obvious ills, such as lack of transparency and accountability. The >panel has mooted sweeping reforms in the board’s structure and functioning. The proposed measures could radically alter the way the BCCI functions as well as vastly improve its public image and impart much-needed credibility: restricted tenures, bar on holding more than one office at a time, limits on terms, cooling-off periods between the holding of one office and another, and steps to prevent the sort of conflict of interest that was brazenly in view for many years. One significant suggestion is that government servants and ministers be kept out of cricket administration. Even if the political class as a whole is not barred, it will at least prevent influential politicians in government eyeing the spoils of office in cricket administration.
The report has two major suggestions related to public policy. One is the >radical idea of legalising betting in cricket. Betting cast a dark shadow on the IPL and led to two franchises being suspended. Many will welcome such legalisation as that will bring in an element of regulation and monitoring. Its implementation, however, will hinge on suitable local legislation across the country. The >BCCI will have to ensure strict adherence to the condition that players, managers, officials or anyone associated with cricket are not allowed to participate in betting. Another idea is that the BCCI — which the Supreme Court held last year to be a body discharging a public function — be brought under the ambit of the Right to Information Act. It does sound attractive. However, it will both require legislative change and a balancing rule that unnecessary queries are not directed towards decisions made by captains and selectors of the national and domestic teams. It is not difficult to guess that the BCCI would prefer the report to be non-binding and that it would contest some of the recommendations before the Supreme Court. A restructured cricket board and an equitable system of voting by and in all its affiliated units will surely be in the game’s interest. What ultimately matters is that cricket should not suffer because of whimsical individuals holding on to key posts in the administration and working to cover up instead of preventing unsavoury developments.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Bridging-cricket%E2%80%99s-credibility-deficit/article13982938.ece
6,1,2016,A dangerous escalation,"The execution of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, an influential Shia cleric, by Saudi Arabia has expectedly led to a flare-up of sectarian passions in West Asia. Sheikh Nimr was the most prominent religious leader of the Kingdom’s Shia minority, which has long been subjected to institutionalised segregation by the Sunni monarchy of the al-Saud family. He was the driving force behind the 2011 protests in the country’s east, inspired by Arab Spring protests elsewhere. Moreover, Sheikh Nimr was a respected cleric among the Shia community in general. He had spent years in Iran’s Shia seminaries. Tehran had repeatedly asked Riyadh to pardon him. By executing him, ignoring all those pleas, >Saudi Arabia has dangerously escalated its rivalry with Iran. Within days, the stand-off has snowballed into a full-blown diplomatic crisis with sectarian overtones. Saudi missions in Tehran and Mashhad were ransacked by protesters. In return, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Sudan have cut diplomatic relations with Iran, while the United Arab Emirates has downgraded ties.
West Asia is already witnessing sectarian conflicts. Iraq, which is torn apart on sectarian lines, is taking baby steps under the new Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, to rebuild national unity. The country witnessed a bloody phase of sectarian strife in the aftermath of the U.S. invasion. Parts of the country, including the second largest city, Mosul, are still under the control of Islamic State, which is carrying out a systematic campaign against non-Sunni religious groups. In Yemen, the Shia Houthi rebels are fighting forces loyal to a Saudi-protected government led by Sunnis. In Bahrain, the >wounds of a Shia rebellion which was crushed by a Sunni monarch with the help of the Saudis are still not healed. By executing Sheikh Nimr, Riyadh has poured oil into this sectarian fire, for which the region will have to pay a huge price. For decades, one of the main sources of instability in West Asia has been >the cold war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Though the ultimate goal of both nations has been regional supremacy, they use sectarianism as a vehicle to maximise their interests. While Riyadh has the support of Sunni monarchs and dictators in the Arab world, Iran is aligned with Iraq and Syria, besides its proxies such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. This sets the stage for a dangerous Shia-Sunni conflict across the region. Unless tensions are dialled down between these two heavyweights, there will not be peace in West Asia. Both the U.S. and Russia, allies of Saudi Arabia and Iran respectively, have called for calm. Moscow has reportedly offered to mediate between Riyadh and Tehran. The U.S. and Russia should use their influence to rein in further escalation of tensions. Unchecked, the Saudi-Iran rivalry could plunge the region, already torn apart by invasions, civil wars and terrorism, into further chaos.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-dangerous-escalation/article13982930.ece
7,1,2016,Time for questions on Pathankot,"There is much relief as quiet finally returns to Pathankot. However, the immediate questions that need to be asked are about the way the security operation was carried out from the moment a specific intelligence alert came to the Centre about the possible targeting of the Pathankot airbase. >This newspaper has already reported that by Christmas, a foreign intelligence agency had passed on a tip-off about terrorists planning to attack the base. Was that not treated with seriousness because most intelligence alerts do not mean anything? Is the response a reflection of the poor quality of general intelligence alerts? On January 1, early morning, the abducted Superintendent of Police, Salwinder Singh, reported to the local police that his vehicle had been snatched. By afternoon >, the government at the Centre had confirmation about the presence of terrorists in Pathankot. What the security establishment did from that moment raises several questions. A meeting chaired by the National Security Adviser and attended by, among others, the chiefs of the Army and the Air Force, decided to rush NSG commandos from Delhi. How did they take that decision, when it was clear that an airbase had to be protected and terrorists could be anywhere in the district? Does this reflect the poor thinking of senior members of the security establishment? Or does it hint at autocratic decision-making in New Delhi without professional participation?
Over the last few days, the government has been making a desperate effort to defend the course of action that was followed in fighting terrorists. From informal briefings in New Delhi to the formal briefing on Wednesday evening by Lt. Gen. K.J. Singh, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Command, the government has been putting up a spirited defence of the operations. Gen. Singh admitted that the first to react to the terrorists were the DSC (Defence Security Corps) and Garuds, but added that the second contact was the Army columns. >As Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar did on Tuesday, Gen. Singh claimed that there was total operational synergy, and he justified the time taken by saying that forces had to be applied sequentially, and not simultaneously, and they were also careful to avoid a hostage situation and other eventualities. However, all this does not answer the basic criticism by military veterans and security experts: despite the Pathankot airbase being at shouting distance from thousands of Army soldiers trained to deal with terrorists, why were they not even called in to provide perimeter security to the base? >What was the need to send the NSG into a military installation where the Army’s para commandos and quick reaction teams would have been more familiar with the terrain? Why was the operational command not handed over to the senior-most Army commander on the ground? The answers should not only inform decisions to hold those responsible accountable for the mis-step in operations, but also lead to an upgrade of existing protocols.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Time-for-questions-on-Pathankot/article13984770.ece
7,1,2016,Think different on infrastructure,"When the going gets tough, public investment must be stepped up to pump-prime a slow-moving economy facing uncertain headwinds of low commodity prices and faltering international trade. When the going is good, the private sector would also have a role to play, > Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said, vowing to ramp up infrastructure investments in 2016-17. Ten months ago, in his first Budget for a full financial year, Mr. Jaitley had scaled up such investment to Rs 1.25 lakh crore, two-thirds of which was earmarked for road and railway projects. In the coming year, he has indicated that the priority will be rural infrastructure as the stress in India’s villages after two bad monsoons has hit demand. This is deterring fresh private investment, with many firms still struggling with past investment plans that are stuck or have become unviable. While economists debate whether the >government should stick to its fiscal consolidation road map or scale up public expenditure to spur the economy, nobody will mind if a slightly higher fiscal deficit leads to more jobs while creating useful public assets. Low oil and commodity prices offer the chance to build more infrastructure at a far lower cost, but as Mr. Jaitley said, “We must have the intellectual honesty to analyse our shortcomings and improve them.”
So have higher allocations to infrastructure spending this year helped? Anecdotally, a few signs are positive. >Demand for bitumen, a key ingredient for building roads, has risen, as have enquiries for construction and earth-moving equipment. Paying private contractors to build highways has boosted cash flows and enabled a few to re-enter the fray for new projects. But all is not well yet. Core sector performance hit a decade’s low in November 2015. “Though public investments have started to gain traction, this is yet to reflect in the performance of investment-linked sectors,” rating agency Crisil said, as demand remains weak in end-user sectors such as real estate, with overcapacity in others. Of course, this is partly the lag effect — infrastructure projects take time to show results. Yet, an honest introspection should reveal the need to utilise public infrastructure budgets more effectively without the cost- and time-overruns associated with the government’s ‘business as usual’ approach. Take India’s largest industrial infrastructure project, >the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, set up as a special purpose vehicle to shed the legacy burdens of departmental decision-making. It’s crawling, though all the States along the corridor except Delhi are run by the BJP. Or the Project Monitoring Group under the Cabinet Secretariat tasked with resolving stalled projects, on which not much has been heard in months. Could the fact that these bodies were left without a head through most of 2015 have affected performance? Tapping the Consolidated Fund of India as well as innovative vehicles such as the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund is laudable. Perhaps, it is also time to find a few good men who can get the job done on the ground, grant them autonomy and fix accountability for outcomes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Think-different-on-infrastructure/article13984769.ece
13,1,2016,A political misadventure,"Political opportunism in an election year often takes the form of dubious actions by the executive, and inevitably runs into a judicial barrier. By staying the Union government’s >recent notification aimed at permitting jallikattu, the popular bull-taming sport in Tamil Nadu, along with bullock cart races in some other States, the Supreme Court >has stopped the Centre’s needless misadventure in its tracks. The festivities associated with the harvest festival of Pongal in Tamil Nadu went off without jallikattu in 2015 after the >Supreme Court’s May 2014 judgment prohibiting the sport on the ground that it perpetrates cruelty on animals and endangers the lives of the participants. The State government ensured peace and prevented any unrest last year, despite considerable unease and anger among the rural population. There is no reason why it could not have continued to practise the same restraint and wisdom in accepting the court verdict. On the contrary, the issue became politicised in the >run-up to the Assembly election that is due in a few months from now. Political parties stoked popular sentiment in favour of reviving jallikattu by demanding measures to circumvent the judicial bar. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party at the Centre, looking to find a foothold in the political fray in Tamil Nadu, made a calculated move by amending a 2011 notification that prevented bulls from being exhibited or trained as performing animals, by exempting bulls deployed in jallikattu and cart-racing from its purview. The party will now have to live with the criticism that it knew that the notification would be stayed, and all it was looking for was some political capital.
The Centre will have to explain why it tried to get around a court verdict through a mere executive notification, when it is common knowledge that it can be done only through legislation that removes the basis for the judgment and not merely by tweaking some regulations. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa has now >urged the Centre to promulgate an ordinance to save the traditional sport, but even that may be no solution. The law laid down by the Supreme Court is fortified by several legal formulations. In a harmonious reading of animal rights in the context of the Universal Declaration of Animal Welfare (UDAW), the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and the Constitution, the court has ruled that animals have a right against human beings inflicting unnecessary pain and suffering on them. In effect, the entire sport has been declared violative of the law against cruelty. Treating animals in a humane, non-exploitative way is now a constitutional requirement for any executive action related to them. The State’s earlier regulatory Act on jallikattu was dismissed as an anthropocentric law that was repugnant to the eco-centric law against cruelty to animals. Instead of continuing this artificial confrontation between tradition and modern law, Tamil Nadu would do well to stop spearheading the cause of jallikattu, which is but a relic of a feudal past.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-political-misadventure/article13996009.ece
13,1,2016,"Individual brilliance, derivative success","Argentine and FC Barcelona footballer Lionel Messi has reclaimed the billing as the best footballer in the world by >winning his fifth Ballon d’Or award in the last eight years, a stupendous record considering no other player has won more than three such awards. Portuguese and FC Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo finished second after having won in the previous two years. That both players have finished in the top two in the award nominations since 2011 suggests that they are the best two footballers in the world by some margin. Messi is the better player, combining the highest form of three important qualities — dribbling, passing and goal-scoring — in one footballer. Ronaldo is as much and perhaps even more a sure finisher. But having them in the Argentina and Portugal national teams is no guarantee for success. The fact that neither of them has experienced the highest form of international success for their respective countries — Messi’s >Argentina lost to Germany in the 2014 World Cup final and Ronaldo’s >Portugal reached the 2004 Euro final before the player reached his peak — suggests that their respective awards were a function of their clubs’ overall success. Messi’s Ballon d’Or, for example, followed FC Barcelona’s three victories in the >UEFA Champions League , the >Spanish La Liga and the >Copa Del Rey in 2015.
Indeed, Messi’s Barcelona and Ronaldo’s Real Madrid have dominated club football in the past few years, the former more so. These clubs have also designed their pattern and style of play in such a way that the abilities and output of their two key players and goal-scorers in Messi and Ronaldo have been maximised. Real Madrid’s strategy of buying the most attack-minded players in the world and Barcelona’s nearly two-decades-long approach of building a squad based on a particular style of play and combining home-grown and bought talent has complemented the strengths of Ronaldo and Messi, respectively. These advantages are lacking in a national set-up, where the team squads are drawn from a more limited pool and their frequency of playing and training together is limited compared to the almost perennial club football. Consequently, the individual successes and strengths of both Messi and Ronaldo have not translated into national glory. Ronaldo’s goal-scoring record for Real Madrid of 338 goals in 325 games and Messi’s 430 goals in 503 games and a record 26 trophies tower over their respective national team outputs. These numbers re-emphasise the team nature of the sport. Ronaldo must thank his colleagues Luka Modric, Sergio Ramos and Karim Benzema and others for consistently putting him in a position to deliver for his club; Messi’s success is predicated upon the cohesion of Barcelona and the brilliance of Neymar, Luis Suarez, Andres Iniesta and Gerard Pique.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Individual-brilliance-derivative-success/article13996005.ece
14,1,2016,Mixed legacy of the Obama years,"In a speech long on past achievements and short on policy promises for his final year in office, U.S. President Barack Obama delivered his seventh and > last State of the Union address to a House of Representatives chamber on Tuesday. Equally dedicating his time at the pulpit to defending his two-term record in office and to laying out a vision consistent with the liberal paradigm of the Democratic Party, Mr. Obama posed four definitive questions, the answers to which he said would determine how much progress the U.S. would make in the years ahead. First, on how the U.S. middle class finds sufficient opportunities in the new economy to secure its prosperity; second, on how the U.S. harnesses the power of technology to tackle climate change; third, what are the means to secure the safety of Americans at home and abroad without getting trapped in any military “quagmires”; and fourth, how could America's leadership foster a less hateful, less anti-minority brand of national politics? In the face of the Republican Party’s attitude of “rancour and suspicion”, Mr. Obama has deftly navigated a path forward on domestic priorities including healthcare reform, economic revival, and sustainable technologies in the energy sector. Yet his record on foreign policy is more patchy and complex. The partial realisation of the dream of America leading a multilateral world sits rather uncomfortably with notable cases of stasis and deepening conflict.
An unequivocal feather in Mr. Obama’s cap is the détente with Iran, which, on his watch, has rolled back its nuclear programme, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and helped the world step back from the brink of war. So too is the revival of formal diplomatic ties with Cuba last summer which, after more than 50 years of isolation and economic embargo, witnessed the relaxation of travel restrictions but awaits a nod from the Republican-controlled Congress before trade can be fully opened up. At the macro level, seven years since the end of Bush-era unilateralism, the adoption of multilateral, regionally focussed and hemispheric political models have certainly come into vogue under the able guidance of the Obama machine. Yet, even as multilateralism has thrived, bilateral crisis-resolution has taken a back seat. With Russia, the legitimate concerns of an important strategic player are reduced to sound bites and talking heads on U.S. news channels. Consequently in Ukraine and Syria there is often a hair-trigger situation. Washington’s China engagement was more reactive than proactive, and led to more aggressive positions in the region. The unravelling security prospects of Afghanistan and the festering Palestine-Israel conflict were inconsistently addressed over the two presidential terms. India, though, turned out to be the classic partner for Obama’s America — there was enough bilateral economic depth to keep ties strong, and the shared idiom of pluralistic democracy held the two nations together in a close but light strategic embrace.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mixed-legacy-of-the-Obama-years/article13997734.ece
14,1,2016,Incremental steps not enough,"The Defence Acquisition Council has approved a > revised Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP), aimed at boosting indigenous defence procurement and encouraging better participation from the Indian private sector. The Council is headed by Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and includes key stakeholders of the defence establishment. Among its key decisions is a proposal to introduce a new category of acquisition termed Buy Indian (or IDDM, indigenous design development and manufacturing), which would become the most preferred acquisition category. Under Buy Indian, domestically designed equipment with 40 per cent indigenous components or foreign-designed equipment with 60 per cent local components will be considered. The new DPP has significantly increased the offset threshold for foreign contracts from Rs. 300 crore to Rs. 2,000 crore (with 30 per cent of the contract value to be procured from within India), while it has certain provisions for encouraging Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. At first glance, the DPP is an incremental improvement over recent efforts to reduce India’s import dependence, which stands at 65 per cent of total defence procurement, to help create a robust military industrial complex within the country.
It is imperative that India succeeds at the earliest in creating a cutting-edge domestic military industrial base: no major nation state has transitioned to becoming a developed economy without one. Such a complex would create not only latest war machines but also hothouse innovations and technologies to improve overall scientific capabilities, and make India self-reliant at least in critical areas. If the ambition is to truly make Make in India a reality in the defence sector, then the DPP falls significantly short of expectations. Many private sector participants have been flagging a host of issues, and inbuilt biases against indigenisation. There are two key impediments to India’s private sector becoming active participants in defence R&D and production: the monopoly enjoyed by defence public sector units, and the favours that foreign suppliers enjoy. DPSUs are the workhorses of the sector as well as the biggest drag on indigenous military research. A significant number of them are merely assembling foreign kits. Given India’s over-dependence on foreign military vendors, several biases have crept in favouring them in procurements. A foreign vendor gets most of his payment on self-certification of project progress, while Indian vendors have to wait for a government inspector’s certification, which can delay payments by several months. A foreign vendor enjoys upfront customs duty exemption, while the excise duty exemption for a local supplier is a reimbursement months after he has supplied an item. The new DPP may work towards expanding the number of participants in military tenders, but it may not help dramatically improve the present environment for all participants. Going by the present trend, the $100 billion and more that India will spend over the next decade will mostly end up in foreign markets. Political boldness and radical reform are needed in defence procurement. Neither is visible in the new DPP.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Incremental-steps-not-enough/article13997482.ece
15,1,2016,Stagflation risk ahead,"The latest Index of Industrial Production data, showing a contraction in factory output in November, should set alarm bells ringing in North Block, especially when read along with the > acceleration in retail inflation. While the reasons for the slump in industrial production, including the festival holidays, were broadly known, the magnitude of overall decline as well as the drops in specific industries are cause for concern. Both basic goods and capital goods – proxies for manufacturing and investment demand – contracted 0.7 per cent and 24.4 per cent, respectively. The government’s IIP figures also come close after the Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index, where the survey revealed a drop in output in December when companies scaled back production on a decline in new orders. The gathering consensus among economists is that, save a few bright spots like automobiles and consumer durables, demand is precariously placed. Two key drivers, the overseas export markets and the rural economy, are both facing independent challenges. Global trade growth has been becalmed by > China’s slowdown and is now being roiled by the > yuan’s depreciation, while > back-to-back deficient monsoons have sapped rural consumption capacity. The economy’s momentum, thus, is threatened by the prospect of a sustained slowdown that may need to be countered urgently by corrective fiscal interventions. With the > Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based reading rising for a fifth straight month in December to 5.6 per cent, the accelerating retail inflation could end up posing a significant risk, of combining with the faltering growth to produce stagflation.
Some economists, including the Chief Economic Adviser Dr. Arvind Subramanian, have mooted the idea of the government temporarily straying from its fiscal consolidation path in order to enable it to step up spending on infrastructure to pump prime the economy, especially given the low levels of private investment. Any additional public expenditure, when coupled with the increased payouts for salaries and pensions as part of the implementation of the > Seventh Pay Commission’s recommendations and the One Rank, One Pension scheme, will in turn fuel price pressures at the retail level and could complicate the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation targeting agenda and monetary policy calculus. While > oil prices remain in free fall, offering succour, food prices continue to climb pushing food inflation to 6.4 per cent in December. And the outlook on that front is hardly reassuring, with reports that unseasonal weather conditions including an El Nino-induced milder winter could lead to the rabi crop yield ending up well below expectations in several regions. With the RBI’s bi-monthly monetary policy and the annual Central budget set to bookend February, all eyes will be on the next set of monthly IIP and inflation data to see if the price gains will plateau, as the central bank had predicted in December, or continue to trend up, and whether output growth recovers or not.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Stagflation-risk-ahead/article14000025.ece
15,1,2016,Return of terror in Indonesia,"The > multiple terror attacks in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, which left at least seven dead, mark the return of organised Islamist violence to the country after a brief period. The Southeast Asian country witnessed several terror attacks during the last decade, including the 2002 Bali bombing that killed over 200 people. Most of such attacks were carried out by the home-grown terrorist group, > Jemaah Islamiyah, which has links with al-Qaeda. An effective military campaign against the JI by the government, along with U.S.-model counter-terror strategies, helped Indonesia break up the extremist network and arrest the tide of terror strikes. But Thursday’s attack, the first major terror assault in the country in six years, has rekindled fears that extremists are regrouping themselves at a time when it is going through a tough economic phase. Indonesia has blamed Islamic State for the attack. The apparent target of the attackers was a downtown mall with outlets of Starbucks and Burger King, as well as a diplomatic quarter in Jakarta. It’s evident that the attackers wanted to inflict maximum damage, much the same way the Bali tourist hotspot was attacked. But the plan didn’t succeed, according to initial reports, as the gunmen were stopped at the mall and sent back to a police post, where they opened fire.
Though major attacks were halted after the Malaysian leader of the JI was killed in a shootout in rural Indonesia in 2009, Jakarta has stepped up security measures in recent times in the wake of growing Islamist challenges. If militants radicalised at home and trained in Afghanistan posed security challenges in 2000-09, now radicalised youth get military training in Syria and Iraq. Up to 700 Indonesians are estimated to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join Islamic State. The government has expressed concern that their return would reinforce the broken extremist networks, bringing back another phase of organised violence. There was a massive crackdown on suspected Islamists on New Year's eve. For the Islamists, Indonesia has always been a high-stakes game. Though their influence among Indonesian society is negligible and their networks were broken up by the state, the latest attacks show they still possess the capability to hit life. It is bad news for the government of President Joko Widodo, which faces the challenge of rejuvenating an economy hit by a slowdown and falling commodity prices. Mr. Widodo, who came to power in 2014, has been trying to portray Indonesia as a peaceful, stable place to attract investments to fund growth. Terror attacks would certainly make his job harder. A bigger challenge is to prevent the return of attacks along the model of the last decade. To stop Islamists making inroads into the world’s largest Muslim society, the government has to take on both the extremist organisations and the extremists’ ideas. President Widodo should not let Islamists have their way.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Return-of-terror-in-Indonesia/article14000023.ece
18,1,2016,Starting up to stand still?,"Two lakh passes were sought for the >Start Up India workshop at New Delhi’s Vigyan Bhawan with a seating capacity of 1,350, a good indicator of the interest in the action plan for start-ups unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi after a nine-hour talkathon between Silicon Valley honchos, financiers, Indian unicorns and top government officials. Amidst the euphoria, at least one Silicon Valley CEO, B.J. Arun of July Systems, warned that India was witnessing a bubble similar to the heady dot-com rush of 1999-2000 in Silicon Valley with too much money chasing too few ideas. The high demand for passes to the event is probably a sign of that growing bubble. India, Mr. Arun warned, won’t recover as easily as the U.S. did after the bubble bursts, only to be told by his Indian counterparts that there is no bubble and even if there is, the fittest would survive. That confidence is refreshing, coming from under-40 first generation entrepreneurs. The government’s action points seem laudable for starters, if not deep enough. They include Rs. 10,000 crore of funding for the next four years, tax-free and labour-inspection-free existence for start-ups for the first three years, speedier patent clearances with the exchequer footing most of the bill, and promises to fix taxation hurdles that deter domestic and global financiers from bankrolling new ventures in the coming Budget. That the government must intervene less for start-ups to succeed — Mr. Modi’s core message — drew the loudest cheers, followed by the tax breaks on start-up profits. The tax breaks fly in the face of the corporate tax reform being pursued to lower rates and phase out exemptions; but it is a headline-grabbing measure that won’t hit revenues as few start-ups would make profits in the first three years.
A bigger issue is the attempt to define the start-ups eligible for the sops, support and funding announced by the Prime Minister: firms set up in the past five years with an annual turnover below Rs. 25 crore, working ‘towards innovation, development, deployment or commercialisation of new products, processes or services driven by technology or intellectual property’. The mere act of developing products or services that do not have potential for commercialisation or have no or limited incremental value for customers would not be a start-up. Moreover, a start-up shall be eligible for tax benefits only after it is certified by an inter-ministerial board. Slotting something like innovation into a template may not click and until more details emerge, it just sounds like more red tape to clear to avoid some red tape. Smarter ventures would seek funding on their own and work without official sops, but the government must not lose sight of the need to fix India’s overall business climate. Failing that, even with tax sops, start-ups will continue to quit India and list or register elsewhere. Bubble or not, that’s one issue Indian unicorns are unanimous about.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Starting-up-to-stand-still/article14003303.ece
18,1,2016,Freedoms only for the outraged,">A comedian, Kiku Sharda, has been arrested under Section 295(A) of the Indian Penal Code for presumably “outraging” the religious sentiments of Dera Sacha Sauda adherents by mimicking their leader, >Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh. The case was filed by a Dera follower in Haryana, and the State police reached Mumbai to make the arrest. In Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, meanwhile, a court has accepted a plea by a local leader of the Hindu Mahasabha for proceedings against >actors Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan. Their misdeed: wearing shoes in a “temple” on the sets of a television show. By the standards of intolerance to creative, literary and academic work over the past two decades in India, these instances are unexceptional — and it is beside the point to iterate the commonsense distinction between reality and representation, between fact and superstition. It is a meandering but firm line that links them up with the vandalisation of the Bhandarkar Institute in Pune over a single line in a fine study of Shivaji; the intimidatory outrage that inhibits the release of films such as > Bajirao Mastani and Jodhaa Akbar which unsettle orthodox storytelling; the moral policing that forced the shooting of Water, on the treatment of Hindu widows, to be shifted out of Varanasi; and the pressure on publishers to withdraw from circulation entire books (Wendy Doniger’s The Hindus: An Alternative History) or excise chapters from compilations used as university texts (A.K. Ramanujan’s ‘Three Hundred Ramayanas’). It is the line that has also run through the murders of Govind Pansare, M.M. Kalburgi and Narendra Dabholkar.
There is no doubt that Section 295(A) of the IPC is in urgent need of amendment to limit its misuse. As is the section dealing with sedition, freely imposed by the state on >folk singers, cartoonists, students watching cricket and defiant political upstarts. But these are attendant issues of the crisis in India’s politics today. In democracies worldwide, questions of representation and liberty have been taken forward in the political sphere, and in India even more so. India’s politics, by parties of the freedom movement like the Congress but also regional parties, took the lead in increasing the space for rationalism, modernity, liberty and freedom of expression. That uncompromising cover for liberty is now giving way to pervasive political competition to frame hurt identities and nationalism for partisan advantage. And those freedoms and the modernity project have been rendered yet more fragile in the past couple of years, with many of the so-called fringe outfits that feast on communal intimidation drawing strength from their affiliation to the Sangh Parivar, and thereby to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Months after writers, academics and artists foregrounded the abnormal circumstances today, it is unfortunate that India’s politics and its legislatures have not joined the debate wholesomely. This is why it takes just a couple of outraged persons to remind the world’s largest democracy that it has lost the essential instinct for liberty.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Freedoms-only-for-the-outraged/article14003302.ece
19,1,2016,Death of a Dalit scholar,"The >suicide of Rohith Vemula, a Dalit research scholar at the University of Hyderabad, is yet another tragic testimony to the feudal passions of caste that roil India’s institutions of higher education, which are known to harbour delusions of being meritocracies. Vemula was one of five Dalit students, all belonging to the Ambedkar Students Association (ASA), who had been suspended by the administration. The ‘suspension’ order allowed them to continue their studies in the university but denied them entry to the hostels, administration building and other common places in groups. It is difficult to imagine a more blatant exhibition of social boycott than such a punitive measure, directed at a group of students from a socially disadvantaged community. That this comes from the governing elite of a central university makes it even more appalling. The ostensible reason for the suspension of Vemula and the four others was an alleged clash between students belonging to the ASA and the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), an affiliate of the right-wing Sangh Parivar. An inquiry by the university culminated in the suspension order. It was against this punitive measure that they had been protesting. On Sunday, the young scholar decided to cut short both his protest and his life. His suicide note, which was posted on social media, states categorically that no one is responsible for his act, a statement that should not be taken at face value.
The police have registered cases against Union Minister of State for Labour and Employment Bandaru Dattatreya, the University of Hyderabad Vice-Chancellor P. Appa Rao, and two ABVP activists on charges of abetment to suicide, and violation of the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Activists say the circumstances leading to Vemula’s death were sparked by a letter from Mr. Dattatreya to Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani, charging the ASA with being “extremist” and “anti-national”. Trying to make sense of a death by suicide is an onerous, and frequently futile, exercise. But Vemula’s death demands it, not least because it is a national shaming. It brings the Indian state face to face with its utter failure in addressing the social evil of caste and casteist discrimination. The Thorat Committee, constituted some years ago to investigate differential treatment of SC/ST students in just one institution, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, had come out with a damning indictment of the way Dalit students were treated. Forced into ghettoes in the hostel, discriminated against by teachers, denied access to sporting and cultural activities, SC/ST students in India’s premier educational institutions walk into an environment that’s virulently hostile to them. Not surprisingly, according to one estimate, in the last four years 18 Dalit students chose to end their lives rather than continue to battle on in these dens of caste prejudice and social exclusion. The first step toward treating the rot of caste is to acknowledge it — after Vemula’s tragic death, it would be a crime not to.

19,1,2016,A new beginning with Iran,"It was a >remarkable moment in international diplomacy. Until last year, it was unimaginable that there would be a peaceful solution to the Iranian nuclear crisis. Even when a deal was reached in July, critics continued to attack the efforts, questioning the operating challenges of the accord and Iran’s dubious nuclear record. But proving its critics wrong again, Iran quickly acted to rein in its nuclear programme. It decommissioned its enrichment centrifuges, removed the core of its heavy-water reactor and shipped out most of its low-enriched uranium stockpile — all in months. On Saturday, the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed Iran had complied with its commitments. Within hours, nuclear sanctions were removed, signalling Iran’s reintegration with the global economy. The implementation of the deal demonstrates the willingness of both the U.S. and Iran to move past their history of hostilities and begin a new future of cooperation. U.S. President Barack Obama and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani deserve credit for their visionary determination. It was not easy to effect structural changes in the thinking of their respective foreign policy establishments and chart a new course of constructive engagement. Both faced criticism at home. There were regional challenges as well, such as the steadfast opposition from Israel. Still they stuck to the path of diplomacy which brought new hopes to a region that is otherwise tormented by conflicts.
Over the past few months, >U.S.-Iran ties have substantially improved. Though both sides maintain that cooperation is limited to the nuclear deal, in actuality it is much broader. Tehran and Washington are engaged in Syria and Iraq. They share common interests in Afghanistan. The quick release of American sailors whose patrol boats drifted into Iranian waters signalled the shift in ties. The prisoner swap deal, announced just hours before the sanctions were lifted and under which Iran released four Americans and the U.S. seven Iranians, is another indicator. But the question is whether these changes are sustainable and, if so, what effects they can have on the troubled West Asian geopolitics. In Iran there appears to be a consensus on enhanced engagement with the West. Despite the anti-American public posturing, often from the hard-line quarters of the establishment, Iran’s political elite remains largely supportive of President Rouhani’s moves. But it’s not the case in the U.S., where the Republican front runners for the presidential election are highly critical of the deal. It is not clear what could happen to the Iran-U.S. détente if a Republican is elected to the White House. But if both nations overcome these challenges and sustain the momentum, it can transform the region for the better in the long run. India should take the cue from the deal. A peaceful, stable Iran is vital for its interests, particularly for energy security and connectivity. New Delhi should get Tehran on board, again.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-new-beginning-with-Iran/article14005268.ece
20,1,2016,Growing crackdown on activists,"The >audacious and unprovoked attack last week on a group of activists who held a peaceful rally in Rajasthan can only be explained in terms of the rising resentment on the part of the ruling class towards civil society organisations demanding accountability. Flagged off by social activist Aruna Roy, the Jawabdehi Yatra was aimed to spread awareness about government schemes and raise the issue of accountability in their implementation. A mob, allegedly led by >BJP legislator Kanwar Lal Meena , attacked the members of organisations such as the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sanghathan (MKSS) at Aklera in Jhalawar district, in a sign that sections of the ruling party in the State were unhappy with civil society activists entering a region falling under a Lok Sabha constituency represented by Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje in the past and by her son Dushyant Singh now, and demanding answers from the authorities. While the police have registered a case and arrested some of the assailants, it was only after video footage showing the apparent presence of Mr. Meena in the crowd was released that there is a hint that his involvement may be probed. The 100-day yatra, under the banner of the Soochana Evam Rozgar ka Adhikar Abhiyan, itself was as innocuous a programme as there could be. It merely tried to cover blocks across all the State’s districts to listen to people’s grievances and spread awareness through street-corner meetings. The Rajasthan Chief Minister would do well to heed the call for a formal inquiry into the incident, come out openly in condemning such unsavoury events, and prosecute the offenders.
It is difficult to see this incident in isolation. The Centre itself has been a poor role model, looking at the way Greenpeace India has been hounded and its registration sought to be cancelled. It is not difficult to surmise that a message is being sent out that activism should be tempered by a nuanced deference to the state’s overarching interests. Even under the previous UPA regime, >activists in Tamil Nadu opposing the Kudankulam nuclear power project faced, and continue to face, hostile treatment by various arms of the state. If bureaucratic aversion to criticism is often an adequate source of harassment and intimidation, political players too weigh in with disparaging remarks against non-governmental organisations and individual activists. Their influence is obvious in incidents as diverse as the prevention of a >Greenpeace activist from going abroad and the registration of a large number of cases against activists. In recent years, civil society has played a significant role in shaping policy. Landmark pieces of legislation — the Right to Information Act, for instance — have come about only because the government chose to involve stakeholders across the political and social spectrum and obtain their inputs and advice. Any attempt to prevent the free functioning of such organisations will amount to de-legitimising key participants and stakeholders in the country’s social, economic and political policymaking sphere.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Growing-crackdown-on-activists/article14007007.ece
20,1,2016,Lessons from a floating armoury,"The >conviction of 35 crew members of a foreign vessel for illegal possession of arms and ammunition marks the end of a trial that threw little light on what exactly the ship was doing when it was seen anchored off Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu in October 2013. Those convicted, many of them nationals of Britain, Ukraine and Estonia, besides some Indians, were sentenced by a sessions court recently to five years’ rigorous imprisonment despite a vigorous defence that their vessel, >m.v. Seaman Guard Ohio, was engaged in anti-piracy operations at sea and was looking for fuel and provisions while in distress. The Tamil Nadu Police, through the Q Branch-CID, may have obtained a conviction under the provisions of the Arms Act, but its investigation did not really determine whether the ship was engaged in something more suspicious than supplying armed manpower to merchant ships. Its charted course lay somewhere in the direction of the Maldives, but what it was doing on the eastern coast is not clear. The sentencing may be troubling for the countries involved, mainly because they may believe that their nationals were imprisoned in harsh conditions for six months and forced to stay in India while out on bail for two and a half years. Going by the detailed court verdict, neither Britain nor the other countries involved, including the U.S., to which the maritime security company owning the ship, Advanfort, belongs, nor the flag state, Sierra Leone, could really help them prove their innocence.
The court’s order is reasonably sound in legal principles. It records a finding that the ship was in Indian territorial waters; second, there was no official document to prove that the company was authorised to do its business in the U.S. or elsewhere. Its registration as a ‘utility boat’ in Sierra Leone contradicted its claim that it was a security vessel. The court ruled that no licence was produced to show that the armaments on board were legal. It rejected the defence of ‘innocent passage’ and noted that its log books did not disclose any distress. The strongest defence was that Section 45 of the Arms Act exempts arms on board a sea-going craft from prosecution if they are part of its ‘ordinary armaments’. However, the court did not agree that the huge cache of automatic and semi-automatic weapons, magazines and cartridges seized from it were part of its ‘ordinary armaments’. The matter will surely be taken on appeal to the higher courts. The case ought to be an eye-opener to all countries on the problem with private security agencies deploying floating armouries without adequate legal protection. The International Maritime Organisation has guidelines for Privately Contracted Armed Security Personnel, but what happens when these norms clash with municipal law is an issue that the global maritime industry has to ponder over. This case underscores the need for states to resolve issues arising out of a key, but weakly regulated sector.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Lessons-from-a-floating-armoury/article14007006.ece
21,1,2016,Dealing with the slowdown,"The International Monetary Fund has added to the prevailing economic gloom by cutting the global growth forecast. It now expects the > world economy to expand by 3.4 per cent in 2016. This is 0.2 percentage points below its forecast of October last year. The revision has come just as Beijing released numbers that showed China posting the slowest growth yet in 25 years. Though it reported a growth of > 6.9 per cent in 2015, the year saw turbulence in the Chinese economy, with heavy capital outflows and stock market volatility. The IMF has kept its growth forecast for China unchanged at 6.3 per cent in 2016, and the fear is that China’s economic slowdown could have a trigger effect on others. Reading the China factor in tandem with weak commodity prices, the Fund has chosen to pare its global growth forecast. The latest IMF growth numbers no doubt reflect the unfavourable ground conditions around the globe. Yet, they also underscore a sense of urgency in putting in place an action plan that would catalyse and hasten the economic recovery process. Not surprisingly, the IMF has emphasised the need for supportive measures in the near term to assist a recovery.
While ringing the slowdown alarm, the IMF, however, finds India better-placed vis-à-vis other large economies. It has kept its growth forecast for > India in 2016-17 unchanged at 7.5 per cent. Coming as it does at a time when global political and business leaders make a beeline for Davos, the IMF’s prediction could be seen to be a shot in the arm for Indian leaders to hard sell the country at the World Economic Forum. At best, it could give India a psychological edge over others. But that alone may not be sufficient to pull India to a higher growth orbit. In an inter-connected environment, global headwinds cannot be wished away. Oftentimes, there have been comparisons between India and China in the global investing community. Managing the ‘China factor’ is very crucial for India to stay its course on the growth path. Containing the spillover effects of volatility in Beijing could, however, prove a big challenge for monetary and fiscal planners in India in the coming days. Given that Indian exports have been contracting month after month, the developments on the Chinese currency front are bound to pose fresh worries for the economy. Though India is relatively better-placed, the economic slowdown is as much a concern for the country as it is for others. Even as the IMF forecast provides India a comparative edge in wooing the global investor community, it is essential for the government to coherently address the growing anxiety among domestic consumers and stem, if not fully reverse, the demand slump. The budget will provide the NDA government an opportunity to announce a plan to mitigate economic distress, especially in the farm sector, and show the political will to push job-creation as a central objective. It’s a task the government must not dodge.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Dealing-with-the-slowdown/article14010404.ece
21,1,2016,Polarisation in Malda,"On the face of it, the > violence unleashed in Malda on January 3 would appear to point to a dangerous escalation of a communal protest by an obscure group called the Anjuman Ahle Sunnatul Jamaat. The group had organised a rally to protest against remarks against Islam made by a Hindu right-wing leader in Uttar Pradesh nearly a month earlier — a mob burnt a Border Security Force (BSF) vehicle, then attacked and ransacked a police station and burnt vehicles in Kaliachak. However, a deeper inquiry suggests that the violence was the result of a law and order breakdown in the largely backward and under-developed district, which has been convulsed by agrarian distress, poverty and a political system thriving on patronage and crime. The mob had specifically targeted the police and the BSF after a crackdown on poppy cultivation and the circulation of fake currency notes, an illicit economic activity that is rampant in the area. It is clear from ground reports that the protest rally was used as a ruse to unleash violence against the police in the Kaliachak area, with crime records and poppy storage facilities being the primary targets for the looters and arsonists among the mob.
The subsequent > attempt by the Bharatiya Janata Party to give a communal colour to the violence is a sinister ploy to foment more trouble in an already troubled district. Malda has for long been a pocket borough of the Congress party. The family of the late A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury continues to wield influence and power through a client-patronage system. The Trinamool Congress had hitherto been unable to breach the Congress stronghold despite establishing hegemony in most other districts. The State government’s business-as-usual reaction to the breakdown in law and order in Malda is possibly on account of the Trinamool Congress’s expectations of deriving some electoral advantage from religious polarisation. Meanwhile, the BJP, which blatantly took recourse to dog-whistle politics in the Lok Sabha elections of 2014, managing a decent showing in West Bengal, has been unable to consolidate its position in the subsequent local body elections. With the increasing prospect of a Congress alliance with the Left Front — both the Congress and the CPI(M) leaderships in the State have signalled a preference for an electoral understanding for the coming Assembly elections — it is amply clear that tensions are being deliberately ramped up in order to polarise voters in Malda. This process is being helped by the Trinamool government’s lack of a will to curb criminality and increasing threats to law and order in West Bengal. Communal riots and deterioration of civic relations are products of cynical electoral strategies of communal and narrow-minded political outfits. It is to be hoped that the progressive social forces in Malda will work to resist the political machinations that are under way to create a communal conflagration. That they are the last hope is a searing indictment of the administration in West Bengal.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Polarisation-in-Malda/article14010403.ece
22,1,2016,Grim reminder in Charsadda,"The >attack by terrorists on Bacha Khan University in northwestern Pakistan, which left at least 21 people dead, raises serious questions about Islamabad’s anti-terror strategy. The assault demonstrates that despite a year-long enhanced counterterror offensive by the Army, >Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) retains the capacity to inflict lethal harm. The attack in Charsadda in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province (the old NWFP) comes over a year after the TTP stormed an Army school in nearby Peshawar, killing 134 children. That massacre had prompted widespread anger, forcing the Army to launch a massive crackdown on Pakistani Taliban. Pakistan lifted a moratorium on executions, detained thousands of suspected Islamist militants, and stepped up attacks on the TTP. This had fractured the Taliban organisationally, and there were fewer attacks in big cities last year. But, as the latest attack shows, the crackdown failed to neutralise the security challenges the TTP poses to the Pakistani state.
This is mainly owing to two reasons. First, Pakistan’s counterterrorism strategy is heavily reliant on its security establishment. To be sure, the army plays a vital role in any campaign against terrorist groups, but its focus would obviously be on the terrorist infrastructure. But Islamabad needs a broader, more comprehensive strategy to deal with the issue at the grassroots level. It has to identify and break up local terrorist networks, counter radical ideology, and more important, take adequate measures to address lawlessness and extreme poverty in the northwestern mountainous region, a fertile recruiting ground for jihadists. Second, Islamabad’s dual policy towards terrorism is self-defeating. Even as it fights groups such as the TTP, the Army is deeply involved with the Afghan Taliban, >the Haqqani Network and anti-India terrorist groups such as the Lashkar-e-Taiba. Using jihadists for strategic gains has been a deliberate strategy for Pakistan’s military establishment for decades. That strategy has been proven counterproductive over the years. Unfortunately, Pakistan has continued this double game for geopolitical gains. Even after the Peshawar attack, the Army’s focus was only on the TTP factions, while it kept intact its good ties with the Afghan Taliban, who control huge swathes of territory in the neighbouring country. As a result, the TTP, even if it is beaten by the Army, can retreat to Afghanistan, regroup there and move back to Pakistan to carry out strikes. Pakistan is aware of these fault lines. But it still won’t amend its strategy because it looks at the Afghan Taliban as a strategic vehicle to expand its interests in South Asia. This dual policy has weakened the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan, while making Pakistan’s own campaign against extremism ineffective. Thus Pakistan remains caught between its own growing internal security challenges and a flawed geopolitical strategy. The way forward for Islamabad is to come out of this mess and join other regional powers in a consistent fight against all forms of terrorism.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Grim-reminder-in-Charsadda/article14012165.ece
22,1,2016,Compassion on death row cases,"Death row convict >Mohammed Arif alias Ashfaq , a Pakistani national found guilty of conspiring to organise the attack on the Red Fort complex in Delhi in 2000, in which two Army soldiers and a sentry were killed, has been given one more opportunity of an oral hearing. His lawyers have been allowed by the Supreme Court to file a fresh petition seeking a review of the death sentence confirmed by the court in August 2011 so that the matter can be heard once again in open court. The court has once again demonstrated its inexhaustible capacity to deal with death penalty cases in a spirit of compassion. A September 2014 Constitution Bench judgment ruling that a 30-minute oral hearing in open court for every review petition involving the penalty is a constitutional requirement was not applicable to Ashfaq, one of the petitioners before it. This was because the limited oral hearing in death row cases was just an exception to the general rule that review petitions be decided by circulation of the papers among judges. The exception was limited to those cases in which both a review petition and a subsequent curative plea had already been rejected. In Ashfaq’s case, the court declined to review his sentence in August 2012 and the curative petition was rejected in January 2014. Chief Justice T.S. Thakur has, however, decided that he deserves a concession in order that even the slightest possibility of error may be eliminated, for he was the sole convict who did not get the benefit of the earlier verdict.
After upholding Ashfaq’s death sentence and declining to review it, obviously because there was no apparent error, is it not mere moral tokenism to afford him another oral hearing? Howsoever one may answer this question, it cannot be disputed that the Supreme Court has been dealing with cases culminating in the >death penalty in a liberal spirit in recent years. It has delivered a series of judgments widening the scope of the clemency jurisdiction. Even when constrained by an earlier judgment by another five-member Constitution Bench allowing the disposal of review petitions without an oral hearing, the Bench, in 2014, carved out an exception for death row cases alone by making oral hearing an integral part of ‘reasonable procedure’. By extending the benefit to Ashaq, a Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist found guilty of plotting and facilitating an audacious attack , the court is enhancing the value of due process. Some critics may question the wisdom of being magnanimous towards such offenders and not taking a stern stand against all forms of terrorism. This apparent conflict between the thirst for condign punishment and the twinge of conscience about sending one to the gallows will persist as long as the death penalty remains on the statute book. Until it is well and truly abolished, it is only the court that can humanise the law and procedure relating to death and mercy.

23,1,2016,The unmet health challenge,"The first set of data from the > National Family Health Survey-4 for 13 States and two Union Territories should be seen as a report card on how effectively India has used its newly created wealth to alter a dismal record of nutritional deprivation, ill-health and lost potential among its citizens, particularly women and children. Given the steady growth in real per capita GDP since the 1980s, and the progress made since Independence in overcoming severe undernourishment, enlightened policy approaches could have brought about a giant leap from 1992-93, when the first NFHS was conducted, ensuring that no child or woman was left behind in the quest for health for all. Evidently, the Indian state has not viewed the situation — even at the height of a prosperous phase of economic growth a decade ago — of 39 per cent of children under the age of five remaining underweight as constituting a national crisis. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that this failure to assume responsibility for child nutrition has left 34 per cent of children in that age group underweight today. There is also a lot of evidence to show that the deprived sections of India’s children have low weight even at birth due to the general neglect of women’s nutrition and well-being.
It is imperative that the > data coming out of NFHS-4 lead to the charting of a new policy course that makes access to nutrition and health a right for all. Asserting this right would require the strengthening of the Integrated Child Development Services scheme in all States, particularly those with a higher proportion of underweight and stunted children. In the first set of data, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh bring up the rear on these crucial metrics of child development. It deserves mention that even within the ICDS, there is a clear deficit in caring for the needs of children under three. Nutrition in the first two or three years of a child’s life has a lasting impact on her development; care given in later years, including freshly cooked meals at school, cannot undo the setback caused by neglect during this foundational phase. Other key areas requiring intervention are access to antenatal care, reduction of high levels of anaemia among women, and immunisation; it is a cause for concern that a State such as Tamil Nadu with an active public health system recorded a reduced rate of full child immunisation compared with NFHS-3 data. Overall, there is a need to assess the health of citizens more frequently than the current NFHS cycle of seven to 10 years allows. Data gathered every two or three years would help make timely policy corrections. A fuller picture of the health of urban and rural Indians will emerge later in the year when data for all States become available.

Since > Mufti Mohammad Sayeed’s death on January 7 and the subsequent imposition of Governor’s Rule in the State, his daughter Mehbooba Mufti has studiedly refused to reveal her hand. Unsurprisingly, the air is thick with talk of various scenarios. The numbers in the effectively 87-member Assembly are such that the Peoples Democratic Party’s options are seen to be many. With 27 MLAs, it could ditch the BJP’s 25 and form a government with the Congress’s 12 and a handful of Independents. The PDP could assert its centrality to the BJP’s ambition to revive its first stint in government in the State by renegotiating terms. Or it could force elections and thereby hope to reverse the perceived loss of popular support over its embrace of the BJP. Former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, whose National Conference is the PDP’s competitor in what is practically a zero-sum game in the Valley, tried this week to reinforce the impression of a party out comparison-shopping in the sombre aftermath of its patriarch’s death, when he wrote an open letter to Ms. Mufti asking her to “rise to the occasion or step back” — in other words, form a government or let the Assembly be dissolved. Ms. Mufti appears to be holding all the cards, but her dilemmas too are obvious. These range from stemming dissent in the PDP’s ranks to consolidating its traditional political space as a party that professes allegiance to New Delhi while administering the “healing touch” to the widest possible cross-section of the State’s population, including separatist supporters.
In early 2015, it had taken all of Mufti Sayeed’s stature and goodwill from his 2002-05 stint as Chief Minister to pull off the > most unexpected of coalitions, with the BJP. He had spoken of the need for the Valley to pull along with the Jammu region, where the BJP had done spectacularly well, and the PDP sought to embed the coalition in a forward-looking Agenda for the Alliance, seeking greater understanding from Delhi for the unique identity of Kashmir and enhanced funding for development. That conciliatory framework sustained pressure on many counts during the past year. One, the breakdown in the ceasefire along the border dimmed hopes of normalising ties and reviving commercial and people-to-people contacts with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Two, delivery of development funds, especially a rehabilitation package for the 2014 floods, was too long drawn out. And three, the creeping into Kashmiri public life of Hindutva issues like consumption of beef and J&K’s flag resulted in suspicion about the BJP’s political agenda, among the population and also within the PDP. These are the circumstances in which Ms. Mufti must revisit the mandate of 2014. Indeed, there is a need for her to step up, and to do so urgently. She needs to find her voice to articulate the vision that guides her in this extended moment of transition. J&K cannot afford this uncertainty to play out much longer.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Uncertainty-in-Jammu-amp-Kashmir/article14014081.ece
25,1,2016,"Alert, fair, transparent","The > arrest and detention of at least 18 people from across the country by the National Investigation Agency and the Delhi Police over the last few days for their alleged terror plans and > sympathies to the Islamic State is a stark warning that the authorities need to be on heightened alert. The Delhi Police caught four young men from Uttarakhand, while the rest have been arrested by the NIA from across India. Both groups are accused of planning to carry out major terrorist attacks. The NIA believes that the 14 men in its custody were in the process of organising a training camp to prepare for multiple > attacks against domestic and foreign targets. Officials say that both the arrested groups had been in touch with Shafi Armar alias Yusuf, who heads a terrorist group named > Ansar-ul-Tawhid that is aligned with the Islamic State and has former members of the Indian Mujahideen in its ranks. This is a clear indication that the IS is no more a danger lurking in some distant land. In fact, next-door Bangladesh has already witnessed a few > lone-wolf attacks suspected to have been carried out by IS sympathisers.
The authorities now have the challenge of identifying terrorist modules, and possible lone wolves, without allowing any attendant excesses. Real-life investigations are painstaking tasks, and the Indian agencies have often failed in due diligence on that front. Therefore it is important that the government keep a close watch to ensure that the NIA and the Delhi Police carry out transparent and professional investigations into the recent arrests. That will ensure public safety and also protect the individual liberty of those accused of terror, but pending a fair trial. Experience worldwide has shown that the perception game is practically won or lost while dealing with terrorist suspects. The investigations must be time-bound and chargesheets must be filed within a reasonable timeframe. A >quick trial is advisable — to showcase that India has an uncompromising posture against terrorism and will hand out punishments without any delay and swiftly, while protecting the constitutional rights of each of its resident. Showcasing such a balanced approach towards terrorism is also very important to send out the message to the aggrieved and those influenced by violent ideologies that Indian democracy is their best bet for a fair life. Young people drawn to various waves of violence through history have mostly been individuals harbouring a perceived strong sense of grievance against the state. Their violent activities are a response to what they believe to be injustices inflicted by the powerful. In India, there have been three distinct waves of domestic Islamist terrorism since the early 1990s. There is no better way of addressing the grave threat posed by young citizens drawn to extremist, violent ideologies than a fair, transparent and swift trial.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Alert-fair-transparent/article14017717.ece
25,1,2016,Sobering reflection from Davos,"> China’s stock market turbulence and the impact its growth slowdown is having on the > global economy were dominant themes last week at the annual > World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alpine resort of Davos. And as the four-day gathering of international finance and corporate captains, government policymakers and central bankers wound down on Saturday, the jury was still out on whether China is headed for a hard landing or is in control of its transition. That China and its fortunes have come to dominate discussions is testimony to the extent to which its companies and manufacturing industry have integrated with the rest of the world, as well as to the increased international concern over the perceived opacity of the country’s banking and financial sector’s real levels of indebtedness. This was perhaps best reflected in International Monetary Fund chief > Christine Lagarde’s exhortation that financial markets need more “clarity and certainty” about China’s management of the yuan’s exchange rate, especially with reference to the U.S. dollar. A modeling study done by Oxford Economics posits that a 10 per cent decline in the value of the Chinese currency against the dollar by the third quarter of 2016 — if accompanied by resultant competitive devaluations among emerging market peers — could roil economies and markets worldwide, with the eurozone and Japan projected to be the hardest hit. The domino effect could retard global growth by 0.2 per cent and hurt countries including the U.S., Brazil, Russia and India. Interestingly though, the same study projects that China would have little to show by way of gains from the yuan’s weakness, lending credence to the Chinese authorities’ assertions that they are not interested in engendering a scenario of competitive devaluations. Still, that second-order effects of what happens in China will be hard to hazard a guess about has already been proven by the recent volatility seen in markets worldwide. And the brave words of regulators notwithstanding, central bankers are running out of ammunition. As Reserve Bank of India > Governor Raghuram Rajan said, monetary easing may have run its course and reached the limits of efficacy as a policy tool.
The other key takeaway from this year’s meeting at Davos was showcased in Pope Francis’s admonition to the global political and economic elite to reflect on their own role in creating inequality. An Oxfam study, released ahead of the WEF meet, said the richest 1 per cent owned as much wealth as the remaining 99 per cent combined did, with the gap in wealth widening even faster than anticipated. With politicians across continents and the entire ideological spectrum, from the far-right to the far-left, focusing their rhetoric and stances on the growing rich-poor divide and seeking to tap the burgeoning discontent for electoral gains, the Pope’s call to the wealthy and powerful to act to help address the inequality lends a powerful moral edge to the issue.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Sobering-reflection-from-Davos/article14017716.ece
26,1,2016,"Grand words, but sobering reality","American President Barack Obama struck a note of strong optimism this week on his country’s bilateral engagement with India, emphasising in an >interview the steady economic and strategic convergence that has occurred between Washington and New Delhi on his watch. Indeed, Mr. Obama has held collaborative efforts with the governments of two Indian Prime Ministers, first Manmohan Singh and now Narendra Modi, to an even keel. Notwithstanding the periodic diplomatic kerfuffle or policy wrinkle, most disruptively over >Devyani Khobragade’s detention, bilateral bonhomie has held in areas as diverse as expanding trade and investment, regional and multilateral cooperation, counterterrorism coordination, military joint exercises, and most recently, policies to fight climate change. Particularly with Mr. Modi at the helm, the two countries have steadily added strategic depth to the bilateral relationship, whether on the Indian Ocean Region, >the Paris climate change agreement, trilateral exchanges with partners such as Japan, or third-country development projects such as those in the Africa region. Yet, some uncomfortable, unanswered questions remain in this space, and they pertain to terrorist attacks in India emanating from across its western border, to the paralysed civil nuclear agreement, and economic brawls that could, if unchecked, fuel spiralling hostility.
Major terrorist attacks in India — respectively in 2001 (the Parliament complex in New Delhi), 2008 (multiple targets in Mumbai) and >in 2016 (Air Force Station in Pathankot) — have opened up a chasm of suspicion between New Delhi and Washington, frustrating India’s foreign policy mandarins over Islamabad’s perceived double-game with Washington. While the U.S. President in the interview this week described the Pathankot attack as “inexcusable”, it is a travesty of justice that terror masterminds Hafiz Saeed, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi and Masood Azhar are not under arrest despite New Delhi submitting evidence of their complicity. The U.S. administration has leverage over Pakistan in the form of $13 billion in military aid under the Coalition Support Funds programme, so why only use words to chastise non-action on this front? Regarding India-U.S. civil nuclear energy cooperation, Mr. Obama expressed the hope that in the year ahead there would be deals for American companies to build new reactors; yet it is hard to see how this would materialise given the insurance conundrum stemming from India’s Nuclear Liability Law, which provides for legitimate protection in the event of a nuclear accident. Finally, a troubling question mark hangs over India, along with China, remaining outside the framework of the U.S.-driven Trans-Pacific Partnership. Exclusion from this trade framework may result in Indian firms losing market share to TPP signatories. Add to this the spate of mini-squabbles that have broken out over intellectual property rights protection and compulsory licences in India, over visa restrictions in the U.S. and a host of trade disputes that have reached the World Trade Organisation, and Mr. Obama’s comment that the bilateral relationship had “absolutely not” reached its full potential seems perfectly accurate.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Grand-words-but-sobering-reality/article14019620.ece
26,1,2016,A debate beyond ‘clicktivism’,"The consultation process set in motion by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on the > issue of differential pricing of cellular data has set off a full-scale and no-holds-barred war of words between the authority and Facebook. The spat came into the public domain last week when >TRAI released its e-mail exchanges with the social networking giant. The telecom regulator is clearly concerned about the unabashed enthusiasm demonstrated by Facebook to utilise — indeed, exploit — the consultation process to drum up support for its Free Basics product. TRAI was scathing in its criticism of Facebook’s high-intensity lobbying exercise. The regulator minced no words, and accused Facebook of converting its consultation process into a “crudely majoritarian and orchestrated opinion poll’’. Also, TRAI is convinced that the campaign by Facebook to defend its free Internet platform “is wholly misplaced” as the consultation paper is only on differential pricing for data services and not on any particular product or service. The social networking giant has been collating responses from users of its platform, and forwarding them to TRAI. Somewhere in this process, Facebook felt that somebody with access to the TRAI e-mail account had blocked the receipt of its e-mails. That accusation was enough to provoke a confrontation with TRAI. More than anything else, the stand-off between the two has brought the focus on the efficacy of the consultation process in an environment where private enterprise is increasingly gaining greater clout. Also, it raises serious questions on the lobbying practices followed to shape outcomes in a consultation process, and the potential impact on policy formulations.
>Also read: All you need to know about Differential data pricing
In the Information Age, where communication enterprises are not just controlling but also redefining the way we interact, it is imprudent and even risky to let them have a free run in setting the policy agenda. The right to do business does not automatically give them the freedom to misuse their platforms to hijack policy initiatives by swaying public opinion. By means of its action, Facebook clearly has walked into the ‘conflict of interest’ argument. In the wake of rising support for net neutrality, > Facebook launched a multi-million dollar campaign late last year to support Free Basics, a re-branded version of its internet.org. How tenable is it for an interested enterprise like Facebook to play a facilitating role in the consultation process initiated by TRAI? The ‘template response’ that it has procured from its users naturally has no articulation on the points made by TRAI. Moreover, Facebook cannot arrogate to itself the right to represent users just because they use its platform. The TRAI-Facebook face-off, unfortunately, has deflected the focus from the real issue: what kind of Internet access will suit a country like India with over a billion people? A solution must focus on providing maximum benefit to the poor.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-debate-beyond-%E2%80%98clicktivism%E2%80%99/article14019619.ece
27,1,2016,Consolidating ties with France,"Like many things French, the country’s relationship with India is an understated one. Yet, as >President François Hollande wrapped up his three-day visit to India, it would be a mistake to underestimate what the India-France relationship has come to mean over the decades, devoid though it is of the grand claims attached to India’s relations with the big world powers. Russia may be India’s oldest and biggest military supplier, the U.S. India’s newest close defence partner, and China India’s biggest trading partner, but it is >France that was India’s first strategic partner. As a result, and through the strategic dialogue institutionalised since 1998, France and India have close ties on counterterrorism. These have been given a boost by the agreement on intelligence-sharing and cooperation on investigations and judicial processes announced during the visit. In fact, Prime Minister Modi described the common threats from >“Paris to Pathankot”. On other fronts too, the relationship has held strong. Despite global recrimination over the nuclear tests in 1998, France was the first to re-start nuclear talks with India, and among the first to push nuclear trade with India in later years. While the Rafale aircraft deal has overshadowed much of the discussion on French ties in the past few days, the fact is that France began to supply India aircraft (‘Toofani’, or Dassault Ouragan fighters) as early as in 1953, and has been a consistent supplier since. And over the years, the French space agency CNES and the Indian Space Research Organisation have collaborated closely. It should therefore come as no surprise that Mr. Hollande’s marked the >fifth visit by a French leader as Chief Guest at the Republic Day parade, something Mr. Modi referred to when he said India-France relations have “cleared every test over time”.
> Also read: Be my guest: The R-Day strategy
However, the test that the two sides have not yet cleared is the one in bilateral trade. Despite 10 per cent growth in most years and more than a thousand French companies operating in India, India-France trade hovers around $8 billion, which amounts to half of India’s trade with the U.K. or Germany. A big reason for this is the impasse in India’s economic relations with the European Union, which have been hanging fire for more than a year now; France is more vulnerable here than its neighbours. Mr. Modi’s expected visit to Brussels for the EU summit in the next few weeks could clear the path for greater bilateral ties with France as well, but India must look to other ways to build on this relationship. Some of those will come from the joint ventures and partnerships envisaged during Mr. Hollande’s visit, on infrastructure such as railways, smart cities and renewable energy projects. But much more needs to come from Indian businesses engaging with France, even as the government moves on long-promised reforms to aid exporters. To quote Mr. Hollande at the CEO forum, speaking about bilateral trade: “We must go faster, much faster and even then it’s too slow.”

27,1,2016,"Politics, impropriety and President’s Rule","It is unfortunate that Arunachal Pradesh, a sensitive border State, should find itself in the throes of an artificial constitutional crisis. After seeking some clarifications from the Union government, P >resident Pranab Mukherjee has approved the imposition of Central rule. The proclamation will have to be approved by both Houses of Parliament and the validity of President’s Rule may be considered by the Supreme Court, but it is difficult not to discern a discredited political pattern behind the crisis that led to the current situation. The pattern involves dissidence within the ruling party, the opposition joining hands with the rebels, confusion over the likelihood of a floor test, and the Governor intervening in a partisan manner. It is in similar circumstances that Article 356 of the Constitution has been misused in the past. And it was in such circumstances that the Supreme Court declared in 1994 that the only place for determining whether a Chief Minister has lost or retained majority is the floor of the House. Yet, the country is still witnessing the sad spectacle of partisan politics overshadowing constitutional propriety. It is a >poor commentary on the Narendra Modi government that instead of finding ways to facilitate a floor test it has imposed President’s Rule in the midst of an ongoing hearing before a five-member Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court. The Congress in the State is also to blame because, having obviously failed to address the dissidence in its camp against Chief Minister Nabam Tuki, it appears to be avoiding a floor test as it has not sought interim orders to that effect from the court.
Undoubtedly, there is a constitutional impasse because six months have elapsed since the last time the Arunachal Pradesh Assembly met. That itself is a valid ground for Central rule. But it cannot be forgotten that events were manipulated in such a way that the divided legislature never got an opportunity to meet and test the government’s majority. The crisis was precipitated when Governor J.P. Rajkhowa advanced the session scheduled for January 14, 2016 to December 16, 2015, and fixed a motion seeking the removal of the Speaker as the first item on the agenda. In that controversial sitting at a makeshift venue, the Speaker was ‘removed’ and a ‘no-confidence motion’ adopted against the Chief Minister. The Gauhati High Court has ruled that the Governor was justified in advancing the session by acting on his own discretion if he had reason to believe that the Chief Minister and the Speaker were stalling a particular motion. The constitutional question of whether the Governor can summon the legislature on his own and whether he can send a message to the Assembly on what motion it should take up is now before the Supreme Court. An authoritative pronouncement is necessary on this question, but what must not be forgotten is that political processes followed should be rooted in norms of democracy, and not be at the mercy of any discretionary powers of constitutional functionaries.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Politics-impropriety-and-President%E2%80%99s-Rule/article14021366.ece
28,1,2016,A message in Amit Shah,"> Amit Shah’s re-election as president of the Bharatiya Janata Party for a full three-year term had probably been secured in the summer of 2014 itself. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s closest political aide, one who > crafted the campaign in Uttar Pradesh to contribute 71 of the State’s total 80 seats and ensure the BJP’s success in getting a clear majority in the Lok Sabha, he had the organisation’s support and the momentum to take over the leadership of the party from Rajnath Singh. That momentum may have been checked after the BJP’s reverses in the Delhi and > Bihar Assembly elections, but Mr. Modi’s and, by extension, Mr. Shah’s control of the party has not been. In Mr. Modi’s BJP, Mr. Shah is arguably the only claimant to the top post. It is not only that Mr. Shah’s power draws from his proximity to Mr. Modi; it is, more importantly, that Mr. Shah’s exercise of power as BJP president is seen, among the wider public and within the Sangh Parivar, to be in conjunction more with 7 Race Course Road, the prime ministerial establishment, than with 11 Ashoka Road, the party headquarters. Indeed, the perfect fit of the Mr. Modi-Mr. Shah partnership is seen in their joint messaging, with Mr. Modi playing the development-oriented patriarch and > Mr. Shah bringing up the majoritarian Hindutva mobilisation and agenda .
Mr. Shah’s first challenge will be to reverse the impression of a party unable to stare down a fast-uniting opposition, >as was seen in Bihar. The BJP faces a batch of important Assembly elections in 2016, and just about a year from now Uttar Pradesh must go to elections. That election may well bring the BJP full circle from the triumph of 2014, and its success or failure in replicating the Lok Sabha sweep in the State Assembly could set the mood for the lead-up to the 2019 general election. Mr. Shah is given to showcasing his achievement in increasing the party’s membership three-fold to more than 100 million. But the proof of success would obviously lie in electoral victories. And the BJP appears visibly lost for an effective strategy. > After the debacles in Delhi and Bihar, embarrassing for also having been fought in Mr. Modi’s name, it must decide whether to revive the practice of declaring chief ministerial candidates, and thereby surrender poster space away from the Prime Minister. More importantly, the party must take stock of the message it gives to rally its base and keep new voters interested. The softly played polarisation of 2014 under the overarching development rhetoric, had by Bihar given way to outright Hindutva mobilisation. Ministers have added their voice to communally divisive comments by Sangh rabble-rousers. In contrast, top leaders in the government and the party have remained silent on hate crimes such as the > lynching at Dadri. How Mr. Shah oversees an appraisal of the party’s message and mobilisation must be judged not only by the electoral outcome, but also by its conformity to constitutional principles.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-message-in-Amit-Shah/article14024511.ece
28,1,2016,Denmark’s absurd law on refugees,"The passage of a law by the Danish Parliament that allows the authorities to > confiscate valuables from refugees is the latest blow to those seeking asylum in Europe. Denmark’s centre-right government says the legislation is intended to cover the cost of each asylum-seeker’s treatment by the state, and bring refugees in line with unemployed Danes who also have to give up their savings before they receive welfare benefits. But the reality is starker than what the government claims. The Danish move is in line with the hawkish stand several > European governments are taking towards asylum-seekers. Earlier in the month, Switzerland started seizing valuables from refugees to help pay for their “upkeep”. Last week, Germany’s southern states, including Bavaria, adopted similar policies. Most of those seeking asylum in Europe are fleeing war, mass crimes and rapes. Some of them make perilous boat journeys across the Mediterranean to reach the shores of Europe. Some pay huge sums to people smugglers to get themselves out of their war-devastated nations. And they go to Europe seeing the relatively prosperous and secure continent as their last hope to find a place to rebuild their shattered lives. These are the people the European governments are seizing valuables from.
Yet, these moves are not surprising given the response of several European leaders to the refugee crisis. To be sure, > Europe is facing the biggest migrant crisis since the Second World War. In 2015 alone, more than 850,000 asylum-seekers landed in Greece, from where most of them moved to other European countries through the open borders. But instead of coming up with a bold pan-European plan to address the issue, the European leadership let member-states have their way. > Hungary has already sealed its boundaries to stop the entry of refugees. The Hungarian Prime Minister has, in fact, given a call to wall off Greece from the rest of Europe to prevent the movement of refugees. Several Balkan leaders have recently demanded the same. How can confiscating assets from the already vulnerable refugees and blocking them at the borders help address one of the greatest humanitarian crises of our time? How can Europe, known for its human rights-driven, combative foreign policy, treat the victims of wars as mere intruders? Besides the ethical arguments, Europe also bears some amount of direct responsibility in this crisis. Most of the refugees reaching the continent are fleeing Syria and Libya. In Syria, besides helping rebels in the civil war that has destabilised the country, European nations, particularly France and Britain, are waging a bombing campaign. In Libya, France was in the forefront of an invasion that has thrown the country into chaos. And when the people fleeing these countries reach its shores, Europe cannot just turn its back on them. Instead of building walls and seizing assets from the refugees, what Europe actually needs is an effective resettlement plan at home, while pushing for peace and stability in the war-hit countries.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Denmark%E2%80%99s-absurd-law-on-refugees/article14024721.ece
29,1,2016,Oommen Chandy must resign,"More than two years after it first broke, Kerala’s ‘solar scam’ appears to have come to a head with a vigilance court in Thrissur ordering an investigation and the registration of a first information report against Chief Minister Oommen Chandy. The immediate reaction of the Chief Minister was to dismiss demands for his resignation, but this development has obviously rocked the United Democratic Front government and further chipped away at its legitimacy. Till this week, Mr. > Chandy had remained in the scandal’s penumbra, shrugging off allegations about his personal involvement after packing off three official aides soon after they were named as alleged go-betweens in the scam. The case draws from >charges that prime accused Saritha S. Nair > and her former partner Biju Radhakrishnan had duped investors in a solar power company they had floated. They had allegedly persuaded investors to put in money by flaunting connections with the Chief Minister’s office. Police investigators have since estimated the amount thus swindled to be around Rs.6 crore. Thursday’s court order comes on a petition by an activist after Saritha Nair deposed before the judicial commission investigating the case that >she had paid a bribe of Rs.1.9 crore to the Chief Minister through an aide. Mr. >Chandy had been questioned for more than 11 hours by the commission a day earlier and he had claimed innocence, but stopped short of agreeing to a lie detector test. With an FIR ordered, the issue has now moved beyond questions and answers. For the legitimacy of the government, in deference to the post he holds, and in the interest of a fair investigation, Mr. Chandy must resign forthwith as Chief Minister.
The > leak of audio tapes wherein the voice allegedly of one of KPCC general secretaries Thampanoor Ravi was heard tutoring Saritha Nair over the telephone, asking her to ‘play safe’ in her testimony to the inquiry commission, has compounded the case against Mr. Chandy. Significantly, two of his senior Cabinet colleagues, >K.M. Mani and >K. Babu, had recently put in their papers > as Finance Minister and Excise Minister, respectively, after adverse court orders in a bar bribery scam. (The Kerala High Court has since stayed the orders in Mr. Babu’s case.) There is no space left for Mr. Chandy to try to brazen it out and resist demands for his resignation without compromising the moral and ethical dignity of the Chief Minister’s office. It is said in Mr. Chandy’s defence that previous charges of graft and sexual favours >levelled against him by Biju Radhakrishnan before the same inquiry commission did not hold up against scrutiny. Nonetheless, Thursday’s order leaves Mr. Chandy no option but to fight his case legally. By doing so politically, and perhaps by pleading his case to his party in the run-up to Assembly elections a few months from now, he would risk drawing Kerala into a constitutional crisis.
An earlier version of this editorial referred to Thampanoor Ravi as KPCC's general secretary. He is one of the general secretaries. The KPCC has 11 people designated as general secretaries of the executive committee, apart from Umanath, who is designated as general secretary.

29,1,2016,"Mounting grievances, little regulation","The >suspected suicide last week of three women students, who were monetarily exploited by the management of an ill-equipped private naturopathy and yoga college in Tamil Nadu, is a dark reminder of the absence of an effective regulatory or grievance-redress mechanism in the higher education sector. Similar tragic episodes have played out in other parts of the country as well. Yet, regulatory authorities have displayed little urgency in trying to rescue students trapped in vicious environments that put their families in financial hardship and deprive them of a meaningful academic life. There is no dearth of regulatory agencies governing colleges. A private institution can be established only after multiple clearances — ‘no objection’ and essentiality certificates from the State governments, approval from apex bodies such as the AICTE and the MCI, and affiliation from the respective regional universities. What is lacking is honest and meticulous scrutiny of an institution’s real strengths by academics, officials and experts vested with the responsibility of inspecting and certifying colleges. In a context where colleges have proliferated, regulatory agencies that lack the wherewithal to physically inspect institutions grant approval mainly based on documents submitted by them. They undertake only random on-site inspections. Many universities grant affiliation if a college fulfils even 60 per cent of the stipulated requirements. Such porous systems are exploited by unscrupulous colleges to submit fabricated records and obtain approvals. There have been numerous cases of medical and engineering colleges employing ghost faculty members, or ‘renting’ teachers, laboratory equipment, furniture and books for libraries during inspections. No concrete steps have been taken to plug the loopholes in the enforcement of regulations. A simple proposal to assign unique identification numbers to teachers of professional colleges to prevent duplication in faculty rolls has been pending for years.
In another unhealthy trend in the pre-approval stage, courts often step in in favour of colleges after regulatory agencies reject approval or universities refuse to grant affiliation citing infrastructure and academic deficiencies. This despite the Supreme Court ruling in AICTE vs. Surinder Kumar Dhawan (2009) that “the courts are neither equipped nor have the academic or technical background to substitute themselves in place of statutory professional technical bodies and take decisions in academic matters involving standards and quality of technical education.” Post-approval, there is no enabling environment to encourage students to raise grievances relating to over-charging and academic deprivation. Universities and many State governments have conveniently adopted a hands-off approach, leaving students in irredeemable distress. Such a lackadaisical approach to regulating higher education is equally responsible for colleges producing unemployable graduates. What is needed is not only the strengthening of regulatory systems but also the appointment of academicians with uncompromising integrity to head regulatory bodies and universities.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mounting-grievances-little-regulation/article14024748.ece
30,1,2016,The trouble with spectrum pricing,"The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s latest recommendation on the r >eserve price for the auction of the 700 MHz wireless spectrum could be a case where the pricing of a public asset may end up having the exact opposite effect: making a scarce resource so expensive that its meaningful utilisation is compromised, and thus rendered unavailable to serve the larger public good. That the telecom regulator, which has been in the vanguard of trying to spur both government and industry to become more responsive to the larger public interest, should have opted to set such a high valuation benchmark is a touch ironic. About 14 months ago, TRAI had, in a missive to the Department of Telecommunications, spelt out the rationale behind its recommendations on valuation and reserve price of spectrum. While the specific backdrop of that particular communication was the likelihood of the government opting to hold a supply-constrained auction, the broader arguments it made then remain as germane. The regulator had pointed out that a very high per unit price realisation, while possibly helping meet immediate fiscal needs, would only bleed the industry of resources. The high price of spectrum would also affect private investment in network expansion and infrastructure. The financial viability of the industry, TRAI posited, was crucial both for its own health and for the government to earn recurring revenues. All these issues are still relevant, as underscored partly by Bharti Airtel’s recent results. The company has reported its first quarterly profit decline in two years, largely on account of higher spectrum amortisation expenses.
It is no one’s contention that the telecom regulator had not approached the task at hand with full transparency and openness in its quest to arrive at meaningful valuations for seven frequency bands. A consultation paper that sought comments from all stakeholders was followed by an open house discussion. TRAI spelt out the points made by varied participants, including many from the industry who argued against an auction of the 700 MHz airwaves at a time when the network and device ecosystem is not sufficiently developed. Still, considering the performance efficiency of the particular spectrum band and its utility in improving and expanding high-speed wireless broadband services across rural areas, the regulator recommended that the government put on the block the available frequencies in this spectrum at the next auction. It is in plumping for its own April 2012 formulation of four times the reserve price of the 1800 MHz spectrum that TRAI appears to have made a less-than-appropriate choice. This is particularly so as spectrum sharing and trading have been operationalised in the intervening period, boosting overall supply. The regulator’s recommendation, for almost Rs.11,500 crore per MHz, if accepted, holds risks for an industry that serves a crucial socio-economic objective.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-trouble-with-spectrum-pricing/article14026848.ece
30,1,2016,Giving cities the smart edge,"The Central government’s framework for >20 cities to become ‘smart’ over a five-year period can cover new ground if it makes intelligent use of information technology to deliver better civic services. Rapid and poorly regulated urbanisation has overwhelmed urban governments, rendering them >incapable of providing even basic services such as clean water, sewerage, pedestrian-friendly roads, public transport, uninterrupted power, street lighting, parks and recreational spaces. So weak and uncoordinated is governance that commercial entities have wilfully violated building regulations and put up unauthorised structures — with severe impact on congestion, air quality and flood management — and governments have gladly regularised the violations later. The >smart city plan now proposes to intervene and bring some order by upgrading the physical infrastructure in select enclaves, and incentivising the use of information and communication technologies. Urban Development Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu has come up with a generalised definition of a smart Indian city as one that “enables a decent life to the citizens, and green and sustainable environment, besides enabling adoption of smart solutions”, but the exercise should lead to measurable outcomes.
> Also read: What are Smart cities?
The first batch of smart cities would create virtually new business districts in several cities, marking a departure from the disaggregated urban development witnessed over the past few decades. This area-based development approach makes it imperative that the resulting demand for mobility to and from the ‘smart’ area be made an integral part of the plan, with an emphasis on walkability, use of non-motorised transport and access to public transport. Ahmedabad and Bhubaneswar have shown high ambition by opting for a common travel card. Others such as Indore, Davangere and Belagavi plan Intelligent Transport Solutions, something that has been unattainable for even a big metro such as Chennai. Although it enjoys high visibility, the >smart city programme is merely a framework for urban development aided by the Centre with a small initial seed fund of Rs.500 crore, while additional finances have to come from public-private partnerships and local revenue. State governments, including those left out of the first list, could unlock the potential of all cities with development policies that aim at structural change. Improved public transport, for instance, has an immediate positive impact on the local economy. Technologies such as GPS to inform passengers in real time on their mobile phones, and common ticketing, increase the efficiency of transport use. Universal design in public buildings and streets would help all people, including those with disabilities. The challenge for Smart Cities 1.0 is to provide proof of concept quickly and make outcomes sustainable. Care also needs to be taken that the effect is not to create gated communities of best practices and civic upgrade in a wider landscape of urban distress. It is crucial that these urban enclaves cater to the housing, health, education and recreation needs of a wide cross section of society, and that the convergence of the Smart Cities programme with existing urban renewal projects countrywide be smooth.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Giving-cities-the-smart-edge/article14026847.ece
31,1,2016,Betting big on big data,"Science, as in other fields, is not buzzword-free and one such word doing the rounds is “Big Data”. Just how big is “big”? And is there any use of spending money and producing a large amount of data in India when the West is already pumping so much data into public databases?
In the context of science, big data refers to the explosion of data now available as a result of modern, large scientific experiments and how it far exceeds what has been traditionally available. For example, the amount of data produced from analysing the network of genes — or genomes — from bacteria, plants, viruses, vegetables and animals in the last five years exceeds all such data from the fields of life sciences/biomedical research in the last five decades. It is estimated that by 2025, exabytes (10 bytes) or the equivalent of about 300 million full-length ‘Star Wars’ of genomics data will be produced globally and will far exceed that from Twitter and YouTube.
Moreover, the genomics data being produced roughly doubles every year and will require new solutions in precision and accuracy for storage, analysis, sharing and security. All this is of relevance to every citizen in India and not just computer geeks because it is such data that will help find cures to vexing human diseases.
Disease study

A study published last week in the journal Science Translational Medicine has reported the use of big data to untangle a lethal class of diseases called prion diseases. They were previously known to have been caused by PRNP, an errant gene, and it was thought that having even one of the known 63 variants of the gene would lead to the fatal disease. Thanks to cooperation from all involved — scientists from multiple countries who shared the data on prion disease genetics and study participants who agreed on sharing data from a large database and patients — researchers combed through the genomes of nearly 63,000 people and found that only four variants were pathogenic, three completely harmless and no more than 10 per cent likely to cause disease. A killer disease had suddenly become much less fearsome and, through it, new ideas have opened up on finding a cure.
There are lessons from this for India. It can begin by predicting global outbreaks of infectious diseases such as dengue fever and malaria using customised models and an open-source framework. Big data can identify the cases of dengue fever or malaria cases on a map and predict the spread of disease by overlaying the disease map with that of the movement of people. India will soon have the second-largest smartphone market in the world. Therefore, by using mobile phone data analytics and real time movement of infected people, it is possible to pinpoint sources of infection and predict areas of transmission.
Before doing this and going on to more ambitious targets such as curing diseases, a crucial step is to also learn from international efforts in large data generation and sharing by building proper infrastructure at multiple levels. To find cures for rare diseases and others such as cancer and heart diseases, we need to generate a large amount of genomics data, best done by building consortia on normal and different diseases and making data available openly without compromising patient privacy. In this, we can leverage best practices already existing in the country, such as in sectors like information technology, high-energy physics and astronomy, in building smart analysis, visualisation and interpretation platforms for big data. Generating big data is necessary but will not be sufficient to solve societal problems unless it is available openly without compromising patient privacy and ethical standards. Therefore, a comprehensive national big data policy framework is needed for analytical and other solutions towards data storage, analyses, interpretation, archiving, sharing, distribution and collaboration.
Making all scientific data open, free and readily accessible without compromising privacy and ethics will be the right step. Placing data in the hands of more than 500 million young Indians will help usher in the next phase of science-driven innovation in India.

31,1,2016,Masculinity is in a crisis. Here’s ‘Y’,"Manhood may have received its nastiest blow yet. Biology textbooks have long informed us that the ‘Y ‘chromosome, present only in males, is critical for reproduction. But a study by researchers at the University of Hawaii (UoH) has shown that healthy mice can be made, using assisted reproduction techniques, without any of the all-important ‘Y’ chromosome genes. Normally a person gets 23 chromosomes —the repository of our DNA — from each parent; 22 of the pairs are called autosomes and the ‘X’ and ‘Y’ are called sex chromosomes. The ‘Y’ chromosome is present in males, who have one ‘X’ and one ‘Y’ chromosome, while females have two ‘X’ chromosomes.
The diminution of man started two years ago after the research team, led by Monika A. Ward, UoH, showed that of the many genes of the ‘Y’ chromosome, only two — ‘Sry’ and ‘Eif2s3y’ — were needed for male mice to sire offspring with assisted fertilisation. Now, the same team, with a collaborating researcher from France, Michael Mitchell [French National Institute of Health and Medical Research] (INSERM, Marseille), upped that and produced males completely devoid of the entire ‘Y’ chromosome.
In last Friday’s edition of the journal Science, Ms. Ward and her colleagues describe the production of these gender-bending mice by detailing how they first replaced the first gene ‘Sry’ with one from the autosome and the other with a gene from the ‘X’ chromosome. While one may quibble that the ‘X’ chromosome used was from the male, there’s been related research showing that the days of the ‘Y’ chromosome are numbered. Both the ‘X’ and ‘Y’ chromosomes are known to lose genes over time and due to the frenetic shuffling of evolution. However, women — by virtue of having two ‘X’s — were somehow able to swap and maintain their genes among themselves. The ‘Y’ — unpaired and solitary in the male — does not get a chance to replenish its genes as much. Also, there are far fewer genes on the ‘Y’ chromosome than on the ‘X’. Jennifer Graves at the Australian National University caused consternation earlier this decade when she estimated that within five million years, the ‘Y’ chromosome, and the men it produces, would disappear. More ominous was genetics professor Bryan Sykes who predicted the demise of the ‘Y’ chromosome, and of men, in as little as 1,00,000 years in his 2003 book Adam’s Curse: A Future without Men.
Not so grave

A flurry of studies that have since looked at the proclamations of Prof. Sykes and Prof. Graves more closely have now found that the future isn’t as dire. The loss of genes, apparently, isn’t a steady loss and there are long periods of stability followed by bursts of attrition.
Jennifer Hughes and her colleagues at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, compared the human ‘Y’ chromosome with that of the ‘Y’ from the chimpanzee — supposed to have diverged atleast 4 million years ago from the line that begat humans — and also with that of the rhesus monkey which diverged from humans 25 million years ago. They reported in the journal Nature in 2012 that human chromosomes had lost no further genes in the last six million years, and only one in the last 25 million years. “The ‘Y’ is not going anywhere and gene loss has probably come to a halt,” Dr. Hughes told the BBC.
While masculinity can breathe easy, Dr. Ward’s studies may provide new lines of investigation for male infertility. Though these results only hold for mice and there are formidable ethical barriers to be negotiated, one thing is incontrovertible by now: it simply isn’t raining men anymore.

31,1,2016,Sugar tax may be the bitter pill to cut obesity,"After years of waiting, the World Health Organisation (WHO) finally took a stand on January 25 and urged governments to levy taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages to end childhood obesity. The recommendation was based on a new report commissioned by it. “The Commission believes that there is sufficient rationale to warrant the introduction of an effective tax on sugar-sweetened beverages,” the report notes.
Besides levying taxes, the WHO also recommends a host of other interventions such as increasing the amount of physical activity and improving access to health food.
The impact of taxation measures on purchasing behaviours has been well documented in the case of tobacco. However, in the case of sugar-rich drinks, the WHO acknowledged that strong evidence on the benefits is lacking but underlined that evidence will become available once countries that have been levying such taxes on unhealthy foods and sugar-laden drinks “monitor their progress”.
Hungary, France, Finland and Mexico are among the many countries that have taken to such measures. A tax of €1 for a container has been levied in France since January 2012 to combat rising obesity and raise funds. Thirty-four U.S. States and the District of Columbia have food taxes that affect sugar-sweetened drinks; 23 States levy taxes targeting these drinks.
Mexico, which has one of the highest prevalence rates for overweight and obesity in the world at over 33 per cent in the age bracket of 2-18 and around 70 per cent for adults, has demonstrated that significant reduction in consumption can be achieved through taxation. Excise tax of 1 peso per litre on sugar-sweetened drinks and ad valorem tax of 8 per cent on energy-dense foods have been in place in the country since January 1, 2014. During the first year of taxation, a 6 per cent drop in average volume of unhealthy drinks purchased was recorded. The reduction was greatest among households that belonged to the lowest socio-economic stratum, notes a paper published in January 2016 in the journal The BMJ. An earlier study of November 2013, published in the journal BMC Public Health, also reported that an increase in the price of sugar-laden drinks was directly associated with reduced consumption in Mexico, Brazil, France, and a few States in the U.S.
While the risks of childhood obesity are greatest in lower socio-economic groups in the high-income countries, data from Brazil and Mexico, which are largely middle-income countries, confirm that levying taxes on sugar-rich drinks achieves the desired results in the target population.
The situation at home

In the case of India, at the current rate of sales of sugar-sweetened drinks, a 20 per cent increase in taxes will reduce overweight/obesity by 3 per cent (11.2 million cases) and diabetes by 1.6 per cent (4,00,000 cases) between 2014 and 2023, a January 2014 modelling study published in the journal PLOS ONE said.
One of the reasons for the WHO recommending taxation measures to rein in consumption of unhealthy food is the burgeoning number of overweight and obese children younger than five years. In 2014, 41 million children in this age group were either overweight or obese across the world.
India may be one of the biggest contributors to the global pool as obesity in people in the age group of 15-49 has increased steeply during the last few years, as the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 2014-2015 reveals.
In 11 of the 13 States where surveys were conducted in 2005-2006 and 2014-2015, the percentage of men and women with obesity (body mass index or BMI 25 kg/m2) had increased sharply. Surprisingly, except in a few States such as Bihar, Meghalaya and Tripura, obesity has increased modestly among women but doubled or more than doubled in men in all the States between 2005-2006 and 2014-2015.
However, nationally accurate estimates of childhood obesity in India are not available. According to a study published in the journal The BMJ last year, prevalence of childhood obesity is between 5 and 14 per cent. The prevalence of overweight children under five years in India is less than 5 per cent, the WHO notes; this will still be big in absolute numbers.
A comprehensive national nutrition survey to be undertaken by UNICEF from March this year will cover children in the age group of 0-19 across all 29 States. This will provide the much-needed data that can guide the government in framing policy guidelines. Meanwhile, all stakeholders need to use the growth charts revised last year by the Indian Academy of Paediatrics for 5- to 18-year-old children to define overweight and obesity (BMI of 23 and 27 respectively).
India faces a double whammy of obesity and underweight/wasted children. Though with respect to the last NHFS survey the percentage of underweight children has reduced this time, it is still very high — from nearly 14 per cent in Sikkim to nearly 44 per cent in Bihar. This is a big concern as children who were born with low birth weight are at a greater risk of becoming overweight and obese when they consume energy-rich diets and have a sedentary lifestyle.
This singularly must be the reason why India should seriously consider introducing additional taxes on sugar-laden dinks, besides encouraging more physical activity in schools and other interventions.
