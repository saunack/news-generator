2,4,2012,An all too familiar first,"Even the unprecedented can be unsurprising. For the first time, the Election Commission of India has been forced to countermand an election to the Rajya Sabha: in Jharkhand, following “incidents of horse-trading” and attempts to influence the electors — Members of the Legislative Assembly — by offering cash for votes. Until now, the bribing of electors has never been a visible factor in elections to the Upper House of Parliament, unlike in Lok Sabha or Assembly elections, where the poll process is routinely suspended as candidates come up with different ways of luring or pressuring voters. However, the seizure of Rs.2.15 crore in cash from a car belonging to the brother of an independent candidate in the Rajya Sabha election from Jharkhand could not have come as a total shocker. The surprise, actually, was in the seizure, not in the attempt to bribe. When the candidates are few and the electorate is small, as is always the case in Rajya Sabha elections, malpractices normally escape public attention. Jharkhand certainly was not the first instance of moneybags seeking easy entry into the Rajya Sabha. Industrialists and businessmen have always found a way to enter the Upper House. The preferred mode of operation, however, is striking a deal with top party leaders, not individual MLAs. In recent times, several industrialists or their representatives and lobbyists have entered the Rajya Sabha through this door with little or no affiliation to the party that supported them. Once elected, these MPs are under no obligation to their electors, and further their own personal or business agenda in Parliament.
The Jharkhand case, however, has its peculiarities. Two seats were at stake in the Rajya Sabha election, but no party was in a position to win even one without the help of others. With five candidates, including two independents, in the fray, the field was wide open for a dark horse. The Bharatiya Janata Party at first announced its support for a Non-Resident Indian businessman, but backtracked following criticism. It later talked of abstaining from the vote, but finally announced support for its ally, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha. In such circumstances, the two independents, both with considerable financial clout, must have fancied their chances, and lobbied hard with the MLAs. The EC did the right thing in countermanding the election after the cash seizure as the situation was getting murkier by the hour. But unless it is able to prove wrongdoing by some of the candidates, and then disqualify them, the same set of circumstances will be repeated when the elections are held again.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-all-too-familiar-first/article3269583.ece
2,4,2012,Licensed to kill,"That tobacco products are singularly responsible for a large number of cancer deaths in adults has once again become strikingly clear. According to a paper published recently in The Lancet, in India, tobacco-related cancers were found in 2010 to be responsible for some 1,20,000 deaths — 84,000 in men, and 36,000 in women — among adults aged 30 to 69. That tobacco-related cancers constitute about 30 per cent of the total mortality (3,95,000) from all cancers in the same age group is proof of the lethal effects of tobacco products. Oral cancer was found to cause more than twice as many deaths as lung cancers. The reasons are not difficult to find. According to the 2009-2010 global adult tobacco survey, 170 million Indians chewed tobacco, and 120 million smoked. While a majority of rural women chewed tobacco, many men in urban and rural areas chose to chew and smoke. Tobacco that remains in close contact with the sensitive mucous membrane of the oral cavity for extended periods is a potent and lethal carcinogen. What makes tobacco use all the more dangerous is that besides causing organ-specific cancers, it increases the risk of death from other medical causes. In urban areas, smoking-related deaths are more from heart attacks, while tuberculosis and respiratory diseases are the main causes in the rural areas. With smoking accounting for five per cent deaths among women and 20 per cent among men, a 2008 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine estimated about one million deaths in 2010 in the 30 to 69 age group.
Evidence from elsewhere paints an equally compelling picture. We know from a study that the mortality rate from lung cancer in 2009 in the American State of Utah was nearly 75 per cent lower than Kentucky. The reason: the prevalence of smoking in Utah was 10 per cent compared with 25 per cent in Kentucky. The single-minded pursuit of governments around the world should, therefore, be to reduce tobacco consumption through all means. The most effective way is to ramp up taxes. France has shown the way by tripling taxes between 1990 and 2005 and halving consumption. Using powerful pictorial warnings, as in many other countries, rather than the currently used ineffectual ones, and rotating them every year instead of once in two years, is yet another means. Maximum gain can be achieved by resorting to both these measures simultaneously. The government showed great eagerness to introduce into the national immunisation programme the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, the most common cancer among women in 2010. Sadly, it seems to lack the gumption to clamp down on killer tobacco products. Will the latest research results stir it into action?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/licensed-to-kill/article3269584.ece
3,4,2012,A scandal and a cover-up,"If the viewing of pornography by three prominent Bharatiya Janata Party Ministers during a session of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly on February 7 was not scandal enough, the report of the committee set up to investigate the incident is a disgraceful cover-up. Following public outrage at TV footage of the three poring over obscene videos during a discussion on drought, the Ministers resigned from the Cabinet and were suspended from the House. The House committee set up by the Speaker — and boycotted by a dissatisfied Opposition — placed its report before the Assembly on March 30, the last day of the budget session. The report is a model of obfuscation and disingenuous reasoning that unquestioningly accepts the weak clarifications made by the three BJP leaders, while overlooking the compelling evidence of the original videographic material. C.C. Patil, then Minister for Women and Child Welfare, known for his public admonishments of women who are sartorially “indecent,” claimed he was in discussion with Laxman Savadi on a district matter, when he saw the latter holding a mobile handset. Like a responsible legislator, he took the device from him and switched it off. The Committee has recommended his exoneration. Krishna Palemar claimed to have “accidentally” brought his mobile to the House and placed it on his desk. Mr. Savadi could therefore not have been using Mr. Palemar's mobile phone, the Committee reasoned, and recommended Mr. Palemar's exoneration too.
Mr. Savadi's dissembling was hard to endorse, even by a committee willing to be persuaded. While some obscene images could have popped up while browsing, he was actually concentrating on reading a government order, he explained. The committee accepted this, and concluded he did not watch the images “deliberately.” However, as he had “whole-heartedly” apologised, and promised not to carry his mobile to the House again, the committee recommended that he be let off with an admonishment. Having let off the errant Ministers, the Committee then trained its guns on the messenger. The TV channels that captured the sordid episode were upbraided for recording “other things” rather than the House proceedings. A channel that ran “separately and repeatedly” the original images downloaded from the internet was criticised. The telecast of the damning visuals violated the dignity of the Assembly, the committee concluded, and recommended that only government broadcasters be allowed to record House proceedings. For the scam-and-faction-riven BJP government, this sorry fig leaf to cover up yet another scandal will only deepen the existential crisis it is already so deeply mired in.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-scandal-and-a-coverup/article3273968.ece
3,4,2012,For equality all the way,"The Marriage Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2010, redrafted on the basis of the recommendations of a parliamentary standing committee, has been cleared by the Union Cabinet. Its highlight, no doubt, is the provision to include “irretrievable breakdown” as a ground for the grant of divorce. This conforms to recommendations made repeatedly by the Law Commission of India and the higher judiciary to enable couples to end already extinguished relationships without further fuss and bad blood, in no-fault mode. A new provision to give adopted children of divorced couples rights on a par with biological offspring is also a step in the right direction. However, the provision to allow a woman a share in her husband's property, in itself a progressive step in line with international trends, does not go far enough. The share a woman is entitled to from her husband's property acquired during the period of the marriage is to be decided by the court on a case-by-case basis, also taking into account the woman's financial state. There are too many caveats here, and leaving the question to judicial discretion and interpretation will only add to acrimony over property. Instead, clear procedures need to be set down to make the process less potentially arbitrary and painful. As it is envisaged, the provision is unlikely to prove an effective legal mechanism for a fair and equitable division of property.
Coincidentally, in February, the Planning Commission's Working Group on Women's Agency and Empowerment proposed a Right to Marital Property Act. That right aims to give separated or divorced women an equal share in property, with the onus of proving a husband's income resting on him rather than on the wife — as is the case in the current scheme of things. In Maharashtra, meanwhile, a Married Women (Property Co-ownership) Equality Bill is being discussed actively. It is meant to ensure equal rights for women in their husband's acquired property, especially in cases of divorce. Goa already has such a law, put in place by the erstwhile Portuguese rulers: when a couple in Goa divorces, half of the husband's property goes to the wife, without any questions asked. Indeed, much of the world has what is called the community property law, a regime that is based on the principle that property acquired after marriage and before actual separation (but for gifts or inheritance) is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment or death. Such joint ownership recognises the theoretically equal contributions of both spouses in the making and the functioning of a family entity. There is one question that, however, remains to be debated further. Should the regime not be made gender-neutral, cutting both ways?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/for-equality-all-the-way/article3273970.ece
4,4,2012,Don't miss this opportunity,"If Asif Ali Zardari's visit this Sunday — the first by a democratic leader of Pakistan since Zulfikar Ali Bhutto travelled to Simla in 1972 — is an indication of the opportunities that lie ahead on the bilateral front, the $10 million price placed by the U.S. on Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Saeed's head is a reminder of the enormous challenges still remaining. For New Delhi, wisdom lies in not allowing national exultation over the American bounty to colour its expectations of this private — but significant — presidential visit. Hafiz Saeed is as much an enemy of India as he is of democracy in Pakistan and there is little point in reminding Mr. Zardari of his powerlessness in the face of the Lashkar chief's uniformed patrons. Despite the evident tension which exists between the civilian, judicial and military elements that make up the Pakistani state, there is no denying the new ease in relations with India. The dialogue which was suspended after the Mumbai attacks of 2008 has resumed and is producing results. Domestic detractors accuse the Pakistan People's Party government of all manner of sins, including that of being too “pro-India,” but that hasn't stopped it from taking the bold step of freeing bilateral trade from the Kashmir issue. And now, Mr. Zardari has decided to visit India, a risky step for any Pakistani civilian leader, but particularly so for one as unpopular as him.
The last time he met Manmohan Singh was in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg in June 2009, where the Prime Minister publicly talked down to him about the Mumbai incident. The two are unlikely to reminisce about that encounter. More likely, Mr. Zardari will reiterate a long standing invitation to Dr. Singh to visit Pakistan. He must make that visit soon. The Prime Minister should also spare a thought for an 81-year-old Pakistani man languishing in Ajmer jail after being sentenced to life imprisonment in a 1992 murder case. Khalil Chisty maintains he was a bystander in the group clash in which one man died of gunshot injuries. The Rajasthan High Court suspended the sentences of three others who were convicted with him. Only Dr. Chisty's appeal for suspension was turned down. The judge said “no leniency” should be shown as he was a Pakistani and that an example should be made of him. As Mr. Zardari undertakes a pilgrimage to Ajmer Sharif, the ailing doctor's imprisonment in the city will be an embarrassing display of the Indian system at its most inhumane. Dr. Singh, whose government recently made a huge effort to bring back two Indian children sent into foster care by the Norwegian state, must immediately take steps to release Dr. Chisty and send him home.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dont-miss-this-opportunity/article3277994.ece
4,4,2012,Free medicines as a mission,"The Centre's move to introduce an experimental universal health package in at least one district per State under the National Rural Health Mission, with access to free generic drugs, is a welcome measure. But the larger mission to provide free essential medicines to all citizens need not await the results of such pilot studies. It should be rolled out for poor and non-poor alike quickly. There is no time to be lost because medicines make up an alarming 71 per cent of all out-of-pocket spending on health. The time for experimental schemes is therefore long past. What is more, efficient models of drug procurement and distribution by State governments involving low costs and improved access are readily available. Tamil Nadu is a leading example, having demonstrated this over the last 15 years. Kerala has replicated it and some other States are in the process of doing so. Clearly, it is feasible to provide carefully chosen essential drugs free, with higher government spending. Some reform is of course needed, and it should include an expanded National Essential Drug List, elimination of irrational drugs from prescriptions, priority for generic medicines and, crucially, a good centralised procurement system. The issues involved have been analysed by the High Level Expert Group (HLEG) of the Planning Commission on Universal Health Coverage.
A quarter century of National Sample Survey data from households on availability of free medicines to patients reveals depressing trends. From about 32 per cent of drugs supplied free to in-patients in1986-87, the figure fell to 9 per cent in 2004. Data on free drug supply for all patients indicate weak controls and escalating price pressure from the mid-1990s. This has severely affected affordability and thus access. It is here that the role of government assumes importance. The Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation has been able to deliver results because State-level procurement has ensured competitive pricing and control over prescription of irrational medicines. Such a system works better because it meets the key principle of efficient financing, which is pre-payment. Obviously, half-measures will only slow the process down and give room for manoeuvring by special interests. The HLEG has provided two scenarios for partial and full drug security that can be achieved in the dramatic time-frame of two and seven years. Scaling up government spending from about 0.1 per cent of GDP at present to 0.5 per cent is essential to achieving this outcome. The Centre must show the political will necessary.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/free-medicines-as-a-mission/article3277995.ece
5,4,2012,Misplaced fears,"The Indian Express's exposé of Raisina Hill getting “spooked” by the supposedly unexplained movement of two army units earlier this year has generated such a furious debate that it is best to get two toxic notions out of the way right at the start. The government may or may not have panicked but there was, in fact, nothing unusual or suspicious about the movement of two Indian army units towards Delhi on January 16. Second, the Indian Express is entirely within its rights to write about a sensitive matter like this, even if its treatment was overblown. Just as it is unfair for anyone to cast aspersions on the Indian Army, it is unfair to question the motives of the journalists who wrote the story. That two units comprising roughly a thousand men — hardly a number that should spook anyone — embarked on a training op on the same day Army Chief General V.K. Singh went to the Supreme Court over his age issue was obviously a coincidence. But it is possible that some officials in the Ministry of Home Affairs, the PMO and the Ministry of Defence completely misread this as an attempt to mobilise uniformed opinion in favour of the Chief's claim. If they did, this is unfortunate. What remains indisputable from the facts presented by the newspaper and by other information in the public domain is that the civilian and military establishments in India are not communicating properly and have become distrustful of each other.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has described the news report as “alarmist” and it is hard to disagree with his assessment. The bureaucratic and intelligence establishment was wary of General Singh but the worst it feared were speeches, not a display of public disaffection, let alone a mutiny or, most far-fetched of all, an attempt at a coup by a handful of soldiers! Any government that gets “spooked” by troop movements does not wait for the Defence Secretary to return hurriedly from Malaysia to seek an explanation from the Army about what is going on. That is why the suggestion that the government was in a state of absolute panic was something of an exaggeration. “Nobody is using the ‘C' word to imply anything other than ‘curious'. All else is considered an impossibility,” the Indian Express wrote. If this is so, then why was the report, which consumed the entire front page and was accompanied by a sensational headline, so overplayed? In doing so, it has run the risk of being read for innuendos and insinuations rather than for the facts — which is exactly what has transpired given the reaction to the story. The controversy over General Singh's age, which seems to have morphed into unrelated disputes about bribery and leaks of sensitive documents, has strengthened the impression that civil-military relations are inflamed. It is important to lower the temperature at this moment, not fan the flames.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/misplaced-fears/article3281517.ece
5,4,2012,Menace of twin deficits,"It is generally well known that India is one of the few countries with both a current account deficit and a fiscal deficit. However, the extent of deterioration in both is a matter of deep concern. According to the Reserve Bank of India's recent data on balance of payments (BOP), the current account deficit (CAD) rose to 4.3 per cent of the GDP during the third quarter (October-December 2011) of last year, sharply higher than the 2.3 per cent during the same period in the previous year. The sharp spike might have come as a surprise, but there was enough evidence of the deteriorating trend. Indeed, the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council which projected the CAD to be around 3.6 per cent by March 31, is just one of the many official forecasters which had anticipated a deterioration in the current account of the BOP. There is an expectation that a jump in the earnings from invisibles during the last quarter would help in moderating the CAD. Even so, its “comfort” levels — variously estimated at between 2.5 and 3 per cent — appear to be as elusive as ever. More ominously, during the third quarter, for the first time since 2008-09, capital inflows were not sufficient to bridge the current account deficit necessitating a drawdown of foreign exchange reserves by nearly $13 billion.
India's fiscal deficit projections have gone haywire with the government revising last year's budget estimate to 5.9 per cent from 4.6. The recent budget hopes to bring it down to 5.1 per cent by March 2013, a level which is still considered very high. The co-existence of a large fiscal deficit with the CAD has invited comparisons with the period preceding the 1991 crisis, when the twin-deficits apparently presaged bad times ahead. Such comparisons can be very superficial however. By any yardstick, the Indian economy is in a much better shape today. However it is good to realise that the co-existence of the two deficits has made the economy more vulnerable to external shocks. For instance, high petroleum prices have inflated the import bill and contributed to merchandise trade deficit besides straining the fiscal situation. Policymakers face quite a challenge in minimising the deleterious consequences of the twin deficits. The RBI might be reluctant to cut interest rates if it is not satisfied with the progress of fiscal consolidation. As recent data indicate, foreign capital flows might be even less forthcoming, given the twin-deficits. All these, in turn, will have wide ranging implications for the macro economy, including exchange rate policy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/menace-of-twin-deficits/article3281518.ece
6,4,2012,Don't lose the plot now,"The continuing efforts to criminalise protests against the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project and portray all opposition to nuclear energy as anti-national must be unequivocally condemned. For over seven months, a popular protest, with wide public participation, went on in the vicinity of Kudankulam without a single incident of violence. An indefinite fast against the Tamil Nadu government's decision to facilitate the commissioning of the plant has now been given up, but low-key protests continue. The government has managed to get the project going again after months of inactivity. Yet, the State has shown no compunction in invoking drastic legal provisions — such as those relating to waging war against the government, and sedition — against key participants in the agitation. The police in Tamil Nadu are preparing formally to lay serious charges against those perceived to have “instigated” the anti-nuclear agitation; the only concession they seem to make to the rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India is to promise that those who ‘innocently' participated in the protests will not be prosecuted. Regardless of one's opinion about the desirability of nuclear power, the imputation that organising protests against a nuclear plant amounts to waging war on the State or promoting disaffection against the government has no place in a democracy.
Non-governmental organisations linked to the protesters are facing a probe about whether foreign contributions meant for charity were diverted to fund the agitation. This may be explained as a legitimate exercise by the Union Home Ministry, which regulates the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act. However, the spate of arrests by the State police and the plan to prosecute protesters under extraordinary provisions of the law give the impression of a witch hunt. Also disturbing is the tendency to seek to demonstrate that ‘extremists' or ‘Maoists' have infiltrated the protests. A government that went out of the way to ensure peace during the prolonged agitation and which gave a necessary pause to the project until its full implications were explained to the public should not lose the plot now and waste its energies on pursuing the prosecution of protesters, be they the ones derisively dubbed “professional agitators” or those supposedly duped into participating in agitations. The larger issue of keeping the people on board always and allaying fears about safety is a long-term obligation that the Central and State governments cannot evade. Nothing can be more perverse than pursuing punitive measures used by colonial rulers in the pre-Independence era to repress democratic protests against the decisions and policies of elected governments.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dont-lose-the-plot-now/article3284757.ece
6,4,2012,Call of the Deep,"After stirring the imagination of people by bringing them up close with the Titanic on the silver screen, legendary film director James Cameron recently pulled off another spectacular achievement that will go a long way in igniting public interest in deep-sea exploration. By plunging nearly 11 km down to the Challenger Deep located in the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean — where a structure as tall as Mount Everest would be more than 2 km below the sea level — Cameron became the first man to reach the deepest depths of the ocean all alone. After spending nearly two-and-half hours to descend in his “Deepsea Challenger” submersible, he stayed at the Challenger Deep for nearly three hours to collect samples and capture on film the life and terrain of one of the world's most harsh and inhospitable regions. Though the Swiss oceanographer, Jacques Piccard, and Don Walsh, a lieutenant with the U.S. Navy, were the first to reach the dark abyss in 1960 in their bathyscaphe “Trieste,” Cameron's journey has captured the world's imagination like never before. His timing has been perfect as our ability to build advanced submersibles equipped with a slew of sophisticated instruments for carrying out various scientific studies has improved vastly since the first journey.
With the team planning to undertake three or more dives in the coming weeks to understand more about life on the rocky sides of the Trench, excitement and awareness is bound to increase. The Challenger Deep has already been explored in 1998 by “Kaiko,” a remote-controlled vehicle, and “Nereus,” a robot submersible in 2009. But these missions and their findings have gone largely unnoticed compared with Cameron's. It is beyond doubt that our understanding of many aspects of the deep ocean bottom is at best sketchy, and many times outright wrong. The spotting of snailfish at a depth of nearly 7 kms in different trenches flies in the face of conventional thinking that the deepest parts of the ocean are bereft of animal life. In fact, many unique marine organisms have been identified at depths greater than 6 km. For instance, free-falling landers that reached Sirena Deep, at a depth of 10.6 km last year, recorded the presence of xenophyophores, which are single-celled animals about 10 cm in size. Since they play host to a variety of organisms, their presence in the Mariana Trench is particularly significant. While each place has its own collection of unique species, their presence certainly strengthens the notion of deep ocean floors teeming with life. The need for a re-evaluation of the ocean floor ecosystem has therefore become inevitable. Cameron's expedition has set the grand stage for this.

7,4,2012,Myanmar's historic vote,"The landslide victory for Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy, in the by-elections held in Myanmar has confirmed what was already widely known: the iconic Nobel laureate remains as popular with the people of her country since the time she last contested elections, in 1990. Then, the military junta had robbed her of victory, putting her under house arrest for nearly all of the next two decades. This time, she will take her place in parliament as a member of the opposition, but her role is much bigger than that. Her studied decision to contest was crucial for the credibility of the reforms that have been set in motion under President Thein Sein. A former military man, the President was handpicked by the junta to lead the nominally civilian dispensation that would take its place after the 2010 elections. Since then, he has surprised sceptics, critics and even his military backers by his enthusiasm for bringing political change. The NLD boycotted the 2010 election as the junta had devised new rules to keep Ms Suu Kyi from contesting. But with the Thein Sein government taking measured but definite steps towards reform, she signalled a cautious willingness to participate in the process. The emphatic vote for the NLD is also an endorsement of her decision, and reflects the people's will that she play a role in the ongoing transition. Along with 16 members of a breakaway faction of her party who were elected in 2010 along with a clutch of representatives from the ethnic minorities, the NLD's robust presence in Parliament means that for the first time in half a century, the country has an elected opposition.
For sure, Myanmar is still far away from democracy. The parliament is still dominated by the military and its proxy, the Union Solidarity and Development Party. The ruling Defence Council still retains the power to dissolve parliament, to suspend the constitution at will, and to reimpose martial law. But military members of parliament have several times voted with the opposition. Clearly, the Myanmar military realises that the country needs to change, and that such change has to begin with it. There will be the expectation, both among her supporters at home and internationally, that in her new role, Ms Suu Kyi can hasten this change, but it would be unreasonable to expect miracles. As in Pakistan, there will always remain fears of a military backlash. The world can play a more constructive role by easing sanctions on the country. That in turn would speed the pace of democratic reforms. India, which had sidelined Ms Suu Kyi and the NLD in its eagerness to engage with the junta, now has the task of rebuilding relations with Myanmar's democratic forces.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/myanmars-historic-vote/article3288316.ece
7,4,2012,Privileged prisoners,"When the rich and the powerful get on the wrong side of the law, it's the law that suffers the most. VIP offenders and convicts are often treated by law enforcers as VIPs and not as offenders or convicts. Security officials rolled out the red carpet for Jagir Kaur, former Minister in the Shiromani Akali Dal government in Punjab, following her conviction last week on charges of abduction and wrongful confinement of her daughter in 2000. Video footage from the Kapurthala jail captured the astonishing sight of officials rushing to touch the convict's feet when she arrived at the prison complex ostensibly to serve out her term. Although Ms Kaur “resigned” as Minister immediately after her conviction, she appears to have lost none of the privileges that come with office. Twice president of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, the powerful body responsible for the administration of gurudwaras, Ms Kaur wields considerable clout within the current government headed by Parkash Singh Badal. Opposition members have already demanded that she be shifted to a jail outside Punjab so she gets a taste of prison life as it is lived by countless other convicts.
Of course, Ms Kaur is not the first person to receive comforts and favours inside a prison cell. Industrialists and politicians convicted for fraud and violent crime have always found ways to carry over their material advantages in the vast, outside world into the confines of a prison. In many cases, they abuse the legal provisions governing incarceration to evade the full rigour of the law. It has, for example, become the done thing for celebrity undertrials and convicts to feign chest pain and seek refuge in high-end hospitals which curiously seem able to delay diagnosing the illness for as long as the patient wants. Stories of well-heeled undertrials being lavished attention in prisons — the 2G accused being a case in point — are a legion. The other trick in the book is parole; the reason for the excursion can be anything, a parent's illness, the death of a relative, or simply the need to reconnect with the city's social circuit. Manu Sharma, convicted in the Jessica Lal murder case, famously spent the parole period granted him (originally 30 days but extended by a month) partying, helped in no small measure by his benefactors in the Delhi government. India's criminal justice system is lax, and many literally get away with murder. For a select few convicted by a court of law, the journey from home to prison brings no ordeal that they cannot bear. When the prison cell door clanks shut behind them, the VIP inmates manage to force open a window to freedom. That's the sad truth.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/privileged-prisoners/article3288318.ece
9,4,2012,Act to save our heritage,"The Tamil Nadu government's inexplicable delay in extending legal protective measures to heritage structures has cost the State yet another landmark building. A substantial portion of the century old P. Orr and Sons building in Chennai, home to the earliest watch ‘manufacturing' firm in South India, will be demolished to make way for an ancillary structure of a Metro railway station. A petition to prevent this demolition — filed by the Chennai chapter of INTACH — was dismissed by the Madras High Court on Wednesday. Of the issues raised by this case and the judgment, one with a larger import is the absence of legal protection for heritage structures. While the rest of the world recognises the value historic buildings bring to a city's culture and even economy, policymakers in India simply don't get it. Often, only monuments such as palaces and religious structures are officially recognised as legacy structures and conserved, leaving out a host of other buildings which are no less significant in historical and architectural terms. No amount of public protest can prevent the bulldozer since, at the end of the day, when the agitation to save these vulnerable and venerable buildings reaches the courts, it is only the point of law that prevails. Though legislation is not the only way to protect heritage, without it, our valuable structures cannot effectively be conserved.
Not all State governments move on leaden feet. States such as Maharashtra, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh quickly realised the importance of heritage and adopted a variety of legal measures to safeguard them. West Bengal enacted a comprehensive Heritage Commission Act, which covers the entire State, and creates an institutional arrangement to identify heritage buildings and recommend measures to protect them. In addition, individual local bodies, such as the Kolkata Municipal Corporation have amended their respective Acts to constitute a Heritage Conservation Committee with the Municipal Commissioner as its head. Mumbai was the first city in India to legally notify heritage buildings as early as 1995. Such measures have made a vast difference to conservation efforts. The objective of these measures is not to prohibit the use of old buildings, but creatively to manage changes without losing the heritage value. This is not impossible to achieve. London, which is one of the largest modern cities in the world with more than 18,000 heritage buildings and 155 monuments, is a case in point.

9,4,2012,Crisis in our skies,"India is one of the few countries where air passenger traffic has been rising year after year. More airports are being opened across the country. With a number of airlines in operation, competition is intense and the resulting fare war has, over the years, made flying an affordable option to many new air passengers. But, at the end of the day, none of the airlines seems to be making a profit. Perhaps only Indigo — the low-cost, no-frills, airline — has been able to keep its head above the waters. At the other end of the spectrum lie Air India and Kingfisher. For Air India, being a national carrier is both an asset and a liability. Kingfisher's malaise has more to do with extravagance and poor management. Today, the employees of both these airlines have resorted to strikes, protesting against the non-payment of salaries for months. The Prime Minister had himself to assure Air India pilots that their dues would be cleared over a period of time, and the Kingfisher Chairman, Vijay Mallya, had to meet unions and pilots to give them a fresh timetable for payment of salary arrears.
So what's wrong with the airlines, or even the aviation industry in such a growth centre as India? Why is the sector booming in China but not here? The airlines, speaking in one voice at least on this, insist that it is the lack of a positive, coherent aviation policy since the opening up of the skies that has led to this crisis. Though traffic is growing, the cost of operations has risen sharply. Aviation fuel accounts for nearly 50 per cent of the costs, and its price increase over the past two years has been substantial, eating into already low margins. Air fares have not risen correspondingly because of competition and the need to raise the load factor. Airport charges, particularly after the advent of privately developed greenfield airports, have also increased manifold. For Air India, the unwise and as yet incomplete merger of Indian Airlines and Air India has remained an albatross, while the now-on, now-off aircraft acquisition programme has led to a huge debt and interest burden. The Centre's decision to allow airlines to directly import fuel has been a welcome measure. But it is too little too late. The Civil Aviation Ministry must discuss all the issues affecting the economics of the industry threadbare and come up with a positive aviation policy to revive the sector without giving anybody a bailout or compromising on safety. The airlines, too, must set their houses in order and take employees into confidence, without leaving them in the lurch.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/crisis-in-our-skies/article3294276.ece
10,4,2012,Shrine diplomacy,"In 2008, months before Asif Ali Zardari had been elected President of Pakistan, he articulated a vision for relations with India that was breathtaking in its forwardness. It is another matter that even before the Pakistan People's Party had settled into its role as the elected government, the terror attacks in Mumbai ensured that just guarding the India-Pakistan status quo would be an achievement; everything else was put on hold. Four years later, in his own unique style, Mr. Zardari has given a push to bilateral relations. A visit covering two cities in half a day with talks squeezed in before lunch was never expected to solve all the problems between the two countries, but its symbolic value can hardly be underestimated. By coming to India as a pilgrim first and only then a President, Mr. Zardari has provided a new metric for high-level visits between the two countries, almost making such trips across the border seem normal and easy. By comparison, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's insistence that he will visit Pakistan only when there is a big breakthrough to celebrate shows a diffidence at variance with his grand vision of “breakfast in Lahore, lunch in Kabul”. The Mumbai shadow still hangs over bilateral relations, and as the Prime Minister rightly pointed out to Mr. Zardari, Pakistan must clean out its stables if the two nations can celebrate a durable peace. But the Pakistani President's decision to come to India over the threats and protests of Hafiz Saeed, the head of the Laskar-e-Taiba/Jamat ud dawa that carried out the Mumbai attacks is a good sign; it is the second time that the PPP government has taken courage to defy Saeed and his backers in uniform; earlier this year, Islamabad decided to go ahead with changes to improve trade relations with India, despite dire warnings from the Difa-e-Pakistan council, an umbrella organisation of JuD and like-minded extremist groups.
Sunday's Zardari-Manmohan meeting will hopefully give new purpose to the dialogue process between the two countries. The tragedy at Siachen on the eve of President Zardari's visit was a cruel reminder of how close the two countries came to resolving this issue in 2006, and a warning of the urgency with which the two sides need to break the ice over it. Mistrust, and the recent memory of Kargil, were behind the Indian Army's objections to a proposed joint withdrawal from those icy heights. That the avalanche that killed 124 Pakistani soldiers and 11 civilians last Saturday might well have happened on the Indian side is a sobering thought. The disaster should spur both sides towards a resolution, so that there is no more the need to spend so much money and risk so many lives to assert a claim over what is essentially wasteland.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/shrine-diplomacy/article3297583.ece
10,4,2012,Spreading its wings,"The 20th summit of the Association of South East Asian Nations last week has not only sought to consolidate ASEAN's gains, but also build a road map for its future. After stabilising itself as a regional cooperation forum for Southeast Asia, ASEAN started building bridges with its political and, more so, economic partners. The ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN+3, and the East Asia Summit are classic vehicles used by the association to build partnership with major powers across the world. From the U.S. and EU, to China, Japan, India, and South Korea, ASEAN has engaged in a useful and continuing dialogue. The objective was invariably to prevent conflict or friction and ensure free trade. At its just-concluded Phnom Penh summit, the association has firmed up plans for holding a global dialogue with institutions such as the World Bank, IMF, and UNCTAD. This will be held in November this year in Cambodia, along with other annual meetings. Again, ASEAN is trying to look into the future and engage development and finance institutions with a global reach to work with them in bringing about inclusive growth, an important objective given the fact that half of Southeast Asia continues to reel under poverty and under-development.
ASEAN legitimately took some credit for the successful conduct of by-elections in Myanmar that enabled Nobel laureate Syu Kyi and her party to contest and earn their rightful place in its Parliament, which remains packed with military nominees. Not surprisingly, the summit appealed to the U.N. and the West to lift the sanctions imposed on Myanmar over the years. Noting with concern continuing tensions in the Korean peninsula and the South China Sea, ASEAN called for the early resumption of the Six Party talks on Korea and for all countries with an interest in the South China Sea to continue to engage in dialogue and help defuse tensions. On India, regional leaders looked forward to the commemorative summit to celebrate 20 years of ASEAN-India dialogue relations to be held in New Delhi in December, and also to the recommendations of the Eminent Persons Group on future directions for this partnership. Despite its internal problems and the different systems of governance in vogue in its member-States, ASEAN has emerged as a model for other regional cooperation bodies to follow. It has also positioned itself at the centre of ongoing efforts to build pan-Asian economic and, eventually, even security structures. This is an arrangement all big powers with a stake in Asia — China, the U.S. and India — are comfortable with, provided the architecture which emerges is open and inclusive.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/spreading-its-wings/article3297582.ece
11,4,2012,Justice will be done,"The conviction by a Gujarat Special Court of 23 men — mostly Patels — for the pre-meditated massacre of Muslims in Ode village is another significant milestone on the long road to justice for the victims of the 2002 violence. Ode was among hundreds of Muslim neighbourhoods targeted and destroyed by organised rioters as part of a pogrom planned and executed in retaliation for the Sabarmati train carnage at Godhra. In Ode, mobs set ablaze a shelter where Muslims had huddled for safety, burning to death 23 of them, 18 women and children included. This is the second of nine pogrom-related cases investigated and prosecuted by the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) where judgments have been pronounced and the murderers brought to book. In November 2011, 31 men — again all landed Patels — were given life sentences for killing 33 Muslims in Sardarpura. There too the victims were mostly women and children locked into a small space and set on fire. Sardarpura, which recorded the highest number of convictions in any instance of targeted communal violence in independent India, was a trendsetter. The Ode judgment takes that spirit forward: not only did the court convict nearly half of the accused, a record in itself, it accepted the prosecution's argument that the violence was a result of criminal conspiracy.
Ode and Sardarpura represent an astonishing reversal of the pattern of acquittals seen over the years in cases of communal violence around India, including Gujarat. The 2003 Best Bakery case, for instance, was so shoddily prosecuted and the acquittals were so quickly obtained that the Supreme Court censured the State government and its officers. The apex court followed this up by ordering a retrial and transferring the case to Mumbai. In 2008, the Bilkees Bano case was transferred to Mumbai. Though the lower courts absorbed this message, acquittals continued to outnumber convictions thanks to a complicit prosecution's failure to lead credible evidence. It was to offset this baneful influence of the State government that the Supreme Court took major pogrom-related cases under its care and also directed the trial courts to deal “sternly” with attempts to intimidate witnesses. Whether in Sardarpura or Ode, the emphasis on witness protection allowed survivor witnesses to testify without fear of reprisals. The fact that the Ode judgment comes at a time the SIT has filed a closure report in the omnibus Zakia Jafri complaint against Chief Minister Narendra Modi — on whose watch the pogrom occurred — is ironic. Yet if there is a message in the recent court verdicts, it is that justice will be done to the victims of communal violence, however long and exhausting the battle may appear to them.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/justice-will-be-done/article3300978.ece
11,4,2012,The April Theses,"When Prakash Karat was first elected general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in 2005, mainstream Left parties in India were on the ascent: they were influential in the functioning of the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre, they were ruling in West Bengal and Tripura, and were on the road to power in Kerala. Indeed, Mr. Karat's first term coincided with one of the brightest phases of his party, and marked a generational shift in leadership. Now, in his third and last term — the Kozhikode congress, which ended April 9, amended the party constitution to set a three-term limit for secretaries at all levels — the party faces a changed environment. Polit Bureau member Sitaram Yechury said the congress highlighted the need for a native model of socialism rooted in Indian conditions. But from the time of Karl Marx, “scientific socialism” was supposed to be just that: a movement for revolutionary change situated in the prevailing conditions rather than a readymade formula to be applied anytime, anywhere. For Mr. Yechury to frame the issue in the manner he did suggests the party is reassessing its recent policies. Communist parties have always prided themselves in tempering the “economism” of day-to-day working class movements with the struggle for social emancipation in a world dominated by global capital. But unless the organic links between livelihood concerns and the big global picture are made evident, it is easy to lose sight of the here and now. This is what happened in 2009. The party broke with the UPA over the nuclear deal, an issue that had little resonance with party sympathisers or the broad masses, and the Congress-Trinamool alliance which followed led to the Left's electoral decimation.
If the CPI(M)'s reference to a native model of socialism is shorthand for placing the social and economic conflicts in Indian society at the centre of its political strategy, then a serious effort is needed to tie together the diverse struggles being waged by peoples' movements across the country. The Left in India — organised and unorganised — is plagued by divisions based on ideology and sectarianism. Finding creative ways of overcoming these divisions is the only way the CPI(M) can advance. For the party, the loss of West Bengal after 34 years in power was no doubt difficult; mistakes were made in Singur and Nandigram, which alienated some of its traditional support bases in the rural areas. Traumatic though this loss has been, it offers a valuable chance for the CPI(M) to introspect, consolidate and build itself anew, not just in Bengal but in other parts of India as well.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-april-theses/article3300983.ece
12,4,2012,Security on the wire,"The Chinese ghost is back to haunt the telecom sector. This time it is over equipment that a private operator has contracted to buy from Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corporation financed by loans from state-owned Chinese banks. India's external intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, has pointed to Huawei's links with the People's Liberation Army of China in an apparent objection to the import deal. To be sure, this is not the first time that Chinese telecom companies are in the news for the wrong reasons. A couple of years ago, state-owned BSNL was forced to cancel a contract awarded to these same companies following objections raised by security agencies. The concern was that foreign agencies could take control of the communication network during a hostile situation through embedded software, or use it to snoop on India. The government then placed an informal ban on imports of telecom gear from China and when the operators protested, it allowed such imports subject to guidelines, one of which was that the supplier should submit the source code for the embedded software.
Let's get this straight. If the concern is over security of imported telecom equipment, it cannot be about any one country or company. The two Chinese companies in question may have links to that country's security agencies but arguably, equipment sourced from any other company or country can be bugged too. Worse, if they so wish, foreign security agencies can even try and bug networks in India that are already running. It is not necessary that they have to do it only when equipment is bought from their country. Faced with such risks, the government has two options. One, it can ban telecom gear imports and direct operators to source all such equipment from within India. But that will be knee-jerk and is a sure fire method to put down the booming telecom industry of the country. The second and more pragmatic option is to develop counter-measures aimed at containing precisely the threat that the intelligence agencies are concerned about. The government should prod these agencies into investing in technology to deal with such threats rather than seeking a ban on imports, which is all too easy and convenient an option. Simultaneously, it should involve the telecom industry in a dialogue to devise a comprehensive policy on equipment imports without compromising on the country's security. Operators go to China for its cheaper prices and easy availability of finance which in turn helps them to offer low tariffs for their services. The government should bear this in mind while framing its policy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Security-on-the-wire/article12956629.ece
12,4,2012,Fighting words with bans,"Tel Aviv's decision to bar Nobel Prize-winning German author Günter Grass from entering Israel is blinkered and lacking in all good sense. By reacting in this manner to his recent poem — which warned Germany against selling submarines to Israel, whose “atomic power endangers an already fragile world peace” — Benjamin Netanyahu's government has raised another question on its commitment to freedom of expression and tolerance of dissent. For a country that likes to project itself as an island of democracy in a region surrounded by illiberal theocracies, the reflexive ban on Mr. Grass is counter-productive for at least two reasons. It has drawn more attention to his poem, ‘What Must Be Said,' than it would have otherwise received. And it has shown up Israel as small-minded, a nation that feels threatened by a mere poem. Irrespective of whether one agrees with him or not, Mr. Netanyahu was within his rights to rail against the poem, which he maintained had made a “shameful moral equivalence between Israel and Iran.” The Israeli Prime Minister went on to draw his own ‘equivalence' — between the fact that Mr. Grass was once a (conscripted) member of the Waffen SS and his poem's message that Israel is a threat to world peace. The worst that one can say of such a personal attack is that it was in extremely bad taste. But by barring Mr. Grass, his government has signalled Israel's disinclination to even engage with those who differ with it in the marketplace of ideas.
Mr. Grass's overtly political poem has been the subject of much debate, even criticism, in his own country, both for its literary merit and for its strategic vision. If the first is difficult to assess in translation, the second must be assessed against Germany's Nazi past, which has created a climate of guilt and fostered an intellectual environment in which attacking Israel is equated with anti-semitism. Grass himself hints at this in the poem: “But why have I kept silent until now? Because I thought my own origins, Tarnished by a stain that can never be removed…” The writer's brief association with the SS as a 17-year-old was not unusual in a period when youth were forcibly conscripted into what was the armed wing of the Nazi Party. His fault lay in not disclosing this until 2006. More than one of his novels, most notably The Tin Drum, that classic of post-World War II literature, were fierce and savagely funny attacks on Nazism. The Israeli establishment's attempt to paint him as a closet Nazi is detestable and will find hardly any takers. It is one thing to dislike or disagree with his poem; but as Salman Rushdie tweeted, “to ban him is infantile pique. The answer to words must always be words.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fighting-words-with-bans/article3304396.ece
13,4,2012,The schools are now open,"Now that the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutional validity of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, the Centre and the States must do their utmost to provide eight years of good quality schooling to all children. The unsuccessful challenge to the Act, which went into effect on April 1, 2010, came from unaided private school managements who are required to set apart 25 per cent seats for poor children. Private schools that favoured a market-based approach to universalisation — relying on government education vouchers for the poor and filtered entry — failed to make convincing arguments. They are all within the ambit of the law, except for unaided private minority institutions. Rather than view this as a loss of prestige, they must sagaciously open their doors to students of all social strata, and help those from the weaker sections integrate with the others. The letter of the law is a far-going reform measure and has the potential to create a generation of Indians who are equipped to participate in nation building. But it will take relentless efforts to turn the legislation enacted in furtherance of Article 21A — which enjoins the State to provide free and compulsory education to all children aged six to fourteen — into a revolutionary instrument. The immediate challenges lie in the area of recruitment, to meet the estimated shortfall of one million teachers, and toning up teacher training as per the pedagogic requirements of the National Curriculum Framework, 2005.
With continued economic growth, it should not be difficult to allocate the Rs. 4.50 lakh crore that the Planning Commission thinks is needed for the implementation of the RTE Act over the next five years. The task will primarily be led by the States, but only a few, notably in the South, have the capacity to take on the challenge. The others must use the opportunity that presents itself to improve facilities and raise standards. Government and municipal schools have a long history of neglect and lack of investment in infrastructure, while affluent private schools use the most modern educational tools and teaching methods. It is worth pointing out here that the RTE rules have provisions to help bridge this asymmetry, in the form of perspective plans to be drawn up by individual schools. Moreover, the Act enables monitoring of the manner in which the law is being implemented, through the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights. The NCPCR and State Commissions for Protection of Child Rights can, of course, only perform their task if they have sufficient resources. The Supreme Court order makes it possible to speed up these vital reforms.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-schools-are-now-open/article12957957.ece
13,4,2012,Assad's last chance,"By implementing the April 12 ceasefire which former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan proposed, President Bashar al-Assad has finally recognised the deepening global anxiety over Syria. The fighting has taken a terrible toll; according to the U.N., 9,000 civilians have died since public protests against Syria's regime started in March 2011. The government also says 2,000 soldiers have been killed. As the conflict developed into civil war, the army increasingly used tanks, armoured vehicles, rocket-armed helicopters, and mortars; 42,000 civilians fled the country, the majority to Turkey and the rest to Lebanon and Jordan. The situation on the ground remains potentially unstable, as troops and heavy weapons are still deployed across the country and the government insists it will respond “proportionately” to any attacks, even though Mr. Assad seems to have abandoned his earlier demand for a written guarantee that the rebels lay down their arms first. The Free Syrian Army, the opposition's main military body, had rejected that call anyway, seeing it as yet another attempt by the regime to evade any serious commitment to a ceasefire. The plan, which Mr. Annan conveyed as an envoy of the Arab League also calls for a Syrian-led political process to address the “aspirations and concerns” of the people and, among other things, requires freedom of association, the right to demonstrate peacefully, and freedom of movement for journalists.
The guns may be silent for the time being but the situation remains dangerous. Although the Arab League has heeded Russian concerns by not requiring Mr. Assad to leave office, his departure is a non-negotiable demand by the Istanbul-based Syrian National Council (SNC), the key opposition grouping. Secondly, the President can claim popular support of a kind — he has stood up to Israel and the West, especially by supporting Hezbollah in Lebanon — but the opposition, internal and external, is severely divided. The Kurdish faction has walked out of the SNC, as has a senior dissident, and the Council has been criticised for the influence of its biggest single group, the Muslim Brotherhood. In addition, some Gulf states want tough action against Mr. Assad, while Lebanon and Iraq do not. The ceasefire is nevertheless to be greatly welcomed. In order to build political momentum in the wake of the ceasefire, India and its fellow BRICS countries should join others in facilitating an inclusive Syrian political process. For Mr. Assad and the Ba'ath leadership, the ceasefire is a last chance to push for such a process. Failure to do so will only increase the clamour for external intervention.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/assads-last-chance/article3308068.ece
14,4,2012,State of readiness,"This reality check was a welcome one in many ways. The two earthquakes that struck off Sumatra spread panic but caused no real damage across a large swathe from Thailand, Indonesia, Myanmar and Malaysia to India, Sri Lanka, Reunion and Kenya. With a magnitude of 8.6, the first was the 10th strongest recorded in a century — and all the others produced deadly tsunamis. It revived memories of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami that left at least 240,000 people dead. But this time round, warning systems introduced since then proved efficacious. Five deaths caused by heart attacks were reported, but overall, better popular awareness of what to expect, information flow based on more advanced technologies, and proactive steps initiated quickly by authorities, suggests disaster preparedness of a higher order. The fact that the use of smart phones and social media has risen since 2004, helped spread the word and keep anxiety at bay. The Internet played a significant role in disseminating information. Although the quakes did not ultimately cause a tsunami, the alert proved a test of the Indian Ocean tsunami warning system, an ambitious network of tidal gauges, deep ocean buoys and seismic monitors put in place post-2004. In the tense hours that a tsunami watch remained in effect, meteorologists monitored offshore buoys that measured the waves, confidently predicting that the likelihood of a large tsunami was minimal. They knew which parts of the coast to watch, as buoys sent signals to monitoring stations. The bottomline: the region was better prepared.
India issued a tsunami warning for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the eastern coast eight minutes after the first quake. In some areas, the alert did expose problems of traffic management and the inability of mobile phone networks to cope in an emergency. Clearly, there is no room for complacency given that natural and man-made disasters of any kind could strike unexpectedly at any point. The founding of the National Disaster Management Authority and State Disaster Management Authorities, and the launching of the National Disaster Response Force during the last decade marked the realisation in India of the need for the management of emergency situations. In order to make the cut, systems need to be in peak form, and equipped right. Personnel should have the means to mobilise quickly and at short notice. This will call for continuous investments in training to improve response time, going beyond periodic ritualistic exercises. Complex tasks of human resource development, capacity building, training, research, documentation and policy formation are involved here. India can rest easy only when it realises the importance of being in a state of readiness.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/state-of-readiness/article3312022.ece
14,4,2012,A bonfire of free speech,"There is an oppressive climate of intolerance towards dissent and free speech in West Bengal today. In an act of crude censorship, the government recently removed several newspapers from over 2,480 public libraries that it runs, aids or sponsors. Now, the police have arrested two people, including a professor from Jadavpur University, for allegedly defaming Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee through a cartoon they posted on a social networking site. These are blatant acts of authoritarianism that mock at constitutional values and freedoms and deserve to be condemned. The decision to purge the public library system of most mass circulation Bengali dailies and English language newspapers reflects a deep-seated contempt for democratic values. This has been done, ironically, under the guise of developing free thinking among readers. But the Chief Minister has only to read the Library Bill of Rights of the American Library Association to understand how far removed her government's views are from civilised practice. “Materials should not be excluded because of the origin, background, or views of those contributing to their creation,” the charter states, affirming the right of readers to have access to all shades of opinion. Specifically, nothing should be excluded because of partisan or doctrinal disapproval. What makes the decision of the West Bengal government particularly offensive is its calculated approach to suppressing ideas and information.
If democracy is to flourish, the public library system must be insulated from censorship. The Centre should strengthen the role of libraries and make their collections mandatorily inclusive. India's public libraries must be governed by a specific freedom charter that spells out their rights and those of readers. This can be done by making it mandatory for libraries to consult the community they serve through public hearings, and acquire publications based on local demand. Such principles are universal, and even titles that are not available at a given moment can be specially requested by readers. The repressive orders in West Bengal are aimed at chilling independent thought. School textbooks have been rewritten to remove the philosophy of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels because Ms. Banerjee has so decreed. And now, citizens are being arrested for merely lampooning leaders. State governments invariably pursue the goal of control of the media, and their favourite tool is grant or denial of government advertisements to bring about self-censorship. But in West Bengal, an era of a more direct assault on free speech seems to have begun. It needs a strong response from democratic forces.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-bonfire-of-free-speech/article3312039.ece
16,4,2012,New Compact faces old problem,"Four months after a tear-gas shell killed a Srinagar teenager in June 2010 — sparking off street protests and firing by the security forces which were to claim over a hundred young lives — the government appointed a team of interlocutors to “suggest a way forward that truly reflects the aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.” Last week, The Hindu published excerpts from Dileep Padgaonkar, Radha Kumar and M.M. Ansari's report, one that, in the six months since it was submitted, the Cabinet is yet to find time to discuss, let alone open up to serious political debate. The report, A New Compact, advocates placing India's constitutional relationship with J&K on a more durable footing by reviewing Central laws made applicable to the State without the consent of its legislators — and limiting Parliament's right to legislate for the State on issues other than India's security and vital economic interests. It seeks the setting up of autonomous councils to address the concerns of the State's regions. It calls for a serious review of security arrangements, including the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, and seeks deeper linkages across the Line of Control. In spite of its title, few of A New Compact's proposals are in fact new. The issues it raises have been debated for decades. Put simply, A New Compact isn't a manifesto for radical new thinking: it is a call to get a move on.
For several reasons, New Delhi is reluctant to do that. First, India wants a constitutional agreement on J&K to be part of a final-status agreement with Pakistan. Mired in an ever-deepening crisis, Pakistan's political leadership just does not have the authority to even negotiate, let alone sign on to such a deal. Second, A New Compact correctly emphasises that the State's constitutional future “be reached through consensus so that they are acceptable to all stakeholders represented in the State Assembly and in Parliament.” Even though political leaders privately acknowledge the need for change, major parties have not even begun to debate the issues. Third, Kashmir's secessionist coalition, which New Delhi hopes would back an agreement, is paralysed by its own crisis of legitimacy. Finally, Pakistan-based jihadist groups have sharpened their polemical swords in recent months. These are real problems. There is no reason, though, to defer discussion on troop cuts, regional dialogue or constitutional change. The report's proposals may or may not address the issues that are driving political alienation in Jammu and Kashmir today. Not debating them, though, is certain to breed resentment and deepen scepticism about India's intentions. New Delhi, not for the first time, has responded to challenges by choosing to do nothing — a response that is outright dangerous.

16,4,2012,We are all Khans,"The detention of actor Shah Rukh Khan for about two hours by immigration officials at a United States airport has resulted in considerable public outrage in India. It is important to separate the emotional chaff from the dispassionate grain when dealing with this issue. Inflamed hyper-nationalistic reaction — reflected in retributory calls for similar treatment meted out to visiting U.S. celebrities – has no place in any level-headed discussion. At the same time, Washington's attempt to clear the air by issuing a qualified apology falls far short of addressing why such “travel-related issues” keep cropping up intermittently. This is the second time that Mr. Khan has been detained at an American airport because of his name. And an expression of regret if any “inconvenience” was caused is a hopelessly inadequate way of dealing with the mortification of being held up and questioned if the reason for doing so is based on a suspicion that someone is a terrorist or on some watch list. New Delhi's strong message, that the “mechanical” routine of detention and apology is no longer acceptable, is most apposite.
The U.S. Embassy has pointed out that tens and thousands of Muslims travel to and from the United States every day without being delayed or detained — a fact it has employed to deny that there is racial profiling. But the germane point is: how many of them are? In the wake of the Shah Rukh Khan incident, other Bollywood figures who share his surname have complained of being detained. Director Kabir Khan has said he has been detained three times; actor Irfan Khan has revealed he has been held up at least four times for two to three hours. This issue is not about celebrities alone and it would seem reasonable to assume a fair number of ordinary Muslim men and women have undergone similar or worse experiences with U.S. immigration authorities since 9/11. Rather than draw attention to the existence of a mechanism by which Indian travellers, who ostensibly risk being questioned because of their names, can alert the U.S. Embassy about their status, surely the solution to the problem — which on occasion has assumed diplomatic dimensions — is to introduce a smarter system that does not red flag people simply because of their names. The fact that the late Senator Edward Kennedy was questioned five times in one month at American airports some years ago because his name showed up on the government's secret “no fly list” should have convinced Washington how flawed the existing procedures are.

17,4,2012,Lessons from a bloody Sunday,"Four weeks after Taliban negotiators walked out of secret negotiations in Doha, their armed units have sent out a stark message to the world: although Mullah Omar's armies might never be able to overrun Kabul and re-establish his emirate, they can deny Afghanistan peace, perhaps indefinitely. Faced with multiple-target attacks in Kabul and other towns, Afghanistan's often-reviled security forces responded with professional skill their Indian counterparts would be hard-pressed to match, killing 36 terrorists while losing only eight of their own; just three civilians died. Yet, it is evident that even a much degraded Taliban — hard hit by the loss of mid-level commanders, and the decimation of its rank-and-file — retains the ability to strike hard. Taliban insurgents backed by Pakistani jihadists have seized hold of remote mountain territories in eastern and southern Afghanistan, slipping back across the border when challenged. In 2014, western armies will complete their drawing-down, leaving a residual force of perhaps 15,000 inside Afghanistan. Funding has been secured for a reduced Afghan military of about 190,000 troops, against the 240,000 it now has. President Hamid Karzai is scheduled to sign agreements that will institutionalise Western support for this army, and allow counter-insurgency operations to continue.
No one knows for certain, however, how well — and for how long — these arrangements will hold. In a best-case scenario, Afghanistan's armed forces will receive enough funding and support to defend the state. In a worst-case one, the army could dissolve back into the ethnic militia from which it arose — opening the way for civil war, and Taliban control of parts of Afghanistan. For India, this second scenario is a grave concern. Taliban successes could provide strategic space to Pakistan-based groups — among them, the Lashkar-e-Taiba, which has been fighting in Kunar province for several years now. This would not only make India vulnerable to attack, but push Pakistan itself further towards the abyss. For years now, Afghan and world leaders have been calling on Islamabad to crack down hard on Pakistan-based jihadists like Jalaluddin Haqqani — the Taliban-linked warlord whose operatives are alleged to have staged Sunday's attacks. Powerful elements in Islamabad's military establishment, though, continue to back proxies in Afghanistan, seeing them as allies. Perched on the edge of a war without end, Afghanistan desperately needs the international community to demonstrate a durable commitment to the country's future. Even more, however, it needs the world to redouble its efforts make Pakistan's army change course.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lessons-from-a-bloody-sunday/article3321318.ece
17,4,2012,A very unusual coup,"The putsch in Mali, which has ended with the army's renunciation of power following confirmation by the country's Supreme Court that the leader of parliament, Diouncounda Traore, can become interim president until elections are held, looks at first sight like one of the more unusual coups of recent times. For the record, President Amadou Toumani Touré, whom junior army officers overthrew on March 21 for what they alleged was his mishandling of a long-running counter-insurgency campaign against Tuareg tribals in northern Mali, submitted his resignation on 8 April, after which the coup leader, Captain Amadou Sanogo, asked the Cour Suprême du Mali for its ruling. Meanwhile the insurgency continues to intensify, exposing weaknesses in the military's claims as much as anything else. To start with, the military lost the cities of Kidal, Gao, and Timbuktu after the coup. In addition, the area now under rebel control is the size of France, with the situation exacerbated by the fact that the Tuaregs themselves are seriously at odds with an extreme Islamist group, Ansar Dine, who aim to impose the Sharia law and appear to be gaining the upper hand over other rebel factions.
Mali, therefore, needs an immediate return to constitutional rule so that the army and the government can address the factors fuelling the northern insurgency and try to resolve the enormous and urgent problems the country's 14 million people face. These include the dispossession of successful subsistence farmers for a huge Chinese-built, Libyan-financed canal in the Ségou region. Secondly, Malian cotton farmers are among others in West Africa who, according to the Fairtrade Foundation, lose $250 million a year in exports because they are undercut by subsidised cotton from the United States, the European Union, China, and India. Thirdly, Mali, like India, loses 30-40 per cent of its foodgrain output because of its poor infrastructure, and the emerging farmers' cooperatives will need more help getting produce directly to the market. What makes the Malian coup so remarkable is that sanctions imposed by the EU and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) were very effective in bringing about the end of military rule. In fact, ECOWAS appears to have been so crucial to the resolution of the crisis that Mr. Touré sent his letter of resignation to it rather than to the Supreme Court in Bamako. The whole episode shows the value of determined non-violent action by international bodies. Not once was there any talk of invasion, regime change, or any of the other interventions that have caused so much harm elsewhere. Malians can now look forward to better.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-very-unusual-coup/article3321320.ece
18,4,2012,A risky wager,"Central bankers as a breed are not exactly known for their gambling instincts, driven as they are by cold economic numbers in their decision-making. Yet, Reserve Bank of India Governor D. Subbarao has gambled big in deciding to drop policy rates by a larger-than-expected 0.50 percentage points in his Annual Monetary Policy Statement announced Tuesday. The move is also in line with the hoary tradition of central banks surprising markets — it was a pleasant one this time round as the money was on a token cut of 0.25 percentage points. There was no surprise, however, in the decision to keep the cash reserve ratio unchanged which, given the comfortable liquidity position, was expected. The RBI says it was driven by two major considerations in its decision to cut rates for the first time in three years: the significant deceleration in GDP growth in the last fiscal and the softening of inflation to levels that the central bank is comfortable living with. The fall in GDP growth to below the trend rate seen in the post-2008 crisis period seems to have spooked the RBI badly as there is more than one reference to this in the policy statement. The rate cut should, of course, please the government which was batting for it in rather brazen fashion as seen from Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee's statements last week.
While the deed is done, the RBI may yet cut a sorry figure if things don't pan out as envisaged. Inflation is “sticky” and above the tolerance level of the central bank. Even if it is assumed that 6.5 per cent inflation, which is the RBI's projection for March 2013, is the new level of tolerance, there are enough factors to push it above this mark. Higher global oil prices have not been passed on to consumers yet and it is possible the government was waiting for the RBI policy to get out of the way before doing so. This will have a cascading effect on prices across the economy, pushing up inflation. Second, if the monsoon fails, there would be a rise in prices of food commodities. The RBI has acknowledged these risks, as also the possibility of the government failing to meet its deficit target, thus adding to inflation. There is also the issue of financing the current account deficit which can be aggravated by a further rise in oil prices or by a drop in foreign capital inflows into the stock market. The hope appears to be that a big bang reduction will stimulate investment and sentiment, leading to growth, which in turn will help rein in all the spectres haunting the economy. The RBI's projection of a rather ambitious 7.3 per cent growth this fiscal underlines the reasoning behind its bold gamble. The question is, will it pay off?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-risky-wager/article3325114.ece
18,4,2012,It wouldn't be cricket,"Leave the details aside for a moment and go directly to the broader question: should Shimla's ancient, verdant and picturesque Annandale Ground be consumed for the construction of a cricket stadium? The logic for such a proposal cannot be more flawed. In a city already overrun with concrete, Annandale Ground, made up of an attractive patch of table land ringed by forest, is a comforting island of green. The tiny State already has an excellent cricket stadium in Dharamsala, host to IPL T20 matches for a couple of years and recently cleared by the ICC to host international matches. Even if one accepts that Himachal Pradesh requires another cricket stadium, and that too in Shimla, could this not be built elsewhere and not in what is a green lung of the hill capital? The fact that the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association is headed by the son of Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal casts a heavy shadow of doubt about the spontaneity of the so-called public campaign to retrieve the ground from the Army's possession. The manner in which the State government has handled the issue has left it open for people to believe it is putting its weight behind the HPCA, and playing facilitator for its proposals, for less than dispassionate reasons.
Having said this, the press release issued by the Army's Western Command, which accused the State administration of acting on the behest of the land mafia, was outrageous. Correctives have been applied since with the clarification that the release was “erroneously issued” and the announcement that an inquiry will be held into the lapse. In a strict legal sense, the State government may have a right to demand that the land, on which the lease has expired, be returned to it. It is also possible that the Army is overstating the case a tad by maintaining that the land has great strategic value, being crucial for the staging of drills and helicopter operations. But even if so, the use for which it puts the land to is far more important than that of cricket. Attempts to retrieve the land earlier have been stalled by the firm intervention of the Defence Ministry. From the 1830s, Annandale Ground — which legend says was named after Anna, the love of a young British captain captivated by the beauty of the area — was a place for picnics, fairs, dog shows, polo matches and other amusements. Yes, cricket was played here as well, but in the countrified style of yore, when a ground meant nothing more than a pretty patch of green and a small pavilion. To ring it with tons of concrete and the other architectural appurtenances that a modern stadium requires would be to destroy something of both historical and ecological value. To use the cliché, it just wouldn't be cricket.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/it-wouldnt-be-cricket/article3325116.ece
19,4,2012,Lost in politicking,"That an item not supposed to be on the agenda could cast a long shadow on the meeting of Chief Ministers called by the Centre to discuss internal security speaks poorly of the status of Centre-State relations in the country. Although Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in his opening remarks announced that a separate meeting would be held to discuss the controversial proposal to set up a National Counter-Terrorism Centre, some of the Chief Ministers were sufficiently ill-at-ease with the proposal to feel compelled to bring up this very issue. What hogged the attention was not Kashmir, North-East, Left-wing extremism, communalism, or terrorism but the Centre's perceived encroachment on State powers. Prime Minister Singh conceded that the “burden of the fight against terrorism” falls largely on the States. The proper course, then, would have been to provide the State police forces with the equipment, training and manpower to undertake this fight, and not to unilaterally move on an NCTC with a nationwide mandate and wide powers. At the meeting, Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram drew attention to the existing coordination with the States in tackling terrorism, and to the absence of any conflict between the Central agencies and the State police forces at the “operational level.” But what he did not touch upon was the absence of political consultations on matters related to national security. For many of the non-Congress Chief Ministers, the motives of the Centre on this front are suspect.
However, State governments also need to introspect. Many have often misused the police for political ends, sabotaging investigations in crimes involving the rich and powerful or initiating cases against political rivals. The Narendra Modi government in Gujarat is a case in point: many of the victims of the 2002 post-Godhra riots had to approach the highest court in their effort to get justice. In Odisha, the violence against Christians in 2008 exposed the state of policing in the State. In Bihar, sloppy investigation and prosecution in the 1996 carnage of Dalits in Bathani Tola has now resulted in the acquittal of all the 23 accused by the Patna High Court. Clearly, State governments, whether of the Congress or the non-Congress variety, have been no different when it comes to employing security agencies under their command for partisan, political ends. Security is too serious an issue to be turned into a political football. Instead of pointing fingers, the Centre and the States need to step up coordination at all levels to neutralise the threats the country faces.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lost-in-politicking/article3328937.ece
19,4,2012,No country for baby girls,"The much publicised case of Baby Afreen's tragic death in a Bangalore hospital will perhaps go down among the most brutal instances of the prevalent prejudice in India against the girl-child. In March, two-year-old Falak met with an equally tragic end in Delhi after she was trafficked and cruelly tortured for months. There is much in common between these two unrelated and widely publicised tales of violence and abandonment and the many hundreds that go unreported. In India, gender discrimination and violence against children and women defy caste and class barriers and urban and rural divides. The effects of these and other gender disparities are writ large on India's human development indicators. Look at the child sex ratio in the 0-6 years age group two decades after the inauguration of India's economic reforms: In 2011, the figure stood at 914 females for every 1000 males, down from 945 in 1991. Years ago, demographers established that technologies that determine the sex of the foetus could be the root cause of the rapid decline in the population of female children. But the law banning this manifestly blatant abuse of modern technology is observed in its breach, thanks to collusion among pliable medical professionals and the bureaucracy.
Policymakers too must take their share of the blame, insofar as they remain impervious to the implications of the two-child family norm in a society where the preference for sons is predominant. At least one state law seeks to disqualify elected representatives of local bodies if they have more than two children. Proponents of such punitive measures miss the following common sense point. Fertility decisions are influenced by the survival chances of children, which are linked to the economic security of families. Hence, it would be highly arbitrary to include family size as an eligibility criterion for public office. Sadly, the courts have upheld these sorts of laws, arguing that population growth has an adverse impact on the country's development and elected representatives should lead by example. Mercifully, the enthusiasm for such indiscriminate incentives and disincentives has waned, possibly because there was talk of extending its application to members of State Assemblies and the Lok Sabha. But combating socially engendered discrimination against women and children calls for creating equal opportunities in education and employment and promoting equity and justice, besides enforcing the law on matters like foeticide and dowry. Only thus could traditional stereotypes be broken and the changing roles of women accorded respect and recognition.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-country-for-baby-girls/article3328935.ece
20,4,2012,The ‘game-changer’,"Agni V, India's most powerful long-range ballistic missile, has lived up to the hopes of its creators at the Defence Research & Development Organisation. In its maiden flight on Thursday morning, the missile demonstrated that it could accurately lob a dummy warhead weighing slightly over one tonne to a distance of over 5,000 km. India already has nuclear-capable missiles that can reach all of Pakistan and Agni V is clearly intended to provide a similar deterrent capability with respect to China. More test flights will be necessary before the missile is inducted into the country's strategic arsenal. V.K. Saraswat, Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister, has called the missile “a game-changer” that can perform different roles, from carrying multiple warheads to providing anti-satellite capability and even launching tiny satellites into orbit. Like its progenitor, Agni III, this missile has a two-metre diameter (as compared to the one-metre diameter of Agni I and II). Agni III and V are therefore the first Indian missiles that can potentially be equipped with several warheads each (known as Multiple Independently Targeted Re-entry Vehicles or MIRV). MIRVs, however, pose their own technological challenges, especially the need to considerably shrink the size and weight of nuclear warheads. Despite China's earlier start, its ballistic missiles are still thought to be equipped with single warheads, not MIRVs. This suggests that developing an operational MIRV capability is not easy and will take time for both countries. Which is just as well because mutual security — as the superpowers discovered during the Cold War — does not lie in going down that path.
Both China and Pakistan possess formidable nuclear-armed missiles of their own. The former is in the process of replacing its liquid-fuelled ballistic missiles with more modern solid propellant ones. From bases in Qinghai and Yunnan provinces, these missiles can reach all of India. In addition, in 2004, China launched the first of its second-generation Type 094 Jin-class nuclear-powered submarines that will carry JL-2 solid-propellant ballistic missiles. Islamabad too has a number of long-range missiles in its armoury. An assessment carried out by an Indian strategic studies group found that Pakistan had a “credible deterrent structure” organised around the solid-propellant Shaheen-1 and -2 missiles. However, responsible possession of nuclear-armed missiles for the purposes of deterrence also requires working assiduously to remove sources of friction that can erupt into open conflict. It is also important that India and China start talking to each other on nuclear matters.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-gamechanger/article3333032.ece
20,4,2012,An elusive turnaround,"The more the government gets into it, the greater the mess Air India seems to become. None of the plans hammered out till now, including the ill-advised merger of the two national carriers, has succeeded. The Centre has been in emergency response mode for years, pumping in small doses of equity and loans to keep Air India alive and permanently in the red. Last week, the Union Cabinet cleared a Rs. 30,000 crore restructuring plan for the airline, to be implemented between 2012 and 2021. This includes an upfront equity infusion of Rs. 6,750 crore, and assured equity support of over Rs. 23,000 crore over nine years. The government will also guarantee non-convertible debentures for Rs. 7,400 crore. Given the Centre's own financial crunch, this is a major financial commitment. The immediate benefit for the struggling and virtually grounded airline will be the induction of 27 Boeing 787 ‘Dreamliner' aircraft, whose acquisition has been delayed by three years, at least in part, because of the financial crisis in the organisation. Perhaps, the employees will now start getting their salaries, may be in instalments. The consortium of banks has also cleared the turnaround plan by converting working capital and other loans into medium and long term debts, with a moratorium of one to two years.
But the more significant element in the Financial Restructuring Plan (FRP) relates to the hiving off of two main business arms — ground handling and Maintenance, Repairs, and Overhaul (MRO). The government, under the FRP, hopes to rid the airline of about 12,000 employees to the ground handling unit and another 7000 to the MRO, thereby reducing the staff strength of Air India to approximately 11,000. The objective seems to be to develop these two services as independent, strategic business units that can become profitable on their own. It is quite likely that Air India will enter into joint ventures to run these units as profit centres. The fundamental question remains: Has Air India consulted its employees and unions on the FRP and other plans to make it succeed? It should not remain, like the merger issue, a thorn in its flesh that could lead to further illness. Though the Cabinet has given its nod for FDI in the airline sector, it is very doubtful if the state-owned Air India can ever attract a suitor in the present circumstances. Worse still, the ability and capacity of the state-owned and politically influenced airline to implement a stringent FRP itself remains doubtful. Unless Air India gains autonomy to function as a viable, commercial airline without political interference, such ambitious plans can hardly succeed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-elusive-turnaround/article3333026.ece
21,4,2012,The land of the not so free,"Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, said recently that he was losing sleep over the attempts by governments to tighten their control of or spy on the Internet. The computer scientist was speaking about moves in the United Kingdom and the United States to widen surveillance of public communications, but his comment echoes the growing concern among civil rights and free speech advocates in India about several provisions of the Information Technology Act and Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules 2011. At the heart of the issue in this country is the conflict between the constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression, and arbitrary, often political, actions that have begun seriously to erode it. Attacks on individuals and inconvenient opinion are being mounted — most recently in the Mamata Banerjee cartoons case — using Section 66 A of the amended IT Act, 2000. This provision makes it a crime to send, using a computer resource or a communication device, information known to be “false” with the aim of causing “annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred or ill-will”. Emails are also similarly covered, and the penalty for the offence is a jail term of up to three years. Used in conjunction with provisions of the Indian Penal Code, or separately, such vague definitions are offensive weapons in the censor's toolkit. Crucially, they far exceed the reasonable restrictions on free speech identified in Article 19 (2) of the Constitution.
In the way they are framed, some provisions of the IT Act and the 2009 amendments, such as Section 69 A (power to issue directions for blocking of access of any information through any computer resource) and 69 B (power to authorise monitoring and collection of traffic data or information) pose serious questions on India's commitment to open democracy. But newer rules covering intermediaries hosting content online are even more controversial and arbitrary. Several Members of Parliament have voiced their concern on these rules, under which anyone can demand the scrubbing of information online on flimsy grounds, and entities hosting the content must act in 36 hours. There is little surprise that a Rajya Sabha MP, P. Rajeeve, has moved a motion calling for the annulment of the intermediaries rules. His move has inspired a signature campaign and gained wide popular support. The best course open to the Centre is to revisit the IT Act and rules, and hold a national consultation of the kind organised by Jairam Ramesh on genetically modified crops. Cyber terrorism cannot be used as a bogey to subvert constitutional guarantees on free speech.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-land-of-the-not-so-free/article12969029.ece
21,4,2012,Winds of change in the Americas,"The sixth Summit of the Americas, which ended in Cartagena on Sunday, may have ended without a final statement of consensus but the states present succeeded in opening three major issues for fresh discussion and policy. One was trade, an increasingly important matter in view of the 14 per cent contribution to global GDP which Latin America and the Caribbean countries make, not to mention the possible doubling of the region's per capita income by 2030. A key point here is that China is now the leading trade partner of several Latin American states, and has ended the regional economic supremacy of the United States. The second main issue was just as significant, as all present accepted that the war on drugs, with its punitive prohibitionism, has failed. The so-called war, instituted by the U.S. in 1969, has generated institutional corruption and organised violence so widespread that many Latin American countries have at times come close to civil war; in Mexico, 50,000 have died in drug-related killings. At the recent meeting, the Colombian and Guatemalan Presidents put forward alternatives — such as decriminalisation and the legal regulation of currently illegal drugs — on the agenda. The change here lies in the fact that although the U.S. in particular will not back decriminalisation yet, President Barack Obama accepted it is a legitimate subject for debate.
It was, however, the summit's third topic, namely Cuba, which revealed the greatest political changes in the Americas. Following the U.S.-Canadian veto on Cuba's attendance, President Rafael Correa of Ecuador boycotted the event; Venezuela's President, Hugo Chávez, who also stayed away, sharply criticised the North American attitude, with good reason. To start with, at its 2009 meeting in Honduras, the Organization of American States, the membership of which is coterminous with that of the recent Summit, repealed its 1962 resolution excluding Cuba. Secondly, the Obama administration itself has enabled Cuban-Americans to travel more freely to Cuba and send money there. Washington's anti-Havana attitude at the summit, therefore, looks anachronistic and hypocritical, driven more by domestic political compulsions than any genuine concerns about “democratic reform”. If the Cartagena summit has demonstrated that the U.S. can no longer dominate its southern neighbours, it is now up to the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean to consolidate their own associations such as the Community of Latin American and Caribbean Nations (CELAC) and Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) and strengthen their ties with other rising regions, especially India, Asia and Africa.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Winds-of-change-in-the-Americas/article12969030.ece
23,4,2012,Don't shoot the messenger,"The outcome of the Press Council of India's decision to challenge the Allahabad High Court gag order on reporting the movement of troops will be an acid test of how far the judiciary can go in curbing media freedoms. The court's order — which directed senior officials in the Home and I&B departments of the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government to ensure that no news on the subject is put out by the print and electronic media — was issued following the recent and sensational Indian Express report on the alleged panic in the civilian administration caused by the movement of two Army units towards New Delhi. It is true that the security of the State is one of the eight heads under which reasonable restrictions may be imposed on freedom of expression under Article 19(2) of the Constitution. But it is inexplicable how the further reporting of these troop movements is related to “official defence secrecy and security of the country” or why there should be a gag on this merely because the already published reports have caught “attention at the highest level in the defence as well as the Government.”
After all, the first reports of these ostensibly sensitive troop movements were based on briefings by Army sources themselves and published much earlier on a website as a routine story on “manoeuvres designed to test [the Army's] readiness for quick armed intervention in India's immediate neighbourhood.” Moreover, there is a vast difference, as PCI chairman Markandey Katju has suggested, between reporting troop movements in wartime, which could benefit the adversary and seriously jeopardise national security, and a ban that places such restrictions on standard operational manoeuvres in peace time. True, the Indian Express report, despite its many hedges and caveats, caused unnecessary consternation because of the exaggerated manner in which it was displayed. But the right of the newspaper or any other media organisation to report on this or any other sensitive matter cannot be questioned unless it clearly transgresses the Lakshman rekha of reasonable restrictions laid down in the Constitution. The higher judiciary, which has a long and commendable record of upholding the right to free expression, has generally recognised that this comes at a price. Such things as sensationalism, exaggeration, mistaken judgments and even false statements made honestly are likely to occur, or at least cannot be totally eliminated, in an environment in which free speech is guaranteed. The answer to this is to defend the right to free expression even as you criticise the specific instances in which it is abused. It is not to shoot the messenger.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dont-shoot-the-messenger/article3342924.ece
23,4,2012,Part of the problem,"Tamil 'Eelam' is for Tamil Nadu politicians what the full moon is for hungry wolves. All their howling is indicative, not of any yearning for a distant, dreamy Eelam, but of the baser urges of the politics of the here-and-now. Former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, who heads the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, a prominent constituent of the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre, gave a call last week for the creation of a separate nation for Tamils in Sri Lanka, on the lines of Montenegro, South Sudan, East Timor and Kosovo. Far from forcing the Sri Lankan government into reaching a settlement on devolution of powers to the minority Tamils, Mr. Karunanidhi appears to have further aided the politicisation of this sensitive issue in Tamil Nadu. Political parties in the State have quite rightly looked up to the United Nations as the instrument to ensure the political and economic rights of the Sri Lankan Tamils. In no small measure, pressure from the parties in the State contributed to the shaping of India's stand on the recent resolution against Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. But to suggest that the U.N. conduct a referendum for the division of Sri Lanka on ethnic lines can only have the effect of prompting the Mahinda Rajapaksa government to resist all international efforts to speed up the peace and reconciliation process. Unreasonable demands and suggestions articulated on their behalf will achieve little other than worsening an already bad situation for the Sri Lankan Tamils.
In any case, Kosovo or Montenegro, South Sudan or East Timor is not comparable to Sri Lanka. But then Mr. Karunanidhi was only looking for instances of new nations formed on the basis of referendums or external intervention, and not seeking to make a cogent case for the resolution of Tamil grievances in Sri Lanka. In 2000, the model of political division he cited was that of Czechoslovakia, which split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In Mr. Karunanidhi's words, this was “separation without bloodshed”, a peaceful resolution of a conflict in a country with sharp divisions. However, instead of making loud noise to no purpose in Tamil Nadu, the DMK leader would do well to raise the Sri Lankan Tamils issue with the Centre, quietly or otherwise, and help in the formulation of a foreign policy approach that can yield quick results for the long-suffering Tamils in the island while preserving the unity and integrity of Sri Lanka. For good reasons, India has a firm position on seeking a solution within a united Sri Lanka. Political parties in Tamil Nadu should see the sense behind this.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/part-of-the-problem/article3342925.ece
24,4,2012,Dealing with the Maoist threat,"The kidnap of a District Collector in Chhattisgarh even as the Odisha hostage crisis remains unresolved suggests the Maoists are looking at soft ways of escalating their ongoing war against the Indian state. This targeting of non-combatants, even if they are officials or representatives of the state, must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. That it directly refutes the Maoist claim to be battling for a higher purpose is also something that needs emphasising. Just as states undermine their democratic credentials by adopting extreme or authoritarian methods in fighting insurgents or terrorists, the use of anti-people means by those who claim to be fighting on behalf of “the people” robs their cause of any legitimacy. Of course, for the Central and State governments involved, the latest kidnapping highlights a key dilemma: every effort must be made to secure the release of the hostages, including negotiations, but care must be taken not to send a signal to the Maoists, or indeed other extremist groups, that abductions pay. The principle of never negotiating with hostage takers is a fine one in principle; in practice, however, it is always difficult to implement when specific situations arise. Governments need to have room to manoeuvre in dealing with such crises and neither the media, nor the courts, should do anything that ends up tying the executive's hands.
The Maoists are clearly expanding and deepening their footprint across a significant, largely contiguous, geographical area. They have terrain advantages, and would seem to have some element of sporadic ground support. To meet what Prime Minister Manmohan Singh a few years ago rightly identified as the most serious threat currently facing India, the Centre needs to have a well thought out strategy. This is not a challenge that can be overcome by brute force. Counter-insurgency tactics that involve the use of civilian vigilantes and “Special Police Officers” have proved to be counter-productive. They have also led to large-scale rights violations in Chhattisgarh and elsewhere. The security forces need better training and resources. Better intelligence gathering is also required. The need to ensure better coordination between the Centre and the States concerned cannot be over-emphasised. If indeed the current hostage situations are resolved through negotiation, the Centre ought to give some thought to the merits of a wider dialogue with the Maoists. Neither the government nor the left-wing extremist is in a position to overwhelm the other. Political wisdom lies in bringing about a negotiated end to a conflict that that has held the whole of the ‘Dandakaraya' region hostage for years.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dealing-with-the-maoist-threat/article3346306.ece
24,4,2012,TB or not TB,"With tuberculosis killing two people every three minutes and the number of people with drug-resistant TB increasing manifold every passing day, even the reports of the first few patients being detected with “totally drug-resistant” tuberculosis — i.e., resistant to all first- and second-line TB drugs — in Mumbai in January did little to spur the government into acting decisively. On the contrary, as in the case of the NDM-1 superbug case, its initial reaction was on expected lines — denying and rubbishing the find. That the World Health Organisation is yet to formally recognise the TDR-TB term cannot be cited as a reason for inaction. TDR-TB was first reported from Italy in 2007 and Iran in 2009. Worse still, the government has further exposed its lack of ingenuity and leadership with its meek response: launching a website next month for “monitoring and tracking” patients with drug-resistant TB, and using the data from the DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short course) programme for creating “awareness.” This move is nothing but a reflection of its unwillingness to tackle a potentially dangerous public health problem. The government is fully aware that the DOTS programme does not cover all TB patients in the country. With a large number of them, including those with drug resistance, turning to private practitioners, even the most robust tracking procedure will never be able to solve the problem. If the government's focussed TB programme is miserably equipped to handle drug-resistant TB, the state of private health care to tackle such cases is appalling. As on 2010, there were nearly 300 million TB-infected patients, and as per 2006 data, more than 110,000 had multidrug-resistant TB.
The first and most important step for tackling the disease is to make every medical practitioner accountable and treat every patient correctly. This can be achieved only by making TB a notifiable disease. The only reason the government has not done this is that the actual number of cases will be known. But hiding the truth is no way of solving the problem; instead it will only compound the crisis. Educating doctors about correct drug regimens and testing protocols should be done simultaneously. Increasing the number of drug-resistance testing centres and the use of new rapid drug susceptibility technology must become a routine for every patient who fails to respond to first-line drugs. These measures will go a long way in preventing the number of people developing resistance to existing drugs. Such bold initiatives are required and should be implemented swiftly if the government is serious about preventing a crisis from getting out of control.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tb-or-not-tb/article3346308.ece
25,4,2012,A travesty of justice,"The acquittal of 23 people convicted by a lower court in the gruesome Bathani Tola massacre case is a shocking indictment of the country's criminal justice system. The mass murder of a group of 21 Dalits and Muslims, most of them women and children, by the notorious caste militia, the Ranvir Sena, took place in Bihar's Bhojpur district in 1996 in broad daylight. The basic facts about the ghastly crime are not contested. The judgment of the two-member Bench of the Patna High Court is a lengthy condemnation of the manner this ghastly crime was investigated and prosecuted — a process it felt was so full of infirmities that “unfortunately…[those] who actually perpetuated the crime, got away with it.” The judgment is a story of compounded procedural and other follies. These include the uncertainty about exactly when the FIR was registered; the failure to recover a single cartridge from the site despite hundreds of rounds being fired; the fact that not even one firearm used in the massacre was seized; the inexplicable decision not to cross-examine some defence witnesses; and the internal contradictions and conflicting accounts put out by the prosecution witnesses.
Whether the Court was correct in dismissing all the eight private or independent eyewitnesses as unreliable — the conviction by the sessions court was based on the testimony of two of them — is bound to be called into question. Its disbelief that some of these witnesses could have hidden in close proximity to the village and watched the massacre — on the ground that the bloodthirsty mob would have found and liquidated them — is at best a questionable conjecture. What is certain, though, is that justice has been denied and that it will be a travesty if the perpetrators of this massacre are allowed to get away. The Bihar government, which has said it will appeal the judgment, must prepare the strongest possible case. While it is finally up to the courts to decide on guilt and innocence, the tragedy of Bathani Tola exposes the elitist biases of the country's media, which has paid scant attention to this miscarriage of justice. When the combination of a shoddy investigation and hostile witnesses led to all nine accused being acquitted in the high-profile Jessica Lal murder case a few years ago, it was the spirited campaign by the media that resulted in the Delhi High Court taking suo moto notice of the acquittal and reopening the case. It is important that we do not allow our attention to be diverted and justice to be subverted in this case merely because the victims were poor and landless Dalits living in a remote village in the Bihar hinterland.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-travesty-of-justice/article3350177.ece
25,4,2012,"Down but not out, yet","The first round of the French presidential election has given the Socialist Party (PS) and the French left as a whole their best results since 1988, with the PS candidate François Hollande winning 28.6 per cent of the vote to President Nicolas Sarkozy's 27.2. A runoff between the two men will he held on May 6. Mr. Hollande's performance, on a platform promising that he would govern from the left and bring about significant change, was broadly expected. Though his winning margin is not as high as the left hoped it would be, it makes Mr. Sarkozy the first incumbent to lose the first round since the Fifth Republic was founded in 1958. He has undoubtedly lost a lot of his earlier appeal for an electorate whose mind is on economic regeneration rather than his flashy, media-directed, self-aggrandising style. As things stand, Mr. Sarkozy could also become the first sitting President to lose office since Valéry Giscard d'Estaing was defeated by François Mitterrand in 1981, unless a right-wing consolidation takes place. The fact is that the first round brought unexpected support for the far-right National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen, whose campaign grew progressively more strident and xenophobic and who has even made admiring references to an anti-Semitic French journalist executed after the war for collaborating with the Nazis. Worryingly, the FN won 17.9 per cent of the vote. These voters, should they cast a ballot in the second round, are bound to plump for Mr. Sarkozy.
In his second-round campaigning, Mr. Sarkozy can be expected to intensify his anti-immigrant rhetoric in the hope of ensuring that enough of Ms Le Pen's supporters come out on May 6. But he is likely to pay a corresponding price by losing centre-right support. His rival, on the other hand, will face problems achieving the 50 per cent he will need. The left polled a total of only 44 per cent in the first round, which means Mr. Hollande will have to attract voters either from François Bayrou's centre-right following or rely on the unlikely possibility that Sarkozy supporters will be so alarmed by the National Front's performance that they will defect in large numbers. The coherence and determination shown by the far-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon were the surprise of the campaign, but the 11 per cent he won will not add enough wind to the Socialists' sails. Mr. Hollande's own major promises, such as far greater regulation of finance and a 75 per cent tax on incomes of over a million euros, have considerable resonance. To snatch the presidency from Mr. Sarkozy, however, Mr. Hollande will need a wider range of voter support. This election is still in the balance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/down-but-not-out-yet/article3350181.ece
26,4,2012,A bond that is no panacea,"A government bond to be executed by doctors going to the United States for higher studies cannot by itself solve India's human resource crisis. The first order priority must be to strengthen the public health system if a significant shift in the availability of doctors is to be achieved. It is worth pointing out that just over a quarter of the doctors in India reside in rural areas, and they serve nearly three quarters of the population. Under the terms of the bond announced by Health and Family Welfare Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, a doctor who fails to return after studies in the U.S. will not be allowed to practise medicine in America because the Indian government would revoke its No Objection Certificate. Naturally, such a measure would appear to be in India's interest, serving as a barrier to migration of doctors who are desperately needed at home. But it is a coercive measure all the same, and does not meet a key principle of the World Health Organization on recruitment, which is not to limit the freedom of health professionals to migrate. There is, of course, a strong case to be made for more doctors to be available. India is, quite depressingly, listed among the countries that face a crisis in human resources for health. There are six doctors per 10,000 population, which is woefully low, in comparison with, say, Cuba which has 59. China has 16, the U.K. 54 and the U.S., 55.
The goal of the Health Ministry should be a circular migration of doctors, which would bring well-trained professionals back, to train others. This suggestion in the voluntary WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel is more likely to encourage doctors to come back, and avoid pushing them to other foreign shores. Building an ethical code into the admissions process is also necessary. Among the arguments made in support of a bond is the high cost of medical education, much of it funded by the public. Producing doctors is undoubtedly expensive and there is a legitimate expectation of a social dividend. A well thought out plan to make suitable rural service a pre-requisite to be eligible for higher studies may yield some benefit. Again, if training costs are high, it is equally true that advances in medicine can come to India only by enabling global exposure. The way forward is to heavily invest in human resources as part of an expansion of the public health system. Many African and Asian nations are today doing just that. India needs to also build a good health professionals migration database and set up a designated authority for this. Many public-spirited doctors have already made a reverse migration, and many more will follow, if the policy emphasis is on inducting them into a strong public health system.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-bond-that-is-no-panacea/article3353729.ece
26,4,2012,"Fake notes, real threat","The counterfeit currency menace is growing in India. In 2011, the rupee appeared to have emerged as the counterfeiter's currency of choice internationally, displacing the greenback. By all accounts, Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) continue to be pumped in — much of it from abroad. A recent report compiled by the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Union Finance Ministry estimated a 400 per cent increase over recent years in counterfeit transactions in India's financial channels. During 2010-11, the agency detected “4,23,539 incidents of FICN with a face value of over Rs 35 crore.” The 2011-12 figures are higher. According to a 2011 report of the U.S. State Department, India faces an increasing inflow of ‘high-quality' counterfeit currency, produced primarily in Pakistan, and smuggled in through multiple international routes including Nepal and Bangladesh. Terrorist and underworld networks could be using the fakes to finance their activities in India. India has repeatedly blamed Pakistan as one of the major originating points. Porous borders facilitate the flow. The magnitude of the problem has not even been quantified. Economic crimes involving black money, hawala foreign exchange remittances and money laundering are but concomitants.
Gone are the days when a fake note could be detected by touch and feel: today, it has become almost impossible to make the distinction as counterfeiters employing sophisticated methods and materials have succeeded in replicating almost all the security features. In the face of such an organised and high-tech threat, in addition to stricter policing and intelligence gathering, India needs to deploy the right technological options on a massive scale to catch and root out the counterfeiters. The kind of machines that Indian banks need at the cash counters are those that can not only verify images but also check the chemical and physical properties of paper, ink, resins and other materials used. India should also look at options in pattern recognition technology and equip banking and other financial channels with them on a wide scale in order that every single note that passes through them are checked. The government should seek global expertise to incorporate more security features in currency notes. It also needs to indigenise the production of currency note paper and end the current dependence on imports from producers who supply it to multiple customers. India should raise the issue effectively at the inter-governmental meeting of the Financial Action Task Force to be held in June. This is a challenge worth investing in.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fake-notes-real-threat/article3353733.ece
27,4,2012,The return of Bofors,"Bofors has often been likened to Banquo's ghost. However, the Rs. 64 crore howitzer pay-off scandal would make a better comparison with James Cameron's Terminator series, judging by its ability to surprise and startle even after the curtain has been rung down. Indeed, the more the Congress has shut the doors on Bofors, the more it has returned to embarrass the party. A quarter century after the bribery allegations broke over Swedish radio and were followed up in painstaking detail by The Hindu, the case has officially reached a dead end. The dramatis personae of the period, including Rajiv Gandhi who lost an election to the scam, have passed away, while in March last year a Delhi court allowed the Central Bureau of Investigation to withdraw charges against Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi. Curiously, just months earlier, an Indian tax tribunal held that commissions had been paid into the accounts of Mr. Quattrocchi and middleman Win Chadha. Not surprisingly, Mr. Q's incredible luck with the law only served to strengthen the suspicion that he was involved and had been hustled to safety by an Indian government worried about where the trail would end.
Now, Bofors and Mr. Q are back in the news. In an interview to Chitra Subramaniam, then The Hindu's Geneva correspondent, Sten Lindstrom revealed himself to be the man who blew the whistle on the scandal. Mr. Lindstrom, who was Sweden's police chief at the time, made two points of political interest. First that there was no material evidence to show Rajiv Gandhi had taken a bribe. Second, there was conclusive evidence against the Italian businessman who had escaped being nailed because Indian investigators had deliberately mishandled the case. The Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party grabbed the story but to make opposite points. The Congress latched on to the part about its leader being in the clear while for the BJP, the most important revelation was confirmation of Mr. Q's role: The long-suspected “Italian connection” had finally and irrevocably been proved. In truth, the interview offers neither party any reason to celebrate. Thanks to 2G and other scams, the public perception of the Congress is of a party steeped in corruption. It can do without Mr. Quattrocchi turning up at the party's doorstep. The BJP can rejoice at its rival's fate, but it must answer questions on its own failure while in office to pursue the case and secure the Italian middleman's conviction. Earlier, V.P. Singh named Rajiv Gandhi as a beneficiary but was unable to prove the charge as Prime Minister. The fact is that not one government comes out unscathed from l'affaire Bofors.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-return-of-bofors/article3357416.ece
27,4,2012,Land as largesse,"Despite the courts repeatedly cautioning and often striking down the allocation of public resources to private parties on specious grounds, there seems to be no end to the whimsical and opaque ways of the netas and babus. The latest to join the dubious and growing list of those hauled up for improper allotment of land, one of the most sought after assets, is a former Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Vilasrao Deshmukh. Last week, the Supreme Court severely criticised the State government for blatantly short-circuiting procedures and allotting about 20 acres of prime land in Goregaon to a private company for a paltry sum of money. It saw through the arbitrariness and rightly cancelled the allotment. The doling out of largesse has become a regular practice with all political parties. In 2006, the Madhya Pradesh government gave 20 acres in Bhopal district to the Kushabhau Thakre Memorial Trust, which had prominent members of the BJP as its trustees. Not only did the government overrule the revenue department's suggestion that the land be auctioned to generate maximum revenue, it allocated the property for a meagre annual lease rent of one rupee. The court rejected this allotment as “a blatant act of favouritism.” In another incident, a few years later, the Left Front government in West Bengal allotted land to Sourav Ganguly for starting a school in Kolkata. This too did not stand up to legal scrutiny and was quashed.
The usefulness of discretionary allotment of land in justifiable instances such as slum development or post disaster rehabilitation is understandable. But favouritism must not be allowed to masquerade as public interest. The question is not whether the executive has a right to work out policies for resource allocation as it sees fit. Rather it is whether the distribution of resources has best served the common good. Was the policy discriminatory and did it favour a select few? The State is only a steward of resources. Political parties in power cannot treat them as a part of their personal fiefdom. Even when claims were made, as in the above mentioned cases, that the land was given for a public purpose such as starting an educational institution, the courts have consistently ruled that “in order to achieve a bona fide end, the means must also justify the end.” The government is obligated to follow settled procedures and cannot surreptitiously favour an applicant, which will deny opportunity to other eligible persons or institutions from seeking public resources. Management of community assets — be they land, mines or spectrum — must be directed by definitive guidelines to ensure the transactions are transparent, fair and genuinely in public interest.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/land-as-largesse/article3357417.ece
28,4,2012,Monsoon reading,"Come April, it is time for an important ritual in the run up to the monsoon — the Indian Meteorological Department's forecast of how the rainy season, which still sets the pace for so much of the country's economy, will turn out. This early in the game — the rains typically set in between the end of May and early June — and without a scientifically reliable crystal ball, the IMD has an unenviable task. The monsoon is a hugely complex phenomenon, and scientists are still in the process of deciphering how the ocean and atmosphere interact to decide its progress. Without such understanding, attempting to predict how the rains will fare can look rather like soothsaying. The IMD's forecast for this year's monsoon used a statistical model to estimate the probabilities for various outcomes. It predicted an 88 per cent probability of the monsoon turning out to be ‘normal' in the sense that scientists generally use the term (meaning a season when the nationwide rainfall is between 90 per cent and 110 per cent of the long period average). Rainfall data for over a hundred years shows that seven years out of ten turn out that way. The IMD forecast would, therefore, appear to indicate enhanced odds for a ‘normal' monsoon.
But that prediction needs to be taken with some degree of caution. How the sea surface temperatures of the equatorial Pacific, especially in the central part of the ocean, evolve in the coming months can impact the monsoon. Several coupled models, which attempt to simulate processes in the oceans and atmosphere, are already suggesting that the central Pacific will warm and a weak El Nino could develop as a result. An El Nino often adversely impacts the monsoon. At present, those models do not show rainfall deficits over India. But that could change as time goes on. However, it is noteworthy that even if the monsoon does turn out to be ‘normal,' the IMD's probabilistic forecast already indicates that it is likely to be towards the lower end of that range. The category it terms as ‘below normal', with the monsoon rains between 90 per cent and 96 per cent of the long period average, has a probability of 24 per cent. That is higher than its climatological probability of 17 per cent. How the monsoon fares will also depend on what happens in the Indian Ocean. There are some indications that this ocean too may not favour a good monsoon. Such uncertainties over the fate of a monsoon should diminish as scientists gain more insights into the phenomenon and consequently are able to improve models that simulate it. One hopes that the National Monsoon Mission, which seeks to do just this and has now received governmental approval, succeeds — and soon.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/monsoon-reading/article3361578.ece
28,4,2012,The Sudan challenge,"The sudden escalation in the long-simmering tension between Sudan and South Sudan is something neither country can sustain without inflicting serious hurt on their respective populations. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) made South Sudan the world's newest country in July 2011, but disputes continue over provinces such as South Kordofan in the Nuba region, Abyei on the border, and Blue Nile. There are also tensions over oil; landlocked South Sudan's pipelines run northwards through Sudan, but it has 75 per cent of the former unitary country's oil reserves and has closed down further supplies, possibly because transit fees were in dispute. The latest fighting has seen the number of refugees in the South rise to 100,000, almost all of whom are already at risk in the fierce dry heat, with severe flooding and water-borne diseases awaiting them when the rains start in a few weeks' time; 30,000 more have fled to Ethiopia. Recent refugees tell of air attacks ordered by President Omar al-Bashir's government in Khartoum, and the Southern President Salva Kiir, during an official visit to China, announced that Sudan had declared war on his country, though he himself had presided over an attack on Heglig in the second week of April; 35,000 civilians are on the move as a result, despite the fact that Juba has now withdrawn its forces. In all this, it is easy to forget the two million who fled their homes in the western province of Darfur.
As so often, the key problems are political. The CPA left the status of South Kordofan and Blue Nile subject to referenda, but those are yet to be held. Secondly, Khartoum had neglected Kordofan for years, mainly because a substantial proportion of its population are Christians or have their own strand of Islam; the province had received no benefits from its oilfields. A rigged 2011 election there led to an uprising, followed by Sudanese reprisals, which were also inflicted on Blue Nile. Worse still, Southern militias are operating in Sudan, and vice versa. In this cauldron of mutual fear and violence, international intervention can achieve little. China, which buys oil from both sides, has long refrained from interference in the internal affairs of its African trading partners. The African Union (AU) and the United Nations Security Council have called for hostilities to cease, but neither side is willing to listen. If there is hope, it lies in the fact that Egypt had a hand in the South's withdrawal from Heglig; the AU, possibly through Egypt, might be able to put enough pressure on both sides to cease their violence. The AU, however, must not stop trying to reach a settlement.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-sudan-challenge/article3361583.ece
29,4,2012,Looking beyond the downgrade,"There are two ways of looking at the downgrade of India's rating outlook by Standard & Poor's (S&P) last week. The first is to dismiss it as something that points to what is obvious to all — a deterioration in major macro-economic indicators, whether fiscal deficit, current deficit or GDP growth. Indeed, this was how the markets reacted, shrugging off the news and showing neither shock nor surprise. To some extent this is understandable because the Reserve Bank of India had already sounded a warning in its monetary policy statement of April 17 pointing to worrisome data. The other choice is to take the downgrade in outlook from “stable” to “negative” as a wake-up call and initiate steps to put the economy back on the rails, which is ideally how the government should view the development. Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee struck the right note with his statement that the downgrade should be taken as a “timely warning,” even as he rightly pointed out that there was no reason to panic. Yet, more than words, what's needed is action, which alone can prevent a downgrade of the sovereign rating to below investment level in the next review by the rating agencies.
Tough decisions are necessary to rein in subsidies, especially on fuel and fertilizers. An increase in the retail price of petrol, diesel and LPG will help the government rein in the fiscal deficit even as oil imports may drop as consumers cut down consumption. With oil being one of the two causes (the other being gold) for the rising import bill, lower imports will also have a salutary effect on the external payments situation. Gold imports may decline following the imposition of a 4 per cent duty in the Budget but the government needs to watch the trend closely and if necessary increase the duty further to keep imports in check. There is pressure from some quarters to liberalise FDI norms in the retail, insurance and banking sectors, the argument being that such a move will boost sentiment among investors. But these proposals are politically contentious and it is not even clear they will deliver the desired impact. For the moment, other reform measures such as the fast-track implementation of the Goods and Services Tax need to be given a conscious push. A trend towards fiscal consolidation together with positive reform measures will also strengthen the RBI's hand in easing interest rates further. This will hopefully boost investment in the corporate sector, giving a leg up to GDP growth. However, none of the above can be achieved in the absence of political consensus. And that appears to be the biggest risk to the economy at this point in time.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/looking-beyond-the-downgrade/article3367736.ece
30,4,2012,A clash averted,"In purely constitutional terms, the battle between Pakistan's Supreme Court and its government has thrown up no clear winners or losers. That may be just as well. The court's sentence to Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani for contempt — imprisonment until the rising of the bench — and the reasons it gave for this token punishment were an admission of the limitations of the judiciary's powers. Contrary to popular expectation that Mr. Gilani would be sent to jail for the maximum imprisonment of six months, the court considered the consequences of the conviction — a likely disqualification from the National Assembly and consequently from the office of the Prime Minister — serious enough by themselves. Again, instead of pronouncing him disqualified from parliament, the court has left this decision to the National Assembly, where it is the Speaker who will adjudicate. Pakistan has been spared the political confusion of a jailed Prime Minister, and the possible institutional clash that might have ensued. But there is no getting away from the conviction itself. The court had directed the government more than two years ago to write to the Swiss authorities asking for a reopening of money laundering cases against President Asif Ali Zardari. It was the failure to do this that led to the court slapping contempt charges. Unimpressed by Mr. Gilani's plea that he went by the advice of his government on presidential immunity, it asserted itself by convicting him.
In the political arena, the Pakistan People's Party has tried to make capital of the whole episode, projecting it as a continuation of its struggle with the establishment since the day the Supreme Court sent its founder, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, to the gallows. Indeed, there was something more than inelegant in the way the judiciary singled out Mr. Zardari's cases for follow-up when it struck down in 2009 a Musharraf-era ordinance closing thousands of corruption cases. Mr. Gilani has flaunted his conviction as a badge of honour, spurning opposition calls for his resignation on the ground that he still enjoys the confidence of the National Assembly. However, the problem with victimology is that while it helps to motivate the faithful, it does not win over anyone else. Mr. Zardari is perceived as corrupt by many Pakistanis; and the PPP is seen as going to any extent to protect him, even if it means defying the law. Already in the home stretch of its five-year term, the party may believe this is a battle it can fight better on the electoral turf. But there is more than one rival contender, and a less cynical use of democratic processes would not hurt a party that can rightfully take credit for putting Pakistan back on the democratic path.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-clash-averted/article3367744.ece
1,5,2012,Perks for life,"Former Speakers are seeking special perks. And the Central government seems to be in a generous mood. According to former Lok Sabha Speaker P.A. Sangma, as reported in the media on Monday, in-principle approval has been accorded to his proposal to extend the perquisites and privileges now reserved for former Presidents, Vice-Presidents, and Prime Ministers to former Speakers of the Lok Sabha. The rationale for seeking this largesse, if at all there is one, is that the Speaker is the only constitutional authority — Number Six in the Warrant of Precedence or the protocol list — who does not enjoy special perquisites after the conclusion of his or her term. Former Speakers, at present, are entitled “only” to pension and ordinary benefits that are also available to all former Members of Parliament. If anything, the argument should be for dropping or curbing the special perks which come with retirement from all constitutional posts and not for adding more former office-holders to the list. The reason high office comes with privileges is because they make it easier for the incumbent to do the job. Logically, therefore, the privileges of office should end with the term in office. This is the way it is in virtually every democracy. Of course, the state has a continuing duty to provide security, where threats exist, and secretarial assistance. But few countries barring India provide homes and motor cars to retired Presidents or Prime Ministers, let alone Speakers, for the rest of their lives.
President Pratibha Patil moved quickly and correctly to quell a snowballing controversy by foregoing the Pune retirement home which was to be constructed for her on land owned by the Defence Ministry. Rashtrapati Bhavan refuted what it said were “fallacious observations” about the home that had been made in the media. At the same time, ordinary people are inclined to see any special benefits extended to former constitutional functionaries as excessive. Though MPs and Ministers compare themselves with bureaucrats while seeking retirement benefits, government servants retire after 30 or more years of service, and not five years like MPs. If former Speakers are granted the privileges they reportedly are seeking, it would only be a matter of time before former Deputy Chairpersons of the Rajya Sabha or former Deputy Speakers of the Lok Sabha demand similar perks and benefits. And why should the poor Speakers of all our State Assemblies be left behind? The issue goes beyond the cost or scale of this exercise. At stake is a fundamental republican principle: that people holding constitutional office for limited terms ought not to enjoy special privileges once they retire.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/perks-for-life/article3371380.ece
1,5,2012,"1,18,474 too many","If only laws could eliminate all that they prohibit, India would have been free of the scourge of manual scavenging decades ago. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Bill, which is to be introduced in the monsoon session of Parliament, is another attempt to prevent employment of people in the cleaning, handling or carrying of human excreta. Despite the renewed stress on rehabilitation in the present bill, doubts persist about the will and the ability of the Central and State governments to end this dehumanising activity. The Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, 1993, was indeed meant to address the very same issue, but implementation was lax, and tens of thousands of people continue to be engaged in manual scavenging. Not a single person was convicted under the 1993 law, although many States confirmed the prevalence of manual scavenging. According to figures released by the government last year, there were 1,18,474 manual scavengers or their dependents identified under the Self-employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) launched in 2007. Of course, one of the difficulties in eliminating this activity is the poor sanitation level in rural India where dry latrines remain in use. In the absence of networked sewerage facilities, even local bodies engage workers to manually clean septic tanks. Manual scavenging, then, cannot be just wished away without improving overall sanitation in the interior areas of India.
The proposal for the present bill came after the matter was brought before the Supreme Court following an order of the Madras High Court that the personal appearance of high dignitaries, including those in the Prime Minister's Office, might be required if the Centre failed to amend the law. Until then, the government was content to allow the ordinary course of rural development, at its slow pace, to draw out the communities involved into other forms of livelihood. Schemes such as SRMS were helpful to many, but did not guarantee a full escape. Most of the manual scavengers belong to the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes, and last year the Union Ministry of Home Affairs told all States that engaging or employing a member of SCs and STs in manual scavenging may fall within the ambit of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. However, there is no record of anyone being convicted under this Act for engaging a person in manual scavenging. If the 2012 bill is to not merely set another passing deadline, comprehensive efforts from the Centre and the States that attack this abominable practice at different levels will have to be made.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/118474-too-many/article3371382.ece
2,5,2012,Last shot at justice,"The Supreme Court's ruling on the requirement of previous sanction to prosecute soldiers accused of committing crimes may have clarified matters as far as the legal provisions of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act are concerned but for the families of the five innocent men who were killed in a fake encounter at Pathribal, Jammu and Kashmir, in March 2000, it is still not clear whether or not they will receive justice. According to the chargesheet filed in the case by the Central Bureau of Investigation in 2006, the five Kashmiris were picked up at random by the security forces from in and around Anantnag and taken to a desolate place where they were killed in cold blood. An FIR was filed by a detachment of Army men from the 7 Rashtriya Rifles in which the claim was made that the five slain individuals were the terrorists who were responsible for the massacre of Sikh villagers in Chittisinghpora a few days before the ‘encounter'. The bodies of the five were exhumed and claimed as their own by villagers who had complained about their family members going missing just before the ‘encounter'. DNA testing was done to establish their identity in two stages. In the first stage, the samples were deliberately switched to thwart the investigation. When this was exposed, a second test was done which conclusively fixed the identity of the five. This was in 2003. A case of murder was then registered and the matter entrusted to the CBI.
The CBI quickly established the sordid facts and filed a chargesheet in a Srinagar court in 2006. Six years had already elapsed. That court offered the Army the chance of trying its men before a court martial but the offer was not accepted. It has taken another six years for the legal battles which ensued to finally be resolved, with the Supreme Court upholding the claim of the accused soldiers that Central government sanction was needed to prosecute them. By asking the Army to take a decision on whether it intends to court martial the accused, the Supreme Court has cut through the careful posturing of the Ministry of Defence on the matter. It bears noting that at no stage did the Ministry seek to discharge its own obligation to ensure justice under the Army Act in the face of the cold-blooded killing of five innocent civilians by senior officers. That obligation can no longer be shrugged aside. The CBI has been directed to seek sanction to prosecute from the government if the court martial option is not exercised within eight weeks, and a decision on that request has to be taken within three months. For the families of the victims, there is finally light at the end of the tunnel. For their sake, and the sake of Indian democracy, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh must do the right thing and ensure that the prosecution gets to have its day in court.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/last-shot-at-justice/article3374520.ece
2,5,2012,A blow for open access,"Harvard University's decision to ask faculty members to make their papers available in the university's open-access repository and choose open-access journals or those with reasonable subscription costs is a sign that the movement for affordable research is gaining ground. Harvard spends close to $3.75 million a year to subscribe to journals from large publishing houses. If this well funded university finds it “fiscally unsustainable” to continue paying such heavy subscription fees, the plight of less well-funded universities in developed countries and almost every institution in developing countries can well be imagined. The Ivy League institution's bold decision could turn out to be a harbinger of similar initiatives being adopted by other major universities. Last year, many novel strategies were adopted by institutions and governments seeking to reduce their dependence on publishing houses that wield ultimate control over the dissemination of scientific information. In September 2011, Princeton adopted a path-breaking policy to retain nonexclusive rights, except in certain cases, to papers published by its faculty. This will provide the University unmitigated freedom to make the research work freely accessible to researchers. The power of collective bargaining in bringing publishers to their knees was demonstrated last year when Research Libraries UK, acting on behalf of 30 member libraries, forced a price negotiation with two leading publishers. The British government made no bones about its keenness to make all research funded by it freely available when it announced its policy in December last year.
The British government's decision parallels that of the National Institutes of Health in the United States. The rationale is simple: taxpayers have a right to freely access the results of research carried out using their money. In fact, journals do not pay for the research; it's the same with researchers carrying out the work and scientists who peer-review the papers. But by virtue of being the gatekeepers of precious information, subscription-based journals charge a heavy fee. Publishers are now finding the tide turning against them as they maintain profit margins of “35 per cent and more.” Elsevier, in end February 2012 withdrew its support for the Research Works Act pending before Congress due to biting criticism and a boycott call by nearly 10,000 researchers. It may be a long battle, but thanks to the internet, open access will finally emerge victorious.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-blow-for-open-access/article3374522.ece
3,5,2012,Tragedy waiting to happen,"The revelation made by Assam's Inland Water Transport Department (IWTD) that the double-decker ferry boat that went down in the Brahmaputra had been running without a permit or licence since being built in 1994, points to the dismal state of safety enforcement in the public transport sector in this country in general. Shockingly, the authorities have revealed that there are currently 2,000 such motorised boats and ferries in the very district of Dhubri where the accident occurred, and that only 30 of them have valid permits. It has also become clear that the vessel that claimed the lives of possibly a couple of hundred out of the 300-plus people who were on board, was loaded far in excess of its capacity. While a sudden cyclonic storm had a major role in causing what could be one of the worst such tragedies in the country in recent times, the lack of attention with regard to elementary safety parameters is scandalous. The Brahmaputra river system that criss-crosses the region is both lifeline and bane. Each day, thousands of commuters depend on ferries and boats to cross the river, some of them perched precariously on the roof, as they go about the business of life: Assam's IWTD operates 74 ferry services, of which 50 ply across this mighty river. Overcrowding is a common sight, with two-wheelers carried on board adding to the crunch. Many of the vessels do not even have side-railings, let alone safety gear such as life buoys. This was a tragedy waiting to happen. That the search operation to recover the bodies of the victims has been continuing for days underlines the difficulties involved. The operation being carried out by members of the National Disaster Relief Force, the BSF and the Army has been a painstaking one. Swift currents have carried many bodies downstream into Bangladesh necessitating a request to that country for assistance in recovering and repatriating them.
Inland water transport is an inexpensive and efficient option wherever it is available and feasible, and relatively greener too. But these advantages are of little use unless minimum safety norms are ensured. It is hardly enough to wake up to this reality each time there is a deadly accident. Modernisation of the sector and strict enforcement of a comprehensive safety code should go hand in hand with the scaling up of this transportation option. Considering the circumstances in which the latest tragedy occurred, there is also a case to ensure that weather forecasting and monitoring data are made available to the operators of large ferry services at originating points and also on board in real-time. If the lessons of Dhubri lead to a better safety regimen for the water transport system, it would make for the development of the sector — and safer journeys.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tragedy-waiting-to-happen/article3381170.ece
3,5,2012,The world as its battlefield,"President Barack Obama, through his National Counterterrorism Adviser, John Brennan, has finally stated, at least in part, the United States position on the use of remotely piloted aircraft, or drones, to kill people elsewhere who allegedly pose a threat to the U.S. or its citizens. In a speech in Washington, DC on May 1, Mr. Brennan made several claims, for example, that targeting members of al-Qaeda in any other country is not illegal under international law and under Washington's own Authorization for the Use of Military Force Act if the country involved is “unable or unwilling” to take action itself, because the U.S. is in “armed conflict” with al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and “associated forces”. In addition, he held that drone strikes meet the requirement of necessity because the targets are of definite military value, that such strikes target only military objectives, and that the attacks are proportionate. He even claimed that the use of drones is “wise”, because it reduces the danger to U.S. personnel, and that it is “ethical and just”, because civilians are not intentionally targeted. Mr. Brennan did acknowledge that the U.S. is the first country to use drones regularly in conflict, and that other countries might not follow its self-proclaimed standards for drone attacks.
The entire American position is, however, riddled with problems. First, what Mr. Brennan has said does not tally even with what is known about U.S. drone use. A reliable estimate is that there have been 250 attacks, with 2,000 deaths resulting, including hundreds of civilians in all age-groups; even U.S. citizens Anwar al-Awlaki and his son, both civilians, were killed by a drone in Yemen in 2011 without prior judicial review in their own country. Secondly, the claim to precise definition of targets is at best dubious. As Princeton University's Gregory Johnsen notes, those members of al-Qaeda who had no prior knowledge of the 9/11 attacks and who have refused to participate in the group's activities in Yemen might not be exempted; the purported criteria for the attacks have not been made public. In addition, what the U.S. considers unwillingness on the part of another country might well be justified reliance on national sovereignty; the Pakistan parliament has denounced drone attacks there as a violation of its sovereignty and called for an end to them. The U.S., by making its own rules and disclosing them belatedly and only in general terms, has turned itself, as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) says, into judge, jury, and executioner. It has made the whole world its own battlefield, with itself as the sole judge of legitimate battle.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-world-as-its-battlefield/article3381172.ece
3,5,2012,Keep things dignified,"By all accounts, Bharatiya Janata Party leader Sushma Swaraj spoke out of turn when she voiced her views on electing the next President. While opposing Vice-President Hamid Ansari for the post, Ms Swaraj, quite shockingly, claimed he did not have the “stature” to be Rashtrapati. In framing its opposition to Mr. Ansari in this fashion, the BJP has not only showed its hand too soon, but also lowered the level of public discourse on an important issue. Saying Mr. Ansari does not have the stature to become the President is both an insult to the office of the Vice-President and to its incumbent, a diplomat and scholar widely regarded as one of the finest India has ever had. To acknowledge and state this is not necessarily to root for his elevation, for India is a vast country and there are any number of able and wise women and men who, like Mr. Ansari, can bring stature and dignity to the office of the President. The BJP is, of course, entitled to announce its support for, or opposition to, individual candidates, and to make it difficult for the government to have its way. But in doing so, a sense of proportion and balance is essential, for once the contestation is over, the President and the Opposition need to be able to look each other in the eye and work together. By failing to articulate her opposition to Mr. Ansari in political terms, Ms Swaraj has done a disservice to herself and her party.
That the BJP had not done adequate groundwork before laying its cards on the table became clear when other constituents of the National Democratic Alliance distanced themselves from Ms Swaraj's statement. Sharad Yadav, president of the Janata Dal (United), a key ally of the BJP, was quick to note that the views of Ms Swaraj were not those of the NDA as a whole. The Shiromani Akali Dal, another NDA ally, which would like its leader, Parkash Singh Badal, elected Vice-President, evidently wants the doors for negotiations with the Congress kept open. In the absence of an agreement with the Congress, Mr. Badal's chances would not be particularly bright. Even as parties weigh the merits and demerits of various candidates, they should be careful in their public pronouncements. The office of the President is political, but only in the wider sense of the term. The role of the President in the Indian constitutional system is such that her or his political affiliation or inclination confers little substantive advantage to a ruling party. The Opposition has a right to make the ruling party sweat a bit in the run up to the Presidential election. But it shouldn't forget that the only political battle which truly matters comes two years later, in 2014.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/keep-things-dignified/article3377573.ece
3,5,2012,When hunger strikes,"Perhaps the one positive aspect to an otherwise grim story of chronic hunger in India is the more frequent public acknowledgement of this sorry state of affairs. The latest monthly progress report of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) for Maharashtra says some 25 per cent of children below six years in Mumbai are severely malnourished. In January, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described the prevalence of child undernourishment as a national shame when releasing the Hunger and Malnutrition Report 2011. India's extremely low global ranking on quality of life indices used to be met with a smug denial until some years ago. That has slowly given way to an acknowledgement that the impressive growth of purchasing power among the upwardly mobile classes has remained anything but socially inclusive. The government's draft food security bill has rightly been criticised for failing to codify universal entitlements to food. But a policy of huge procurement of grains — with its attendant wastage — would sooner rather than later be unsustainable when hunger remains a mass phenomenon. A particularly disturbing aspect of the ICDS figures on Mumbai is that the city's north east suburb, notorious for its abysmally poor public health, maternal and child care services, is continuing on a downward spiral. This is the region that recorded an infant mortality rate twice the State average in 2009, as per the human development report for Greater Mumbai. The State government has now decided to set up an urban malnutrition mission, an idea worth replicating elsewhere.
Research has established that chronic maternal undernourishment leads to fetal deprivation, underweight babies and the greater proneness of children and adults to illnesses. The susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases in later life when nutritional deprivations occur in the womb is of particular concern in India. The obvious lesson here is that comprehensive interventions which enhance the agency of women would bring all round benefits for the entire population. There is also a strong case to extend the midday meal scheme to the 0-6 age group, given the very positive impact it has had on children of school going age. After all, a lack of early intervention adversely impacts learning and developmental outcomes. Concerted efforts in the 1990s saw an increase in school enrolments and retention rates and a modest decline in the prevalence of child labour. These culminated in the enactment of the law on the right to basic education. A sustained intervention in relation to malnutrition and attendant morbidity should not be beyond our reach.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/when-hunger-strikes/article3377575.ece
5,5,2012,Back to consensus in Nepal,"The agreement among Nepal's four major political formations — the Maoists, Nepali Congress (NC), Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist) and Madhesi Front — on the formation of a unity government could not have come a day too soon. A new constitution has to be promulgated in a little over three weeks. The Maoists will lead the government till it is finalised; the NC will lead the next government at the time of constitution promulgation with the mandate of holding the first elections under the new statute. This marks an important milestone in Nepal's political history as it revives the political consensus that had got fractured ever since the 2008 Constituent Assembly elections resulted in a surprise win for the Maoists. Four majority governments have been formed in the past four years, but this only deepened the polarisation. Progress in the peace process has now created grounds for a consensus. This new unity comes at a time when Nepal needs it most. In theory, being in government and opposition should have been no deterrent to working together on constitutional issues. In practice, however, politics acquired a ruthlessly competitive edge not conducive to consensual constitution making. The latest agreement will give all sides a stake in government, greater ownership in the new constitution, and enable them to tackle the transition following the adoption of the new statute.
The constitution will institutionalise the new political values of Nepal — democracy, republicanism, secularism, federalism, inclusiveness, social justice, and measures to address regional, caste, ethnic, class and gender based discrimination. The most contentious issue to be resolved is the nature of federalism. Mainstream national parties led by hill elites should recognise that the identity-related aspirations of marginalised communities — especially the ethnic groups and Madhesis — need to be taken into account while creating federal structures. The conservative elements in these parties seem reluctant to share any power. They must not be allowed a veto. At the same time, the Madhesi groups should know that a single province across the entire southern plains is not acceptable to diverse communities who live there. Indeed, the constitution must protect minority rights within the new provinces regardless of which group forms the dominant community there. In a low-key but effective manner, India — led by an able ambassador — has played an enormously constructive role in encouraging all sides to come to a compromise. It must continue to engage with all actors, and put its political weight behind the new unity formation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/back-to-consensus-in-nepal/article3384794.ece
5,5,2012,A place worth visiting,"When it comes to tourism and policymaking, successive Five Year Plans appear lost and directionless. Unfortunately, even the proposed recommendations by the expert group leading up to the preparation of the 12th Five Year Plan do not do much to erase the impression. For the last decade, the government has been trying to position tourism — the second largest service industry — as a national priority. The emphasis is on creating world-class infrastructure, effective marketing and enhancing competitiveness of destinations. To its credit, the government has consistently increased the funding over the years to achieve these objectives. Going by the current recommendations, this is set to rise steeply with about Rs.22,000 crore to be spent over the next five years. However, the question is has the money been well spent and the objectives achieved. The answers are not encouraging. The previous plans tried to do many things at the same time, such as promote leisure travel, actively pursue rural tourism and boost mega destinations. It is understandable that a sector as large as tourism needs multiple strategies, but they also need to converge. The past plans failed to deliver. Disappointingly, there appears to be no change in course even in the proposed recommendations.
If earlier plans unintelligently promoted fancy projects such as golf courses, the proposed one fatuously recommends theme parks as a key idea to increase the duration of stay of tourists at important destinations. About 20 parks — similar to the one in Sentosa, Singapore — are on the anvil. Apart from the question of whether the state should squander its precious resources on theme parks, such choices expose the lack of clarity on what the government wants to focus on. Domestic tourism, which contributes about three-fourths of the tourism economy, has not got the attention it deserves. Promoting budget accommodation is crucial to support this sector. The earlier policies, which depended on the State governments to create land banks for building them, failed to deliver. The argument that financial incentives and better coordination by the Planning Commission will ensure the wholehearted commitment of States to the project is unconvincing. The government should get its priorities right and stay focused on its avowed objective of making tourism people oriented. There is much to learn from successful Asian experiences such as Luang Prabang in Laos, where community-based tourism has been working well for years. Unless the destinations are comprehensively developed as good places to live in and their assets and people cared for, tourism cannot flourish and sustain.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-place-worth-visiting/article3384797.ece
7,5,2012,The insensitive Indian,"Two students from the North-East have died unnatural deaths in the last few days. Dana Sangma, a student from Meghalaya studying for an MBA at an institute in Gurgaon, committed suicide after she was accused by her college of cheating; Richard Loitam, a student of architecture from Manipur, was found dead in his hostel room in Bangalore from head injuries. In both cases, there have been allegations of callousness by the college authorities and by the police in investigating the deaths, and in Sangma's case, of driving her to taking her own life by discriminating against her. It took protests by the community of North-East students and others in these two cities and interventions in Parliament for the police to register a case under the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe Act in her case, and to start murder investigations into Loitam's death. While it is for the police to establish if college officials abetted Sangma's suicide, and to trace the culprits responsible for the other student's death, it is hard to disagree with the impression that has gained ground in the North-East after these two incidents that the institutional response might have been swifter had the students been from “mainland India”. Despite the increasing presence of people from the seven North-Eastern States — students as well as economic migrants — in all the major cities of India, there is a collective prejudice against them that is undeniable.
The prejudice is driven by racism, no less, and there is no point mincing words or being coy about this. This racism manifests itself on the Indian street in rude comments, stares, and facile judgments about the lifestyle and morals of people from the North-East. Such attitudes put women from the region at particular risk of sexual harassment and worse, as several incidents over the past few years have sadly demonstrated. People from the ‘seven sisters' — and especially from Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland — also face difficulties finding accommodation in many cities outside the region. The same is true of Kashmiri students and migrants, who often have to deal with the added burden of being harassed by local law enforcement. Last year, the Union Home Ministry issued an advisory to all States asking that Kashmiris not be singled out unnecessarily for police reporting merely because of their origin. Now the MHA has promised there will be “zero tolerance” for crimes against people from the North-East. India has spent an enormous amount of blood and treasure safeguarding its physical territory from militant groups, secessionists and foreign powers. It is time we stopped being insensitive towards the people who venture inland from those boundaries to seek a better life.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-insensitive-indian/article3391080.ece
7,5,2012,Understanding Osama's legacy,"Exactly a week before the May 2, 2011 raid that claimed his life, Osama bin Laden authored what may have been his last letter. From inside his Abbottabad safehouse, al-Qaeda's chief had watched as Hosni Mubarak and Zain al-Abedin Ben Ali were overthrown; he was convinced that “the fall of the remaining tyrants in the region was inevitable.” Bin Laden wrote: “If we double our efforts towards guiding, educating and warning Muslim people against half-solutions, by carefully presenting [our] advice, then the next phase will [lead to a triumph] for Islam”. In the year since bin Laden's death, experts have debated whether this is something al-Qaeda can in fact do. Earlier this week, the Combating Terrorism Centre at the West Point military academy in the United States released 17 documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's home in Abbottabad — 175 pages of a trove that is reported, though not confirmed, to run into thousands of pages. Like all primary documents, the Abbottabad letters need careful contextualisation and analysis, but do offer a new prism through which bin Laden's mindset, and legacy, can be examined.
Even though al-Qaeda has haemorrhaged leaders since 9/11, its inheritors have gained strength across the region. In 2003, Saudi jihadists set up al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which now controls significant parts of Yemen. The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan has waged a successful war of attrition against the United States in Afghanistan and terrorised the Pakistani state into near-submission, especially in the agency areas. Even though al-Qaeda in Iraq or al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb have fared less well, they are significant actors. Bin Laden, the letters show, was no enthusiast for these allies — far from the puppet-master some media accounts made him out to be. He comes across as contemptuous of organisations like the TTP, and dismissive of iconic young jihadists like Anwar al-Awlaki. We know little of what the new jihadists privately made of him — but the very existence of these organisations represented a success for bin Laden. Al-Qaeda's purpose — as its very name, “the base” suggests — was to provide resources for the wider jihadist movement. Bin Laden, the letters show, feared the affiliates might be seduced by their local successes, and lose sight of their global objectives. He warned the Yemeni jihadists, for example, that even a weakened U.S. “continues to have capabilities that would enable it to bring down any state that we might establish”. Long before his death, al-Qaeda's chief had been relegated to the margins of the jihadist movement. The cause he killed and died for, though, is very far from spent.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/understanding-osamas-legacy/article3391085.ece
8,5,2012,Rollback rules,"Capitulating to unrelenting pressure from stakeholders affected by his stringent budget proposals, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has rolled back some while delaying implementation of others, notably the anti-tax evasion provisions popularly called GAAR (General Anti-avoidance Rules). The pressure brought to bear by angry investors and traders, depressed stock markets and a rupee in free fall was probably too much to bear. Mr. Mukherjee must also have been conscious of the importance of foreign portfolio flows to bridge the widening current account deficit, estimated to be around 4 per cent for 2011-12, while deciding to defer the implementation of GAAR until the next financial year. These were a red rag to foreign investors, some of whom held back fresh investments in the period since the budget. The Finance Minister has also done the right thing in shifting the onus of proving tax avoidance to Revenue, which is an amendment of the budget proposal, and in allowing an independent member to be appointed on the GAAR panel. The facility of seeking advance ruling on GAAR provisions is also a welcome step as investors can plan their moves better. It is not surprising, then, that the stock market gave the thumbs up to Mr. Mukherjee's rollbacks with the BSE Sensex, which was down by over 300 points until the Finance Minister's speech in Parliament in the afternoon, soaring by 400 points from the day's low.
The jewellers' lobby also seems to have won with Mr. Mukherjee doing away with the 1 per cent excise duty that he imposed on non-branded jewellery. It is a double bonanza for the trade because branded jewellery will also be exempt from the levy now. More than the revenue that could have been generated from it, the duty was important because the jewellery business has traditionally been a magnet for unaccounted money and this levy might have brought such funds to account. From this perspective alone the rollback is retrograde, aside from sending the wrong signal that this government is susceptible to pressure. One proposal on which the Finance Minister has not succumbed, though, is the retrospective clarification that will bring the Vodafone deal to tax. The government has justified its move saying that such a large deal cannot be allowed to go tax-free and has to be held to tax in one jurisdiction or another. The case might well return to the Supreme Court but the government has held firm, which is notable indeed. It is also not clear what impact the rollbacks will have on the revenue side of the budget arithmetic. If in the end, they lead to better sentiment and consequently higher GDP growth, their purpose might have been served.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rollback-rules/article3394660.ece
8,5,2012,France backs Hollande,"François Hollande's victory in the French presidential election is notable on several counts. He has ensured the Socialists' return to power after 17 years in the political wilderness. In doing so, he has effaced the humiliation suffered by the Parti Socialist (PS) in 2002, when Prime Minister Lionel Jospin was bundled out of the first round by the extreme right leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen. Today, it is the extremist supporters of his daughter, Marine Le Pen, who have helped outgoing conservative incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy reduce Mr. Hollande's margin of victory to a sliver. Mr. Sarkozy exploited a sense of cultural insecurity and economic vulnerability which led even traditional leftist voters to back the far right. Even so, Mr. Hollande's low-key approach, which includes a commitment to higher taxes for large corporations and high earners, served him well against the self-promotional style of Mr. Sarkozy. In effect, the country's 44.5 million voters have shown that they are generally more concerned about unemployment and the maintenance of a mixed economy — which has made France one of the world's most powerful and successful post-war economies — than they are about, for example, immigration.
While the celebrations by PS supporters at Paris's iconic Place de la Bastille and elsewhere across the country were understandable, the figure of 51.7 per cent to 48.3 does not amount to the resounding victory the French Left badly wanted. The abstention rate of 19.6 per cent also indicates wider public disaffection with the political climate as a whole, which Mr. Hollande may not be able to alter soon. The new President will face other challenges too. He is the first leader of a major power to criticise the austerity strategies which have dominated global politics since the 2007-8 financial crash; but European Union rules on budget deficits will make it difficult for him actively to stimulate the economy. Secondly, his economic views are in stark contrast to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and a Franco-German tussle is perhaps the last thing a crisis-ridden European Union needs. Thirdly, his relative inexperience — he has never been a minister before — could prove a liability. On the positive side, however, 21 of metropolitan France's 22 regions are held by a broad left or left-green front. Mr. Hollande can, therefore, count on grassroots support for a policy approach which rejects the shibboleths of fiscal austerity, though his first test will be the rates at which France can borrow debt-servicing money on 16 May, the day after he is sworn in. There will be no honeymoon period for the new occupant of the Élysée Palace. The hard work has already started.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/france-backs-hollande/article3394661.ece
9,5,2012,Crude pressure,"For once, the top line in the agenda for Hillary Clinton's just-concluded visit to India wasn't Pakistan or Afghanistan or even terrorism but the Obama administration's obsessive compulsive desire to turn the screws on Iran and all those who do not back its confrontational approach to resolving the Iranian nuclear question. Put simply, New Delhi is being asked to undermine its own economic and strategic interests by cutting back on oil imports and other commercial transactions with Tehran in order to comply with extra-territorial sanctions that have no basis in international law. As things stand, India is fully in compliance with trading restrictions imposed by the United Nations Security Council on Iran following the latter's refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment programme. But the U.N. sanctions do not cover Iranian crude exports, something the U.S. has now tried to target by threatening Tehran's biggest customers. India has resisted, but the government has not done enough to solve the financial, transportation and insurance problems that the American threats have created for Indian refiners. The Prime Minister can have the satisfaction of telling Ms Clinton that India's energy ties are guided by its national interest. The emerging numbers on Indian oil imports from Iran, however, tell another story.
Apart from its need for oil, there are two reasons why New Delhi must not take the American pressure lying down. India's only reliable land-route into Afghanistan and Central Asia runs through Iran. Second, the current U.S. approach is likely to make the Iranian — and regional — security situation worse, not better. Saudi Arabia and Israel, which is already nuclear-armed, worry that a nuclear-capable Iran would tilt the regional balance and want the squeeze put on Tehran. But too much financial or military pressure could backfire, goading the regime to commit to acquiring a strategic weapon — something it has not done so far. Like others in the wider region, India too would not like to see Iran acquire nuclear weapons. Nor does it want to see a confrontation or war over the issue. As a result, India now has to balance complex, competing interests: the cost of alternative sources of oil against its economic relationship with the U.S.; the potential long-term risks of having another nuclear power in the neighbourhood against the repercussions of another conflict over ‘WMD' in the region. The reason India faces these choices is because everything the U.S. has done since 2005 has made the Persian puzzle more complicated and intractable than it initially was. As friends, we owe it to the Americans — and ourselves — to tell them that the path they are going down now can only produce greater instability and insecurity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/crude-pressure/article3398198.ece
9,5,2012,More power to wind,"It is an industry often derided as one founded on tax-breaks and growing on them. Yet, if Tamil Nadu, reeling under serial load-shedding of up to 10 hours a day over the last few months, was spared power cuts on some days last week, it was thanks to the same industry — wind-power. Early onset of monsoon winds in the southern districts of the State set the wind mills spinning, and helped bridge the yawning power deficit substantially. With an estimated 6,300 mega watts, Tamil Nadu accounts for 40 per cent of total capacity for wind power generation in the country and in many ways can be said to be the pioneer in the field. Even so, the State government's reluctance to support the industry meant that it could not develop to its potential. Investment in transmission lines to evacuate power from wind farms, for instance, has not been adequate, leading to under-utilisation of capacity. Wind power generators have also been asking the government to fully utilise their capacities during the wind season, which corresponds to the monsoon season, but they have invariably been asked to ‘back-down' in favour of other, more stable sources. It is an irony that the partial relief for the State on the power front came from an industry that it did not support.
Tamil Nadu's experience is instructive and points to the need to cultivate and nurture all sources of power, more so the renewable ones such as wind and solar. Granted that these are unpredictable, especially wind, which is also seasonal. That is where the challenge lies for policymakers. The complaint is that recouping investment in transmission lines that evacuate wind power takes longer as they are used only for a few months in a year. Besides, sharp surges and dips between seasons and even during the season — a prime characteristic of wind power — make it impossible for power managers to manage the grid. Yet, such problems can be handled easily if the States in the southern grid, where wind power capacity is concentrated, cooperate. The higher generation during the wind season can be shared while backing down costlier thermal generation stations without affecting grid stability. This is easier to accomplish in a larger, regional grid than in a smaller State grid where backing down a large thermal station could lead to instability, especially if wind generation dips suddenly. Such cooperation will also lead to fall in the rather high tariffs that States pay for unscheduled drawals from the grid. The lesson really is that policymakers should treat wind and other renewable sources as integral parts of the power generation system rather than as outliers to fall back upon only when conventional sources fail.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/more-power-to-wind/article3398200.ece
10,5,2012,Pilgrim's progress,"The Supreme Court's order that the Haj subsidy be phased out will be welcomed by almost everyone, including the majority of Muslims, because it strikes at the heart of a dysfunctional management system that is run in the interest of politicians and self-styled community leaders and not the average pilgrim. Haj is the fifth pillar of Islam and every Muslim is enjoined to perform the pilgrimage at least once in her or his lifetime provided she or he is physically fit and has the financial means to discharge this obligation. While Indian rulers traditionally took steps to ensure the safety of passage for pilgrims to and from Arabia and built hostels for them in Mecca, none violated the Islamic emphasis on individual capability by providing direct subsidies. The modern Indian state crossed the line for two reasons. First, the management of the pilgrimage was franchised out via an official Haj Committee to ‘community leaders,' most of whom used the power to build their political influence among ordinary Muslims and were only secondarily interested in matters of piety. Second, the politicisation of the process meant no one in the government or the Haj Committee had an incentive to keep costs down and no political party was willing to rationalise the system out of a misplaced fear of offending the wider body of Muslims.
Contrary to public perception, India's hajis are not the main beneficiaries of the Rs.685 crore spent by the government on the pilgrimage last year. The money essentially goes towards subsidising an inflated fare to Jeddah for the 120,000-plus Muslims who go through the Haj Committee each year. Despite the bargaining power it commands, the government invariably ‘negotiates' a fare with Air India and other charter operators that is much higher than that paid by hajis who make the pilgrimage privately. Since Air India is state-owned, the ‘Haj subsidy,' in essence, goes from one pocket of the government to the other. Given the discrepancy in the data on Haj subsidies, it is possible that some of the money spent is going to other — unknown and undeserving — pockets as well. The Supreme Court hinted at the wider malaise by ordering an end to the so-called ‘goodwill' Haj delegation but a complete review of India's Haj management system is what is urgently needed. Even as the subsidy is phased out, the government must, of course, continue to oversee arrangements for the pilgrimage to Mecca, just as it does for the Kumbh Mela and the Amarnath and Kailash Mansarovar yatras. As the Supreme Court itself noted, we should not be “oblivious of the fact that in many other purely religious events there are direct and indirect deployment of state funds and state resources.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pilgrims-progress/article3401446.ece
10,5,2012,Another take-off aborted,"Just as it looked that the ailing national carrier Air India will take-off on the wings of a Rs.30,000 crore bailout package, the agitation by well over 200 pilots belonging to the Indian Pilots Guild has once again grounded the airline. At the height of the tourist season and summer vacation for domestic traffic, these pilots started reporting “sick,” forcing the airline to cancel some of its flights, including about 20 international flights. And what was the reason? They are worried about their career prospects and promotions because pilots from the erstwhile Indian Airlines are being trained to fly the new 787 ‘Dreamliner' aircraft that are about to join the fleet. Recently, when the pilots protested against non-payment of salaries and flying allowances, there was much sympathy for their cause because a highly mismanaged Air India had racked up four months worth of arrears. It was only after a schedule of payment was worked out did the pilots call off their strike and resume flying. This time round, not only has the airline management decided to act tough with them, the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the travelling public are aghast at the highly irresponsible behaviour of a section of the pilots.
Air India has sacked about 20 pilots, derecognised the Guild, dubbed the strike illegal, and sent out medical teams to the houses of pilots who are reporting sick. Union Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh has gone a step further to say that, ideally, the government should not be in the airline business and that too in the service industry. But even to disinvest, Air India has to be turned round and made profitable. The question uppermost in the public mind is: why should public and taxpayer money be washed down the drain by bailing out such a mismanaged airline? When there was such a chorus of disapproval against a bailout package to the private Kingfisher airline, what can justify the repeated pumping in of public funds in an airline which is just not able to take-off? The Air India-Indian Airlines merger seems to be the worst management decision in the chequered history of the company. The Justice Dharmadikari committee report is due anytime now, and the least that the Aviation Ministry can do is to set up a panel comprising representatives from the management and the two erstwhile airlines to implement the recommendations. This is perhaps the last opportunity to revive the airline. The pilots have to call off the strike, resume negotiations and find an amicable solution. This is the time not for strikes or agitations but for a focused plan to restructure and resuscitate the airline.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/another-takeoff-aborted/article3401453.ece
11,5,2012,Returning Chisty,"The Supreme Court must be thanked for finally allowing Khaleel Chisty to return to Pakistan. The 80-year-old Pakistani was convicted last year in a murder case in Ajmer and sentenced to life imprisonment. A man had succumbed to gun shot wounds received in a clash between two sets of Mr. Chisty's relatives in 1992. The trial court, which took nearly 20 years to decide the case, was not convinced by his plea that he was only a bystander and played no part in the violence. For the two decades that it took to decide the case, he was confined to Ajmer. After the conviction, the Rajasthan High Court refused his plea for suspension of the sentence, even while granting identical appeals of three other Indian men convicted in the case. For a whole year, his family and rights activists pleaded for his release and return to Pakistan and requested the Rajasthan Governor to consider a pardon. Keeping an ill and infirm octogenarian in prison militated against the commitment by both India and Pakistan to treat their cross-border prisoners humanely, but the pleas fell on deaf ears. Perhaps what was most inhumane was that Governor Shivraj Patil, showing the same indecisiveness that he displayed during his time as Home Minister, sat on the case for all this time, even ignoring an impassioned personal appeal from Justice Markandey Katju. Then still at the Supreme Court, Mr. Katju asked that Dr. Chisty be released on humanitarian grounds. His plea found a sympathetic echo in the Prime Minister's Office. But all to no avail.
President Asif Ali Zardari raised the issue during his visit to India in April. The first ray of hope came when the Supreme Court granted him bail last month while admitting his petition challenging the conviction; in allowing him to return to his hometown of Karachi on a separate petition, the court has made it clear that it was taking into account the “special circumstances” of the case. The government had opposed his return to Pakistan, but as the court observed during the hearings, they were dealing here not with a terrorist or someone with a criminal record but a qualified virologist. To be sure, the court also imposed certain conditions, including that his passport be held by the Indian mission in Pakistan, and that he must return in November when it will start hearing the petition on his conviction. But the judges have shown that even while adhering to legalities there is always room in civilized jurisprudence for a humane approach. Indeed, both in India and Pakistan, the judiciary has shown far more wisdom and humanity in dealing with the prisoner issue than the bureaucracy or the political leadership.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/returning-chisty/article3405296.ece
11,5,2012,"Water, and justice, for Bhopal","The Supreme Court order directing time-bound provision of safe drinking water to 18 long-suffering residential areas around the Bhopal gas tragedy site highlights two things — the slow pace at which even the highest judicial intervention produces results in India, and the persisting pollution threat to the health of thousands. In fact, the same court had directed that protected water be supplied to 14 localities around the Union Carbide plant in May 2004 (four more were added subsequently). The Centre claimed that a series of measures were taken by the Madhya Pradesh government to comply with the order, but not much relief has been available to the residents. The Municipal Corporation of Bhopal is yet to provide tap connections to households. Moreover, the water supplied is yellowish, with a heavy flat taste even today, involving consequences for health. Sadly, as governments have come to regard this 27-year-old industrial catastrophe as just another chronic problem, the residents have to bear the terrible consequences of this continuing denial of their right to a healthy life. It is welcome, therefore, that the Supreme Court has finally set a three-month deadline for water supply and appointed a fresh monitoring committee. The M.P. government must not prolong the misery of the victims and do everything to fulfil their needs.
The safe supply of water to the densely populated areas hit by the gas tragedy is essential to eliminate the public health threat. But there is also the question of disposing of some 350 tonnes of hazardous waste lying in the abandoned Union Carbide India factory premises. Here again, neither the Centre nor the M.P. government appear anxious to conduct a speedy operation. This, in spite of a new option available to avoid Indian disposal sites, and hand it over to a German firm that can move the hazardous material to Hamburg. It must also be emphasised that, while the responsibility of the Centre and the M.P. governments to remediate Bhopal is paramount, it does not mitigate the claim on Dow Chemicals for its liability towards Union Carbide's failures. Faced with global ridicule for its attempts at greenwashing through a ten-year Olympics sponsorship, Dow has disingenuously described its critics as “irresponsible.” If anything, it was its own decision to acquire the assets of a disaster-hit Union Carbide and disclaim any liability for the tragedy that calls for severe reproach. The proper course would have been to own up, to engage in a comprehensive clean-up and rehabilitation exercise, and to compensate victims in full. The immediate task, however, is to alleviate the physical misery of the victims by providing them a clean environment and good water.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/water-and-justice-for-bhopal/article3405294.ece
12,5,2012,State of the Union,"Barack Obama's bold endorsement of gay marriage has been picked threadbare for its motives (savvy electoral calculation?) and its possible outcomes (political suicide?). But there is no denying that the U.S. President has been on the right side of gay rights for quite a while now. He has backed legislation that upholds the principle that the federal government should give gay and lesbian couples the same rights and legal protection as heterosexual ones. He was instrumental in the repeal of the ‘Don't Ask, Don't Tell' law that barred openly gay and bisexual people from the U.S. armed forces. His presidency, in fact, has been marked by a consistent and muscular support for sexual minorities, reflected in his campaign for equal treatment for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders all over the world. It was only on same sex marriage that he had staked out a somewhat ambivalent position, maintaining his opinions were “evolving”. He was criticised for being indecisive and vacillating; in contrast, Mitt Romney, his Republican rival in the 2012 election, is clear and unequivocal in his opposition to gay marriage and is likely to mount a divisive campaign on this issue.
In strict terms, the step from supporting equal rights for gay couples to endorsing same sex marriage is a small one. The hesitation in taking this stems entirely from the fact that people continue to view marriage as a sacrament, something performed by a religious body and, ipso facto, not a function of the state. Even if same sex marriage becomes law, it is unlikely that the church, which is autonomous in religious matters, will be persuaded to marry gay couples; civil unions may continue to be the only option for them. But there is a real victory for the gay movement here. It lies in having a government on its side, one that is willing to send the signal that it is opposed to any discriminatory policy on the basis of sexual orientation. The President's endorsement comes at a time when there is mounting American opinion in favour of same sex marriage, confirmed by a recent survey that showed 50 per cent in favour of it. At a time when globally, there is growing acceptance that sexual minorities must be accorded equal rights, it is truly shameful that the Indian government is unable to take a firm position on decriminalising homosexuality. Although the Delhi High Court held Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code to be unconstitutional insofar as it criminalised consensual homosexual acts, an indecisive Centre remains in the thrall of moral obscurantists and arch-conservatives who are opposed to the change.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/state-of-the-union/article3409158.ece
12,5,2012,The cart before the horse,"Ruling parties are often internally divided on sharing power and pelf. In contrast, parties in the opposition are usually cohesive, and single-minded in the pursuit of power. But in Rajasthan, the Bharatiya Janata Party seems as divided while in the opposition as it was while in power. There is more than a year to go for the next Assembly election, but the party is already witnessing a struggle for the Chief Minister's job. True, things are going badly for the Congress government led by Ashok Gehlot, but it is still too premature for the BJP to fight over who the next CM should be. The first signs of trouble began when State party leader Gulabchand Kataria proposed to take out a yatra. Since yatras are the preferred way of demonstrating one's leadership in the BJP, former Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition Vasundhara Raje saw this as a challenge and threatened to resign. Not wanting to invite unnecessary trouble for himself and his party, Mr. Kataria called off the yatra but the Vasundhara camp chose to up the ante. Sensing that additional political space had opened up for her in the party, Ms Raje encouraged her supporters to demand that she be named the chief ministerial candidate for the 2013 election. The national leadership of the BJP is now in a fix: to not give in to the demand of the Vasundhara camp could pave the way for the weakening of the party at the State level, and to give in could undermine the authority of the party at the national level.
Of course, what is being played out in Rajasthan is a microcosm of the bigger fight within the BJP over the influence wielded by those owing allegiance directly to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Mr. Kataria is a known RSS supporter, and his yatra to highlight Congress “misrule” in Rajasthan had all the markings of a proxy war on behalf of the RSS against Ms Raje. Despite leading the party to defeat in 2008, Ms Raje was unwilling to relinquish her leadership role and had sought to reassert her position within the party. But the RSS was intent on putting down such personality-driven politics, and was seeking to create an alternative leadership that was more subservient. Yielding further ground to Ms Raje would have meant allowing her out of the orbit of influence. Many Vasundhara supporters in the Assembly have now threatened to resign to show their support for her. For both Ms Raje and the RSS, it is important to win these little battles ahead of the 2013 election. But lost in all this internal fighting are people's issues, the livelihood concerns that should have been centre-staged ahead of the Assembly election. Come 2013, the party might well regret putting the cart before the horse.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-cart-before-the-horse/article3409160.ece
14,5,2012,The comic republic,"“Bhakti in religion may be a road to the salvation of the soul”, B.R. Ambedkar said in a famous speech to the Constituent Assembly on November 25, 1949, just before putting the Constitution of India to vote. “But in politics, Bhakti or hero-worship is a sure road to degradation and to eventual dictatorship”. If only the parliamentarians who vented their anger against a 1949 cartoon last week had bothered to read and understand the hero in whose unnecessary defence they sprang up, Indian democracy would have been spared the degrading spectacle of the government banishing a sixty-year-old sketch from the classroom. The sight of our parliamentarians cutting across the political spectrum foaming at the mouth in simulated rage, vying to outdo each other in their pious indignation, and sporting their ‘hurt' sentiments like badges of honour was like watching a bad soap opera gone worse. That they could have spent the day grandstanding over a totally inoffensive cartoon is not merely deplorable. It is also downright dangerous, if we pause to consider that these are the men and women we elect to safeguard our constitutional democracy, of which the freedom of expression is a fundamental and inviolable part. Disrupting Parliament would have been unjustifiable even if the cartoon were repugnant. But to create a controversy over a comment on the slow speed with which the Constitution was being drafted, on the absurd ground that the cartoon “insulted” Ambedkar, was downright ridiculous.
The demand that criminal action be taken against those who permitted the cartoon's publication is reflective of a larger malaise among many of India's politicians. Apparently, they think there is more political mileage in creating controversies over irrelevancies than addressing genuine issues facing Dalits such as backwardness and discrimination. Predictably, the Centre's response was one of total capitulation, reflected in HRD Minister Kapil Sibal's craven apology, his agreement that the cartoon was “shameful,” and his promise of even criminal action in the matter. That there is a slippery slope between hostile speech and violent behaviour was manifest when the office of one of the scholars involved in the production of the textbook was ransacked by vandals. The argument that the cartoon could be misconstrued by the 11th standard schoolchildren who read the textbook is bogus and an insult to their intelligence. It is our MPs who showed a total lack of acumen and wisdom by wasting the nation's time on a complete non-issue. Worse, they have ensured that public life in India, already awash with hurt sentiments of one kind or another, will now be inundated by a torrent of demands to ban more and more expressions of culture, art and knowledge.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-comic-republic/article3415779.ece
14,5,2012,Let no youth be left behind,"After a prolonged period of weak initiatives in higher education that stunted enrolment in the university system, India now has the opportunity to speed up remedial action during the Twelfth Plan. If recent assessments are correct, the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in universities and colleges has touched 20 per cent, translating into about 20 million men and women in the 18 to 22 year cohort entering the portals of higher learning annually. The goal is to reach a 30 per cent GER by the end of the current decade. Evidently, even if the target is achieved, the absolute number of young Indians able to get a recognised higher education degree will remain well below the level a knowledge economy needs. Progress demands an end to the fragmentation of the higher education system, improved infrastructure, overcoming the inability of students to pay high tuition and boarding fees, especially at private institutions, and filling faculty vacancies. It is imperative that the Centre makes access, quality improvement and affordability the basic tenets of policy.
The idea of opening up the physical infrastructure of universities and colleges to start whole new batches of degrees and diplomas late in the evening has been the low hanging fruit in the area of wider access for many years. If this is pursued vigorously, as the Planning Commission's Working Group on Higher Education for the Twelfth Plan emphasises, a quick scaling up of enrolment rates is possible. This will maximise the value of the previous Plan measures, such as the opening of 374 colleges in educationally backward districts, besides 16 Central universities and 1000 polytechnics. Less robust, however, is the Plan approach to funding higher education. Scholarships are good, but they can work only if they cover all students with affordability problems. Loans are definitely an inferior alternative because they impose a heavy debt on the young graduate. Providing more scholarships is the answer. This should not be difficult, considering that Indians are paying a one per cent cess towards higher education. Corpus funds can be started by States with additional taxes, topped up by philanthropic and community-led contributions. In coming years, the enrolment of women, people with disabilities and minorities needs special attention. In the case of women, their share of total enrolment has risen from about 11 per cent in 1950 to nearly 39 per cent in 2009. Further GER growth will depend on investments in hostels, and grant of scholarships. India should also put its gigabit IT network in place quickly, to bring good learning materials from around the world to all campuses.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/let-no-youth-be-left-behind/article3415780.ece
15,5,2012,For a people's Parliament,"As the Indian Parliament completes 60 years, it is time not for noisy celebration but for serious introspection. That India remained a parliamentary democracy while some of its South Asian neighbours went through military coups or violent upheavals can only be a small consolation to its people. Stability is of no great value in itself. After 60 years, the question to ask is whether the debates in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha have adequately reflected the will of the people, whether the law-making powers of Parliament have contributed to the creation of a freer, fairer and more just society. Evidently, the score-sheet shows mixed results on these counts. Meaningful debates over marathon sessions have been few and far between in the last six decades. In contrast, disruptions and slogan-shouting over any number of frivolous issues have been frequent. Too often, a boisterous few have held the whole of Parliament hostage. A case in point is the Women's Reservation Bill: over several years, a small section of the two Houses has been able to physically stall the bill, which on paper enjoys the support of the overwhelming majority of MPs. Forcing adjournment of the proceedings through high-decibel interventions and demonstrations is a common enough occurrence in the Lok Sabha as well as the Rajya Sabha. Not surprisingly, the impetus for progressive change in the last few decades has often come from the wider civil society with Parliament shown up as reactive and passive.
Also, after 60 years and 15 national general elections, India's Parliament is nowhere close to being truly representative. Thanks to seats reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and the political mobilisation of the backward classes on the basis of reservation benefits, members are now drawn from different social strata. But women and Muslims are under-represented, and the rich continue to dominate India's law-making bodies. With the cost of fighting elections spiralling, businessmen, the landed gentry and highly-paid professionals are entering Parliament in increasing numbers, alongside leaders of trade unions. This, no doubt, skews the debates too. Since the adoption of the Constitution, India has moved decisively towards a multi-party system, with laws such as the one to prevent defection restricting inner-party dissent even while curbing horse-trading. Thus, power is still concentrated in the hands of a few, with the role of the public limited to voting in governments every five years or so. India's people need to be an active part of the political process before they can be the agents of change, and the masters of their own destiny. Six decades on, the task of shaping a truly representative Parliament must be taken up in earnest.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/for-a-peoples-parliament/article3419027.ece
15,5,2012,Educating students for free,"In a spectacular initiative that could transform our understanding of the ‘classroom', Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have announced that they will soon start providing free online courses. Giving students, particularly those in the developing countries, free access to quality education will produce the same results as what freeing up research results through open access has done to scientists across the world. The non-profit organisation, edX, launched recently with $30 million funding by each institution, will provide free education in five courses starting this fall in a range of disciplines — engineering, humanities, the social sciences and natural sciences. Incidentally, edX is not the trendsetter; two other free online education projects have already been launched this year. Udacity, a January venture launched by a Stanford University professor, was the first off the block. Three months later, Coursera was flagged off by Stanford, Princeton, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Michigan. While both Udacity and Coursera have courses in computer programming, the latter has many upcoming courses in diverse fields such as health care, mathematics, economics, and humanities. Though the courses are taught by professors from the collaborating institutions, students who make the cut will only get certificates of mastery, and only grades and no credits.
That there is great demand for free online education became apparent when edX's prototype course attracted a whopping 120,000 enrolments, while Udacity saw more than 200,000 enrolments for its six courses. In addition to providing flexibility in learning, the ventures have to necessarily make the courses — spanning for a few weeks — both accessible and interesting, and adopt engaging teaching methods so as to hold the attention of their students in faraway lands tuning in via shaky internet connections. For instance, Udacity not only permits but also encourages collaborative learning “both on-line and in-person” among students so as to “enhance” understanding. That there is also a compulsion to design courses catering to the needs of different sections of society has been brought out by Coursera. Its course on vaccines will go a long way in removing the many misconceptions on the subject. The autism scare in the United States led to a drastic fall in vaccine uptake and continues to remain a challenge. Like open access journals, free online education has to come up with a few innovative financial models that will enable the ventures to remain self-reliant. Like the rest of the online universe, media included, the biggest test will come in the form of financial sustainability.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/educating-students-for-free/article3419028.ece
16,5,2012,Yeddyurappa's last stand,"With the Central Bureau of Investigation registering a First Information Report against B.S. Yeddyurappa, his two sons and son-in-law, a mining company and a businessman in the CBI Special Court in Bangalore following an order of the Supreme Court on May 11, the crisis in the turbulent Karnataka unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party has intensified even further. Forced by his party's central leadership to step down as Chief Minister nine months ago on account of allegations of corruption in mining deals by the Lokayukta Report on Illegal Mining, a restive Mr. Yeddyurappa has been agitating for his reinstatement, especially after a division bench of the Karnataka High Court this March quashed both a portion of the Lokayukta report, and the Governor's sanction to prosecute him based on the report. The legal intervention by the Dharwad-based NGO, Samaj Parivartana Samudaya, added force and mass to the allegations against Mr. Yeddyurappa, resulting in the appointment of the Central Empowered Committee by the Supreme Court. Now facing a special CBI team, Mr. Yeddyurappa's position in the party and government is at its weakest, notwithstanding his defiance, and the sound and fury that his uncertain support base of loyal legislators, religious seers and “elders” have drummed up in recent days. His response to the Supreme Court order has been one of injured innocence, and he has rallied his supporters against the three top leaders of the state BJP — Chief Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda, BJP State president K.S. Eswarappa and national general secretary Ananth Kumar, accusing them of having written to the central party leadership in March this year charging six of his supporters of “anti-party activities.”
For all his bluster, the former Chief Minister is acutely aware of the ground slipping from under his feet. The BJP central leadership has not extended him support even as the Congress has spurned his overtures, prompting him to quickly withdraw his threat to quit from the party and legislature. The CBI inquiry marks a stage in the long period of factional turmoil in the party and government caused by Mr. Yeddyurappa's actions both during his controversial innings as Chief Minister, and after he stepped down. The central party leadership for its own reasons did not intervene to course-correct the government in the initial years of its tenure when the mining mafia was consolidating its political clout. If the BJP has suffered irreparable damage, it is the State that has had to pay the price for the callous disregard of day-to-day governance by its squabbling leaders. Karnataka deserves better.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/yeddyurappas-last-stand/article3422924.ece
16,5,2012,The inspiring Ms Kraft,"The resounding win by the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, constitutes a firm rejection of Chancellor Angela Merkel's main policies and sends a clear wider message. The election for the Landtag or state assembly was triggered in March, when the SPD Minister-President Hannelore Kraft failed to win the budget vote; this time, however, the electorate decisively backed Ms Kraft, whose party raised its share of the vote from 34.5 per cent to 39.1 while Ms Merkel's Christian Democratic Union crashed from 34.6 to 26.3. This was the CDU's worst showing in the province since 1949, though its ally, the Free Democratic Party (FDP), staged a revival of its own, winning 8.6 per cent. Now the highly respected and popular Ms Kraft will govern with the Greens, whose 11. 3 per cent will give the new coalition a sustainable working majority of 10 in the 181-seat assembly. For the record, the newly formed Pirate Party, which calls for greater openness in government through the use of technology, cleared the 5 per cent threshold, and its 7.8 per cent means it has gained provincial representation for the fourth consecutive time. Its reliance on lay personnel and a shoestring budget seem to be no disadvantage in view of its rising political appeal.
Provincial it may be but the implications of the North Rhine-Westphalian election are national, continental, and quite possibly global. To start with, this result will give the German social democrats renewed confidence, which will stand them in good stead as they prepare for the 2013 general election. Secondly, the vote, paralleled by a CDU defeat in the state of Schleswig-Holstein, is in keeping with the public anger shown in Greece, Spain, Italy, and Portugal, to name but four European Union states where public-spending cuts have sent economies on a downward slide, which by putting tens of millions out of work is jeopardising an entire generation's future. That German citizens, who accepted wage cuts following the 2008 financial crash, have put their weight into anti-austerity votes will rightly resonate across the EU and far beyond its borders; even in the Union's biggest, and the world's fourth largest, economic power the public is starting to show that it has had enough of financier-driven policies which only exacerbate shrinkage even as they leave those responsible for the crash sitting on hundreds of billions in taxpayer bailouts. The SPD now have every incentive to prepare and act on genuinely social-democratic policies in the confidence that the public will support them. They could also become an inspiration to social democrats around the world.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-inspiring-ms-kraft/article3422926.ece
17,5,2012,The first year's balance-sheet,"When J. Jayalalithaa began her third substantive term as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu last year, she was expected to undo some of the things that had gone wrong under the previous regime and take initiatives in areas that the Karunanidhi government had neglected. One year into her new term, those changes are more than evident. The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam government has strengthened the Public Distribution System by providing free rice, and raised rural income levels by providing free milch cows, goats and sheep to the poor immediately after assuming office. But change can lose its charm when it is done to fix things that ain't broke, when it is done simply for the purpose of reversing the previous government's schemes and projects. One such reversal was the overnight dismissal of 13,000 Makkal Nala Paniyalargal or people's welfare workers recruited by the DMK government. And then there was the move to drop the Uniform System of School Education just weeks before the academic year was to begin. Not that the USSE was without fault, but to slash the whole scheme in one sweeping stroke instead of trying to fix the defects in a structured manner showed a certain disregard for the interests of school-going children. The decision to not use the new Secretariat complex, and to move the Anna Centenary Library out of its well-furnished building also came through as politically coloured. Not surprisingly, time and energy which could have been spent more constructively went in fighting lost-cause legal battles over these rollback decisions.
To her credit, however, Ms Jayalalithaa also knew how to improve upon some of the DMK government's welfare measures. Although her government dropped the private insurer for the government's health scheme, the scheme itself got a makeover that made it a far improved version. Also, the government's drive against land-grabbing, initially seen as directed against DMK leaders, proved to be of great benefit to a large number of people who had lost their land to an organised mafia. The government has also been efficient in both short-term restoration and long-term rehabilitation after the death and destruction caused by cyclone Thane. Alongside some short-sighted steps motivated by political considerations, Ms Jayalalithaa unveiled a bold Vision Tamil Nadu 2023 document that aims to achieve 11 per cent economic growth and rid the State of hunger and poverty. For a party in power, good governance is the best way of conducting politics. The people of Tamil Nadu would like nothing better than for their Chief Minister to spend the next four years single-mindedly pursuing the goals set out in that document.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-first-years-balancesheet/article3426127.ece
17,5,2012,Wagers of sin,"The world of cricket faces a formidable challenge after a television channel's sting operation has brought the corrosive effect betting can have on the game and its players back into sharp focus. The Board of Control for Cricket in India should be commended for swiftly suspending the five cricketers involved from all forms of the game till a committee headed by Ravi Sawani, the former International Cricket Council anti-corruption unit chief, submits the findings of a preliminary report within 15 days. Whatever his findings, the fear is that the latest allegations are the tip of the iceberg. Cricket shed its heart-warming amateur spirit long ago and not many call it a ‘gentleman's game' these days. The Indian Premier League is cash-rich and this means the stakes are high not just for the broadcaster, the franchises and the cricketers but also for the betting syndicates. The Twenty20 format, too, is especially vulnerable to fixing. Since this form of the game is so compressed in nature, a couple of deliveries or a single over could influence the eventual outcome of a match. Here, spot fixing, even a single deliberate no-ball, can alter the result. Under the circumstances, the allegation that one of the cricketers demanded Rs.10 lakh from an undercover television reporter for sending down a deliberate no-ball in an IPL match is extremely disturbing. Are there loopholes in the system and is it possible for a cricketer to pull off this illegal act in an IPL match? The IPL — after initial reluctance — now has ICC's anti-corruption unit overseeing its matches, but are the mechanisms in place fool proof?
The cricketers allegedly trapped by India TV's sting operation might not be big-time players but we should not allow the smallness of the names to cloud the enormity of the issue. Ever since Shane Warne, Mark Waugh and Tim May alleged that the then Pakistan captain, Salim Malik, approached them to fix an international game in 1994, some marquee cricketers have found themselves on the wrong side of the law. In 2000, Hansie Cronje of South Africa admitted to match-fixing and the subsequent scandal saw some Indian stars, including its skipper at the time, being banned from the game. And the News of the World sting saw Salman Butt, who was Pakistan's captain at the time, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir being convicted and jailed for spot fixing in 2011. Money brings with it greed and cricket needs to be very careful to preserve its soul. Otherwise the game — in the eyes of a cynical public — could well end up like one of those wrestling tournaments where the protagonists play-act and the outcome is fixed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/wagers-of-sin/article3426125.ece
18,5,2012,Facing up to rape,"This we know: few days go by without newspaper headlines announcing a violent sexual assault on a woman who could have been us or a loved one. This is less well known: the victims we read about are less likely to get anything resembling justice than ever before. Since 1973, ever more women have summoned the courage to walk into a police station, growing from 2,919 that year to 20,262 in 2010. In the same period, conviction rates dropped from 37 per cent to 26 per cent. Police attitudes are a key part of the problem. In a recent exposé, Tehelka magazine covertly videotaped several mid-level Delhi Police officers endorsing the view that rape victims had somehow contributed to the assault they suffered by what they wore, or the way they behaved. Earlier, the Director General of Police in Andhra Pradesh said that “provocative fashionable dresses” could be “one of the factors” behind the increase in rape. With the police espousing such ridiculous views, it is hardly surprising that rape cases are not properly investigated. Forensic resources are conspicuous by their absence. Newspaper headlines about Delhi or Gurgaon being “rape capitals” exacerbate the problem, incentivising the police to make it harder for women to seek justice in the hope of manufacturing better crime figures.
Finding answers to these problems is easier said than done. For one, anti-women attitudes remain resilient even in relatively progressive western societies. In the 1960s, Harry Kalven and Hans Zeisel showed how U.S. juries go to extraordinary lengths to be lenient with defendants when there is any suggestion of “contributory behaviour” by victims — such as hitchhiking, or simply talking to men at parties. In a 2005 survey conducted by Amnesty International in the United Kingdom, an astounding 26 per cent of respondents said they “thought a woman was totally or partially responsible for being raped if she was wearing revealing clothes”. Katie Ewing, in a 2009 study, pointed out that conviction rates in the U.K. had fallen from 25 per cent in 1985 to under 5 per cent in 2008, with juries proving reluctant to convict except in cases where there was compelling forensic evidence. Though focussed work to reshape police attitudes can help, there should be no illusions about what can be achieved. There is a large welter of scholarship that shows sensitisation courses, for example, have few long term results — sometimes merely teaching police officers the language they need to cloak their bigotry. The real threat to women comes from the men they live and work with, not the stranger lurking on a dark, ill-lit road. For victims to get justice, we must engage in a far larger effort to eradicate the toxic attitudes passed from fathers to sons.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/facing-up-to-rape/article3429555.ece
18,5,2012,The Greeks say no,"Angry Greek voters punished both their main political parties in the general election on May 6, but all subsequent attempts to form a government have failed, and another election is to be held on June 17. Under the reinforced proportional electoral system, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, which had been part of Lucas Papademos' interim national unity government, crashed by about 30 percentage points, and its 13 per cent vote-share sent it down to third place with 41 seats in the country's 300-seat unicameral parliament. Its former governing partner, the conservative New Democracy, benefiting from being in opposition during the economic crisis and downplaying its earlier vote for budget cuts, got 19 per cent, but won a 50-seat bonus for coming first. It had 108 overall, but could not assemble a government; neither could the election's surprise package, Alexis Tsipras' anti-austerity left grouping Syriza, which won 17 per cent and 52 seats, on a 65 per cent overall turnout. Looming over the situation too is the fact that the far-right Golden Dawn party won 21 seats with a vote-share of 7 per cent. President Karolos Papoulias has appointed a senior judge, Panagiotis Pikrammenos, to head another interim government until the next election.
Greece is now in chaos. The European Union, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund have provided a €130-billion loan to follow the 110 billion lent in 2010, but the money has been used mainly to compensate private investors; the 2011 sale of public assets realised only a third of the expected €5 billion. Other loan conditions, like higher taxes, deep cuts in pensions, pay, and public sector jobs have hit ordinary Greeks hard. Unemployment, at 21 per cent, is twice the eurozone average, and in the 15-24 age-group it has risen from 17 to 51 per cent in three years. The resulting slump in aggregate demand has caused business closures and has worsened the slide. While almost 70 per cent of the May 6 vote was for parties opposed to the bailout terms, the majority of Greeks wish to stay in the eurozone. Therefore, Mr. Tsipras's level of support — currently rising through 27 per cent — makes it highly significant that he intends to renegotiate the bailout terms. Ominously, vulture funds which hold Greek debt are demanding interest payments, but the key problem is the intransigence of the EU and the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel. The sooner the EU moderates its position, the better the prospects for a solution which both respects Greek public opinion and allows the country to remain in the eurozone.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-greeks-say-no/article3429557.ece
19,5,2012,Justice for the tiller's land,"The Parliamentary Standing Committee for Rural Development has made critical and bold recommendations to reduce the anomalies in the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill, and make acquisition fair and just. Not only has it strongly disagreed with the government's specious claim that land acquisition to aid for-profit private companies would constitute public purpose, it has also rightly recommended that the government not acquire land for such companies. A complete overhaul of the archaic Land Acquisition Act (1894) was long overdue. Two issues in particular needed radical revision: the definition of public purpose that justifies forcible acquisition, and the award of compensation. The Act, which was originally limited to acquiring land for only government projects, was amended several times to dilute the definition of public purpose so that land can now be acquired for all kinds of projects and for anyone. The dangers of this course came to the fore a few years ago when thousands of acres of land were violently acquired for Special Economic Zones, displacing many farmers. Expectations were high when the government announced last year that it would improve the Act. The new and revised Bill did well to increase the compensation amount and mandate public consultation; but it persisted with ambiguous definitions of public purpose and supported land acquisition for private companies.
Extending help when small parcels of land, for reasons of legality in property title, hold up a large commercial project is understandable, but wholesale State intervention reeks with dangers of abuse. Lessons from the farmers' agitation in Bhatta Parsaul, U.P., against the acquisition of agricultural land to favour private developers, which was condemned by the Supreme Court as a ‘colourable exercise of power,' were not learnt. The Parliamentary Committee has now made it clear that clauses vulnerable to misuse should be deleted. It also has done well to recommend that local participation through Gram Sabhas must extend beyond mere ‘consulting' to include review of rehabilitation measures, enquiries into objections and the final determination of compensation. The 2011 Bill exempts projects covered by Central Acts such as pipelines from its purview. This would have resulted in about ‘95 per cent' of government land acquisition escaping the pro-people provisions of the Bill. To its credit, the committee has questioned such large-scale exemptions and has strongly suggested that all land acquisitions be treated on a par. If the UPA government is serious about enacting a just land acquisition legislation, the well-considered recommendations of the committee must be adopted without delay.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/justice-for-the-tillers-land/article3433237.ece
19,5,2012,A fatal rivalry,"In a long-drawn fight, new weapons always come in handy. The rivalry in the Kerala unit of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) between former Chief Minster V.S. Achuthanandan and the State secretary, Pinarayi Vijayan, is legendary. Although the murder of T.P. Chandrasekharan, leader of the Revolutionary Marxist Party, a breakaway group of CPI (M), in Onchiyam in Kozhikode earlier this month appears to have accentuated divisions in the party, this is but another phase in the seemingly never-ending Achuthanandan-Vijayan factional feud. As leaders of the ruling United Democratic Front pointed fingers at the CPI (M) for the murder, Mr. Vijayan and Mr. Achuthanandan used the killing as an opportunity to begin a fresh battle within the party. While Mr. Vijayan described Chandrasekharan as a traitor, Mr. Achuthanandan paid homage to the slain RMP leader. But in defending Chandrasekharan by stating there was nothing wrong in floating a new party, Mr. Achuthanandan was actually attacking Mr. Vijayan. The situation in Onchiyam was similar to the one prevailing in 1964, Mr. Achuthanandan said, alluding to the split in the Communist Party of India that gave birth to the CPI (M). And, taking the analogy further, he compared Mr. Vijayan to S.A. Dange, then chairman of the CPI, seen as a villain during the split, who was later expelled by the party. But those who think Mr. Achuthanandan was raising visions of a split in the party are mistaken. For the veteran Marxist leader, this was merely another shot at his rival, and not some strategic manoeuvre intended to split the party. Political murders are non-events in Kerala, and, in any case, the course of the CPI (M) will not turn on whether Chandrasekharan is seen as a traitor or martyr.
More than the murder, what is worrying Mr. Achuthanandan is that Mr. Vijayan does not seem intent on toppling the UDF government, which is surviving on a wafer-thin majority. If the 88-year-old Mr. Achuthanandan is to be CM again, his only chance is in the current term of the Assembly. The party lost a recent by-election in Piravom, and to lose another in Neyyattinkara next month would practically end any hope of the LDF finding a way back to power in the current Assembly. In his own interest, Mr. Achuthanandan will not rock the boat at this stage. To force a split would be to sabotage his chances of leading the next government. Mr. Vijayan, too, pulled back and refused to get into an extended war of words. The swords are thus back in their scabbards for now. But as long as this rivalry, which is both ideological and personal, endures, the CPI (M) cannot breathe easy in Kerala.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-fatal-rivalry/article3433239.ece
21,5,2012,Signs of a deeper malaise,"The rupee's record-breaking slide against the dollar last week seriously tests the resolve of policymakers to defend the domestic currency in the face of an unholy combination of domestic and external factors. It is true that none of the factors pushing down the rupee is either new or unanticipated. Nor is India's predicament unique. Nearly all the currencies of other emerging markets have declined in dollar terms. While the government has identified the eurozone crisis and the increased outflow of foreign institutional investment as being the principal causes, one has to look at the shortcomings of its macroeconomic policies, especially those relating to the external economy in the context of an extremely uncertain global environment. Clearly a proximate cause such as the fast deteriorating eurozone crisis has had the potential to exacerbate one of India's well known structural rigidities, the dependence on volatile capital flows to bridge the current account deficit and support the balance of payments. The eurozone crisis has heightened risk aversion, leading to a flight of capital from countries such as India to safe havens. Many other emerging market economies have lost out but India, having an unacceptably high current account deficit, is particularly vulnerable. Again, the crisis in Europe has caused a dent in India's merchandise trade — the EU has been one of India's important export destinations. Moreover, European banks are among the largest providers of short-term debt to Indian companies. Obviously, their losses in Europe will have to be at least partially met by pulling out of India.
It is clear that a combination of interdependent factors is contributing to the rupee's decline. A multi-faceted problem does not admit of simplistic solutions. For instance, the suggestion to use the country's still sizeable-forex reserves to stem the decline is fraught with risks. The size of the reserves has been declining over the years. Experience in other countries suggests that reserves are best used to even out violent fluctuations in the exchange markets, seldom to defend the home currency over a long period. The government has announced a few austerity measures. While these are welcome, they are at best symbolic gestures. More effective measures should aim to check the trade and current account deficits. Unfortunately, many of the factors contributing to the widening deficits are beyond the control of the government. Oil prices are expected to remain sticky at the current high levels. The import bill is unlikely to come down in the foreseeable future. On the other side, exports have faltered after a heady run during most of last year. The rupee's fall is a symptom of a deeper economic malaise.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/signs-of-a-deeper-malaise/article3439613.ece
21,5,2012,"Clean hands, stay healthy","India is once again in the news for all the wrong reasons. Along with four other countries India in 2010 accounted for half the estimated number of global deaths from eight main causes in children younger than five years. A recent study in The Lancet has revealed that half the number of global deaths caused by infections again took place in these five countries. In all, there were nearly 1.7 million estimated deaths in India that year. With nearly 400,000 deaths, pneumonia turned out to be the top killer disease, followed by diarrhoea causing more than 210,000 deaths. In fact, India is one of the five countries where most have died from two preventable infectious diseases — pneumonia and diarrhoea. Apparently, in India, pneumonia felled the most in both age groups — about 143,000 deaths in neonates (less than 28 days old) and nearly 254,000 in those aged 1-59 months. The corresponding mortality figures for diarrhoea were nearly 19,000 in neonates and 193,000 children aged 1-59 months. That no significant improvements took place during the period 2005-2010 became clear in a November 2010 Lancet study that looked at the estimated deaths in 2005 at ages 1-59 months. Half the 1.5 million deaths in 2005 were from pneumonia and diarrhoea.
These findings should come as no surprise as the main causative factors have yet to be addressed. A majority of people, especially in rural areas, do not have access to safe drinking water, and sanitation and hygiene levels are terrible. A recent UNICEF report says 638 million people, or nearly 54 per cent of the population, defecate in the open. The corresponding figure in Bangladesh and Brazil is just seven per cent. The report adds that only six per cent of rural children below five years used toilets. While Jairam Ramesh, Union Minister for Drinking Water and Sanitation, is determined to rid the country of open defecation by 2017, what needs to be undertaken immediately is to spread a simple yet cost-effective public health message — the importance of handwashing with soap after defecation. Unfortunately, only about half of all Indians regularly wash their hands with soap after contact with excreta. Washing hands can cut diarrhoea by over 40 per cent, and about 30 per cent of respiratory infections, including pneumonia, can be avoided. The gain is more if this practice is adopted before eating. Global Handwashing Day, endorsed by many countries, including India, was initiated in 2008 to drive home this important message. But awareness building should be a continuous process and cannot be restricted to just one day.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/clean-hands-stay-healthy/article3439774.ece
22,5,2012,Thou shalt not ask questions,"What happens when shocking behaviour is almost predictable? The shock value diminishes? Not in the case of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who brought drama and excitement to a television news channel last week by walking out in the middle of a shoot after describing members of the invited studio audience as Maoist and CPI (M) cadres. Worse, and more shockingly, she ordered police investigations against the students among the audience who had raised uncomfortable questions during the event. Yet, everything she did at the shoot fits in with her record of past behaviour, whether as an opposition leader or as the head of the government. The Trinamool Congress leader is known for moving quickly from one display of temper to another, from one act of defiance to another. But all the qualities she showed as an opposition street-fighter with only ordinary peasants and workers for supporters have taken on a sinister form now that the might of the law-enforcing machinery stands behind her. It is one thing to rail against the government when you are in the opposition, and quite another to lash out at ordinary citizens when you are in power. But sadly, Ms Banerjee, who was elected to office riding a popular mandate for reform and change, is unable or unwilling to see this difference and make the transition from resistance to governance.
Security officials at the Chief Minister's command are treated the same way as party workers waiting on her. Cases are ordered filed and investigations undertaken at her whims and fancies. The fracas at the CNN-IBN programme in Kolkata revealed an intolerant streak that was also evident when a professor was arrested for having sent e-mails lampooning her. For Ms Banerjee, every criticism of her is engineered by her principal political opponent, the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Her way of discrediting critics, then, is to brand them as CPI (M) or Maoist supporters, forgetting conveniently that the two left groups are themselves at loggerheads. And once branded thus, in Ms Banerjee's assessment, the critics can have no cause for complaint about oppressive police action. The Chief Minister should realise that the media and ordinary citizens would necessarily subject a government to greater scrutiny than they would an opposition party. As the head of the government, Ms Banerjee should know that she is more accountable to the public than she has ever been before. If she does not change her ways, she will only have sycophants for company; everyone else will have been driven to the opposition camp.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/thou-shalt-not-ask-questions/article3443094.ece
22,5,2012,A law for those who speak up,"The murder of S.P. Mahantesh, who succumbed to injuries five days after he was brutally attacked, is a gloomy reminder of the risks of being upright in an environment that stinks of corruption. It also reinforces the need to push through with the long delayed legislation to protect whistleblowers, who often reveal information in the public interest at great personal risk. Mahantesh's death is especially poignant for The Hindu — less than a fortnight ago, the Karnataka Administrative Service officer had facilitated the release of an audit report of a cooperative society made up of employees of a public sector undertaking that is accused of making improper land allotments. While the unknown assailants must be found and brought to book, the least we owe him and other brave people who have striven to expose the nexus between politicians, bureaucrats and private interests is a legal mechanism that protects whistleblowers from harassment, threats, violence and death. While The Whistleblowers' Protection Bill 2011 was passed by the Lok Sabha last December, it has been stuck in the Upper House, thanks to belated objections and anxieties, principally from a section of the Opposition, about the “leaks” it may encourage.
Any effective whistleblower legislation has two principal aims — to protect the identity of the whistleblower and to insure him or her against disciplinary action such as suspension or dismissal. Following the murder of Satyendra Dubey, the Bihar-based engineer who exposed irregularities in road contracts, the Supreme Court in 2004 had made a strong pitch for a legal mechanism to protect whistleblowers. It was thanks to this that the Centre even got moving on drafting a law; however a Bill introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2006 was allowed to lapse. Ironically, the Bill passed by the Lok Sabha — and which faces obstruction in the Rajya Sabha — is weaker in one crucial respect. Unlike similar legislation in the United Kingdom and the United States, it limits those who may receive protection for blowing the whistle to government employees and those in societies or companies controlled by government. Given the number of RTI activists who have been murdered over the past couple of years, it is arguable that the country needs a wider and more comprehensive whistleblower protection mechanism that looks beyond government. The Bill is also vague about the manner in which the identity of whistleblowers will be protected. While it is important to recognise the limitations and the deficiencies in any legislation, it is obvious that those who risk their lives to uncover corruption would be better served by an imperfect law than no law at all.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-law-for-those-who-speak-up/article12886812.ece
23,5,2012,Wanted: A proper probe,"The rear-end train collision at Penukonda of the Bangalore-bound Hampi Express at 3 a.m. on Tuesday cannot certainly be dismissed as “yet another tragedy” on the tracks. The fact that over 25 precious lives were lost when the express train rammed into a stationary goods train raises several serious questions that the Indian Railways needs to answer. Of course, Railway Minister Mukul Roy has ordered the statutory inquiry and the usual compensation. But preliminary reports point to a problem with the signal. Was there a technical problem with the signal — a failure, in other words — or did the driver jump it? This needs to be probed properly and the Railways should not jump the gun to blame the accident on “human failure.” Even if “human failure” was involved in jumping the signal, why could the driver not see a stationary goods train in front? The Railways needs to ask searching questions about actual operating conditions at the time — such as night visibility from the driver's cab, especially if the engine was running in ‘long hood forward' mode — and see whether any system-wide changes are indicated.
What appears unfortunate is that an unreserved women's compartment bore the brunt of the collision, even catching fire. Most of the dead were women and children. The first and third coaches were badly damaged, while the second coach had a miraculous escape. Gas cutters had to be used to take out the injured as well as the bodies, some of which were charred beyond recognition. Apart from the signal issue, there is another point to ponder over. The Railways has for long been talking about the use of non-combustible or non-inflammable material in its coaches, at least to prevent a fire. How much progress has been made on this front, and when can the coach factories really roll out fire-proof coaches? Existing specifications mandate the use of fire-retardant material in coaches but this hasn't prevented devastating fires such as the one which killed 59 passengers on board the Sabarmati Express in Godhra in 2002. The Indian Railways has always mastered the art of rescue and relief operations at the site of mishaps. The Penukonda tragedy was no exception to the emergency relief operations exercise perfected over the years. But it is perhaps time for the Railways to focus more closely on accident prevention, especially of this kind — collisions — which are clearly a failing of the system. So much has also been spoken and written about anti-collision devices, which have taken a painfully long time to develop and install in all trains.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/wanted-a-proper-probe/article3446675.ece
23,5,2012,Facebook's flop show,"It was supposed to be a dream debut for the most visited site on the Internet but Facebook's Nasdaq listing on Friday turned out to be anything but that. A combination of technical glitches on the trading platform, poor investor appetite and most important of all, that old stock market trait called greed ensured that the listing turned into a flop show. But even if the stock trades well below its offer price of $38 a share now, Facebook's early investors, who include some venture capitalists, angel investors and even a Russian oligarch, are now laughing all the way to the bank. By pricing the IPO fully, the investment banks may have ensured that early investors got the maximum bang for their buck. Yet, by leaving very little on the table for new investors, the investment bankers also ensured the stock will not trade over the offer price in the near term. In a throwback to the dark days of the dot-com boom last decade, Facebook, after sensing the hype around the IPO, raised the price band from $28-35 to $34-38 a share and also increased the number of shares on offer by a quarter. It is not surprising that 60 per cent of the proceeds of the offer of $16 billion will accrue to shareholders who invested in Facebook in its early days. Of course, as those who assumed great risk in investing in an unknown company, they deserve to reap the rewards now. But should this have been at the cost of incoming investors?
The first two days of trading suggest the market is uncomfortable with Facebook's mind-boggling $104 billion valuation. The company's price-earnings ratio of 107, based on its 2011 earnings, is way ahead of the 13x that the more profitable Apple commands. The first quarter revenues and earnings also show a slowdown compared to 2011 and with General Motors recently deciding to pull out of advertising on Facebook, the concerns are real. Questions are being raised over its revenue model, which mainly relies on advertising on the site, though Facebook Credits, which it sells for applications on the site, also contribute to revenues. With about half its users accessing the site through smartphones, Facebook has to develop advertising options for them. Typically, such users find advertisements annoying on the small screen. Facebook is also experimenting in New Zealand with paid posts (NZ$2 a post) with the assurance that the recipient will surely get to see them. With petabytes of information and pictures vested with it, there is no question of the opportunity available for Facebook to leverage. How well it does that will decide whether Facebook's stock appreciates rapidly like Google's or continues to languish below the offer price.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/facebooks-flop-show/article3446678.ece
24,5,2012,Words no longer count,"Too little time to begin all over again, and too much time to continue in the same set ways. Into its fourth year, the second edition of the United Progressive Alliance government is in a make-or-break phase. Opposition parties might be judged on the basis of promises, but governments are always evaluated on the basis of performance. For the UPA, the time for words is clearly over with only two years left of its second term. At the time of the 2014 general election, the Congress and its allies will stand or fall on the strength of what's on the ground. Unfortunately, the list of what could have been is longer than the list of what is. Compared to UPA-I, which saw the implementation of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, the passing of the Forest Rights Act, the waiver of farm loans, and the implementation of the Right to Information Act, the second edition has been lacklustre. The Right to Education Act would surely have counted as a big positive if only its stated aims were close to fulfilment more than two years after its passage in Parliament. Indeed the Act typifies the working of the UPA: big on promise, tardy in implementation. On the Lok Pal Bill, every step forward was followed by two steps back. Despite growing public pressure for the creation of anti-corruption institutions, the government ensured that an effective Lok Pal would not come into being. After the 2G spectrum sale scam, the government needed a credibility boost, but the opportunities were wasted.
Notwithstanding all the talk of a rising India readying to take its “rightful place” in the world, the economy has stuttered in the last couple of years. And, income disparities and high levels of deprivation have punctured the hyperbole on India's economic growth. At the same time, there have been positives, especially on the foreign policy front. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh showed uncharacteristic drive in getting past establishment hawks to push for talks with Pakistan. The tilt towards the United States in the post-Cold War phase is still to be corrected, especially in relations with Iran, but India has also displayed a welcome willingness to work with Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa through forums such as BRICS and IBSA. Sadly for the Congress, the 2014 election is unlikely to revolve around these successes. UPA II surely needs a course correction in its domestic policies. Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who seems more clued in than Prime Minister Singh about India's need for social democratic initiatives, showed a readiness to give the government a welfarist direction when she spoke at Tuesday's function to mark its third year in office. Without it, the UPA will surely drift and lose way in the next two years.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/words-no-longer-count/article3449557.ece
24,5,2012,For the better half,"The Union Cabinet should be commended for deciding to take on board sentiments widely expressed in Parliament during the discussion on the Marriage Laws Amendment Bill, 2010, and agree to amend it to provide for a clearly defined 50 per cent claim for a wife in her husband's immovable residential property. This is the first time in India — except in Goa where the ‘community property' principle in marriage has existed as a positive legacy from Portuguese times — that a woman's rightful share in marital property has become part of marriage-related legislation. Significantly, a wife will now have claim over residential property acquired by her husband even before marriage. The Cabinet's decision to retain the mandatory six-month waiting period even in case of a divorce by mutual consent is also a well-advised move that would give more room for reconciliation where possible. Under the provisions of the original Bill, this cooling-off period could be waived by a judge on a plea by either party. In large measure, this Bill, which introduces irretrievable breakdown of a marriage as a ground for divorce, could now be said to be a progressive piece of legislation in tune with the times in terms of empowering women. Yet, a wife's share in her husband's other assets is still left to the judge's discretion.
A possible upshot of the proposed enactment, which seeks to amend the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and the Special Marriage Act, 1954, will be that divorce-related litigation would become even more fraught and protracted than it is now. The stakes being higher for both parties, court battles will be that much more bitterly contested. Looking at the large backlog of pending divorce petitions, the need to take steps to speed up their disposal is clear. The setting up of courts under the Family Courts Act, 1984, does not seem to have helped cope with the rising tide of divorce litigation. More such courts are needed, and their proper and uninterrupted functioning in tune with the spirit of the legislation has to be ensured, in order to enable them to deal with the often traumatic proceedings in a sensitive manner. The objective of the establishment of Family Courts was “to promote conciliation in, and secure speedy settlement of, disputes relating to marriage and family affairs.” The government and the judiciary ought to give a hard look at whether that objective has been met. This is also the time to reflect on whether amid all this, enough attention is paid to ensure that children caught in divorce battles get a just and fair deal, too. The child is the first, and often the worst, victim of a marriage gone wrong.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/for-the-better-half/article3449561.ece
25,5,2012,Poor petropolitics,"It is a sad irony that when international oil prices are on a downward spiral, India has administered its biggest increase ever in the domestic price of petrol. Behind this irony lies a story of gross mismanagement of the oil economy by successive governments. The winds of reform that blew across other infrastructure industries such as telecom, transforming them unrecognisably, have largely been absent in the oil industry. The result is a mess characterised by ballooning subsidies, opaque pricing policies and a government that is guided more by political expediency than economic considerations in managing the industry. The reason why Wednesday's price increase of Rs.6.28 per litre — net of taxes, translating into hikes as high as Rs.8.36 in some States — turned out to be so big is that the government, which faced State elections, did not allow oil companies to increase prices in the last six months when global oil markets were on the upswing. By the time the oil companies got the nod, their deficits had spiralled so high that shock therapy became inevitable. We might yet see a partial rollback but the question to ask is: would it not have been less painful if prices had been increased gradually over the past few months rather than in a one-shot massive hike? A regular increase in small doses might also not have elicited the kind of opposition the big raise has now engendered.
That said, we need greater transparency in the pricing methodology adopted by the oil companies who link their domestic fuel prices to those in commodity markets abroad such as in Singapore and Dubai. The concept of “under-recovery,” which is basically the difference between the landed cost of petrol and its domestic selling price, needs to be questioned. India imports crude oil and not petrol or diesel. So why should domestic prices of the two fuels be linked to their international prices? Ideally, the price build-up should be based on the landed cost of crude oil plus the cost of refining and marketing the product. The increase in petrol prices also means the gulf with diesel has widened, further distorting the dynamics of the passenger car industry. By raising petrol prices, the government has only partially addressed the problems of the oil industry. The bigger challenge is dealing with a diesel price increase that has implications for inflation. There is also the issue of paring subsidies on cooking gas and kerosene that are weighing down government finances. Apart from trying to answer the basic question of whether the subsidy on cooking gas, which is by no means a poor man's fuel, is necessary, the government needs to streamline the subsidy delivery mechanism to ensure that only the deserving enjoy it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/poor-petropolitics/article3453040.ece
25,5,2012,A library in the schoolbag,"The quest for the optimal mobile device that can advance education by improving access to learning materials and reducing costs is engaging many countries, including India. Among the more promising gadgets for the task are e-readers, which use e-ink display technology that closely matches the look and feel of a printed black and white page. Tablet computers, on the other hand, offer a full-colour, backlit screen alternative suitable for multimedia and rich content. These technologies can significantly aid the teaching-learning process. And this concept has been put to the test in a field setting in Ghana involving distribution of e-readers to hundreds of school students. One striking outcome: 43 per cent of the students, who had never used a computer, learned to use the gadget quickly. Students who had access to only a few books at home were able to read an average of 107 titles overnight. These ranged from wirelessly delivered sponsored texts to open access volumes that they downloaded. Also, several students discovered that they could listen to music, and read newspapers using the data connection. Importantly, though, 40 per cent of the gadgets broke while in use mainly because of fragile screens. These results from the project make it clear that there are key problems to be ironed out.
India's grand plan to identify a tablet device for educational purposes has been virtually stillborn. The Centre has conceded that the Aakash tablet computer distributed in limited numbers does not measure up due to problems such as heating of the device, limited battery life and unsuitable screen technology. The Department of Information Technology, which has been working with the IIT system, must show the competence necessary to come up with a robust set of specifications for the ideal “low cost access-cum-computing” device for students. The key factor that should underscore the programme is a falling price curve for the hardware. Amazon's Kindle, an e-reader, has witnessed a price fall from $399 in 2007, to $79 now. If a similar graph can be ensured in India, there can be a free or subsidised reading-learning device in every schoolbag. Moreover, the gadget must be able to exploit the ubiquitous availability of mobile data connectivity. Crucially, learning materials need to be available free of copyright costs. Literature could be sourced, for instance, using Creative Commons permission for use by students. It would be a great leap forward if a robust, affordable device can be produced through multiple vendors on an open licensing platform, with the Centre specifying the benchmarks, and monitoring compliance through a certification mechanism.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-library-in-the-schoolbag/article3453042.ece
26,5,2012,"Good Act, bad provision","The obvious, first. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, recently passed by both Houses of Parliament, must be wholeheartedly welcomed for filling a glaring lacuna in the law. While rape is a serious criminal offence under the Indian Penal Code, the law was hopelessly deficient in dealing with a range of sexual crimes such as groping and harassment, covered by weak and imprecise provisions such as “outraging the modesty of a woman.” Also, despite presumptions to the contrary, young boys are frequently subjected to sexual abuse — a study commissioned by the Ministry of Women and Child Development in 2007 showed that almost 53 per cent of the children abused were male. Against this context, the Act gets a couple of things incontestably right. It is steadfastly gender neutral. And it lays down stringent punishments (up to life imprisonment) for a broad range of sexual crimes such as non-penetrative sexual assault, sexual harassment, and the use of children for pornography. The legislation is also marked by the introduction of special procedures to prevent the re-victimisation of children at the hands of an insensitive justice delivery system. These include measures for recording a child's evidence, for protecting his or her identity and for providing children with assistance and expertise from professionals in the fields of psychology, social work and so on.
The problem with the Bill lies in an indefensible change made at the behest of the Parliamentary Standing Committee that reviewed it. While the earlier 2001 version of the Bill did not punish consensual sexual activity if one or both partners were above 16 years, the one recently passed criminalises all sexual contact either with or between those under 18. The change is out of consonance with other laws not to speak of our social realities. Under Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, sex with a girl under 16 years with or without her consent amounts to rape. To believe that it is too early for those between 16 and 18 to have sex is one thing. But to criminalise all consensual sexual activity on the ground that everyone below 18 is a child — and that too in a conflicted social environment where child marriages persist on the one hand and where teenagers are becoming increasingly aware about sexuality on the other — can have terrible consequences. Only recently, the Delhi High Court described the move to raise the age of consent from 16 to 18 as “regressive” and “draconian,” while acquitting a youth of kidnapping and raping a 17-year-old girl who he had gotten married too. In its present form, the Bill seems set to encourage bogus and unjustified complaints. The best solution? Retain the Act and amend the age provision.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/good-act-bad-provision/article3456804.ece
26,5,2012,Netanyahu gets it all,"Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's deal whereby the centrist opposition Kadima Party has joined his Likud-led coalition government may be one of the most adept pieces of realpolitik by any political leader for a long time, but it raises as many problems for the rest of the world as it solves for Mr. Netanyahu. The deal was made on May 8, even as the Knesset, Israel's unicameral parliament, was voting on its own dissolution for a general election a year ahead of schedule. The ruling coalition was under severe pressure, with Likud's own right wing and cabinet hardliners demanding legislation to regularise West Bank constructions that the High Court had ruled were on land looted from Palestinians; in addition, religious parties in government wanted orthodox Jews to be allowed military service deferment. Therefore, bringing the largest single party — Kadima has 28 seats — into government has given the coalition 94 out of 120 Knesset seats; Mr. Netanyahu will stay in office until October 2013 and will now get parliamentary approval for anything he does. The deal, moreover, wrong-foots the centre-left Labor Party, which had expected to win seats at Kadima's expense in the now-cancelled election.
Mr. Netanyahu emerges as the outright winner. Poll ratings had portended a Kadima meltdown to about 10 or 11 seats, but joining the government makes its leader, Shaul Mofaz, look opportunistic and will reduce any moderating influence he might otherwise have had. Furthermore, Mr. Mofaz has accepted the deputy prime ministership despite his previous attacks on Mr. Netanyahu, and has reneged on a pledge never to join a Netanyahu government. Secondly, the Prime Minister can use Kadima's coalition presence to justify concessions, however minuscule and insincere, towards the Palestinians. Equally, with no significant opposition in Parliament and a main coalition partner which needs him for its own political survival, Mr. Netanyahu can intensify his talk of war with Iran and can ignore strong cautionary advice from Israel's military and security services. In addition, his inflammatory rhetoric serves to blackmail the United States and its western allies into strengthening sanctions against Iran. That is exactly what Mr. Netanyahu wants, as do the oil corporations and Saudi Arabia, who fear the impact on crude prices of increased world oil supply. It also diverts attention from the matter of justice for the Palestinians — which Israel wants excluded from the political space. Mr. Netanyahu has already achieved that objective in part.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/netanyahu-gets-it-all/article3456797.ece
28,5,2012,Poverty of measurement,"The government has constituted one more expert group to re-examine the methodology for fixing a poverty line and estimating the incidence of poverty in the country. Changes in average incomes and consumption patterns over time may require review and revision of the approach currently in use. However, the last such review of the methodology originally recommended by the Lakdawala committee (1993) was undertaken after more than a decade by the Suresh Tendulkar Committee. The Tendulkar committee was constituted in December 2005, submitted its report in November 2009 and its recommendations were formally accepted only in 2011. The decision to revisit the matter again so soon suggests the government is finding it difficult to offer a credible estimate of what can be considered a consumption basket and level of expenditure that would provide a definition of poverty. This lack of credibility stems from multiple sources. The first is the absolute value of the poverty line. Few are willing to accept the official position that a measly Rs. 32 a day in urban areas or Rs. 26 a day in rural areas in 2010-11 was adequate to lift a person out of poverty. The second is evidence that while the Lakdawala committee had anchored the poverty estimate on a minimum calorific intake, the current poverty line excludes from the poor those whose calorific intake falls far short of the Lakdawala minimum. Third are the estimates of the incidence of poverty at the level of the nation and the States yielded by the official poverty lines, which are seen as too low to be acceptable. This is also a material issue since these estimates are being used to identify those who should be given the benefit of state support as part of the misplaced “targeting” of welfare programmes.
These controversies demarcate the task of the new committee headed by C. Rangarajan. Rather than seek a number that sets a cap on access to state programmes, it should define what in the current historical and social context could be considered a minimally acceptable level of consumption expenditure. To do so it should identify a defensible anchor (like calorific intake) or set of anchors to which poverty line estimates would be tethered for a reasonable period into the future. And, finally, it should find a robust methodology that would generate estimates that allow inter-temporal comparisons of poverty incidence so as to assess the impact that the path of development being pursued has had on poverty levels. These are objectives that must be met if the exercise is not to be seen as one more attempt to obfuscate uncomfortable truths.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/poverty-of-measurement/article3462829.ece
28,5,2012,"Egyptians make history, again","Egypt's 51 million voters have made history by voting in their country's first-ever free and open presidential election. They have also proved almost all commentators wrong in the choices they made. The Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Morsi, standing on the ticket of the Freedom and Justice Party, has 25.3 per cent of the first-round vote to 24.9 for Ahmed Shafik, standing as an independent candidate. Final figures will not be known before May 29, and the runoff will be held on June 16 and 17. None of the 12 candidates emerged as a clear pre-election leader, but the surprises include the left-Nasserist independent Hamdeen Sabbahi, who took approximately 20 per cent on a strong social-justice platform. The candidates with higher campaign profiles, such as Amr Moussa, former secretary general of the Arab League, or the ex-Brotherhood independent Islamist, Abdul Moneim Aboul Fotouh, made little impression in the poll itself. It is highly significant that neither of the two front-runners has been harmed by their antecedents. The Brotherhood chose the uncharismatic Morsi only when the Higher Presidential Electoral Commission disqualified its first choice, Khairat al-Shater, for an unresolved criminal conviction. For his part, Mr. Shafik, a former fighter pilot and long-term civil aviation minister in the Hosni Mubarak dictatorship, was also Prime Minister for a month before Mr. Mubarak was ousted by the Tahrir Square revolution.
Mr. Morsi has benefited from the Brotherhood's huge party machine and its supporters' deep social conservatism, and Mr. Shafik from political conservatism among those who staff major institutions like the military, the civil service, the judiciary, and the police. They could well see him as Egypt's best defence against the Islamism, however moderate it is said to be, of the Brotherhood, and against the uncertainties embodied by the urban and tech-savvy younger generation whose courage precipitated the end of the dictatorship 15 months ago. The liberal or left-liberal vote may have been split between Mr. Sabbahi and Mr. Moussa, and the younger democrats are the biggest losers in this election, because the greatest impact of the conservatives' first-round win will probably be shown in the new constitution, which is yet to be written and will either reflect the dominance of Islamist MPs in the already-elected parliament or reveal tensions between them and Mr. Shafik. Irrespective of the eventual outcome, however, the whole election remains a triumph for the hundreds of thousands of young people who started the Egyptian revolution in February 2011. Democracy is not a one-shot game and their continued engagement and vigilance are essential for its success.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/egyptians-make-history-again/article3462831.ece
4,6,2012,The knives are out,"The Bharatiya Janata Party has long since lost its brand image of being a party “with a difference.” Even the joke about the BJP being a party “with differences” has begun to fray at the edges. Indeed, in the eight years since it made the transition to Principal Opposition Party, the BJP has rarely been in the news for anything but its in-house squabbles. Today, as Lal Krishna Advani takes on Nitin Gadkari, who has himself just about escaped being mauled in a battle with Narendra Modi, there is no saying who else will jump into the fight. The latest to don the boxing gloves is none other than the BJP's mouthpiece, Kamal Sandesh, which delivered some stinging homilies to the Gujarat Chief Minister. Not long ago, Mr. Advani, Mr. Modi and Arun Jaitley formed the troika that was seen to be ranged against the party's second rung. Even as the feuding raged, entered Mr. Gadkari, a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-appointee, apparently on a mission to spread sunshine and cheer in the party. But obviously the party chief did not take the high seat in the BJP merely to win a geniality contest. As Mr. Gadkari set about clipping some important wings in the party — including notably that of the Gujarat Chief Minister — his own ambitions came to the fore. And yet there was only one way the Modi-Gadkari war could end — with Mr. Modi emerging triumphant.
For Mr. Gadkari, it was a hard choice. Either he allowed Mr. Modi to rub his nose in the ground or he settled for a deal whereby he would get a second term as chief in return for unreservedly acknowledging Mr. Modi as the future leader. The unstated subtext was of course that the Gujarat Chief Minister would be the BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate for the 2014 general election. But surely in a party brimming over with PM-hopefuls, the twosome should have known better than to seal the deal by themselves. Mr. Gadkari got his second term only to face an unexpected party-pooper in the form of Mr. Advani. The curious thing here is the see-sawing Advani-Modi relationship. Once Mr. Modi's most ardent supporter, Mr. Advani today feels badly treated by the younger man. His outburst against Mr. Gadkari (recorded in his blog) is at least in part directed at Mr. Modi, and as much is evident from the party organ's indirect barbs at Mr. Modi. If there is a beneficiary here, it is the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance. Scam-tainted as it is, the UPA even at its lowest point has more allies by its side than the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance and for the only reason that the BJP continues to be viewed as a party with a sectarian agenda. As a deeply polarising figure, Mr. Modi cannot but further disadvantage the NDA.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-knives-are-out/article3487148.ece
4,6,2012,Updating our copyright laws,"Public discourse on the omnibus copyright law changes approved by Parliament last month has largely focused on the controversy in the film industry over the provision that gives music composers and lyricists the right to claim royalties if their music is used in any other form — a ring tone, for example — apart from the film for which the composition was made and sold. The change, which is in keeping with the practice in Hollywood and elsewhere in the West, puts an end to a stifling and commercially exploitative system in which film producers, and not the creators of music, were regarded as the sole author of the work. Almost unnoticed in the producer versus composer hullabaloo were some other progressive changes in the Copyright Act such as the one that allows organisations to provide persons suffering from disabilities with access to special formats of books on a non-profit basis without the consent of the copyright owner — an empowering provision that will encourage conversion of books into accessible formats such as Braille and Daisy. The Bill is also a boost for the open licensing model with the idea of a stronger public domain reflected in the amended Section 21 that permits authors to relinquish any or all copyright rights through a mere notice to the Registrar of Copyrights.
Interestingly, the provision for parallel imports of books, part of an earlier 2010 version of the Bill, has been quietly dropped. Parallel imports would have allowed the import of a book published outside India without the mandatory licence from its Indian copyright owner. Although such imports would have liberalised book distribution, some Indian publishing houses, which stand to gain from their monopolies over the import of books, seem to have had their way. Overall, the copyright amendments were justified by the government as a measure to update existing laws with international and World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) norms. Although India is not a signatory to either the WIPO Copyright Treaty or the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, which address the challenge of protecting copyright of works over the internet, the Bill recognises the Digital Rights Management regime which is designed to ensure copyright holders can use technology such as encryption and access control devices to prevent illegal reproduction. The use of such digital locks in impeding the free exchange of content is a controversial and complex issue. Indian courts must now ensure that the DRM regime strikes the right balance between the interest of copyright owners and the legitimate, fair use access of users to digital content.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/updating-our-copyright-laws/article3487149.ece
5,6,2012,Bihar's caste curse,"Bihar under Nitish Kumar received some stunning good news last week. Long condemned as a basket case, the State buried that image once and for all with a chartbuster GDP growth of 13 per cent. Remarkably, Chief Minister Kumar achieved this in just seven years, setting an example for other leaders struggling to lift their States out of crushing poverty and economic backwardness. Yet only days after scaling this wonderful statistical peak, Bihar would return with a vengeance to its badlands past, with mayhem and worse following the murder of Brahmeshwar Singh, the unofficial chief of the outlawed Ranvir Sena. The violence rekindled memories of an earlier Bihar, where lawlessness was a given, and the Sena, an upper caste Bhumihar-led private militia, plundered and killed as it pleased. Formed in the early 1990s, the Sena ruled unchecked for a decade, leaving its bloody imprints on large swathes of central and south Bihar, where its primary adversaries were the Naxals led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist Leninist-Liberation) and the Maoist Communist Centre. And yet, the victims of this class war were almost always the landless Dalits, newly awakening to Bihar's gross caste inequalities but nonetheless rendered doubly vulnerable by their poverty and their social exclusion.
The Sena's signature was evident in over 40 massacres, with the landmark cases of Bathani Tola, Laxmanpur Bathe and Shankarbigha accounting for the murders of over 100 Dalits and Muslims. The Sena's sadistic trait was revealed in the fact that it did not just kill randomly, it acted by design, picking women and children as its targets. Bitter memories of that period were stirred again when the Patna High Court in April this year acquitted all 23 men charged with the Bathani Tola carnage. The court cited lack of prosecutable evidence against the accused but for the families of the victims, this was no consolation. Indeed, the release of the men, among them Brahmeshwar Singh himself, was a warning that Bihar could yet relive the caste nightmare of the 1990s. Tragically, the Nitish Kumar government failed to anticipate the violence inherent in the situation. The regime ought to have exercised vigil, and all the more in view of the perception that the Janata Dal (United) is a patron of the Bhumihars. In his time, Lalu Prasad was wont to boast that he had given swar (voice) to the Dalits of Bihar and he would give them swarg (heaven) too. The caste massacres showed up the emptiness of his words. Under Mr. Kumar, Bihar has admittedly come a long way from the hopelessness of that period. It would be a pity if the feel-good vibes were to escape the Dalits and the landless who form the lowest rung of the social ladder.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bihars-caste-curse/article3490670.ece
5,6,2012,It must come from within,"The massacre in the western Syrian village of Taldou, near Houla, on May 25 has exposed, yet again, international divisions over the civil war in Syria. United Nations observers in Syria have confirmed that 108 civilians, including 49 women and 34 children, were killed and hundreds more wounded as heavy artillery, tanks, and “point-blank range” rifle fire were used against them; they add that most of the dead were executed. The U.N. Security Council received a closed video-conference briefing from Major-General Robert Mood, head of the 280-member Supervising Mission in Syria, and then issued a statement condemning the “outrageous use of force” involving government artillery and tank shelling against a residential neighbourhood. The world body's special envoy, Kofi Annan, has arrived in Damascus to see if anything in the six-point plan he proposed in April, such as a ceasefire and a recall of government troops to barracks, can be implemented. Kuwait, the current president of the Arab League, has announced that it will host an emergency meeting of the grouping. President Bashar al-Assad's government has denied responsibility for the deaths and attributes them to a terrorist attack — its term for opposition groupings. Survivors and eyewitnesses say that pro-government militias known as the shabiha were also involved on the army side.
Unfortunately, the condemnations are unlikely to have much effect because the rest of the world cannot agree on what is happening or on what to do about it. The Security Council statement is not binding, it seems to have been toned down at Russian insistence, and it did not end the violence; another 24 people, again including children, were killed in Hama on May 27. The main opposition group, the Syrian National Council, says that if the international community does not protect Syrian civilians then it will have to take matters into its own hands. The Free Syrian Army, for its part, says the Annan plan is dead. The U.N. has no fallback proposals at present, and Russia is against any deal whereby Mr. Assad would step down, as Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh did in February. Russia, Mr. Assad's strongest international backer, has however stated that the Annan plan is still the best available, and that, for its own part, it is ready to consider further work to coordinate international efforts on Syria. Moscow has thereby sent the crucial message that it is prepared to back a political settlement which the Syrians devise themselves. That will be not only the best but the only tenable outcome, and the world must help — and pressure — the Syrian government and opposition groups to achieve it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/it-must-come-from-within/article3490671.ece
6,6,2012,A surgical purge,"“What does not kill me makes me stronger.” True to this Nietzsche maxim, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik seems to have emerged stronger after the failed coup against him while he was away on an official visit to the United Kingdom. In a series of moves that began soon after his return, Mr. Patnaik has dropped three ministers from the cabinet and consolidated his support-base in the ruling Biju Janata Dal. The suspended rebel leader, Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament Pyari Mohan Mohapatra, could only watch in helplessness the rapid depletion of his following once it became clear that he would not be able to successfully challenge Mr. Patnaik. Indeed, the Chief Minister met many of the dissidents who attended a meeting called by Mr. Mohapatra and obtained details of the main conspirators and the deliberations at the meeting. The remedial action was surgical in its precision, targeting the ringleaders and leaving alone those who claimed to have been misled. Not having alienated the entire group of dissidents, Mr. Patnaik thus retains a comfortable majority in the legislature. Besides the three ministers, only two of the dissident MLAs were suspended. The forgiven dissidents, like new converts, are now full of faith and repentance. The unsuccessful coup seamlessly gave way to a successful purge.
But Mr. Patnaik would be mistaken to assume that his tactical handling of the post-coup situation would bring down the curtain on all his political troubles. That Mr. Mohapatra could not muster the necessary numbers must have been comforting to Mr. Patnaik, but the question to ask is about the support that the rebel group managed to get initially. Surely, if some 30 MLAs can be persuaded to attend a meeting of dissidents, there must have been something seriously wrong with Mr. Patnaik's governance or style of functioning. In recent months, the mining scam had cast its shadow on the government, and Mr. Patnaik, who enjoys a relatively clean image, was seen as slow to act. Justice M.B. Shah, who heads the Commission of Inquiry set up to probe illegal mining of iron ore and manganese, had drawn attention to the involvement of bureaucrats in the illegal mining. But, to Mr. Patnaik's advantage, the rebel group itself was packed with persons of dubious character, and the allegations made by Mr. Mohapatra lacked credibility. Even so, Chief Minister Patnaik would do well to treat the threat to his leadership as a wake-up call, and pay greater attention to governance and development, and livelihood issues in Odisha. Otherwise, a fourth successive term might elude him in the general election two years from now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-surgical-purge/article3494074.ece
6,6,2012,A welcome move,"In a big push towards the adoption of a similar measure globally, the European Parliament voted overwhelmingly last month for a financial transaction tax across the bloc of 27 states. The objective behind the move is to ensure that the financial sector contributes its share to a more broad-based European economic recovery. After all, taxpayer money to the tune of €4.6 trillion was committed to this sector during the economic crisis. The European Commission proposes a levy on all transactions on instruments between financial institutions when one of the parties is located in the European Union. The European Parliament would like those outside also to be covered where securities originating in the EU are involved. The modest levy of 0.1 per cent on shares and bonds and 0.01 per cent on derivatives is expected to encourage compliance, make relocation costlier and potentially raise €57 billion annually. Moreover, the revenues from the new tax could reduce national contribution to the EU budget by half. Significantly, house mortgages, bank loans, insurance contracts and small businesses fall outside the scope of the tax. Legislators have also advocated an exemption for pension funds.
A Euro barometer survey claims 66 per cent support among Europeans for the Franco-German initiative; ordinary Europeans clearly see the measure as a sign of a more even sharing of the burden of the financial crisis. The fact that this sector is under-taxed in comparison with others in the EU perhaps strengthens the case further. Not to mention the €18 billion tax advantage owing to the VAT exemption on financial services every year, according to the European Commission. But implementation is clearly a long way yet, with Britain and other countries rejecting the move, arguing that such a tax would do little to address the real issues. The Conservative-led coalition of David Cameron has even voiced strong concern over the proposal's impact on London's pre-eminence as the world's biggest financial hub. In terms of procedure, the proposal has to be unanimously approved by the finance ministers of all the EU states and would come into force not before 2015. Given the financial distress that Greece and other countries of southern Europe are faced with, coupled with crippling austerity measures, a device such as the financial transaction tax would give governments a certain cushion against future contingencies. The progress on the EU tax will to a large extent determine the prospects of establishing a similar tax at the global level, attempts towards which have been spearheaded by France and Germany.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-welcome-move/article3494075.ece
7,6,2012,Clouds that cheer,"The interest in the monsoon can sometimes be obsessive and is a measure of the extent to which these rains rule the tempo of life in this country. The twists and turns that a rainy season inevitably takes are carefully scrutinised for portends of its outcome. This year, amidst a gloomy economic outlook, with a rupee that has sharply depreciated and prices heading the other way, such concerns are all the greater. Using a statistical model, the India Meteorological Department had predicted in mid-May that the monsoon would set in over Kerala on June 1 with an error bar of four days. So, when the monsoon appeared to be lagging, questions inevitably came to be asked. To the relief of all, the meteorological agency was able to declare on June 5 that the monsoon had at last arrived. The rain-bearing clouds will go on to cover the whole country in the coming weeks, ending the reign of oppressive summer temperatures. The monsoon generally reaches Kerala around June 1. Data for the years from 1901 to 2000 show the onset occurring as early as May 11 (in 1918) and as late as June 18 (in 1972). However, in about half those years the monsoon got in between May 28 and June 5. More importantly, the date of onset says little about how the monsoon will fare. Despite its early arrival, the 1918 monsoon ended in a severe drought. The monsoon of 1983, on the other hand, which sauntered in on June 13, went on to provide the country with ample rain.
Now that the monsoon has come, its progression northwards to cover the rest of the country could well occur in spurts, sometimes moving forward swiftly and at other times dawdling infuriatingly. In every monsoon, rains are not evenly spread either spatially or in time. Some places receive too much rain and get flooded while other parts of the country get too little. Active phases can be interspersed with periods when the rains weaken. Breaks in the monsoon, when large swathes of the country receive little or no rain for prolonged periods, are always worrying. What happens in the Pacific Ocean could have a considerable impact on how this year's monsoon fares. The below average temperatures that prevailed in the equatorial waters of that ocean, known as a La Niña and which is generally beneficial for the Indian monsoon, has dissipated. There is concern that an El Niño, with a warming of the equatorial Pacific that often leads to less rainfall over India, could emerge to take its place. In a recent speech, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee observed that a normal monsoon would help propel an economic recovery for the country. One hopes that this is the sort of monsoon we have this time.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/clouds-that-cheer/article3497883.ece
7,6,2012,Ambitious but not realistic,"The latest supplement to the five-year Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) (2009-14) announced by the Commerce Minister on Tuesday certainly does not lack ambition. Exports which rose 21 per cent to cross $300 billion at the end of last year are budgeted to touch $500 billion by April 2014, admittedly an extremely tough task during a period of macroeconomic stress in India and abroad. The medium-term goal is for India's share in global exports to double by 2020. These two objectives are predicated on an export performance scaling new heights consistently and well into the medium term. Reiterating the objectives of the FTP, the supplement focusses on spurring investment and job creation and hastening diversification of markets as well as products. The government would appear to have made considerable progress in realising the last objective: amid persistent slowdown in India's principal export markets, Europe and the U.S., Indian exporters — with help from the government — managed to tap newer markets in Latin America, Africa and the CIS countries with a variety of conventional and non-conventional merchandise exports. Until recently, India's exports appeared to buck the trend of declining world trade in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. However, recent performance has been modest, inevitably reflecting the sharp economic slowdown in India. Manufacturing, which has strong connections to exports and job creation, actually contracted during the fourth quarter of last year, dragging GDP growth down to a 32 quarter low of 5.3 per cent.
Of the seven key measures announced, two stand-out. The extension of the duty-free export promotion capital goods (EPCG) scheme and the expanded interest subvention plan are noteworthy also because these two measures have large fiscal implications and have been included despite obvious budgetary constraints. The interest subvention had cost the exchequer Rs.996 crore in 2011-12. It is expected to go up by another Rs.200 crore, now that its coverage is being expanded. While generally welcoming the measures, exporters have pointed out that the FTP does not specifically address the high transaction costs and inadequate physical infrastructure that have been holding back India's international trade. Clearly, solutions to those require a coordinated approach by the government and the private sector and cannot be left to the Commerce Ministry alone. One point of justifiable criticism: the FTP supplement is overwhelmingly focussed on exports while remaining relatively silent on imports. With very few restrictions in place, a trend of declining non-oil imports, especially of capital goods and raw materials, is a sure sign of economic slowdown.

8,6,2012,Settle election disputes quickly,"Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram may have failed in his bid to avert a trial in a case challenging the validity of his election in 2009 from the Sivaganga parliamentary constituency. But does the Madras High Court's decision dismissing his plea to strike off the election petition filed by his opponent, the AIADMK's Raja Kannappan, signify anything more than a small embarrassment? While the allegations made by Mr. Kannappan are of a serious nature, the germane issue is whether this case against Mr. Chidambaram will be decided before he completes his five-year term as a Lok Sabha MP. The answer: probably not. The delay in disposing of election petitions, which are rarely settled before the term of the elected candidate runs out, is a major flaw of our electoral system. This is not the way things were supposed to be. Section 86 (6) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 enjoins High Courts to hold trials “from day to day” until their conclusion. And subsection 86 (7) declares that “every election petition shall be tried as expeditiously as possible and endeavour shall be made to conclude the trial within six months from the date on which the election petition is presented to the High Court on trial.” Unfortunately, the speed of the judicial system has failed to keep up with the demands of the law.
Faced with the phenomenon of election petitions becoming infructuous, as they remained pending after the term of the House expired, the 2nd Administrative Reforms Commission recommended the setting up of special tribunals to expedite their disposal. The enormous irony of delay was brought home in the case of Congress MLA P. Veldurai, whose election to Cheranmahadevi in 2006 was set aside by the Supreme Court at a time when he was busy campaigning to be elected to another Tamil Nadu constituency in 2011! That the court ordered to him to repay the salary he earned as a legislator was hardly recompense to his opponent, who was unjustly denied Assembly membership. The High Court's decision allowing the trial against Mr. Chidambaram to take place should not be interpreted — as some of his political opponents have chosen to — as evidence of his guilt. No conclusion should be drawn about the merits of the petition and the calls for his resignation over this are unreasonable. The Court's decision only means that the charges, with the exception of two that have been struck off, will now be examined in detail during the trial. However, in the interest of justice and in recognition of the centrality of elections to our constitutional framework, this should take place as expeditiously as possible.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/settle-election-disputes-quickly/article3501800.ece
8,6,2012,Making the stimulus work,"The government's well publicised announcement to kick-start key infrastructure projects as a means of reviving the economy might have cheered the stock markets but instant market reactions are not the best guide to economic policymaking. The government needs to convince an increasingly cynical audience that its sound theoretical assumptions — of massive investments in core infrastructure areas acting as a catalyst for spurring economic growth — can in fact be implemented at this juncture. In addition to boosting investment rates across several sectors in the short-run, infrastructure development will remove supply-side constraints to economic growth in the long run. It is in the practical aspects of their implementation — the fact especially that many of the projects have not delivered on their initial promises or become controversial in some way — that the infrastructure sector has earned a bad name. The Centre has proposed an investment of at least Rs.2 lakh crore during the current fiscal year. Earlier this year, in his budget speech, the Finance Minister estimated that in the Twelfth Plan period, infrastructure investment will go up to Rs.50 lakh crore, to be funded equally by the public and private sectors.
Those are gargantuan amounts and on the face of it, mobilising them appears to be the biggest hurdle. However, several expert committees have vouched for the availability of money, given the right policy. One strategy could be to invite the private sector in order to lessen the dependence on public funding. However, attempts to create a conducive environment for private sector participation with a credible and transparent regulatory mechanism have not been wholly successful. Besides, private capital has not been attracted to areas such as irrigation, water supply and sanitation. Even as the government continues to swear by it, the time has come to question the very large reliance on the public-private partnerships (PPP) route for promoting and running infrastructure projects. Some of the showpieces set up through the PPP route have become controversial. Over the recent past the government has taken a number of steps to facilitate infrastructure funding. Some of these, such as the one allowing easy access to external commercial borrowings, smack of short-termism and should be avoided, while those that seek to attract traditional infrastructure investors such as pension funds and insurance companies are clearly on. In announcing a stimulus package for the economy, the government's aim might be to demonstrate its assertiveness in decision making; but as long as it walks the talk, it is not infrastructure alone that will benefit.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/making-the-stimulus-work/article3501801.ece
9,6,2012,Diesel dilemma,"Faced with criticism that rich buyers of diesel cars are benefiting from subsidies on the fuel, the government is considering imposing a higher excise duty on such motor vehicles. Sales of diesel cars and utility vehicles have been rising steadily in the last year and more thanks to the wide gulf between the retail prices of petrol and diesel. Historically in India, higher taxes have always made petrol more expensive than diesel. With the government in recent times being chary of raising the price of diesel due to its impact on inflation — the last increase was effected a year ago — the price gulf with petrol only widened further, especially because petrol prices continued to rise. Spotting an opportunity here, car manufacturers pushed diesel engine models in the market. Though considerably more expensive than their petrol variants — and there is no real economic justification for why this should be so — diesel cars were still attractive for consumers given the lower fuel costs. This naturally led to the increasing ‘dieselisation' of private motor transport. Other undeserving users getting subsidised include mobile phone companies who use diesel to power thousands of towers across the country.
While the revenues from the higher duty on diesel cars may be welcome to a funds-starved government and the move will also address critics who feel that rich car buyers are walking off with a subsidy aimed at the poor, a few questions nevertheless arise. Studies show that diesel cars as a category consume just between 12-15 per cent of all diesel sold in the country. Higher excise will help recoup some of the undeserved subsidy the owners of new cars will enjoy but what about the existing population of diesel cars? Surely they cannot continue to enjoy the subsidy. Perhaps the government ought to look into introducing a variable annual road tax on all cars with the levy on diesel cars pegged to neutralise the advantage of subsidised diesel. Car manufacturers insist that any punitive levy on diesel cars will affect the profitability of investments already made in plant and machinery. But the demand for diesel cars will also fall if the fuel subsidy were eliminated say, by a system of dual pricing. In Ireland, for example, farm diesel, with a green additive, sells for roughly €0.5 a litre less than regular diesel. If farm consumption has to be subsidised, dual pricing is an option that India should seriously consider, though stringent monitoring against diversion and resale is essential. By one estimate, roughly 10 per cent of all diesel sold in Ireland is illegal. Whatever the government decides, however, it must find a way to stop subsidising the owners of diesel motor cars.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/diesel-dilemma/article3505961.ece
9,6,2012,The missing EU link,"Last week's talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his counterparts in Berlin and Paris were dominated by the catastrophic civil war in Syria, but the relations Russia has with France and Germany involve other significant issues as well. Mr. Putin started his third term in office by visiting Belarus first, and then the two giants of the European Union. He will have noted the new French President, François Hollande's statement that international military involvement in Syria cannot be ruled out, as well as the likelihood that Mr. Hollande was largely addressing a domestic audience. The Russo-German relationship, however, is one of disagreement, mutual caution, and mutual dependence. The disagreements extend beyond the Syrian situation to a stalemate on visa regulations; there is also a personal coolness between Mr. Putin and Chancellor Angela Merkel. Mr. Putin, for his part, is aware of Ms Merkel's antipathy towards communism and towards former Soviet officials who now hold high posts in Russia. Yet Russian exports to Germany currently earn €25 billion a year, and Berlin's dependence on Nord Stream — the undersea natural gas pipeline from Russia — will only increase in the years ahead. By bypassing problematic transit countries like Ukraine, Russia has not only increased its earnings potential but also reduced the chances of Germany and other Western powers using former Soviet satellites as leverage against Moscow.
The limits to which either side can go, however, are illuminating. Germany, as Der Spiegel International notes, for example, gets 35 per cent of its natural gas needs from the Nord Stream line, but its attempts to find non-Russian sources face problems following the near collapse of the Nabucco project for Caspian Sea gas. A second Russian pipeline — which would deepen German dependence — is in prospect, but Berlin is relying more on renewables as it closes down its nuclear programme, and both France and Germany can now buy cheaper United States gas if they wish. The key underlying issue here, however, is the apparent non-involvement of the EU as a whole. Moscow sees EU procedures and standards as obstacles, but needs German cooperation for its dealings with the Union; that alone could give the EU greater leverage than it now has. Secondly, Mr. Putin's absences from the G-8 meeting at Camp David and the Nato summit in Chicago, both in May, will lose effect if repeated. While Russia understandably says world security and world problems can be settled only with Russian support, the active engagement of the EU, via a coherent and decisive foreign policy based in part on common concerns with Russia, is long overdue; it could greatly strengthen moves towards global peace.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-missing-eu-link/article3505962.ece
11,6,2012,No alternative to regulation,"The decision of the University Grants Commission to defer a move to accommodate foreign higher educational institutions as deemed universities is sensible, considering that starting universities generally requires Parliamentary sanction. Using the UGC to help entities from abroad make a covert entry would be grossly improper when the Foreign Educational Institutions (Regulation of Entry and Operations) Bill, 2010 has stalled in the Rajya Sabha. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Human Resource Development has raised several issues relating to the legislation and called for a centralised policy and regulatory regime. What needs to be done immediately is to curb the operation of many unauthorised entrants that are exploiting the prevailing policy vacuum. It is true that a large number of Indian students leave for foreign campuses every year to secure a degree. There is much to be gained, therefore, if the best universities abroad open campuses in India, and offer courses that live up to their reputation for academic rigour. For the student, such an option can mean much lower costs.
Evidently, the passing of a robust law is essential to make sure that exploitation of students by foreign institutions does not take place. What has happened so far in the area of technical education and management courses offered by foreign entities, under the rules of the All India Council for Technical Education, is far from encouraging. The Standing Committee says the AICTE rules have failed to regulate the activities of such institutions, and only a handful of unapproved entities have been proceeded against. A large number of foreign institutions operating twinning programmes partnered unaffiliated and unapproved domestic organisations. As a result of such carpetbagging, the UGC has now initiated a clean-up by laying down that twinning or joint ventures can be undertaken only with the top 500 names in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, and a similar list of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University. This is a welcome advance over the present situation but no substitute for hard decisions on issues such as registration, transparent accreditation, socially-relevant medical education, faculty training, mutual recognition of degrees by the respective countries, and crucially, a check on profiteering. It must be emphasised that while an international education can expose some of India's youth to global excellence, equitable access to higher education will depend on a rapidly expanding public university system.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-alternative-to-regulation/article3512521.ece
11,6,2012,Mess in the slum capital,"Slum rehabilitation in Mumbai is in total disarray. Corrupt practices and inept institutions continue to deny stable housing, access to sanitation and quality life to a large number of slum dwellers who make up more than half of the city's population. Worse, this vast marginalised group, as recently witnessed in Sion Koliwada, lives under a cloud of fear unleashed by vested interests who want to appropriate their land. To other Indian cities, Mumbai's slum rehabilitation is not any more a role model to emulate, but an execrable experience to avoid. Two decades ago, about four million people were living in slums. The State government, realising that their earlier policies neither reduced the numbers nor substantially improved shanty settlements, adopted a new approach. It set up the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) in 1995 with an emphasis on using the slum lands as a resource. The idea was to rope in private developers and encourage them to redevelop areas by permitting more dwelling units than what the building rules allowed. The excess units were to be sold and the money so mobilised was meant to subsidise reconstruction of slum tenements. On the face of it, this approach appeared well meaning. However, on the ground, it was blatantly misused, denying the needy the benefit of owning a house even as small as 270 sq.ft.
Despite many complaints, the SRA did not carry out comprehensive surveys of slums nor prepare a well-verified list of eligible beneficiaries. Proper photo identification was not fully issued to the allottees, allowing many illegible users to benefit. The SRA, as a recent CAG report reveals, adopted improper practices that affected the performance of projects: proper evaluation of builders was not undertaken; dues were not recovered; projects were not properly monitored, resulting in poor construction and delay. The state of the flagship project — the Dharavi Redevelopment Project — is no better. Even eight years after sanctioning and spending about Rs.50 crore in planning, not even one of the five sectors earmarked for redevelopment has taken off. As a result, Mumbai has so far rehabilitated only about 15 per cent of the targeted four million slum dwellers, even as the number of people living in slums has crossed 6.5 million. The limitations of the State machinery to deliver slum tenements may justify joint ventures with private builders. But what is required is total transparency in decision-making, complete disclosure of project details, clear enunciation of specifications and deliverables, undiluted monitoring and periodic public consultation. Above all, slum rehabilitation has to take a people first approach and must benefit only the deserving.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mess-in-the-slum-capital/article12899406.ece
12,6,2012,The truth must still be told,"“Iwill open my mouth,” Major Avtar Singh had told the journalist, Hartosh Singh Bal, last year. “I will not keep quiet.'' This weekend, Singh, facing extradition proceedings for his alleged role in the brutal 1996 murder of Kashmiri human rights activist and lawyer Jalil Andrabi, shot himself, his wife, and their two young children, at their home in Selma, California. In weeks to come, theories about what led Singh to engage in his savage act will likely proliferate. There is only one fact, though, that we can be certain of: no one will ever now know what he might have told a judge about the murder of Andrabi. The basic facts about the Andrabi case, though, are well known. In 1996, Jammu and Kashmir Police investigators established during a High Court-mandated inquiry that Andrabi was kidnapped from his home by a unit of former terrorists working with the Indian Army. The lawyer had been involved in documenting instances of human rights abuses by the security forces. Days later, his mutilated body was found floating in the Jhelum. The five men alleged to have killed Andrabi also turned up dead days later. From the custodial testimony of Muhammad Ashraf Khan, part of the covert unit working with Major Singh, police learned that the officer had executed Mr. Andrabi. For his part, Singh sought to discredit Mr. Khan's testimony, saying it was implausible that he would have made a murder confession to a man who was not his friend.
Even if Singh will now never be brought to trial, there are questions the Indian government needs to answer about the Andrabi case. Major Ashok ‘Bulbul' Clifton, Singh's superior at the time of the murder, has never been formally questioned. It has also never been explained how Major Singh succeeded in leaving the country, and why the government repeatedly stalled judicial efforts to locate him. These questions, among others, are important not just in and of themselves, but also because of what they mean for the future of Jammu and Kashmir. Last year, former Orissa High Court Chief Justice Bilal Nazki, who had earlier ordered the investigation into Andrabi's death, said the case symbolised “what is wrong with Delhi's approach to Kashmir.” “There is demand for a solution to Kashmir outside the ambit of the Constitution,” Justice Nazki said, “but if the government gives people all the rights enshrined in the Constitution and puts in place effective systems, this place will change.” He is right. For many, this appeal might seem utopian — but making sure the truth about Jalil Andrabi's murder doesn't die with the killings in Selma will be a small step in that direction.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-truth-must-still-be-told/article12899790.ece
12,6,2012,Better system for better results,"After a prolonged struggle with low enrolment rates for children in the school-going age, India now has to come to grips with another crucial issue: poor learning outcomes for students in the six to 14 age group. National data on this is not comprehensive, but available empirical evidence points to weak achievements for a significant percentage of students. In rural India, which is more disadvantaged, the highest level of reading that the largest segment of students in Class Eight were capable of was a Class Two text, according to the Annual Status of Education Report, 2011. In the same student sample, only 56.8 per cent were able to do a simple arithmetic division in Class Eight; others performed badly. Viewed against the backdrop of such low academic attainments, it is understandable that Education Ministers of some States expressed their apprehension at the 59th meeting of the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) that the “no detention” feature of the Right to Education Act could pave the way for a further fall in standards. The solution, however, cannot lie in a system that merely seeks to punish students who could not do better due to intrinsic factors — including bad teachers and lack of infrastructure — by insisting that they repeat a grade. The RTE Act is, in fact, consistent with the National Policy on Education, 1986, which states clearly that “the policy of non-detention in the primary stage will be retained, making evaluation as disaggregated as feasible.” The answer, then, lies not in detention, but in upgrading the system for all.
If students are to do better at school, they must overcome the extreme fear caused by examinations. There is some evidence to show that being labelled a “failure” at school reduces the child's self-esteem and contributes to higher drop-out rates. The RTE Act attempts to ameliorate this by providing for comprehensive and continuous evaluation. It is welcome, therefore, that the CABE has decided to explore the better options and formed a committee chaired by the Haryana Education Minister, Geeta Bhukkal, to come up with an evaluation framework in three months. While that task is pursued, it is incumbent on the Centre and the State governments to get serious about the fundamental goals of the RTE Act. These include provision of all-weather classrooms and sufficient teachers to match the prescribed pupil-teacher ratio by 2013 and training of untrained teachers by 2015. These actions will potentially raise student achievements. Moreover, the objective of education is to produce all-round development of children, besides equipping them with life skills. It would be folly to reduce the process to mere clearing of annual examinations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/better-system-for-better-results/article3516276.ece
13,6,2012,Way out of line,"Team Anna and Team Manmohan continue to be at each other's throats, clearly oblivious to the distaste the spectacle must generate in an already demoralised citizenry. Of the two, the latter ought to take a larger share of the blame if only because ministers are surely restrained from behaving badly by the office they hold. Yet over the past week, senior UPA government ministers have lunged at Team Anna and at Anna Hazare himself with all the finesse of a street bully engaged in a bruising fight to the finish. It was difficult to decide who among Ministers Salman Khurshid, Vayalar Ravi and V. Narayanasami deserved top prize for incivility as they hurled accusations at their civil society opponents. The Minister for Law and Minority Affairs said he was deeply offended by the team's personal attacks on the Prime Minister but was himself not above aiming some broadsides at Kiran Bedi, claiming to have tolerated her thus far only because she was India's first woman police officer. If this was low theatre, Mr. Narayanasamy, who is a Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office and Mr. Ravi, who holds the Cabinet portfolio of Overseas Indian Affairs, stooped further in calling the Anna movement anti-national and insinuating that Mr. Hazare has “foreign backing”. Mr. Hazare's methods can be debated and even criticised but it is shameful for ministers and politicians to question his patriotism.
Some months ago, the PMO had spotted a similar foreign hand behind the anti-nuclear power movement at Kudankulam. This pattern of official paranoia over popular protests is surely ironic considering the government has itself been accused of selling out to foreign interests and must therefore know the pain of being at the receiving end of wild accusations. Not that Team Anna is without its faults. The movement that caught the nation's imagination barely a year ago looks woebegone today thanks to factional fights and a loss of direction. The group set out to give us a robust Lokpal Bill but has since allowed itself to be diverted by other issues. It took the anti-corruption battle into the electoral arena only to make no impact whatever. Crowds have thinned at Anna's protest sites, and the veteran has not helped himself by teaming up with the maverick Baba Ramdev. Anna's on-again, off-again statements against the Prime Minister have added to the confusion and considerably undermined his team's effort to link Dr. Singh to corruption charges in the allocation of coal blocks. Unfortunately, the slanging match between Team Anna and the ministers cannot even provide comic relief to a nation fearing an economic downturn and groaning under misgovernance and runaway prices.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/way-out-of-line/article3520597.ece
13,6,2012,The power of perseverance,"The men's final at Roland Garros provided something sporting contests rarely do — the foreknowledge that, irrespective of the result, history will be made. There was a brief period in this rain-blighted encounter when it seemed that top seeded Novak Djokovic would become the first man in 43 years to win four consecutive Grand Slam championships. But in the end, it was Rafael Nadal who underlined his brooding and belligerent mastery over clay by winning his seventh French Open, surpassing the record set by another genius with a totally contrasting style — the phlegmatic and stolidly calm Björn Borg. That Nadal is the greatest clay court player in the modern era is an opinion that many subscribed to even a few years ago. His victory at the French Open — when his rough-edged, muscular exuberance overcame the all-round skills of the gifted Djokovic — will erase any shadows of residual doubt for those who nursed them. Nadal's record on clay speaks for itself. In Grand Slam and ATP World Tour matches, he has a staggering 254-19 win-loss record, a better ratio than that of Borg (245-39) and other clay court greats such as Ivan Lendl (329-75). Moreover, Nadal has already won 36 clay court titles against Borg's 30 and Lendl's 28.
Nadal's game — founded on heavy topspin and great reserves of strength and patience — is ideal for a surface with a slow and high bounce. Of course, he is so much more than a clay court wonder. His career has been marked by a doggedness that has seen him come to grips with different surfaces. Those who believed his game was unsuited for grass, which plays fast and low, had to eat their words as his gradual improvement on the surface yielded two Wimbledon titles. His performance on hard courts has been pretty impressive as well and his record of having won all four Grand Slams is proof of his all-court ability. With 11 Grand Slams under his belt, Nadal has already shown he is one of the greats of the modern era. His game is built around an astonishing fleetness of foot, an uncanny instinct for anticipation and retrieval, a strenuously unorthodox style that delivers a huge package of power, and the patience and intensity to wear down and dishearten his opponent. For years now, some commentators have claimed that his style of play — marked by over-exertion — is programmed for injury-inflicted breakdown. His somewhat off-colour performance last year was regarded by some as proof of their dire predictions. But the Spaniard has again shown that he cannot be written off lightly. And that you can never underestimate the power of perseverance and resilience.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-power-of-perseverance/article12858081.ece
14,6,2012,First test for new Myanmar,"A long-festering wound in Myanmar has burst and if not attended to swiftly could pose a threat to the nascent process of political reform in that country. Decades of racial and religious animosity between the Buddhist community and Rohingyas in Rakhine, formerly Arakan, on the country's western coast, erupted in serious clashes that left at least 20 people dead over the past week. The trigger for the violence was the gang rape and murder of a Buddhist woman, and it has led to ‘retaliatory' killings and calls among the Rakhine Buddhist community for the expulsion of the Rohingyas from Myanmar. The Rohingya Muslims have for centuries lived in Rakhine, where their number is estimated at 750,000. But Myanmar has denied them citizenship, and treats them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. During the long years of military rule in Myanmar, thousands of Rohingyas fled to Bangladesh fearing persecution. Dhaka does not recognise them as its own either. Indeed, not wanting any “transboundary spillover” from the present round of violence, Bangladesh has turned away hundreds of stateless Rohingyas trying to flee to its shores in boatloads over the weekend. For India, the violence is of particular concern as it is in an area that is key to its plan to build connectivity with Myanmar and the rest of South-East Asia.
The troubles in Rakhine are a challenge to the gradual process of national reconciliation that President Thein Sein has set in motion since 2010. The process has been two-fold: democratic reforms in partnership with Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Myanmar's pro-democracy movement; and, peace-building with the many ethnic insurgencies on the country's borders with India, China and Thailand. In fact, the entire process is really one of delayed nation-building. But it would remain incomplete without the inclusion of the Rohingyas. The danger is that sections of the military that are unconvinced about the need for reforms may use the Rakhine incidents to advocate a roll-back. Rakhine has been placed under emergency laws already. Beyond the restoration of law and order, Myanmar's pro-democracy movement, which has a big stake in the reforms, must take the lead in pushing the demand for addressing the issues that underlie the problems in Rakhine. Ms Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy kept away from the Rohingya cause all these years, perhaps because of concerns that it might not appeal to the majority Buddhist population. But that is no longer an option for a political party that is now seen as playing an important role in shaping a new Myanmar.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/first-test-for-new-myanmar/article3524774.ece
14,6,2012,The rights of the Roma,"The latest survey on the status of the European Union's largest Roma minority should be seen as an occasion for stock-taking on the effectiveness of the racial equality legislation. Conducted by the EU Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) and the United Nations Development Programme, the study points to the need to expand education and employment opportunities to end the vicious cycle of exclusion, discrimination and poverty in this community. Of those covered in the survey, carried out across 11 EU member states, a meagre 15 per cent of adult Roma had attained education up to higher secondary levels compared to over 70 per cent among the non-Roma majority. Similarly, less than 30 per cent were in paid employment and 45 per cent lived in households lacking one or another basic amenity. Of particular concern is the finding that deprivation among the Roma is acute even in EU countries with a higher standard of living. The FRA evidence corroborates a recent Amnesty International report which highlights disturbing findings of discrimination and persecution of Roma communities. The term Roma covers a wide diversity of groups, including Gypsies and others with itinerant lifestyles. The Roma population is in the region of 10-12 million, as per estimates of the Council of Europe. According to historians, between a quarter and half a million were exterminated in the Nazi Holocaust. In the past decade, segregation and violence against the Roma associated with anti-immigration tendencies have been widespread in France, Romania and Bulgaria. In recent years though, Germany has initiated several measures to commemorate its Roma heroes in the cultural and sporting arenas.
In the context of the current economic recession and crippling austerity in the EU, it would be hard to conceive of any real and sustained recovery, or improvements to the continent's long term global competitiveness, in the absence of significant advances in the life prospects of its largest minority. In June 2011, for the first time, EU governments pledged to adopt strategies to integrate the Roma into their respective mainstreams. But the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, has pointed out that member states had yet to deliver concrete action. Relevant in this connection is the tendency nowadays among political parties of the centre-right to appeal to the anti-immigrant constituency both at national and European elections. These parties — and their leaders — are playing with fire and must bear responsibility for creating the sort of xenophobic climate in which hate crimes against the Roma and other minorities occur.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-rights-of-the-Roma/article12858766.ece
15,6,2012,Presidential twist,"In cricket, a googly at best claims a single, unsuspecting victim. In politics, a googly can strike, wound and benumb an entire party, as is evident from the Congress's shocked — and overly delayed — reaction to the audacious shortlist of Presidential candidates presented by Mamata Banerjee and Mulayam Singh. In the event, the Congress' rejection of the regional duo's proposal, nearly 24 hours after it was made, has only reinforced the perception that the party's reflexes have dulled irretrievably and it has no leadership to speak of. It was out of the question that the Congress could choose among the three names so casually proposed by Ms Banerjee and Mr. Singh. Not after the West Bengal Chief Minister had outed the Congress's own preference for Rashtrapati Bhawan — Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee as first choice followed by Vice-President Hamid Ansari. And certainly not after Ms Banerjee and Mr. Singh had dared to include Manmohan Singh in their list of three, the other two being Abdul Kalam and Somnath Chatterjee. Ms Banerjee and Mr. Singh were in fact suggesting that the Congress change its Prime Minister, a proposal the party should have rejected instantly, without a second thought. Indeed, it should have been evident to the Congress that Ms Banerjee and Mr. Singh had dragged Dr. Singh into the presidential contest with the sole intention of unsettling and embarrassing the leadership troika of Ms Gandhi, Dr. Singh and Mr. Mukherjee. As it turned out, the ploy worked and a paralysed Congress showed itself incapable of mustering the strength and clarity required to deal with the situation.
For their part Ms Banerjee and Mr. Singh should think through the long-term consequences of their opportunistic behaviour. Of the three Presidential probables they have suggested, their real choice is Dr. Kalam. But the former President, though not averse to a second term, would expect to be elected unopposed. Ms Banerjee also ought to know that she cannot expect to remain in the UPA after breaking ranks with it on something so serious as the Presidential election. Nor can she be a part of any third alternative in which the Left parties have a role to play. Is she prepared to go to the Lok Sabha polls with her wagons hitched to the BJP? The Congress has paid a heavy price for its smug assumption that its allies would go along with any unilateral decision it made on the Presidential nominee. Not surprisingly, Sharad Pawar too has asked for wider consultations within the UPA. The Congress must act on this advice if it is at all to salvage a situation made difficult by its own hubris and indecision.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/presidential-twist/article3529172.ece
15,6,2012,A retrograde decision,"The dethroning of Archaeopteryx as the basal bird last year has had the much anticipated effect — opportunistic creationists using the findings to further advance their unscientific and absurd views. According to Nature, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology of South Korea recently revealed its decision to “exclude” examples of the avian ancestor and horse from textbooks. The Society for Textbook Revise has been successfully campaigning to delete “errors” from the textbooks on the ground that evolution is an “unconfirmed theory.” If it has its way, even “the evolution of humans” and “the adaptation of finch beaks based on habitat and mode of sustenance” may be removed from textbooks. With this, South Korea joins a few American States where religious sentiments have won over science. The latest developments from Korea have naturally shocked many scientists. Though they fault the government for not involving experts before taking the decision, scientists share equal blame. While the movement to popularise creationism has been going on for years, the scientific community did little to counter it — by engaging the public and explaining the science behind evolution, as well as its limitations. As the latest Gallup survey of over 1,000 adults in the United States shows, education plays a vital role in people rejecting creationist views — those with postgraduate education were most likely to believe in evolution.
Though the fossil record is far from complete, several prized fossils central to the theory of evolution have been unearthed in the past few years. These fossils are either the crucial transitional fossils or those that highlight the stages of evolution. Unfortunately, researchers have failed to emphasise the significance of these discoveries. Most importantly, they have collectively failed in explaining the ways of science. The very fact that the latest research was able to knock down Archaeopteryx from the high pedestal is proof enough that unlike creationism, evolution science is not dogmatic but self-correcting in nature. Still, as the latest Gallup survey of over 1,000 adults in the United States shows, 46 per cent of Americans believe that God created humans in their “present form within the last 10,000 years!” The reason for this is not difficult to find. Not every American has a science background and most fail to understand the complexities of evolution. For them, obscurantist religious views are easy to comprehend. But rejecting evolution on the ground that there is insufficient evidence to support it is nothing but absurdity — religion offers no evidence or proof for its claims whatsoever.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-retrograde-decision/article12860153.ece
16,6,2012,Pranab-da gets his due,"For all its loss of face over allowing the mercurial Mamata Banerjee to seize the initiative on the presidential election, the Congress has finally done the right thing in announcing Pranab Mukherjee as the UPA's choice to succeed Pratibha Patil. Mr. Mukherjee's stature, unequalled experience, easy command of a range of subjects, not to mention his understanding of constitutional history and practice, make him uniquely qualified to enter Rashtrapati Bhawan. The Union Finance Minister has been the clear frontrunner for President, and not simply because the ruling UPA appeared likely to endorse his candidature. Mr. Mukherjee is respected across the political spectrum, confirmation of which came within minutes of his nomination in the form of support from the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party. The Left parties should also come on board judging by their comfort level with Mr. Mukherjee. Besides, there is no other candidate that they can back given their ideological opposition to the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. Though no game is won until it is won, the Congress appears to have sewn up the presidential contest with its biggest breakthrough being the conquest of the SP, which returned to the fold after a brief display of brinkmanship politics in the company of Ms Banerjee.
So, why did the Congress delay the consultation process to a point where Ms Banerjee virtually ran away with the agenda? The West Bengal Chief Minister heaped indignities on the offices of the President and Prime Minister and set an unacceptable ultimatum to the UPA on her choice of candidates. But instead of calling her bluff rightaway, the Congress inexplicably took recourse to silence, allowing all manner of players a free hand to exploit the situation. Yet when the same party finally displayed leadership qualities and summoned a meeting on the presidency, the results were spectacular. The UPA allies lined up behind Mr. Mukherjee, enabling other parties to join in. Ms Banerjee, whose actions almost derailed the UPA leading to speculation about early general elections, was left isolated. The NDA, which had hoped to gain from the fissures in the UPA, turned out to be itself a divided house, with consensus eluding the alliance on both Abdul Kalam and Purno Sangma. The former President will not enter a contest and Mr. Sangma does not even have the support of the Nationalist Congress Party of which he is a member. The lesson on presidency learnt, the Congress must now start consultations for Vice-President, keeping in mind the natural claim and excellent credentials of Hamid Ansari, the current incumbent.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pranabda-gets-his-due/article3533391.ece
16,6,2012,Deccan to Delhi,"By-election results are not always pointers to the outcome of a general election. However, what Andhra Pradesh went through was not a by-election to one seat or two, but a mini-general election to 18 Assembly seats and one Lok Sabha seat. And the verdict was decisive: a sweep for the YSR Congress led by Jaganmohan Reddy, son of former Congress Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy. No matter how the results are read, the YSRC, which won in 15 Assembly constituencies and in the lone Parliamentary constituency, Nellore, will have to be seen as a frontline challenger to the Congress in the State in the 2014 general elections. Indeed, the results could encourage other Congress MLAs to shift allegiance to the Jagan Congress and thereby pose a threat to the very survival of the Kiran Kumar Reddy government. The Congress managed to win just two of the seats, and the Telugu Desam drew a blank. Parkal, the only constituency in the Telangana region that went to the polls, was taken by the Telangana Rashtra Samiti. Unlike the earlier sets of by-elections in the Telangana region, these were not in a geographically contiguous area. The constituencies were spread across 12 districts, some of them Congress strongholds. That the YSRC could perform well beyond YSR's home base in Kadapa district and the Rayalaseema region is surely noteworthy. Of course, a good chunk of the seats — to be specific, eight — are from this region, but the gains in Nellore, Prakasam, Guntur, West Godavari, Visakhapatnam, and Srikakulam districts demonstrate the YSRC's ability to expand its base. Moreover, in Parkal the YSRC finished a creditable second to TRS, an ominous sign for the TDP and the Congress.
Irrespective of the merits of the CBI's case against Jagan, the arrest of the YSRC leader on charges of corruption during the campaign period was, in public perception, a politically-inspired misadventure. To make matters worse, the Congress and the TDP, instead of attacking each other, chose Jagan as the prime target, unwittingly making the YSRC the frontrunner. Further, the Congress suffered the incumbency disadvantage twice over. The non-governance in the State was made worse by the hike in fuel prices and the failure of the Congress-led Centre to rein in inflation. While the YSRC still has some distance to cover before it can entertain visions of coming to power in Andhra Pradesh, the odds are stacked against the Congress. Without some corrective measures, the party will face an uphill task in 2014. Surely, the loss of Andhra Pradesh, a State which today accounts for the largest block of Congress MPs in the Lok Sabha, will have implications that go beyond the Deccan plateau.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/deccan-to-delhi/article3533393.ece
18,6,2012,A law that enables,"The National Advisory Council's suggestions for strengthening the draft law on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities (PWD) is a potentially far-reaching intervention. The step is in sync with the recent notification of a separate Department for Disabilities in the Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, which was announced in the President's 2012 address to Parliament. Ever since India ratified the United Nations Convention on the rights of PWDs in 2007, the formulation of a comprehensive law became imperative and these two developments suggest things are finally moving ahead. Currently, there are four separate pieces of legislation pertaining to India's disabled population. The earliest, the 1987 Mental Health Act, predates the discourse on affirmative action for the disabled in India and, to that extent, the status of mental illness as a disability remains ambiguous. Then, there is a separate law that deals with the creation of qualified and trained personnel for the provision of rehabilitation and education services for this segment of the population. The third, the PWD Act of 1995, is underpinned by an emphasis on anti-discrimination and guarantees of equal opportunities. Although the latter was envisaged as a comprehensive law, it did not address fully the conditions of persons with other equally severe disabling conditions. Hence the 1999 Act for people with autism, cerebral palsy, mental retardation and multiple disabilities.
It is hardly surprising that these four laws in themselves have not mitigated the sense of apathy and bureaucratic red tape that hamper the creation of an enabling environment. The mechanisms and procedures involved are riddled with duplication and inconsistencies, as evidenced by the evolving case law over questions of jurisdiction and interpretation of different laws. More than a billion people around the world experience one or another form of disability, according to the World Health Organisation and World Bank 2011 report. On other estimates, about 10 per cent of the population in developing countries is disabled. By any reckoning, India's numbers would be much larger than what governments are prepared to acknowledge, given the detrimental influences of poverty, illiteracy and poor health on disability. It follows that stepping up investments in health and education is one of the important ways of preventing disabilities and mitigating their impact over the long term. Requiring service providers to furnish a declaration of conformity with the relevant laws is the other means to ensure accountability and effective enforcement. An umbrella legislation will go a long way in altering the present state of affairs.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-law-that-enables/article12555174.ece
18,6,2012,Intriguing games,"From the time Pervez Musharraf suspended him and placed him under house arrest in March 2007, through his first restoration later that year and the second in 2009, to present times, Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary has come to be seen by ordinary Pakistanis as the only hope for their country. Under his leadership, the Supreme Court has been nothing less than activist, calling politicians, government, the military, intelligence services, police, all of them to account. From Pakistan's relations with the U.S. to the country's budget, there is no area of public life that the higher judiciary has spared in the last five years, no national ill that it has not commented on. Some have seen in its actions and pronouncements a grudge against the Pakistan People's Party government, especially against President Asif Ali Zardari. Now and then, the court's actions have given reason for such a conclusion, especially when it overturned the graft cases amnesty granted by General Musharraf that benefited Mr. Zardari. Still, the Chief Justice has defied easy labelling, such as “pro-military”, “pro-Establishment” or “pro-Opposition”. What is more easily apparent, though, is that he enjoys public adulation and affection of the kind previously unheard of in the country.
Not surprising then that when the country's biggest property tycoon claimed he had bribed Mr. Chaudhary's son to win favourable judgments in cases relating to him being heard in the Supreme Court, the allegation came to be seen as part of a political campaign to unseat the Chief Justice. If that is really the case, Mr. Chaudhary has won this battle: he first took suo motu notice of the allegations against his son, then recused himself from the case; the bench hearing the case has now ordered the government to use all available instruments to investigate the allegations and act as appropriate. Most importantly, in the time-frame covered by the allegations, the Court gave no verdicts favourable to the businessman. The controversy is bound to have implications for the turf war that has roiled Pakistan over the last few months. The Supreme Court and the Executive have been locked in a struggle to redefine the limits of their powers. Before the court are petitions against the Speaker's decision not to disqualify the Prime Minister on the grounds of his conviction in the now famous contempt case. The conflict has already sapped the energy of the nation, and diverted virtually all attention from day to day governance, but if it leads to stronger institutions, Pakistan, and its nascent democracy can only benefit.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/intriguing-games/article3540038.ece
19,6,2012,"Well done, Mr. Kalam","Political parties, as is their wont, play political games, whether in a parliamentary or presidential election. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who distinguished himself as one of India’s most popular Presidents during 2002-2007, seems to have been quick to sense the designs of self-serving politicians who were seeking to drag him into another presidential contest. With the ruling United Progressive Alliance announcing Pranab Mukherjee as its candidate, and the opposition National Democratic Alliance divided over forcing a fight, Mr. Kalam would have been staking his personal prestige and international reputation in a presidential bout without standing a realistic chance of winning. Often celebrated as the People’s President during his years in office, Mr. Kalam enjoys the love and affection of countless youth in the country. The octogenarian bachelor is seen as a selfless patriot standing apart from the much-derided political class. In 2002, when he decided to contest, the political circumstances were markedly different: both the major political formations, the NDA and the Congress, were with him, and only the Left parties put up a token fight. Now, with Mr. Mukherjee getting the support of even the Samajwadi Party — whose leader, Mulayam Singh, was instrumental in first proposing Mr. Kalam’s name in 2002 and floating his candidature this time around too — the presidential race is as good as over. The Left parties will decide on their stand on June 21, but no matter what, they would be averse to backing an NDA nominee even if it is Mr. Kalam.
Mr. Kalam would surely have realised he would be placing his own legacy under threat if he were to contest again. As a former President, he is taken seriously wherever he goes. On the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant issue, his views had a bearing on the broader public opinion, even if not on the local populace. If West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and the BJP wanted him as President, it was only to serve their respective political ends. The BJP will do anything to embarrass the Congress, and Ms Banerjee will stop at nothing to stay in the spotlight and project herself as the prime mover of all things. To his credit, Mr. Kalam was able to see through the motives of his supposed backers, and resist the temptation to enter the fray. In 2007, when there was a similar move to make him contest again, he had rightly stepped back as he did not want to involve Rashtrapati Bhavan in any political process. Five years on, Mr. Kalam’s statesmanship, vision and sense of his own legacy remain undiminished.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/well-done-mr-kalam/article3543920.ece
19,6,2012,Rationale for status quo,"Given the economic slowdown, the clamour for a cut in policy interest rates with or without a simultaneous reduction in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) was intense. Consequently, there has been a deep sense of disappointment among market participants at the Reserve Bank of India’s decision to maintain the status quo in its mid-quarter review of credit policy. However, the fear that the RBI has abruptly changed tack and is reversing its stance of softening interest rates seems misplaced. In its annual policy statement of April 17, the RBI announced a larger than expected 0.50 percentage points cut in policy rates but made it amply clear that future rate cuts should not be taken for granted. The moderation in core inflation, a consequence of the slowdown, gave the RBI some elbow room then. Yet inflation has always remained a concern and monetary policy’s traditional task of balancing the often conflicting goals of supporting growth and maintaining price stability is becoming more complex by the day. In just over a month after the annual policy statement, there has been a deterioration in both the global and domestic macroeconomic environment. The eurozone sovereign debt problem has continued to weigh on the global recovery. Of special consequence to India, it has heightened risk aversion leading to a slowing, even withdrawal, of short-term capital flows. That in turn raises serious concerns over managing the large current account deficit.
Moreover, steps towards fiscal consolidation along with various supply side initiatives so critical for inflation management have not made any headway. It is not for the first time that the central bank is holding the government accountable. The real clincher for the RBI has been the realisation that inflation remains a potent problem even at a time of perceptible economic slowdown. Economic activity in 2011-12 moderated sequentially to touch a low of 5.3 per cent in the fourth quarter, though for the whole year it was 6.5 per cent. Deceleration in industrial production from the supply side and weak investment from the demand side have both contributed to the slowdown. The index of industrial production (IIP) increased by just 0.1 per cent in April. All of this ought to have tilted the balance in favour of a rate cut, but the high numbers for overall inflation both at the wholesale and retail levels have clearly weighed with the RBI, which makes the novel point that interest rates are playing a relatively small role in the current slowdown. Consequently, a further reduction in the policy interest rate at this juncture could exacerbate inflationary pressures rather than supporting growth.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rationale-for-status-quo/article3543918.ece
20,6,2012,Not quite a coup,"In strictly legal terms, Yusuf Raza Gilani stood no chance. Back in April, the Supreme Court had convicted the Pakistani Prime Minister of contempt. The government had not complied with a 2009 order asking it to seek the reopening in Switzerland of money laundering cases against President Asif Ali Zardari. The court did not accept the explanation that the government had deferred to the President’s constitutional immunity. Pakistan’s Constitution is clear that conviction leads to disqualification from the National Assembly, but instead of pronouncing on this in its order convicting him, the Court left it to the Speaker to take the decision on this aspect. The Speaker — a fellow stalwart of the Pakistan People’s Party — refused to disqualify the Prime Minister, and just as predictably, his ruling was contested in the Supreme Court. Tuesday’s order disqualifying Mr. Gilani as a legislator “with all consequences”, specifying that this meant he had also ceased to be Prime Minister, was thus not unforeseen. In a situation in which an elected government and a resurgent Supreme Court are both trying to redefine their institutional boundaries, a clash was inevitable. The troubling question, however, is whether this is something more than just democratic jousting over powers between the judiciary and the executive. The single-mindedness with which the Supreme Court has conducted its battles with the government has led to accusations of a “coup by other means”. Also, coming in the wake of a controversy over a property tycoon’s allegations that he paid vast sums to the Chief Justice’s son, the disqualification carries a hint of vengeance.
The PPP has likened the disqualification order to the infamous “judicial murder” of its founder Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, calling attention to how no Prime Minister from the party has been allowed to complete a single term in office. The oblique suggestion is that the Court is acting as a proxy of the military. The crucial difference though is that then, a military dictator had already placed the country under martial law. This time around, the Prime Minister’s disqualification does not affect the government; the party will simply replace him. Indeed, the court has directed the President “to take necessary steps under the Constitution to ensure continuation of the democratic process through [the] parliamentary system of government in the country”. Elections are just a half year away. The government could well decide to hold them early, on the calculation that Mr. Gilani’s ouster will help draw sympathy votes. What is important in the present crisis is that the possibility of a democratic transition to the next government has not been erased.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/not-quite-a-coup/article3547594.ece
20,6,2012,"Long march, backwards","The churning in Nepali politics has entered a new stage with a split in the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda’s ideological mentor and senior leader, Mohan Vaidya ‘Kiran’, has walked away to form a new party. He was supported by four other major leaders, about one-third of the party’s central committee, and a segment of the former Maoist fighters who recently retired from cantonments. Kiran was in an Indian prison in 2005 when the Maoist party decided to engage with democratic parties against the monarchy, work with the Indian establishment and enter open politics. Even though it was precisely the success of this political line — advocated by Prachanda and Baburam Bhattarai — that ensured Kiran’s release, the latter never felt any ownership over the process. The peace agreement was based on a quid pro quo. The Maoists were considered a legitimate force, and their key demands — of elections to a Constituent Assembly and proclamation of a republic — were accepted. In return, the rebels gave up violence and agreed to integrate and rehabilitate the combatants of the ‘People’s Liberation Army’. Kiran and his supporters felt these compromises were tantamount to surrender. They put up impossible demands, pushed the line of ‘people’s revolt’, opposed India, flirted with royalists under the garb of ‘nationalism’, and were ambivalent about a democratic constitution. This gave ammunition to conservative parties and Indian security hardliners who used Kiran’s rhetoric to paint the entire Maoist party as one seeking to ‘capture the state’. The moderate Maoist leadership was squeezed between these extremes.
The split, while unfortunate, brings an end to the artificial unity of the Maoist party and was inevitable given the wide gulf. But in the immediate context, where the Constituent Assembly has expired without delivering a constitution and the country stares at a political-constitutional vacuum, it will complicate politics. Kiran’s party is expected to join the Nepali Congress and Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist) on the streets against the government. The new Maoist party has rejected elections, and kept open the option of resorting to ‘people’s revolt’ or even ‘people’s war’. Its core plank is a mix of ultra nationalism and ideological dogmatism. Its rhetoric and activities can only help the far-right forces and royalists who seek to undermine the gains of the 2005-06 people’s struggle. The need of the hour is a broad political consensus on framing a new constitution. By diverting attention from that crucial goal, Kiran and his ultra-left comrades have weakened the sacred cause of bringing progressive changes in Nepal’s state structure.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/long-march-backwards/article3547595.ece
21,6,2012,Family feuds,"It says something for the Bharatiya Janata Party’s diminishing brand equity that it set out to exploit the schisms in the United Progressive Alliance ahead of the presidential election but ended up showcasing the vulnerabilities of its own alliance. From the party’s perspective, the downturn must seem unreal considering it was the Congress that was thought to have shot itself in the foot with Mamata Banerjee and Mualyam Singh pairing up to do battle on the choice of nominees for Rashtrapati Bhavan. Yet not only did Mr. Singh beat a hasty retreat, the UPA allies swiftly closed ranks behind Pranab Mukherjee, precluding any chance that they could be poached by the Opposition. As it turned out, it was the BJP’s flock that needed watching. The Shiv Sena signed up for Mr. Mukherjee amidst indications that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar could follow suit. A shouting match has since ensued between Mr. Kumar and the sangh parivar over Narendra Modi’s potential emergence as the NDA’s Prime Ministerial candidate. The provocation came from the Gujarat Chief Minister who unfavourably compared Bihar with Gujarat at a public rally in his home State. Now, Mr. Kumar is a celebrity in his own right having finally placed backward Bihar on the growth trajectory. On the other hand, it is Mr. Modi’s shining Gujarat that has lost some of its sheen with recent statistics painting an unflattering picture for the State on the growth front as well as on human development indices.
So it was unsurprising that Mr. Kumar returned volley for volley in his quarrel with the parivar. Besides, the two State leaders have a history of discord that was revealed most famously in the run up to the 2009 general election with the Bihar Chief Minister dramatically declaring his State out of bounds for his Gujarat counterpart. Mr. Kumar may have tied up with the BJP to get the better of bête noire Lalu Prasad but he lives in fear of getting tainted by association. He needs to protect his secular image both in order to keep his Muslim and middle class following and to be able to play a larger role at the Centre. In other words, any accommodation of Mr. Modi spells political ruin for Mr. Kumar. This truth should have been evident to the BJP which has made almost no headway in alliance-building thanks to its inability to shed its sectarian image. Instead, party and parivar have pandered to the Gujarat Chief Minister’s every wish. Whatever the reason for this indulgence, they should know that with Mr. Modi in a leadership role, an expanded NDA — which is a pre-requisite for winning the next general election — will remain a pipedream.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/family-feuds/article3551419.ece
21,6,2012,Greece needs growth,"By returning a verdict for a coalition of mainstream parties in Sunday’s poll, viewed widely as a referendum on Athens’ continuation in the eurozone, the Greeks have shown they have not lost hope in the politics of moderation. In an encouraging show of sagacity this time, traditional rivals — the rightwing New Democracy (ND) and the Pasok socialists — are putting their heads together to provide what everyone hopes will be a stable government. There are already signs that Europe’s leaders are inclined to ease the terms of the Greek bailout. Sunday’s elections, the second in as many months, saw a surge in support for the radical left — a 10 per cent rise in vote share over the May polls. For the first time since Greece’s return to democracy in the 1970s, the far-right has also been catapulted into Parliament. The erosion of the political middle-ground in Greece mirrors what has been happening elsewhere in Europe as the continent grapples with the harshest economic crisis since the Great Depression. While ND was in power in the early years after Athens joined the eurozone and enjoyed a credit boom, it failed to undertake crucial reforms that were needed to check rampant tax evasion and other administrative lapses. Greece made headlines when it came to light that its growth figures were inflated in order to show compliance with European Union stipulations. When the debt crisis gripped Greece in 2010, the incumbent socialists were blamed both for the country’s bloated public sector and for the extremely stringent bailout conditions imposed on Greece by its European and international partners.
Both ND and Pasok had, in the latest elections, campaigned on a platform of broad support for the EU bailout moneys in return for fiscal consolidation and austerity measures. But as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh noted in his speech to the G-20 on Tuesday, austerity is of little help if it chokes growth. The leaders of Greece, and the EU, must accomplish the task of pushing structural reforms while simultaneously taking steps to bring unemployment down from the current high level. In the run up to the recent elections, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund appeared impatient for Athens to speed up long overdue reforms. But the troika would do well to weigh the political cost of ramming through unpopular measures that have driven the country to a state of near paralysis. The last thing Greece, Europe and the world need is the instability of another election. Equally, the perpetual threat of exit of one of the member states is the least desirable scenario for the decade-old eurozone.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/greece-needs-growth/article3551422.ece
22,6,2012,"Tennis, but not with anyone","Faced with a revolt in the ranks, a beleaguered All India Tennis Association (AITA) has come up with a formula that smacks of an-attempt-to-please-all compromise. Two men’s doubles tennis teams will be sent for the Olympics, one of which will comprise Mahesh Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna as they wanted — or more accurately, demanded. While Leander Paes has been paired with a lowly-ranked player, he has been thrown the sop of playing mixed doubles with Sania Mirza in the event she secures a wild card. The decision makes no tennis sense — something that the almost apologetic AITA president Anil Khanna has virtually conceded. If the decision to pair Paes, the country’s top-ranked men’s doubles player with a player ranked ranked 207 is “unfair” as Mr. Khanna admitted, why did AITA make it? Aren’t sporting bodies supposed to take fair decisions in the best interests of the sport rather than buckle under pressure? As for the Paes-Mirza pairing, it is simply illogical given that it was the Bhupathi-Mirza combination that just won the French Open earlier this month.
If AITA has displayed a lack of spine, our tennis players have exhibited a shocking self-centeredness. Even though Mr. Khanna described pairing Bhupathi with Bopanna as “not the best on tennis grounds,” the two have been playing with each other and have reason to believe they make a good team. But by declaring that they will not partner Paes, the two have laid themselves open to the charge that they have put themselves above the nation. In any team sport where players represent the country, the choice of who plays with whom is determined by the appropriate agency (captain, coach, organisation) and not the players themselves. Although playing effective doubles tennis requires a lot of coordination and personal chemistry, in principle the threat held out by Bhupathi and Bopanna is as inexcusable as, say, a member of a relay team declaring he or she will not run with another athlete. Regrettably, after saying he was willing to pair with Bhupathi or Bopanna, Paes joined the chorus of intimidation by threatening to pull out of the Olympics if partnered with a junior player — something he may well do. Nobody has emerged well out of this controversy — not even Sports Minister Ajay Maken who, despite his stated reluctance to interfere with team selection, made it more than clear he was for sending two men’s doubles teams to the Olympics. The controversy, of course, was never about sending one team or two. It was about sending the finest pair to represent the country. In the end, a clash of egos has resulted in the enormous irony of AITA drawing up three teams that it believes are not the best combinations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tennis-but-not-with-anyone/article3555563.ece
22,6,2012,Picking the challenger,"Weaker players often set the pace in longer races. But rarely do the stronger players follow them to the very end. From the moment the Congress chose one of its own, Pranab Mukherjee, as its candidate for the presidential election, the Bharatiya Janata Party was under pressure to enter the race. The BJP was not consulted on the choice of nominee as the Congress clinched a deal with its partners and allies. Putting up a fight must, therefore, have seemed to the BJP more important than winning the presidential race. But far from seizing the initiative, and dictating the selection of a rival candidate, the main opposition party seemed content to let smaller parties pick the challenger. The BJP can be forgiven for wanting to take advantage of the fissures within the UPA on the nomination of Mr. Mukherjee, and for tailing Mamata Banerjee in trying to prop up former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam as a candidate. However, in the process, the party opened up cracks within its own National Democratic Alliance. For very different reasons, the BJP could not count on the support of either the Shiv Sena or the Janata Dal (United). Clearly, the BJP was in no position to win new friends without losing old ones. Dropping all pretence of a party destined to lead, it looked every bit a party doomed meekly to follow others.
In turning to P.A. Sangma, the BJP displayed an insipid pragmatism. True, it made sense to support a candidate who had already won the support of two regional parties, the Biju Janata Dal and the AIADMK, than to name a candidate who could further divide the opposition votes. But in playing a cynical waiting game, and in moving from Mr. Kalam to Mr. Sangma within the space of days, the BJP seemed directionless, praying for a saviour instead of actually presenting a real challenge to Mr. Mukherjee. The party might have seen no point in countering a Congress candidate with a nominee from its own ranks as it did in 2007 by fielding Bhairon Singh Shekhawat against Pratibha Patil. But, surely, the alternative need not have been the adoption of somebody else’s candidate, that too at the eleventh hour. Had the party thrown its weight behind Mr. Sangma — who is certainly a worthy candidate — as soon as Jayalalithaa and Naveen Patnaik had announced their support for him, a real contest might well have been on the cards. Today, the principal Opposition party has become a tail of the regional parties it needs to mobilise if it is to stand a chance of coming to power in 2014. Of course, the BJP’s loss is Mr. Sangma’s gain. He still has no chance of winning, but at least he will have the satisfaction of putting up a reasonable fight.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/picking-the-challenger/article3555564.ece
23,6,2012,Disaster ahoy,"In November 2008, 10 armed men held Mumbai to ransom for three days but on Thursday all it took was a short circuit to paralyse the seat of the Maharashtra government. The fire brigade took 20 minutes to respond to calls and another precious 15 minutes or more to start operations. By then the blaze caught on, aided no doubt by the building’s shoddy electric wiring and huge quantities of paper. There was no water from hydrants or enough pressure in them for a while to get going. The exclusive space nearby reserved for the movement of emergency vehicles was jammed with parked cars and fire tenders could not make their way close to the seven-storied building fast enough. It took 12 hours to bring the flames under control and five people suffocated to death. Post 26/11, the specially created elite Force One and Quick Response Teams were on stand by below while the parapets of the building were filling up with people seeking an escape route.
Nearly four years ago, Mumbai’s residents watched helplessly as the Taj hotel burnt all night and many remembered those scenes as the dense smoke from the secretariat fanned out into the sunset. The hysteria over disaster management reached fever pitch after that terror strike but lost steam soon after. The secretariat has at any point over 5,000 people inside its cramped offices and in 2008 a fire safety audit had pointed out at least 32 risks, which included civil and electrical defects, the parking of cars in the mandatory open spaces around, apart from lack of fire signage, fire lifts or exits. It drew attention to the lack of precautionary measures on the very floors — the 4th, 5th and 6th — which were ravaged by the fire. The State government seems to have ignored these risks. Ironically, the oft refurbished, state-of-the-art disaster management cell is on the fifth floor. After 26/11, there was a scheme to build a bullet proof wall around the secretariat, laughable under the circumstances, and the public works department headed by Minister Chhagan Bhujbal proposed a Rs. 2,000 crore revamp of the whole building which was scrapped due to controversy. On Thursday, senior Ministers and government officials for the first time came face to face with a harsh reality that many Mumbaikars are confronted with after a fire — no water, no access for fire engines and no escape route. That this should happen in the highest office of the State government shows a criminal disregard for the law by the enforcers themselves. Amid talk of a structural audit and anguish over lost files, what has really been burnt to a cinder is the amour propre of a rather vapid State government.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/disaster-ahoy/article3559586.ece
23,6,2012,The road to safety,"Economic growth has set off a wave of motorisation in India, but in the absence of a comprehensive approach to road safety, accidents are killing or maiming a large number of people every year. Data for 2010 presented to Parliament in the last session show that 134,513 people died in road accidents, an increase from 119,860 just two years earlier. The available statistics for accident-related injuries are grossly low and far from complete, due to underreporting. Quite simply, India’s love of vehicles over the past quarter century has been so intense that it has strained the capacity of States and Union Territories to intervene. Governments, on their part, are approaching this serious issue with token gestures, rather than launching systemic reform. It is wholly appropriate, therefore, that the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture in the Rajya Sabha has taken up detailed examination of all aspects of road safety. This exercise, following the panel’s 2008 report on the Motor Vehicles Act, must lead to far-going change. It is vital, because it encompasses legal and institutional frameworks, programmes, public health interventions, compensation and human resource development for road safety.
The task before the Standing Committee is to review the expert recommendations and international best practices that have so far been ignored by governments, and produce a fresh blueprint for change. Five years have passed since the Sundar Committee on road safety and traffic management called for a scientific accident investigation system, and formation of a single empowered board for safety. Sadly, that has remained an elusive goal. Such an agency should ideally be responsible for targets — starting with a reduction in the annual death toll. Policymakers should also look at pointers on safety available from transport research. A study conducted by IIT-Delhi in Bangalore showed that low-floor bus design and automatic doors reduced the risk of death and injury to passengers, since 92 per cent of people who had a fatal fall from a bus were entering or exiting. Such designs must therefore be made mandatory for buses across the country. To aid pedestrians, civic agencies should be compelled to provide usable footpaths of sound technical standards, and regulated crossings, in all cities and towns. Failure to do so should attract stiff penalties. Segregated pathways for cyclists are now internationally acknowledged for their role in safety, and need to be introduced through re-engineering of urban spaces. Overall, road safety has to become a key national mission that invites active stakeholder participation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-road-to-safety/article3559592.ece
25,6,2012,Between a rock and a hard place,"The Egyptian electoral commission has announced that Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party has won the presidential election runoff, beating the independent candidate Ahmed Shafik, the last Prime Minister to the deposed dictator Hosni Mubarak, with 13.2 million votes out of 26 million, a share of 51.2 per cent on a turnout of just over 50 per cent. The result, however, does not settle the standoff between the Brotherhood and the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), which did not even wait for the result before taking a series of steps which some Egyptians have called a constitutional obscenity. One crucial move was made by the constitutional court, made up of judges from the time of Mubarak, which unilaterally dissolved the national parliament. That body, elected between November 2011 and March 2012 in Egypt’s first-ever free polls, was to write a constitution for the new state. SCAF, for its part, has gone even further, awarding itself powers to veto changes in the constitution, to propose legislation, and to detain civilians and deploy the military at times of what it calls internal unrest; it would also retain control over the armed forces and have a veto on declarations of war.
In such a situation, it is far from clear what the newly elected President’s powers are to be, or what powers the military will relinquish, despite SCAF’s respective statements that they will hold their powers until a new parliament is elected and that they still intend to hand over to the new President on June 30. Discussions between the Brotherhood and SCAF have produced no decisive outcome. SCAF’s conduct is certainly ominous. The first implication is that the military fear losing control over major political decisions and the major institutions of state; in addition, their silence over economic issues is very telling in view of the economic dominance they have built up over a very long period. SCAF may not be acting solely on its antipathy to the Brotherhood, but even if it is now talking with the latter with a view to avoiding outright confrontation, what it is revealing is much more dangerous — namely its fear of democracy itself. The Brotherhood, on the other hand, is yet to show how it will reconcile its Islamism with the requirements of representative democracy. For the millions of Egyptians who endured savage repression for decades and then brutal violence when they rose against the erstwhile dictatorship in 2011, the democratic election of a President is a major step forward. But they will have to be on guard against the remnants of the old order, for the durable, broader transition they struggled for is still some distance away.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place/article3566432.ece
25,6,2012,Rio’s unfinished agenda,"At a time when the headline issues are economic growth and financial crises, few countries would willingly commit themselves to new treaties and conventions. Unsurprisingly, therefore, a significant occasion such as the Rio+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development produced no new binding agreements that could ensure the future well-being of the world’s natural capital and its people. Rio’s unfinished agenda is to measure human well-being and sustainability using a good set of tools, rather than a narrow metric such as GDP, and reach a consensus on development. Obviously, any measure that does not fully calculate the cost of present development to future generations is flawed. The Rio+20 conference in Brazil failed to measure up to this task. It was bigger than its predecessor summit, but achieved less. Twenty years ago, the Rio Summit produced Agenda 21 and its major principle of common but differentiated responsibilities for the rich and poor countries in dealing with environmental and development imperatives. That this foundational principle is retained in the Rio+20 outcome document “The future we want” provides some hope that equitable approaches will continue to guide global efforts.
A key theme that dominated Rio+20 is the so-called Green Economy. There is certainly much to be gained by shifting development to a green path. As the outcome document points out, countries could be matched on the basis of national sustainable development priorities and availability of financing and technology transfer. In the absence of a firm agreement, though, such efforts can only be pursued by coalitions of the willing. It is worth pointing out here, that any estimate of the net benefits of a green economy must include the impact of consumption of resources, and environmental pollution. Markets are weak at accounting for negative factors, notably pollution, but efficient at pricing resources that go into production. This has led to an exaggerated emphasis on extraction and consumption. Elsewhere, Rio+20 has made weak references to the human right to water, empowerment of women, the poor, indigenous people, disabled and vulnerable groups, belying expectations of stronger support. What is important is for India and other fast-growing nations to invest heavily in human capital to help such citizens, notably in education and health, and preserve its stock wealth. It must also start producing data on sustainability indicators, such as polluting emissions, nutrient overload in water bodies, health of select natural species, habitat conversion, and fish stocks. That can make development sustainable.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rios-unfinished-agenda/article3566426.ece
26,6,2012,Wells of life – and death,"“Does it take much to prevent such incidents?” the Supreme Court asked in November 2009 while considering the lethal risks posed by abandoned open borewells that had already taken several young lives. Doing some plain-speaking, it directed State governments to ensure that all abandoned borewells and tubewells were capped. Providing practical tips to cover them with wire mesh or lids, the court also wanted functioning wells fenced off. On the basis of this order, the Union government in February 2010 issued guidelines for the maintenance of borewells. All that was evidently in vain, judging from the number of accidents since then, including many in which children died after remaining traumatically trapped in the innards of the earth for days. The latest such heart-rending tragedy occurred in a Haryana village: the body of little Mahi, who fell into a 70-foot-deep borewell on June 20 while playing with her friends on her fourth birthday, was pulled out after some 80 hours of rescue efforts.
Borewells and tubewells are widely used for irrigation in Punjab and Haryana, mostly in rural areas, because of the falling water table. Where these were once narrow holes, they are now typically 18 to 24 inches in diameter. Rural India has become growingly dependent on groundwater. Almost all the government programmes seek to supply water to villages through tubewells. Poor recharge due to geological reasons and environmental degradation (where creeping urbanisation is a key cause) make many of them defunct. The typical short-cut solution is to dig more borewells. Most of them, illegal and unlicensed, are left uncapped once they fall into disuse. On a larger plane, excessive reliance on groundwater for drinking, irrigation and industrial uses in India represents a massive failure of state policy. A review sponsored by the Central Ministry of Water Resources four years ago estimated that 85 per cent of rural, 50 per cent of urban drinking and industrial needs, and 55 per cent of irrigation needs, were met out of groundwater. This points to a virtual withdrawal of the state from the water sector, despite the formation of the Central Ground Water Authority with a mandate to, among other things, interact with State governments and regulate extraction of sub-soil water. Incidents of borewell deaths will stop only when the government takes its goals seriously — of safety as well as better groundwater management — and starts taking measures in mission mode to ensure consistent water supply wherever needed. The best way to start is to team up with local bodies, starting with village panchayats.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/wells-of-life-and-death/article3569975.ece
26,6,2012,A necessary ban,"The recent decision by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to ban the manufacture, sale, distribution and use of serological (blood) test kits for diagnosing active tuberculosis — both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary — is significant. The blood test diagnoses active TB based on antibody response. The decision does not come as a surprise. In fact, the question was not whether the government would act but how soon it would ban it. In July last year, the World Health Organisation had for the first time issued an “explicit negative policy recommendation” against a practice used in TB care. India’s Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme also endorsed WHO’s advice. It is unfortunate that the world health body had to step in to put an end to a test that has become widely available in many developing countries despite not being recommended by any regulatory agency. “A blood test for diagnosing active TB disease is bad practice,” the WHO stated in its July communiqué. The reason it came out strongly against the “diagnostic tool” is that the test produces very unreliable results. According to a 2008 WHO report, none of 19 commercially available rapid serological tests studied “performed well enough to replace [sputum] microscopy.” The organisation found that the tests provide “inconsistent and imprecise” results due to their inferior sensitivity and specificity. Unlike in the case of HIV and other diseases, detecting antibody response in people with active TB is difficult and hence unreliable as many factors can cause the response.
According to an August 2011 paper in PLoS Medicine, the blood test, if used in place of sputum microscopy for a year, will be able to diagnose 14,000 more active TB cases but will end up misdiagnosing more than 121,000 people as suffering from the disease (false positive cases). The antibody test is also prohibitively expensive. Every year in India, about 1.5 million serological tests are done at a cost of $15 million. As a result, a staggering number of people end up being wrongly diagnosed and unnecessarily medicated every year. The direct fallout of unnecessary medication is the increased chances of people developing acquired drug resistance, thus further complicating and compromising TB care. But imposing a ban is just the first step towards rooting out the malaise. Since implementing the ban will be a tall order, there is a need for increasing awareness level among the public. Simultaneously, the government should quickly complete the pilot testing of the WHO recommended Xpert MTB/RIF molecular test and make it widely available. Only the availability of a superior alternative can solve the problem.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-necessary-ban/article3569976.ece
27,6,2012,Falling below expectations,"If our policymakers cannot manage the economy, they should at least learn how to manage expectations. For two days, the UPA government let it be known that a robust package to check the fall of the rupee and improve market sentiment was around the corner. An announcement was scheduled for Monday, Pranab Mukherjee’s last full working day as the Finance Minister. Speaking to reporters on his way back from the G-20 and Rio+20 summits, the Prime Minister also helped talk up sentiments. As far as industry and the markets were concerned, the timing couldn’t have been better. Economic growth has been slowing down, falling to 6.5 per cent in 2011-12. While industrial output continues to be sluggish with a mere 0.1 per cent growth in April, inflation remains elevated. Of specific concern has been the precipitous and psychologically damaging decline in the rupee’s external value. Having lost over 25 per cent in the last one year, it breached the 57 level against the dollar on June 22 and threatened to drop further in the medium-term. To many observers, the rupee’s fall embodies all that has gone wrong with macro-economic management recently. Therefore, it was assumed that any major economic initiative from the government would primarily seek to address concerns over the rupee. More optimistically, it was hoped that the government would announce some reform measures alongside specific rupee-supporting measures.
In the event, it was the absence of any reform measure in the ‘package’ unveiled on Monday that has contributed to the disappointment seen across the board. The stock indices fell back and the rupee once again lost value. The measures announced by the Reserve Bank of India in consultation with the government are by themselves unexceptionable. Companies in the manufacturing and infrastructure sectors with foreign exchange earnings can borrow in dollars to cover rupee loans, up to a ceiling of $10 billion subject to certain conditions. The cap on foreign investment in government bonds has been raised to $20 billion from $15 billion. Sovereign wealth funds and pension funds can invest in government securities. These and a few other measures aim to boost foreign exchange inflows by selectively relaxing existing rules and regulations. However welcome increased dollar supplies are at this juncture, the government’s package reflects a knee-jerk response to the rupee’s decline. In particular, the Finance Ministry and RBI ought to have weighed the consequences of these measures on the country’s already high level of short-term external debt.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/falling-below-expectations/article3573726.ece
27,6,2012,Greening the urban jungle,"Urbanisation took centre-stage at last week’s Rio+20 conference for good reasons. Cities collectively consume 75 per cent of world’s natural resources, generate 50 per cent of waste and emit about 70 per cent of the greenhouse gas. With no slowing down of urbanisation in sight, this consumption is bound to increase. It is now abundantly clear — as UNEP’s recent report on sustainable cities convincingly demonstrates — that unless cities become resource efficient and reduce waste generation, national and global sustainable development would be impossible to achieve. This is a warning bell to Indian policymakers, who have so far focused on the economic growth of cities and ignored their environmental performance. Consuming 40 billion tonnes of raw material every year has its consequences. The first visible challenge is the staggering waste cities produce. Conventional wisdom has been to find more landfill sites. This approach would demand more land over time and cities cannot endlessly appropriate the resources of their region. It would lead to potential conflicts and the loss of productive agricultural land would partly offset the economic benefits provided by the cities. Pursuing standard solutions and treading the beaten path of town planning would not help. Only a radical change in course will create zero-carbon, zero-waste habitats, which is imperative.
It would be impractical to cap the growth of cities. Neither is it the objective of the current debate. The question is how to transform them. Certain cities have taken the lead and shown a way forward. For instance, Copenhagen recycles most of the waste it generates and lets only 3 per cent go to the landfill. Extending the idea of recycling, Kitgum town in Uganda traps used water from houses and utilises it to grow food in greywater gardens. Cities in Malta have opted for a smart bi-directional grid system to regulate their power consumption. There are more inspiring examples. With the Central government dithering on commitments to reduce emission levels and the National Mission on Sustainable Habitats failing to offer anything substantial, Indian cities can no more rely on centrally directed policies and projects. They have to adopt best practices on their own and launch projects with clear green benchmarks. A good beginning would be to promote non-motorised transport. Even in larger cities such as Chennai, the share of bicycle trips, despite poor arrangement, is as high as 12.5 per cent of the total trips. Building dedicated bicycle tracks would significantly reduce transport related emissions. If Indian cities are keen to improve the quality of life and remain economically competitive, they have to leapfrog to become desirable green places to live in.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/greening-the-urban-jungle/article3573728.ece
28,6,2012,It pays to be patient,"For the loved ones of the 164 people who died in the 26/11 attacks, the arrest of Zabiuddin Ansari marks a small step forward in the slow march of justice. Mr. Ansari is alleged by India’s intelligence services to have been one of six men who guided the actions of a control team in Karachi. His arrest in Saudi Arabia will demonstrate to the masterminds of 26/11 that their crime is not forgotten, and that there will be no impunity. India’s intelligence services deserve credit for patiently pursuing Mr. Ansari — but so do its diplomats and national security strategists. India’s hunt for the perpetrators of 26/11 has met with more success than any past transnational terrorism investigation because of adroit use of the country’s geostrategic influence. New Delhi has succeeded in pushing the United States to take its counter-terrorism concerns seriously, hammering home the issue’s centrality to the relationship. Riyadh’s increasing cooperation with Indian counter-terrorism interests is also driven by its appreciation of the realities of a changing world. India, with China, will be among the kingdom’s principal energy markets in coming decades. More important, Saudi diplomats wish to wean India away from its long-standing relationship with their key regional adversary, Iran. There is one place, though, which remains shut off from the evolving international consensus on terrorism — and that is Pakistan, where 26/11’s key architects live.
There are three things India ought to do to deal with this situation. First, its high officials must resist the temptation to engage in the kinds of media-driven verbal India-Pakistan mud-wrestling that has periodically broken out over the 26/11 case. It has long been clear that powerful figures in Pakistan’s intelligence services had at least something to do with the attacks; it is unlikely that the country’s most powerful institution will collaborate in its own prosecution. It is not without reason, after all, that the men who harboured Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad are yet to be identified. Secondly, India must conduct the prosecution of Mr. Ansari as transparently as possible. Ill-advised Mumbai police investigators attempted to frame Indian nationals Sabahuddin Ahmad and Fahim Arshad Ansari for a role in the 26/11 attacks, disgracing themselves in the process. Finally, in years to come, with the influence of jihadist groups in Pakistan waxing, there will be new threats to India. New Delhi must anticipate and counter these threats using all tools at its disposal, from enhancing its counter-terrorism capabilities to doing what it can to strengthen the hands of democratic forces across the border.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/it-pays-to-be-patient/article3577554.ece
28,6,2012,Welcome assertiveness,"The true significance of the Competition Commission of India (CCI)’s recent order penalising 11 major cement companies for violating competition law is to be seen not just in the quantum of penalty, even though at more than Rs.6300 crore it is by far the largest such penalty and one that is sure to dent the profitability of the companies for years to come. By demonstrating its assertiveness in this path breaking order, the CCI hopes firmly to delineate the contours of competition law, which is relatively new to this country. Setting valuable precedents and accumulating case law are important, essential tasks before any regulator. The Competition Act (2002), amended in 2007, prohibits anti-competition agreements and the abuse of dominant position by enterprises, and regulates mergers and acquisitions as well as other forms of combinations in the corporate sector that have, or can have, an adverse impact on competition in India. The CCI has accused the major cement companies of adopting collusive practices, akin to forming cartels to prop up prices. While imposing a stiff penalty, the Commission says it has considered “the parallel and coordinated behaviour of cement companies on price, dispatch and supplies in the market.” Further, that even when capacity was available they did not increase supply to meet the rising demand. Apart from the fine, the companies were told to “cease and desist” from indulging in any anti-competition activity.
The cement companies are sure to go on appeal but even in these early days it is clear that they will cite the lack of direct evidence pointing to collusion. Their supporting arguments are likely to be equally familiar: that input costs covering raw materials, freight fuel and power have been going up across the country. Besides, the industry is very large and forming cartels when there are so many players is neither easy nor sustainable. All of these arguments can be rebutted but it is for the courts to pronounce a final verdict. The order against cement companies is the fourth major order by the CCI. Earlier, two entities, the real estate major DLF and the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. (NSE) were found to have abused their dominant position and slapped with hefty fines. In the third case, three suppliers of aluminum phosphide, used in storing cereals, were fined Rs.318 crore for colluding with one another in a practice very similar to that of the cement firms. Although located in different parts of the country and having varying cost structures, these firms charged their major buyer, the Food Corporation of India, a uniformly high rate. The battle for an effective competition law has begun in earnest. The CCI’s assertiveness is a welcome sign.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/welcome-assertiveness/article3577555.ece
29,6,2012,What’s in a name? A life,"No excuses, no nitpicking. The entire media got the ‘Sarabjit to be released’ story wrong — including The Hindu, in its early editions before we stopped press at midnight to make the correction. If anything, the Sarabjit/Surjeet Singh mix-up has held a mirror to the beast that the media has become: easily excitable, know-it-all and supremely confident to the extent of being tone deaf even when Pakistan’s Presidential spokesman Farhatullah Babar was clearly saying on Indian television channels — and by extension to the tuned-in print media — that “Surjeet Singh” was entitled to be released. The media stands exposed but still does not have the grace to admit it was wrong, let alone introspect or apologise for giving false hope to the family of a condemned man. Worse, a section of the media has topped it all up with theories galore on why Islamabad made the “midnight switch”. Ironically, because of the nature of the story and how it unfolded, Sarabjit’s family at least got to air its disappointment. But what of all those mistakes that are being made by the media in the rush to be first with the news? The insensitive line of questioning to bring out raw emotion on camera, the crowding around rescue operations for a “quote”, or ruining investigations by breezing into crime scenes? In this particular case, there is the fig leaf of an excuse in the two names sounding similar but the media was clearly not listening and kept repeating ‘Sarabjit’ so often that on at least one TV show, Mr. Babar himself got confused and used that name for the man he had referred to only seconds earlier as ‘Surjeet.’
In the India-Pakistan context, the role of the media on both sides has been particularly dubious; leading the pack in baying for blood at the smallest of irritants even while talking Track-II, overly obsessing with certain issues, and allowing emotions and rhetoric to determine the narrative instead of informed discourse. To be fair to both governments, the Foreign Offices in recent months have been restrained in the face of provocation from the media. If Islamabad was at pains to explain to the local media that granting ‘Most Favoured Nation’ status to India was not equivalent to making it Pakistan’s ‘Most Favourite Nation’, officials of the Ministry of External Affairs sought to drive home the fact that both Kashmir and the Mumbai terror attacks got equal play in the last round of Foreign Secretary-level talks. Both governments have been trying to create space for each other to navigate the slippery route to peaceful co-existence and cooperation, made all the more treacherous by the media which has allowed shrill voices to flourish to the detriment of sane and studied opinion. Mercifully, the media-created fiasco that made the Pakistan government — already under siege for other reasons — look bad did not stall Surjeet Singh’s release. His return should now set the stage for the repatriation of all Indian and Pakistani prisoners who remain incarcerated across the border despite completing their sentences.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/whats-in-a-name-a-life/article3581721.ece
29,6,2012,Responsibility to protect,"The International Labour Organisation has adopted a new global standard on the creation of a social security floor aimed at stimulating aggregate demand and fostering social cohesion. The moral and pragmatic appeal of these measures, as opposed to the dominant approach underpinned by austerity, should be apparent to all governments anxious to avert another global economic crisis. Social protection measures have expanded in most of the 77 countries surveyed by the ILO and World Bank on policy responses to the global financial and economic crisis. Among these are major middle-income countries from the developing world, providing important lessons on responding to unforeseen consequences from the boom and bust economic cycles and volatile financial markets. Some of these states are said to have put in place effective arrangements with a modest investment of one to two per cent of their GDP. However, only 20 per cent of the world’s population has adequate social security cover and 50 per cent lack any protection at all, according to the ILO’s 2010-11 World Social Security Report. The ILO’s new Recommendation on Social Protection Floor sets nationally defined guarantees aimed at universal access to essential health care and minimum income security; especially during old-age, unemployment, work-place injury, invalidity and maternity. Such guarantees are a human right and an ethical imperative of governments.
ILO Director-General Juan Somavia has rightly emphasised that social protection measures have the potential to generate demand in the economy, combat poverty, empower the vulnerable and ensure just, inclusive growth. Paradoxically though, European countries which have a long and enviable tradition of social protection have today emerged as unrelenting advocates of economic austerity. It is about time they effected a swift and effective course correction from a dogmatic emphasis on fiscal consolidation. Countries around the world are also committed to realising the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Of these, those pertaining to basic health, removing illiteracy, maternal and infant mortality are the more critical human development indicators. Socially inclusive policies have a direct bearing upon the extent to which governments can realise these objectives. Therefore, the underlying importance of social protection in all of this can hardly be overstated.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/responsibility-to-protect/article3581722.ece
30,6,2012,‘Obamacare’ wins,"The endorsement by the United States Supreme Court of a key provision in President Barack Obama’s health reform law requiring most individuals to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty, is a progressive decision. As all provisions in the law go into effect, it is bound to strengthen the call for a non-profit universal health care system in America. That the majority verdict delivered by the Chief Justice and four liberal judges chose to lean to the left in a cliffhanger case is a watershed moment in U.S. constitutional history. To those who have campaigned for tax-based health coverage for all, the new law may still fall short, but what it does provide is health protection to millions of uninsured Americans through more affordable insurance choices. It also prevents insurers from refusing to cover people with pre-existing conditions. In spite of such progressive features, the law is not universal in its coverage, exempting prisoners, undocumented aliens, and some poor families. Four years ago, the agenda for the U.S. presidential election virtually centred around health reform, and the Obama presidency has weathered the fierce backlash from Tea Party and Republican conservatives. The legal denouement has now vindicated the President as he pursues a re-election bid, and sustained much of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.
For sheer scale, President Obama’s health reform evokes comparisons with Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal. Despite Thursday’s ruling, though, it faces challenges. These arise from the court’s rejection of a portion of the law that requires States to use more federal funds to protect the health of less affluent citizens through the Medicaid programme. Importantly, the principle on which the health reform law has survived is the power of the government to levy a tax (in this case, on those who are eligible but do not take out health insurance). The Affordable Care Act also stipulates the percentage of funds that insurance companies must spend on actual care, thus capping administrative costs. These aspects are of particular interest to India, which has a fast-growing profit-seeking health and insurance industry, and is simultaneously trying to formulate a tax-funded universal health coverage plan over the next five years. A Planning Commission panel here has submitted its report calling for regulatory structures to standardise health care, with a contracted-in role for the private sector. Unlike the U.S., and in spite of the impoverishing levels of out-of-pocket payments for healthcare incurred by citizens, health reform has not become a central issue in Indian politics. As Americans celebrate their constitutional victory, it is a moment for India to think of its own universal health system.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/obamacare-wins/article3585651.ece
30,6,2012,Time to talk,"It has been over 50 days since a section of Air India’s pilots reported “sick” and launched an agitation, basically on issues related to career advancement. Under Ajit Singh, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has taken a tough stand and — for the first time — refused to buckle: call off the agitation, report for work, and we can talk. The last time Air India pilots went on strike — they had not been paid for four to six months and were demanding their salary — there was considerable public sympathy and the government had to come up with a schedule for payment of arrears. But this time, the protests began over what was really a personal plaint: that pilots from the erstwhile Indian Airlines were being asked to train for the new fleet of 787s rather than those from the original ‘Mahararaja.’ Of course, the striking pilots clubbed this issue with the other problems the merger of the two airlines has generated and how nothing had been done over the past five years to resolve them. Even so, Mr. Singh was able to take the high moral ground and insist the pilots call off their protest first before talks are held.
With the passage of time, the protesting pilots have mellowed. They are now insisting on two basic demands — that the hundred-odd sacked pilots be taken back, and that their Guild, which was derecognised, be recognised again. These are not difficult demands to meet, though the Minister has every right to insist on talks without any preconditions. It is perhaps time for both sides to put the future of Air India first and find the space for a compromise. In the first round of talks, an agreement on these two demands can be reached, and then the serious issues can be taken up for negotiations. If the government and Civil Aviation Ministry are not prepared to do that, this can only mean they have decided the national airline is beyond redemption. No private or commercial airline would have allowed a strike called over such flimsy grounds to drag on for two months and cripple an already sick company. The end point of any fresh negotiations should be a professional management and an airline that operates on largely commercial considerations, with no political interference. This means the airline should not be run in such a way that it keeps coming back to the government for a bailout. A fresh Rs. 30,000 crore package over a nine-year period has already been worked out and needs to be implemented. But for that to happen, the strike which has badly affected India’s international operations must end immediately.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/time-to-talk/article3585648.ece
2,7,2012,Reading the rains,"This year, not only did the monsoon reach India a few days late but its progress thereafter has been alarmingly lackadaisical. While Assam has been deluged and is reeling from the resulting floods, over 85 per cent of the country is suffering from far too little rain. The result is that the nationwide rainfall deficit stood at a grim 29 per cent at the end of June. Rainfall data for the past 140 years shows that even with a June deficit of that magnitude or greater, there is still a 60 per cent chance of the monsoon turning into a ‘normal’ one where nationwide rainfall for the season falls between 90 per cent and 110 per cent of the long-period average. The government, which has been pinning its hopes on a good monsoon to help propel economic growth, will undoubtedly be hoping for such an outcome. Even if the monsoon does turn out to be ‘normal,’ it is likely the rains will be at the lower end of that range. The probabilistic forecast in the India Meteorological Department’s updated monsoon prediction issued in late June has indicated that this is just what could happen. The forecast divides the traditional ‘normal’ range into three — ‘below normal’ (90 per cent to 96 per cent), ‘normal’ (96 per cent to 104 per cent) and ‘above normal’ (104 per cent to 110 per cent). The current monsoon has, according to the IMD, a 35 per cent chance of becoming ‘below normal,’ which is twice the climatological probability based on the outcome in past years.
After its poor showing in June, it is important that the monsoon revives quickly. Good rains in both July and August are essential for a ‘normal’ monsoon that is needed to sustain the kharif crop. July will be particularly important for agriculture. As it is, the sowing of rice, coarse cereals, pulses and oilseeds have been hit. Much could depend on what happens in the Pacific Ocean. The temperature at the surface of its central and eastern tropical waters has risen. The worry is that the temperature rise might continue and result in an El Niño, which could adversely affect the monsoon. According to the IMD statistics, there have been 36 El Niño years since 1875. Of these, the nationwide monsoon rainfall was between 90 per cent and 100 per cent of the long-period average in 14 years and above 100 per cent in six years, including in 1997 that saw one of the strongest El Niños of the last century. But there were ‘deficient’ monsoons, with nationwide rainfall falling below 90 per cent, in 16 El Niño years. One hopes that if an El Niño does develop this year, it will be the benign variety. The government would, however, do well to plan ahead and get prepared to meet any contingency.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/reading-the-rains/article3591888.ece
2,7,2012,Ill blow the trade winds,"India’s external economy, for long considered to be the one bright spot in the entire macro economy, has been repeatedly coming under stress recently. While still not a cause for alarm, the latest balance of payments (BoP) data released by the Reserve Bank of India on Friday is deeply disquieting. The current account deficit (CAD) — the sum of the balance of trade and “invisibles” including earnings from software exports and workers’ remittances — has risen to the highest ever level of 4.5 per cent of GDP, or $21.7 billion, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011-12. This is sharply higher than the 1.3 per cent recorded over the same period in the previous year. That in turn has pushed up the CAD for the whole year to $78.2 billion, or 4.2 per cent of GDP, which is again a record. Any hope of containing the CAD to within reasonable levels depends on global commodity prices as well as economic activity in India. Although falling petroleum prices have afforded a measure of relief, the depreciating rupee has neutralised some of the gains. The economic slowdown, though an undesirable feature from the growth perspective, can also moderate the CAD by limiting the import bill relating to capital and intermediate goods.
The falling rupee can discourage imports and, over the medium term, at least, boost export competitiveness, consequently shrinking the CAD. That has not happened so far because some imports, notably petroleum, are inelastic. Also, exporters have not derived the full benefit of the rupee depreciation mainly because of lower demand from the principal markets of the European Union and the U.S. Obviously, for policy makers, the real challenge is to fund the CAD on a sustainable basis. In sharp focus is the fact that the widest ever CAD has kept India’s BoP in negative territory for the second quarter in a row, forcing the RBI to dip into its foreign exchange reserves. Once again, the BoP data highlights the huge risks in depending on volatile portfolio capital flows. A related development contributing to the economy’s vulnerability is the high level of external debt, especially of the short-term variety. Key vulnerability indicators like the debt-GDP ratio and debt-service ratio deteriorated during last year. However, despite being aware of the serious pitfalls, the government and the RBI have shown a penchant for short-termism. Recent relaxation of rules relating to external commercial borrowings and greater incentives for non-resident Indians and foreigners to invest in government paper can all be justified only on the ground of expediency. Such steps go against the grain of prudent policies that have stood the economy in good stead, until recently.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ill-blow-the-trade-winds/article3591889.ece
3,7,2012,Saving the western jewels,"The inclusion of the Western Ghats in the World Heritage List by UNESCO is a fitting tribute to one of the most fragile and ecologically sensitive areas of the world. These montane forests and their rich biological diversity were included in the very first list of ‘global biodiversity hotspots’ drawn up by scientists at the turn of the century. Today, the Ghats are considered one of eight “hottest hotspots”. With their official listing as natural heritage, India commits itself under the UNESCO Convention to conserve, protect and transmit the 39 chosen sites spread across nearly 8,000 square kilometres to future generations. The challenge to protect the Western Ghats, however, is much bigger because the area of these mountains assessed by the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel encompasses a total of 129,037 sq km. This is a vast swathe of ecologically unique habitat, which significantly influences the Indian monsoon. The WGEEP has, in its report, treated the entire region as an ecologically sensitive zone, while recommending that some sub-regions be treated as more sensitive and given higher levels of protection.
India is required by virtue of its participation in the UNESCO Convention to let the listed natural heritage sites “function in the life of the community” and promote scientific and technical studies to counteract harm. The national record on both these counts has been uninspiring and often negative. On the one hand, the Centre has been unable to foster an effective people-driven conservation paradigm using the Forest Rights Act, while on the other, it has been consistently hostile to independent scientific research in protected areas. The new global recognition accorded to some parts of the Western Ghats should help change that, and secure international assistance for conservation. What comes as a source of worry is the approach of some State governments to the larger question of nature protection. Karnataka wanted 10 sites withdrawn from the list submitted to UNESCO, presumably because it wanted to avoid greater scrutiny of incompatible activities such as mining. Kerala, which is keen to have a hydroelectric project at Athirapilly in the forests, has also reacted negatively to the idea of conservation. These trends do not bode well for natural heritage protection. It is beyond argument that the Western Ghats in their entirety represent irreplaceable natural capital, and any people-friendly policy should spare them damaging, extractive pressures that can only aid short-term commerce. Moreover, it should be less problematic now to compensate any financial loss resulting from protection, as India can seek international assistance for a World Heritage site.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/saving-the-western-jewels/article3595327.ece
3,7,2012,Viva La Roja!,"If Spain’s status as the greatest football side of this generation was ever in any doubt, its emphatic Euro 2012 triumph should settle the matter once and for all. Vicente del Bosque’s outfit put on a compelling exhibition of belligerence in Kiev to conquer the continent again, silencing critics and destroying a spent Italian team. No other country has defended the European championships or won three major international tournaments on the trot; it can safely be assumed that these feats will not be matched in the foreseeable future. But beyond the results and the mountain of statistical firsts, it is del Bosque and Spain’s unflinching commitment to their style of play — the tiki-taka, a game built on absolute control of the ball and demanding fiendish levels of skill — that deserves to be lauded. It has prompted accusations — born mostly out of resentment – of Spain being boring, but if games have seemed dull, it is simply because opponents have been unable to win the ball back. No praise is too high for the masterful midfielders Xavi Hernández and Andres Iniesta, who have been pillars of their Barcelona side for a while now. They were exemplary on Sunday night for their nation, playing a direct hand in three of the four goals.
For Italy, there is no humiliation in defeat. This team has demolished clichés by playing fine attacking football, and undoubtedly deserved to be in the final. Were it not for the quality of the opposition, another journey that began with scandal in the backdrop could have ended in a trophy. Coach Cesare Prandelli must take a lot of the credit for the turnaround. He picked the side up from the depths of the 2010 World Cup campaign and set out to “make people fall in love with the Azzurri again”. He will take pride in the outcome. Euro 2012 will be remembered as one of the better international competitions of recent times, and with more thrilling encounters in the knock-out rounds could have gone down as one of the great ones. There were numerous standout individual performances, while the group stages made for thoroughly entertaining viewing. Hosts Ukraine and Poland can pat themselves on a job well done for the most part. There was the ugly fracas involving Polish and Russian fans, and alleged racist behaviour from supporters that saw the Spanish, Russian, Croatian and German national football associations fined. But reports on locals and their hospitality have largely been glowing. In the aftermath of the tournament, the Spanish position in the pantheon of the best teams ever will be debated. Wherever they may rank del Bosque’s charges, it won’t be very far from the top.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/viva-la-roja/article3595328.ece
4,7,2012,Theatre of the absurd,"In ordering the deletion of certain cartoons and words from a number of social and political science school textbooks, the committee constituted by the National Council for Educational Research and Training appears to have followed the line of least resistance. First the two cartoons that have generated political controversies were promptly sent to the trash tray; and then, many, many more. With a mandate to review the textbooks and identify educationally inappropriate material, the panel headed by S.K. Thorat was expected to take a detailed look at all visual material with the help of subject experts. But the number of cartoons erased and the flimsy and even bizarre reasons given mark the whole exercise as politically coloured from beginning to end. Many of the changes seem to have been recommended with the interest of the political and bureaucratic classes in mind, and not on pedagogic grounds. Some cartoons are to be removed because they convey a “negative message” about politicians and bureaucrats, others because they are politically “sensitive”. A few cartoons were seen as too “ambiguous.” Surely, these cannot be grounds for exclusion while preparing instruction material to develop critical thinking among students in Classes XI and XII. Indeed, going by the suggested deletions, the “politically sensitive” argument looks tailor-made to ensure the removal of cartoons seen as causing offence to the Nehru-Gandhi family.
As the dissenting member of the committee M.S.S. Pandian sagely notes, what is perceived as “politically incorrect” need not be “educationally inappropriate” for students being initiated into critical thinking. The National Curriculum Framework from which the current textbooks sprang broke new ground precisely because they sought to encourage young learners to ask questions for which there may not be a single correct answer. True, the authors of the textbook may have gone overboard here and there; a sensible, nuanced review could have easily set things right. But the deletions now being ordered defy all reason and commonsense. For example, an American cartoon in which the Republican and Democratic parties are shown as an elephant and donkey is to be dropped because “politicians and institutions are represented as animals.” This despite the fact that the two animals are party mascots! Agreed, there is nothing sacrosanct about the textbooks and the cartoons they carry. Other cartoons and other textbooks could have served the pedagogic purpose just as well. But inclusion and exclusion of material in textbooks cannot be carried out, as the Thorat committee has done, keeping in mind narrowly defined political sensitivities and imaginary community sensibilities. It will be a matter of national shame if its recommended deletions are accepted by the NCERT.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/theatre-of-the-absurd/article3599210.ece
4,7,2012,Return of the old guard,"Enrique Peña Nieto’s win in Mexico’s presidential polls marks the return of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which enjoyed seven decades of power until 2000. Breaking the stranglehold of the drug mafia and crime syndicates which are said to have claimed as many as 60,000 lives in recent years would be among the most formidable challenges facing Mr. Peña Nieto, who will take charge only in December. In a hotly debated campaign, the outgoing conservative party, PAN, was not in the reckoning, largely due to President Felipe Calderón’s track record on tackling crime and his failure to enact economic, energy and education reforms. On the other hand, second-time contestant Andrés Manuel López Obrador of the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution merely managed to narrow the lead Mr. Peña Nieto enjoyed earlier in the opinion polls. The campaign acquired immense momentum over the past few months also on account of the surge in popularity of the pro-democracy student-led Yo Soy 132 movement. The PRI’s controversial nexus with a prominent media group lent the poll process additional sting. The pervasive resort to violence and intimidation during previous polls led Mexico’s election authority this time to seek a commitment from political parties to honour the popular verdict and to denounce violence during the electoral process.
Despite the return of the ‘old guard’ that the PRI represents, multi-party democracy in Mexico is here to stay. Presented as the PRI’s new face during the election campaign, Mr. Peña Nieto, governor of the State of Mexico until last year, knows only too well the reasons his country has been punching below its economic weight in the region. The introduction of growth inducing measures might well be the answer to the gross inequalities which are a fact of life in the country. The incoming President would draw much comfort and courage from the fact that his country weathered the aftermath of the 2008 global financial and economic crisis better than its mighty northern neighbour, the United States, even as it was battling the H1N1 flu pandemic. Mr. Peña Nieto’s ultimate triumph, however, would be winning the war on drugs that his predecessor never really waged. But this will require greater cooperation and sensitivity on the part of the U.S., where the lack of control on deadly assault weapons, not to speak of the demand for drugs, fuels the violence that has exacted such a heavy toll on ordinary Mexicans from all walks of life.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/return-of-the-old-guard/article3599212.ece
5,7,2012,Restore Pinki’s dignity,"For the past week, Pinki Pramanik — award-winning athlete, citizen and, most important, human being — has been reduced to an exhibit in a media-driven circus. Her treatment disgraces us all. Ms Pramanik, an Asian and Commonwealth Games medal-winning athlete, was earlier this month charged with rape by her partner, who claims Ms Pramanik has male sexual organs, and also that she reneged on a promise to marry. Like all women who file a complaint of rape, Ms Pramanik’s partner deserves a serious and sensitive police investigation of her allegations. It takes no great imagination, though, to see that what is happening is a particularly distasteful farce. Ms Pramanik has been subjected to multiple medical examinations, often with a voyeuristic media present to record her journey to and from prison; a surreptitiously made video recording of one of those tests was even put online, and promptly went viral. Thus, Ms Pramanik has been put on public trial not for her alleged crime, but her intersex condition. Prurience runs through this story: no one, after all, posts MMS clips of the medical examinations of the tens of thousands of men arrested each year on rape charges; nor is their anatomy a subject of discussion.
Ms Pramanik’s treatment tells us something profoundly disturbing about the society we inhabit. Ensuring dignity for the sexuality of citizens is one of the keystones of a democratic polity. Human sexuality is a powerful yet private sphere for citizens to exercise freedoms, which is why political and religious despots have often sought to regulate and punish perceived deviance. The assault on Ms Pramanik’s dignity comes at a time when political reactionaries and religious bigots are increasingly colluding to police our private lives. The hounding of Ms Pramanik also reinforces the stigmatisation of the millions of intersex people in this country. Late in the last century, research established that diverse forms of sexual physicality are not diseases to be treated. Nature is less doctrinaire in its approach to gender than our minds — a fact Hindu tradition, among others, has long acknowledged. Even though modern surgery has made it possible to stamp out what society considers to be aberrations, there is an ongoing debate on precisely when such intervention is appropriate. Ms Pramanik might or might not be guilty of the crime she is accused of, but her dignity must be restored — starting now. The individuals who made the video, the medical personnel who allowed it to be taken, and the police officers on whose watch this crime occurred, must be punished. For full justice to be done, though, we must search inwards, within our culture that engendered an audience for this sordid spectacle.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/restore-pinkis-dignity/article3602997.ece
5,7,2012,Pledging the gift of life,"India has a huge burden of diabetes, hypertension, and other serious morbid conditions that often lead to organ failure. The medical evidence makes it clear that the majority of patients diagnosed with end-stage organ disease cannot survive for long, if replacement therapies or organs for transplant are not available. Among renal failure patients, the survival rate beyond a few months of diagnosis is estimated to be less than ten per cent. What stands out in this bleak picture is the life-saving act of altruistic donation of organs by the families of brain dead people. These organs harvested mostly from road traffic accident victims are given as a gift of life, with no expectation of any form of compensation. Tamil Nadu, with a donation rate of close to 1.3 per million population, is arguably the leader in deceased-donor organ transplantation. It has provided 759 major organs over the last four years, after the State government threw its weight behind a campaign by doctor-activists. Of course, official support followed in the wake of rampant illegal organ trade. Now, Karnataka is taking the welcome step of marking an organ donation pledge on driving licences in a pilot scheme, if the applicant chooses to do so. If an unfortunate accident were to render the bearer of such a licence brain dead, his family could choose to donate his organs.
As a country with over 130,000 fatalities in road accidents annually, such pledges could potentially raise the number of organs available, but only if governments get more involved. Also, major changes must be made to the medical infrastructure. In Tamil Nadu, for example, although 53 hospitals are licensed to conduct kidney transplants, only a minority is able to participate effectively. That is because they lack tertiary care infrastructure to handle trauma, which is vital to maintain brain dead patients. Yet, even with a long way to go, Tamil Nadu has been able to contribute organs and exceed the national donation rate of 0.08 per million population per year thanks in part to civil society initiatives, such as the Multi Organ Harvesting Aid Network (MOHAN) Foundation. Stronger hospital infrastructure, counselling staff, and adequate training to confirm and certify brain death are, therefore, vital to raise the availability of organs. In the long run, it is necessary to reduce diabetes and hypertension incidence at the population level, and improve road safety to prevent brain deaths; fewer organs would be needed with better disease management. The success of the deceased donor programme would ultimately depend on all district hospitals in the country becoming fully equipped to conduct transplants.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pledging-the-gift-of-life/article3602998.ece
6,7,2012,Small is beautiful,"The discovery of a new particle at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which in all likelihood is the Higgs boson — the particle desperately sought after by physicists for decades — may not change our lives but it is important for our understanding of the sub-atomic world that determines the universe at large. The Higgs is the crucial missing link in a theory of the known fundamental particles and forces of nature (save gravity) called the Standard Model. While the theory gives a unified description of the disparate forces of nature, the underlying mathematics requires all particles to be massless, which is certainly not the universe we live in. In the early 1960s, Peter Higgs, among others, hypothesised the existence of an energy-field and an associated particle — the Higgs field and the Higgs boson respectively — which enabled the particles to acquire mass without destroying the unification of forces in a single mathematical framework. The theory has withstood all high precision tests that have been done to verify its correctness but the Higgs particle itself has eluded detection since the 1990s when high-energy accelerators began their focused search for it. The Large Electron-Positron collider at CERN had ruled out the existence of Higgs below a mass of 115 GeV before it shut down in 2000 to make way for the higher energy LHC. The search was picked up by the Tevatron at Fermilab in the U.S. Just two days before CERN’s landmark announcement, Fermilab scientists announced that if the Higgs particle exists, it has a mass between 115 and 135 GeV, a result that provides an independent validation of LHC’s results.
The LHC began its operations in March 2010 and by December 2011, there were already hints of a Higgs-like signal in the data but its statistical significance was low, with a 1-in-750 chance of getting it wrong. The latest data revealing the existence of a 125 GeV mass particle — with just a 3-in-10 million chance of being wrong — marks a high-point in precision experimental high-energy physics. The quality of data that it has produced in such a short period is certainly unprecedented. The extraordinary performance of the accelerator and the detectors, and the high quality data extracted through improved analytical techniques, is due entirely to the pooled-in skill and brains of thousands of scientists from all over the world, including India. True, this is just the beginning of a long journey when other properties of this new particle will be scrutinised to see if it indeed is the Higgs boson that scientists were looking for, or some other beast altogether. If it is the latter, it would raise many more questions and open new avenues for other ideas in our attempt at understanding the universe.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/small-is-beautiful/article3606903.ece
6,7,2012,Battling bias,"The revelation that nearly half the teaching positions reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Central universities remain unfilled is a cause for serious concern for policymakers in government and academia. According to information obtained through the Right to Information, 48.5 per cent of posts for SCs and STs in 24 Central universities across the country were vacant during 2010-2011.The reasons given for the dearth of “suitable candidates” to fill these vacancies are varied and, sometimes, contradictory. Many institutions of higher learning would rather leave reserved posts empty than fill them with the best among the available candidates. Surely, the academic costs of letting posts go unfilled are quite high for any institution. Even in the absence of objective criteria for evaluation, a loosely defined concept of merit is conveniently used to keep out eligible candidates. Laws and rules are often undermined by systemic bias. Sometimes, the institutions also point to the absence of qualified applicants, arguing that the most talented among the weaker sections opt for a more lucrative career in the civil service rather than for academics. In effect, the argument is that candidates belonging to SC and ST categories are either too good or too poor for the university system.
While the RTI query that brought out the backlog in filling vacancies in the SC/ST categories was specific to Central universities, the situation is unlikely to be very different in other educational institutions anywhere in the country. Even the adoption of a system of recruitment through roster registers in cases where the vacancies are few and far between (as in universities) has not produced very encouraging results. Without conscious, radical interventions from policymakers and administrators, the situation will not improve for Dalit and Adivasi candidates seeking employment in institutions of learning. Even if one were to accept for a moment that there are not enough qualified applicants, the fault for this surely lies with the Central and State governments which have done little to provide equality of opportunity for SCs and STs at the primary and secondary educational levels. A recent illustration of just how hostile the system can be towards Dalits and Adivasis was provided by the report this week that students of a school in Tamil Nadu were prevented by their caste Hindu parents from attending classes following the appointment of two Dalit women as cook and helper at the noon meal centre. Quite shockingly, the Block Development Officer agreed to transfer the employees as the parents belonging to the Kambalathu Naicker community insisted their children would not eat food cooked by them.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/battling-bias/article3606836.ece
7,7,2012,Everything is Maya,"A clean chit? Hardly. It is important to see the Supreme Court’s quashing of the disproportionate assets (DA) case against the former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, Mayawati, for what it is — a decision grounded entirely on legal technicalities. It is far from being a declaration of innocence as Ms Mayawati’s overzealous supporters would like us to believe. As the first line of the judgment states, “the only question” under consideration was whether the FIR lodged by the Central Bureau of Investigation against Ms Mayawati for allegedly possessing assets disproportionate to her income was “beyond the scope of directions” passed by the Supreme Court itself. In holding that it was, the Court has made a distinction between the Taj Heritage Corridor Project case — in which it had directed the CBI to register an FIR relating to the Mayawati government’s preposterous plan to construct commercial buildings on a two-km stretch behind the Taj Mahal without appropriate clearances — and a “roving enquiry” into her financial assets. Having maintained that “anything beyond the Taj Corridor matter was not the subject-matter of reference before the Taj Corridor Bench,” it was only a short step to reach the conclusion that the CBI had exceeded its jurisdiction in the case.
The CBI may be faulted for misunderstanding the Court’s orders and investigating Ms Mayawati’s assets from 1995 even though the Taj Corridor project was conceived only in 2002. But the manner in which the assets of Ms Mayawati and her relatives have mushroomed cannot but raise a suspicious eyebrow. The CBI had claimed that her assets increased from Rs. one crore in 2003 to Rs. 50 crore in 2007. Its affidavit in the Supreme Court talked of 96 plots, houses and orchards acquired by her and her close relatives between 1998 and 2003. The affidavit filed along with Ms Mayawati’s nomination for the Rajya Sabha a few months ago contains an estimation of her own wealth: Rs. 111.64 crore. If her defence in the now quashed DA case rang a familiar bell, it is because politicians have used it before: sharp increases in wealth are explained as the accretion of small contributions made by legions of followers out of “love and affection.” Acceptance of income tax returns is held out as proof that the income is genuine. In an environment in which clear financial trails are hard to unearth, disproportionate assets cases — where the onus of proof is shifted on the accused — are a more effective instrument against politicians and bureaucrats suspected of corruption. Given that the chargesheet in the DA case against Ms Mayawati was only being readied, there was hardly anything concrete against her to begin with. Sadly, with the quashing of the FIR, everything is maya.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/everything-is-maya/article3610507.ece
7,7,2012,Saudi games with women,"Saudi Arabia’s announcement that it would allow women who qualify to compete in the 2012 Olympic Games may give the impression that the conservative kingdom, which has a brazenly medieval attitude towards its female citizens, has finally seen the light. No such thing. The country was under pressure from the International Olympics Committee, which itself was feeling the heat from international human rights organisations for not coming down hard enough on the country for its gender discrimination. The Olympic Charter describes discrimination against women in sport as “incompatible” with its mission. The IOC did nothing about the wealthy kingdom’s discriminatory ways all these years even though it barred Taliban-ruled Afghanistan from the 2000 games for not sending a women’s team. This year, there were strong calls for similar treatment to Saudi Arabia. Had the country not complied, at the very least, it would have stood out as the only significant outlier among 205 participating nations: the two other countries that have never sent women to the Olympics, Qatar and Brunei, have already nominated their female participants. The Saudi decision allows both it and the IOC to look good without much changing on the ground, and it should not come as a surprise if even now, the Saudi Olympic contingent does not include women. The country has restrictions that keep women away from sport. Girls who want to take up games have no access to material or venues, and rigorously observed gender segregation ensures it remains that way. Given these circumstances, there is virtually no woman who makes the Olympic cut. One equestrian hopeful did not qualify because of an injury to her horse.
Last year, as the Arab Spring swept through the region, King Abdullah quickly made some modest concessions, including permitting women to contest and vote in the distant 2015 municipal elections. Saudi Arabia is the only country where women are not allowed to drive, but this limited extension of franchise was seen as evidence of a new reformist spirit in the monarchy. The true test of Riyadh’s commitment to the IOC lies not in this year’s games, but whether it is willing to loosen up enough to prepare a women’s contingent for the 2016 Olympics. At the moment, this seems somewhat far-fetched; it is telling that women who play sport underground now fear there will be a greater scrutiny of their activities by the powerful religious establishment. There are a few liberal-minded Saudi royals but the monarchy derives its power and legitimacy from the religious orthodoxy.

What malodorous disease could lead a random mob of men to molest a minor schoolgirl, stripping her and beating her by turns in the middle of a busy downtown street, as if they were engaged in some casual sport? Surely, this appalling crime — which took place barely a kilometre from Assam’s State secretariat and in full view of many — is more than just a reflection on a criminal mob of some 20 or more young men and the deteriorating law and order situation in Guwahati. Surely, it should hold up a mirror to all of us and lead us to ask what has gone so horribly wrong in our society. The sheer savagery of the gang molestation, the video of which went viral on the Internet, has fuelled outrage across the country even as it has triggered a sense of national shame. The Assam police, which took a full 30 minutes to arrive at the crime scene, should lose no time in arresting all those involved in the bestiality, many of who have been already identified because of the video. It is debatable whether or not the onlookers who passively watched the mortification of the schoolgirl are legally culpable. But their moral complicity in the crime is beyond question.
We live in a time when crimes against women — which climbed over 2.25 lakh in 2011 according to the National Crime Records Bureau — are growing alarmingly. The data also clearly reveals that over the last couple of decades, the (reported) incidents of rape have increased at a far steeper rate than other serious crimes such as murder and theft. Even so, we assiduously cultivate the patriarchal lie that women are fundamentally responsible for many of the crimes against them. The panchayat in Uttar Pradesh’s Bagpat region which recently issued a diktat against unescorted women visiting the marketplace, entering into love marriages or even carrying mobile phones, was guided by the same warped mindset. The stated objective was to protect women from being teased and harassed by men. But rather than take steps to punish those responsible for such harassment, the panchayat chose illegitimately to restrict the freedom of women and infringe on their rights. Sadly, it is not uncommon to find police officers and politicians subscribing to such a regressive belief system. Justice is rarely done in the face of such attitudes. This is why organisations such as the National Commission of Women, which is sending a team to Guwahati, must track the molestation case closely and work towards seeing that the guilty are severely punished.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-depths-of-depravity/article12750154.ece
14,7,2012,Still no room for optimism,"It is a measure of the very low expectations from the economy that even an anaemic 2.4 per cent increase in industrial production in May should be viewed positively in some quarters. It is only on a comparison with the previous months that the index of industrial production (IIP) data looks tolerable, though it is quite a stretch to claim that it marks the beginning of a turnaround in the economy. Industrial production had contracted in March and April by 3.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively. But “a return to positive territory” is, by itself, hardly a cause for celebration. In May 2011, industrial production had grown by a relatively healthy 6.4 per cent, which at that time was considered to be inadequate. The dip in industrial production has been the prime reason for the steep fall in overall GDP growth rates during last year. A break-up of the May data reveals that manufacturing, accounting for more than 75 per cent of the overall IIP, grew by 2.5 per cent after contracting 1.25 per cent in the preceding month. If that is seen to augur well for future growth, the decline in mining — it contracted by 0.9 per cent — and in the output of capital goods by as much as 7.7 per cent are real dampeners. Capital goods are a proxy for short-term investments while the poor performance of mining points to the need for proactive, holistic government policies towards the sector.
The relatively strong performance of consumer goods might be short-lived if the monsoon remains erratic, dashing hopes of a robust rural demand. The performance of various sectors that form the IIP is, therefore, mixed and merely reflects the ground realities. Interestingly, even at a much broader level, the value of this index to policymaking has, for quite some time, been questioned for very basic reasons. Even in the new series, revised with 2004-05 as the base, the index has been extremely volatile and subject to frequent revisions, a glaring, recent example being the April number which was revised downwards to negative territory from a small 0.1 per cent increase. The IIP series has been considered unreliable and inaccurate by important users of economic data including, notably, the Reserve Bank of India. Its governor has, more than once, complained that the index’s negative attributes hinder monetary policy formulation. There is of course a case for improving government statistics including the IIP. As for the May figures, while they may not indicate a bounce-back, they do send out a clear message to the government to frame policies that will put industrial growth back on track.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/still-no-room-for-optimism/article3636393.ece
16,7,2012,Subterranean challenges,"The perils of the system of rat-hole mining that thousands in Meghalaya routinely engage in were in stark focus over the past week. After a fruitless search that yielded no survivors or bodies in a flooded coal pit in the South Garo Hills, a rescue team of the National Disaster and Rescue Force has called off its operations. This means the 15 miners who were believed trapped underground are being given up as dead. It is the failure of the authorities to put in place a monitoring and regulatory mechanism that stands out in the wake of the accident. The miners, desperate to make a living, typically scramble into the shafts, crudely dug and so small that even kneeling is impossible inside. Lying horizontally, they hack away with pick-axes and their bare hands to extract the often sparse pickings. More shockingly, thousands of children, some under 10, toil alongside adults, their small bodies a perfect fit for the narrow seams. Many of the miners are migrants. Instances of death, from cave-ins and other accidents, are not always documented but are far from rare. Proximate facilities for medical care are nonexistent. In 2002, over 30 people died in a rat-hole pit in Meghalaya after it was flooded suddenly.
Meghalaya has no mining policy: minerals are extracted by individual operators at will. Miners use rudimentary gear, and among other risks face the black lung disease caused by the ingestion of coal dust. The mines operate in the manner of an unorganised cottage industry. Most land in Meghalaya is privately owned by tribal people, who as a matter of customary right exploit the coal present in their parcels. The villages located in the coal belt actually sit on a network of trenches dug beneath. It is not as if the practice, coyote hole mining as it was referred to in the Americas as it evolved from a 16th century Spanish system, is inherently unsound. Such inexpensive excavation was technologically simpler, and amenable to small-scale operation, compared to the large-scale industrial-corporate mining that emerged in the 19th century. Indeed, the low-tech approach was efficient in its own way, calling for excavations to follow the meanderings of ore seams. It may be neither possible nor advisable to move suddenly to end rat-hole mining in this region. Coal is Meghalaya’s biggest source of revenue. What is needed immediately is a scientifically sound regulatory mechanism to optimise yields and make the operation more efficient. Labour laws have to be enforced, worker safety and payment of fair wages ensured, and child labour of any kind has to be eliminated. The miners should be provided training and made aware of the risks, and put through safety drills.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/subterranean-challenges/article3643095.ece
16,7,2012,A victory for the voters,"About 63 per cent of Libya’s 2.8 million registered voters have turned out in the country’s first free election in nearly 60 years, to choose a constituent assembly that is to appoint a cabinet and Prime Minister before it writes a new constitution under which fresh parliamentary elections will be held. With 200 seats allocated by regional population sizes, the western region of Tripolitania and the southern region, Fezzan, have 100 and 40 seats respectively; the other 60 go to Cyrenaica in the east. Under the hybrid electoral system, voters have been offered 2,600 individual candidates and some 1200 contenders belonging to one or other of 400 political organisations, and early indications are that the 60-party National Forces Alliance under Mohamed Jibril has established a strong lead. Final results will not be known until after July 16, and while nearly all polling stations opened and functioned as required, there were some disruptions. In the east, armed militias killed an election worker when they fired on a helicopter carrying election materials; the aircraft later crash-landed.
Mr. Jibril, who led the National Transitional Council (NTC) during the 2011 western-aided war to overthrow the 42-year dictatorship of Muammar al-Qadhafi, is a devout Muslim and rejects attempts to label him a liberal or a secularist. Yet that only partly explains the poor showing by the Justice and Construction Party, the Libyan political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, which through its political parties has won the parliament and the presidency in Egypt, as well as a majority in the Tunisian parliament. In Libya, however, the Islamists are reliably estimated to have won only a 15 per cent vote-share even among conservative easterners. One reason is that the complicated system has led to voting largely along tribal and familial lines; a second is that Libyan voters resent the suggestion that they need to be told how to be Muslims. Thirdly, Cyrenaican leaders, who seek a federal system, are suspicious of what they see as strong forms of Islamism pushed by West Asian states like Qatar, which helped depose Qadhafi. Eastern leaders — who live above the country’s main oilfields — contend that the seat allocation in Tripoli marginalises their region, and they have already won a concession in that the 60-member parliamentary committee to write the new constitution will now be elected by the public and not be appointed by the constituent assembly. The key issues, therefore, are mainly political rather than religious, as they should be, but it is ordinary Libyan voters who have made them so. Irrespective of the result and the political feuding, this election is their triumph and theirs alone.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-victory-for-the-voters/article3643094.ece
17,7,2012,"Right contest, wrong reason","After having denied him the chance to be President in 2012, the United Progressive Alliance did the next best thing in offering Hamid Ansari another term as Vice-President. With the support of the Left parties, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party, the UPA holds enough votes in both Houses of Parliament to ensure a smooth sailing for the soft-spoken and erudite scholar-diplomat in the election for Vice-President. Political compulsions played their part in the Congress, and thereafter, the UPA, deciding to go with Pranab Mukherjee in the presidential election. Mr. Ansari was never ruled out in the calculations and the confabulations; he was just not ruled in. By nominating him for another term, the UPA is seeking to underscore this very fact. Indeed, the Congress initially projected both Mr. Ansari and Mr. Mukherjee as options for the UPA partners to reach a consensus on, but Mr. Mukherjee won that round. When elected, Mr. Ansari will be only the second Vice-President to get a second term; the country’s first Vice-President, S. Radhakrishnan, was the first.
Not unexpectedly, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the National Democratic Alliance it heads have chosen to force a contest by nominating former External Affairs and Finance Minister Jaswant Singh for the post of Vice-President. Mr. Singh, who is eminently qualified for the job, stands no chance of winning, but for the BJP this is an opportunity to try and keep its alliance together after the divisions that emerged within the NDA in choosing the candidate for the President’s post. Unlike in the presidential election, when both the Janata Dal (United) and the Shiv Sena differed with the BJP, now all the NDA partners are united in backing Mr. Singh. Actually, the BJP, perhaps as a placatory measure, first offered to back JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav in the election. Mr. Yadav, a seasoned political campaigner who cannot think of staying away from active politics, declined, and the choice fell on Mr. Singh, who doubtless saw in this an opportunity to cement his already formidable credentials as a statesman within the NDA. Curiously, the NDA’s reasons for opposing Mr. Ansari’s candidature were two-fold: the opposition did not like his conduct as the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha during the discussion on the Lok Pal Bill, nor his shepherding of the Women’s Reservation Bill. Surely, the passing of the Women’s Bill, stalled by the likes of Mr. Yadav for several years, should count as one of the foremost achievements of Mr. Ansari’s tenure. If the BJP and the NDA are keen to use the Vice-President’s election to re-connect their politics with a wider public, this is certainly not the way to have begun.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/right-contest-wrong-reason/article3646624.ece
17,7,2012,Tragedy at Timbuktu,"The wanton and horrifying destruction of a World Heritage site — the Sidi Yahia mosque — and several ancient tombs at Timbuktu by radical Islamist insurgents in Mali is another grim reminder of growing intolerance towards cultural symbols in conflict areas. Eleven years after the Bamiyan Buddhas were pulversised by the Taliban and 19 years on from the demolition of the Babri Masjid by Hindutva fanatics, it is clear that existing international conventions and the protective measures they offer to heritage structures are ineffective. Timbuktu is not, as the English-speaking world conditioned by Orientalist imagination conjures, an insignificant place located in the back of beyond. Rather, it is a historic city of captivating beauty. Saddled between the desert and the irrigated areas of the river Niger in north Mali, Timbuktu, founded by Tuaregs in the 11th century, flourished as a trading city during the 15th and 16th centuries, and also as a centre of learning. The mosques of Djingareyber, Sankore and Sidi Yahia, built more than 400 years ago, attest to its great past. These exquisite examples of earthen architecture along with 16 cemeteries are World Heritage sites. Ansar Dine — the radical Islamist militia which has taken control of the area — considers the mosques dedicated to Sufi saints and structures over graves as idolatrous, and has barbarically ravaged them with pickaxes.
What Malians fear more is the condition of about 300,000 ancient manuscripts. In the past, Timbuktu hosted thousands of students who came to learn about Islam. Books on religious and other subjects were written, copied and traded. Libraries and institutions there such as the Ahmed Baba Institute of Higher Learning and Islamic Research still preserve and use many of them. If these precious documents meet the same fate as the monuments, the loss would be irreplaceable. Sadly, the World Heritage Convention and the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and its two protocols have turned out to be toothless. They could not bind the radical militia. Hope now lies in two places. The statute of the International Criminal Court includes as war crimes the deliberate destruction of cultural properties. Such legal provisions could be improved in scope to become effective deterrents. A proactive empowerment of local communities to care for and guard their heritage during conflict is another avenue to explore. UNESCO’s assistance to local guards in Congo during the time of conflict (2001) to save the world natural heritage sites there was reassuring. Timbuktu needs more of such support and it needs this urgently.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tragedy-at-timbuktu/article3646625.ece
18,7,2012,The first victim of Obama’s new war,"Mounting tensions in the Persian Gulf have come home to India in a most tragic way: An Indian has been killed and three more injured when a United States Navy vessel fired on their fishing boat off Dubai. The four men, all from Tamil Nadu, worked for a United Arab Emirates company and the incident has stoked the same kind of anger in their home district of Ramanathapuram as the unprovoked killing of two fishermen by Italian marines off the coast of Kerala did last February. The U.S. has conveyed its “regrets” and promised an investigation but there is no escaping the bottom line: the steadily expanding American military presence around Iran since January 2012 has claimed its first ‘collateral’ victims. The Obama administration has tightened the sanctions noose on Tehran and moved significant military reinforcements to the Persian Gulf in an ill-advised attempt to force a resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue. More fighter aircraft have been deployed and the U.S. Navy has added minesweepers and an amphibious transport and docking ship reportedly to serve as the Pentagon’s first floating staging base for military operations or “humanitarian” assistance in the event of hostilities. USNS Rappahannock, whose guards fired at the Indians in their fishing boat, was a military supply ship. The U.S. Navy has said “a series of non-lethal, preplanned responses” failed to warn off the approaching boat, necessitating the use of force. What exactly transpired may never fully be known. But clearly, the incident points to a military on the edge.
India’s response to the crisis in the Persian Gulf so far has been to try and balance its competing interests with both Tehran and Washington. It has fully complied with the United Nations Security Council’s trading restrictions on Iran for its refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment programme. U.N. sanctions do not cover crude, and despite U.S. pressure on importing nations, India has continued to source Iranian oil, albeit in reduced quantities. However, the death of an Indian citizen in American firing should serve as a wake-up call for New Delhi because it underlines the uncertain fate that lies ahead for the nearly six million Indians who live in the Gulf and West Asian regions should the U.S. escalate its stand-off into full-scale hostilities against Iran. Passivity in the face of the looming storm is no longer an option. In its own interests, India needs to up its diplomatic game and do what it can to prevent another war in that region. It must do this by working with like-minded countries to persuade the U.S. to reverse an unnecessarily aggressive approach that is only worsening instability and making the Iranian nuclear issue even more intractable.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-first-victim-of-obamas-new-war/article3650534.ece
18,7,2012,Let the games begin,"The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) must be congratulated for its bold move to invite the Pakistan cricket team to visit India for a short tour of one-day and Twenty20 matches at the end of this year. The decision has delighted millions of fans in both countries, who revel in the competitive intensity these contests inevitably produce. Quite clearly, the cricket-loving public in the subcontinent is against the game being politicised in a narrow and chauvinistic way — something a section of our political class and intelligentsia is wont to do. There is absolutely no logic for prohibiting bilateral cricket ties at a time when India and Pakistan maintain a range of other sporting contacts, apart from having cultural exchanges and trading relationships. Also, India has no reservation about playing Pakistan in multi-nation tournaments, where refusal to play would entail forfeiture. The last such match in India was held just a year ago — the World Cup semi-final at Mohali. It is true that India-Pakistan cricket has had a tendency to arouse excessive passions, but an important reason for this is the fact that the two countries rarely play each other. The answer surely is more cricket — or enough to make such matches seem so routine and habitual that nobody would regard them as if they were politically charged gladiatorial contests or a matter of national honour.
Although the BCCI’s decision must be officially approved by the Centre, it appears that the tour has already received an informal nod from the ministries of Home and External Affairs. Predictably, those who have been running a longstanding hate campaign against India-Pakistan cricket, such as the Shiv Sena, have already registered their opposition. That Mumbai, which suffered the 26/11 terror attack, resulting in the snapping of sporting ties, has not been chosen to host any of the matches is probably deliberate. The Sena, which used its roughnecks to vandalise the pitch in Delhi’s Ferozshah Kotla and ransack the BCCI office in Mumbai in an attempt to disrupt Pakistan’s 1999 tour of India, would have been difficult to contend with in Mumbai. It was in the 1999 series that Pakistan registered a nail-biting victory in Chennai despite a heroic innings by Sachin Tendulkar that almost saw India through. Although deeply disappointed, the throng of cricket fans gave the Pakistani players a standing ovation as they did a victory lap of the M.A. Chidambaram stadium. It was a significant moment in the history of India-Pakistan sporting relations which underlined a basic truth — that cricket, when played and enjoyed in the right spirit, is but a game.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/let-the-games-begin/article3650270.ece
19,7,2012,Strengthen the melting pot,"India took a belated but bold step to provide universal education by enacting the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. That egalitarian measure to empower disadvantaged children with a seat even in an unaided school — affirmed recently by the Supreme Court — has upset some institutions that obviously identify themselves with the privileged classes. The backlash to the law has been immediate, in the form of closures and protests. Now, in a shocking display of latent violence, a school in Bangalore has subjected disadvantaged students to a deeply stigmatising kind of discrimination: it has cut a lock of their hair to segregate them from other children in the class. These children have apparently not been entered in the regular attendance rolls either. The actions of the school deserve to be condemned and a full enquiry must be held into how and why it took such a cruel step. Unless the school involved is made an example of, it is likely that similar reprehensible acts carried out to assert class power will be witnessed in other institutions which have publicly opposed the equity objectives of the RTE Act.
In an address to the nation on April 1, 2010, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called the new law guaranteeing elementary education a redemption of a pledge made to all children. The Bangalore incident makes it clear that laws alone are not enough, strong determination is essential to break barriers down. The RTE Act and associated rules specifically forbid any kind of segregation, physical punishment or mental harassment of children. A reading of the law, however, indicates that the penalty for violation is essentially confined to withdrawal of recognition. What happened in Bangalore is both physical punishment and mental harassment of children, who are likely to carry the scars long into their lives. It is necessary, therefore, to review the penalties prescribed, and provide for stronger punishment to individuals also, for acts stemming from extreme class bias. A provision for government takeover of institutions that refuse to reform themselves may be necessary. Societal commitment through active vigilance and well-functioning supervisory institutions are vital to make the RTE Act work. Equally, governments must demolish the culture of elitism promoted by many unaided schools by encouraging the starting of more institutions. India corrected a historic injustice towards its children by making education a justiciable fundamental right under Article 21A. It should not hesitate to show political will to enforce this right in the face of bigoted resistance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/strengthen-the-melting-pot/article3654444.ece
19,7,2012,Price of collusion,"The recently released report of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission provides official confirmation of what has been common knowledge since the March 11, 2011 disaster: that the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) cared little for safety right from the point of choosing sites for its nuclear plants to operating them, and that it shared a murky relationship with Japan’s regulators. The commission was constituted last December by the National Diet of Japan. The Daiichi nuclear power plant accident is “clearly manmade” and a disaster that was “made in Japan,” the report states. It resulted due to the “collusion between the government, the regulators and TEPCO.” These observations fly in the face of TEPCO that blamed the unprecedented 9-magnitude earthquake and subsequent killer tsunami for causing the nuclear disaster. While the committee does admit that the natural disasters were the “direct causes of the accident,” it insists that the accident was “manmade.” The reason — the accident could have been avoided if the regulators and the operator, who were fully aware of the risks, had put in place the necessary safety measures. For instance, they were fully aware, as early as 2006, of the possibility of total power blackout in the event of a tsunami reaching the level of the site. They also knew the risk of a tsunami killing the seawater pumps and the ensuing risk of reactor core damage. Shockingly, instead of insisting TEPCO safeguard the plant, the regulators did not want the operator to “consider a possible station blackout.” Similarly, despite the nearly 40-year-old plant not being built to withstand a 9-magnitude quake and killer tsunami, no proper structural reinforcements were added by the operator to increase the anti-seismic safety of units 1, 2 and 3.
The report has brought to the fore the problems of private companies operating nuclear plants. For instance, it found ample evidence of a mindset that “prioritised benefits to the organisation at the expense of the public.” This should be reason enough for India to stick to its current stand and desist from allowing private operators. The main reason why the regulators failed in their duty can be traced to conflicts of interest — the regulators are a part of the ministry that actively promotes nuclear energy. Japan’s nuclear industry has apparently refused to learn some critical lessons from the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl accidents. What resulted was Fukushima. Nuclear operators and regulators around the world — India included — must now ensure the lessons of the latest catastrophe are internalised and acted upon.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/price-of-collusion/article3654445.ece
20,7,2012,Time to stop partying,"In the eight years since he was elected to Parliament from Amethi, Rahul Gandhi has shown a lot of political promise but little else. As a leader of the new generation in the Nehru-Gandhi lineage, he was expected to play a prominent role, first in the party, and later, in government. In 2004, when his mother declined the prime ministership and instead asked Manmohan Singh to lead the country, Rahul’s reluctance to jump into governance was understandable. A quick, dramatic entry into Cabinet at that point would have undermined the Prime Minister, who had no political base of his own and who depended entirely on the Congress’s first family for his political survival. Rahul chose instead to work within the organisational ranks of the Congress; his decision was both tactical and strategic. The fact that he did not seem greedy for the fruits of power and appeared ready to go through the drudgery of field work did his public image a lot of good. But he also tried to use his leadership over the Youth Congress and students’ wing to democratise these organisations — and through them — the ‘mother party’. Though his efforts helped the Congress draw fresh talent, the grip of the old guard, sadly, remains just as firm today as it was eight years ago. More than the indifferent electoral results Rahul produced in Uttar Pradesh this year then, it is his failure to make a dent in the party organisation that must surely rankle more.
Clearly, Rahul Gandhi is not, and could never have been, the answer to all the shortcomings of the Congress. But if he is the heir-apparent, as the entire party thinks he is, and he is to be projected as a prime ministerial candidate in 2014, he must end his wanderings through the thicket of the party organisation and take on concrete ministerial responsibilities. Congress leader Salman Khursheed got it partly right when he lamented the fact that Rahul had so far only shown “cameos” of his thoughts and ideas. The answer, though, is not for him to come up with some “grand announcement” for India but to demonstrate to the people that he can actually administer, as a minister, some of the small but important infrastructure programmes of the UPA government. On Thursday, he indicated his readiness to take on a more pro-active role in the party and the government. He should forget about the party for now. In 2012, Rahul can have no excuse for staying away from the Cabinet. Anything else would appear as a shirking of responsibility, or worse, as aversion to working under Manmohan Singh. Indeed, his entry could give the Prime Minister a perfect opportunity to wield some long knives in his next Cabinet reshuffle and give younger ministers the responsibility they deserve.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/time-to-stop-partying/article3658796.ece
20,7,2012,Ignorance is not bliss,"A Tamil Nadu university’s decision to suspend a student with leucoderma — an autoimmune disorder that leads to white patches on the skin — is a reminder of the deep roots ignorance and insensitivity have struck in the social terrain of India. One day after he joined a B. Tech course at the Kalasalingam University in Virudhunagar district, 18-year-old Ayyappan was asked to leave the institution as parents of other students had apparently objected to his presence in the class. Leucoderma, medically referred to as vitiligo, is not a contagious condition; people coming in contact with such a person run no risk of getting infected. Unfortunately, leucoderma is often confused for leprosy as white patches are seen on the skin of people with leprosy. There is more confusion in Tamil Nadu, as vitiligo is often referred to as ‘white leprosy’ (‘ven kushtam’ and ‘ven kuttam’). But the nature of the white patch is very different in both these cases. While a complete absence of melanin pigment, which gives human skin a brownish hue, causes the white patch in the case of leucoderma, a depletion of the pigment causes the white patches in leprosy. Loss of sensation and the dry nature of the patches are further indications of leprosy. Moreover, leprosy is contagious only in the untreated lepromatous form; other forms are not contagious as the bacilli remain in the nerves.
Even if the students and their parents were unaware of these differences, it is most unfortunate that the authorities too were grossly ignorant. More shocking is the fact that the authorities not only doubted the veracity of the medical certificate issued by a doctor from the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital vouching for the student’s condition, but never cared to obtain independent expert medical opinion before taking recourse to such a drastic step. In failing to do so, the institute unwittingly became guilty of discrimination, and in the process sent a wrong message. The Tamil Nadu government on December 27, 2010 issued an important order to abandon the use of the terms ‘ven kushtam’ and ‘ven kuttam’ to reduce the confusion and consequent stigmatisation of leucoderma patients. The university has now asked the student to rejoin his classes but this incident clearly indicates that much more has to be done to destigmatise vitiligo. Much has been written about the stigma and discrimination faced by people with HIV/AIDS and an effective government-sponsored programme has gone some way towards righting that wrong. A similar awareness drive on leucoderma is clearly needed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ignorance-is-not-bliss/article3658961.ece
21,7,2012,Pawar strikes a blow,"The relationship between the Congress and its ally, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has reached a new low with Sharad Pawar threatening to quit the UPA government and provide only “outside support” if his party’s demands are not met. The NCP is part of the coalition government in Maharashtra and the threat, if effected, could have serious implications in the State. In a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the NCP has complained about policy issues and the fact that it is kept out of decision making. It has accused the Congress of one party rule and not functioning like a coalition. Mr. Pawar seems to have been goaded into action by the impending Cabinet reshuffle, the organisational changes in the Congress, where Rahul Gandhi is slated to play a more powerful role, and by the possibility of his one- time protégé Sushilkumar Shinde getting a key position. There are issues over decision-making within the United Progressive Alliance, and in Maharashtra there is antipathy to Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan’s functioning. In a bid to restore the tattered image of the State government, the Maharashtra CM has been scrupulous, much to the dismay of the builder and contractor lobby. The rumbling about lack of decision-making in the government is largely coming from this section. Mr. Chavan has also done his bit to antagonise his coalition ally by putting the NCP-controlled Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank under administrators and insisting on a white paper from the NCP-headed irrigation department, among other things.
Today, the Congress and the NCP look more like sparring partners, not allies, and it is no wonder that they decided to go it alone in the Maharashtra local bodies’ polls. The NCP came up trumps, outsmarting the Congress in some municipal corporations by tying up with right-wing parties. There is speculation that the party will junk the Congress and go with new allies in 2014, but that remains to be seen. Mr. Pawar enjoys a good rapport with Ms Gandhi and the Prime Minister. It is unlikely that they will react unreasonably to his demands — assuming, of course, that his demands are reasonable. But the Congress also has to keep in mind that the NCP is not its only coalition partner and that the UPA has within its fold larger and trickier allies. The quality of the Congress’s mercy may be tempered by these considerations. Mr. Pawar, a man with prime ministerial ambitions, may be miffed at not getting his due in the Union government and the lack of discussion in key areas like agriculture, food security, irrigation and exports. But he is also adept at negotiating a good bargain.

21,7,2012,Syrians betrayed,"The killing of 200 people in the village of Tremseh has confirmed the depth of the Syrian crisis and the dangers it poses for the region; it has also exposed major problems for international institutions. In Tremseh, one of the bloodiest episodes since the uprising started in 2011 occurred on July 12 when, according to United Nations observers, heavily armed government forces targeted rebels and defectors. A week later, a suicide bomber killed defence minister Daoud Rajha, his deputy Assef Shawkat, who was also President Bashar al-Assad’s brother-in-law, and former defence minister Hassan Turkomani; a fourth victim, national security chief Hisham Ikhtiar, died later from his injuries. That the attack took place at the National Security Bureau in Damascus is a huge blow to the Ba’ath regime. Fighting continues in Damascus, and thousands of civilians have already tried to take shelter in a Palestinian refugee camp at Yarmouk, a southern district of the city. In a further key development, Russia and China have for the third time vetoed a Syria-related U.N. Security Council resolution, with Russia rejecting sanctions and military intervention; Moscow also accuses the western powers of blackmailing it with threats to block the renewal of the U.N. Supervision Mission unless it collaborates over Syria.
The violence there, which has claimed 17,000 lives so far, is itself terrible, but the inability of the international community to reach any kind of agreement means the crisis will almost certainly escalate even further. That Mr. Assad is in deepening trouble is not in doubt. Senior-level defections from his regime are becoming more frequent, and the rebels now hold five border crossings, four to Iraq and one to Turkey. Nevertheless the prospects for post-Assad stability do not look bright. The United States, in the person of its U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, says it will work outside the Security Council to put pressure on the regime; this is ominously reminiscent of the prelude to the illegal Iraq invasion in 2003. Second, there is increasing evidence of tension among the rebels resulting from the increasing involvement of extreme Islamists sponsored by West Asian Sunni-majority states, which have also provided sophisticated weapons of western manufacture. None of the external players is showing any motivation beyond self-interest. If Russia and China are concerned about the fate of the Assad regime, the U.S. and its allies are not willing to draft a balanced resolution that pushes regime opponents towards talks. Unless the big powers give up their games, Syrian civilians will continue dying by the thousand.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/syrians-betrayed/article3662813.ece
23,7,2012,Pranab as President,"In Pranab Mukherjee, India will have a knowledgeable and pragmatic President who is well-versed in constitutional procedures and practices, and who was, until his nomination as a candidate by the ruling coalition, an active politician and senior Union Minister. Unlike Pratibha Patil, who was out of active politics long before she became President, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who was a genuinely non-political person in the best sense of the term, and K.R. Narayanan, Shanker Dayal Sharma and R. Venkataraman, who served as Vice-President before they entered Rashtrapati Bhavan, Mr. Mukherjee is making the switch from active politics and governance to the office of President in next to no time. The last time this happened was when Zail Singh moved out as Union Home Minister a month before becoming President in 1982. What this means is every action of Mr. Mukherjee in the discharge of presidential duties will be scrutinised for political partisanship. Under the Indian Constitution, the President has no executive role to play, but his or her actions — whether, for instance, in approving Bills or sending these back for reconsideration, or in forming a new government or in asking the incumbent to face a vote of confidence — have political import. The President is no rubber stamp, and is not required to sign on the dotted line irrespective of the issue at hand. While there are strict statutory limits to his discretion, his advisory or cautionary role is well recognised by the Constitution.
The most critical test for Mr. Mukherjee as President will no doubt come in 2014 after the general election to the Lok Sabha. As in the last couple of decades, no one party is likely to get a majority of its own, and the bigger parties would have to depend on the support of alliance partners or new-found friends. Venkataraman in 1989 and Sharma in 1996 followed the principle of inviting the leader of the single largest party to form the government. Rajiv Gandhi declined the invitation in 1989; Atal Bihari Vajpayee accepted the invitation, but lasted as Prime Minister on that occasion for just 13 days. With these examples behind him, Narayanan insisted on letters of support from a claimant party’s allies before extending it an invitation to form the government. While this looks like the most sensible approach after elections with a fractured mandate, in India there is no such thing as a settled convention. But historical precedents have a way of exerting a pull on the present. As President of India, Mr. Mukherjee would know how to fall back on traditions and conventions when necessary and when to look for fresh ways to break new impasses or constitutional deadlocks.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pranab-as-president/article3670180.ece
23,7,2012,Message from Manesar,"There can be no two ways of looking at the horrific violence unleashed by workers at the Manesar plant of Maruti Suzuki that resulted in the death of a manager of the company. It was ghastly and shocking and deserves to be condemned in unequivocal terms. Nothing can justify the brutal murder. It is disturbing to read reports that the manager burned to death because his legs were fractured by some workers and he could not escape the fire set off by them. Indeed, the violence of the mob was so ghastly that 33 managers are still in hospital nursing injuries inflicted on them. The police have arrested 91 workers who allegedly participated in the violence. Those found guilty should be dealt with sternly and held to account especially considering that worker violence has become all too frequent in recent times in the Gurgaon-Manesar belt that houses many automobile and ancillary companies. Indeed, in this context one needs to ask if the sad events at Maruti’s plant could have been avoided if the Haryana government had been proactive. It is clear that the labour in this region, working for different employers, is restive for varied reasons and has been so for more than the last couple of years.
While condemning the violence unleashed by the workers, it is important to find out why they reacted in such an extreme way. Maruti’s Manesar plant workers and management have been in an uneasy relationship for over a year now. The plant witnessed labour protests for more than four months last year, culminating in a 33-day lockout following a dispute over employment of contract labour, wages, the creation of a new union and speed-ups. The truce since then was an uneasy one as borne out by the unfortunate events of last week. Across Indian industry, the traditional management-labour face-off has acquired a new edge in recent times as companies grappling with a complex business environment do their utmost to rein in costs, including wages. Workers have been frustrated and this has to be seen in the context of the consumer culture that has taken hold of the country. The attempt by some companies, especially multinationals, to discourage unionisation has added to the volatility of industrial relations, and their preferred tactic is to employ workers on contract so as to have a hold over them. Apart from the Gurgaon-Manesar belt, there have been problems in other parts of the country, notably the Sriperumbudur industrial corridor near Chennai, Bangalore and Pune. Apex industry bodies such as business chambers, labour unions and the government need to put their heads together to assess what is undoubtedly a disturbing trend and examine ways to reverse this trend.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/message-from-manesar/article3670182.ece
24,7,2012,Pilgrims’ distress,"As the number of Amarnath yatra pilgrims rises by the year, the casualty figures appear set to create a distressing record. Over the first four weeks of the 39-day yatra period, 97 pilgrims have died. There are 10 days left in the window for the year, and it is feared that the final toll may outstrip that of 2011 when 107 people died — which marked a spike over the 68 deaths in 2010 and 45 in 2009. The trip to the venerated Himalayan shrine involves an arduous trek in extreme cold conditions along a narrow path to reach an altitude of about 12,755 feet. Most of the deaths have been attributed to cardiac arrest and pulmonary problems. Dearth of oxygen in the rarefied high-altitude atmosphere is the biggest cause. The Shri Amarnath Ji Shrine Board, which is in charge of the arrangements, has made it mandatory for each pilgrim to carry a medical certificate. However, it turns out that in their eagerness to qualify, some pilgrims obtain fake fitness certificates. The devout set out on an empty stomach after an ice-cold bath. Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, who linked the high number of deaths to issues of age, poor fitness levels and lack of acclimatisation, may have hit the nail in the head. There is a case to put in place a fool-proof system involving multi-stage health screening — ensuring that those who have not registered through the proper process are not allowed to risk their lives. The CRPF and the BSF have created a network of medical camps that are functional round-the-clock along the two yatra routes, and there are medical aid posts set up by the State government, but their efficacy in handling life-threatening situations remain to be assessed. In the event of an emergency, there should be arrangements for swift evacuation to base camps, and thereafter to specified hospitals in Srinagar.
The Supreme Court’s decision to appoint a high-power committee to look into the deaths reflects concerns that have been widely felt. Taking suo motu note of reports, it has sought an explanation from the Central and Jammu and Kashmir governments on the medical and other facilities made available en route. It has also directed that the committee examine issues including the widening of the pilgrim passage route and provision of amenities. The court has asked the committee to visit the shrine. The state cannot be impervious to the pilgrims’ distress. The findings of the committee should form the basis for a protocol that would minimise deaths from accidents as well as from health emergencies along the yatra route at least from next year on.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pilgrims-distress/article3675451.ece
24,7,2012,"Contraception, but no coercion","Rich countries pledged large financial resources to expand access to contraception to some 120 million women and girls in the developing world at the recent London Summit on Family Planning. Such promises seem audacious, especially when many G8 countries — having reneged on their aid commitments for years — are now pulling back even more under the domestic drive of austerity. The fresh commitments announced also come close on the heels of the perceived failure of the June 2012 U.N. conference on sustainable development in Rio de Janeiro. The Rio declaration was criticised as having failed to restore lost momentum on gender equality in recent years owing to reduced resource allocation and diminishing political support. The positive fallout of the global impetus on family planning in the 1980s and 1990s is there for all to see. According to World Health Organisation estimates, the number of women who died annually due to pregnancy and childbirth related deaths declined by one-third between 1990 and 2008. Over this period, deaths among newborns declined from 3.5 to 3.2 million annually. The U.N. Population Fund estimates that doubling current investments to $24.6 billion would reduce the still unacceptably high rates of maternal and neonatal deaths, especially in the developing world.
Family planning lies at the heart of a host of politically contentious and divisive issues surrounding human development. The issue of women’s reproductive rights has acquired immense political potency given the backlash from the religious right in the United States and some orthodox Muslim and Christian countries where issues around family planning get mixed up with abortion. Then, it is also tainted by association with the much discredited ‘population control’ policies and the resort to coercive use of sterilisation at the expense of women’s agency and autonomy. In India and other Asian countries, attempts to enforce the so-called two-child norm to determine family size, against the cultural backdrop of a preference for boys, has already resulted in skewed sex ratios. The Indian government must actively move away from the recourse to incentives and disincentives to influence healthy fertility outcomes and instead promote measures to augment women’s overall well-being and gender equality. In addition to access to appropriate contraception services, a policy framework is needed that would empower women to control pregnancies, and space and limit child-births. The absence of such an environment is said to be the reason why the international community is farthest from reaching targeted reductions in rates of maternal mortality under the Millennium Development Goals.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/contraception-but-no-coercion/article3675453.ece
25,7,2012,Descent of the republic,"Sons and daughters can be forgiven for wanting to emulate successful parents. Abhijit Mukherjee, son of President-elect Pranab Mukherjee, is reportedly keen on contesting from the Jangipur Lok Sabha seat, which was vacated by his father on being elevated to the presidency. To many in the Congress, steeped as it is in a dynastic culture, this yearning seems natural enough. But politics is not a family business for a son to make capital of the goodwill and assets of the father. In a democracy, the right to represent electors should spring from a proven track record of public service or the promise of change and not family lineage. For Abhijit to harbour such a notion diminishes the very republic which his father has just been elected to head. At present a Member of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly from the Nalhati constituency in Birbhum district, the younger Mukherjee is contemplating the switch to Jangipur in Murshidabad solely on the strength of descent. In any case, Jangipur is not his father’s pocket-borough. Whatever his political acumen, Pranab-da was no mass leader, and had to take the Rajya Sabha route to Parliament for a major part of his career. Abhijit, by all accounts, is even more handicapped in this respect.
Of course, in the Congress — and in all other parties barring the Left and, possibly, the BJP — Abhijit’s stated ambitions do not seem out of place. Indeed, the party, perhaps on account of the dynasty ensconced at the very top, has been allowing sons to take the place of their fathers as a matter of unchecked routine. Sachin Pilot, Milind Deora, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Jitin Prasada, and Deepender Singh Hooda, to name a few, have their lineage to thank for getting into Parliament. From other parties, we have Supriya Sule, Agatha Sangma, Dimple Yadav and more. Once in Parliament, of course, these sons, daughters and daughters-in-law do make a mark — some more than others — but so would any competent woman or man in their position. Although he is himself the chief beneficiary of this system of distributing party tickets, Rahul Gandhi did make an attempt to spread the net wider to identify young leaders but he had limited success. Just how pervasive dynasticism is can be seen by the statistics compiled by Patrick French in his book India: A Portrait: 28.6 per cent of Lok Sabha MPs have a hereditary connection as do 100 per cent of MPs under the age of 30. Such unabashed feudalism explains the low public stock of the political class, and the growing disconnect of the youth with the politics of the day. Abhijit is already an MLA, and if he believes he has done whatever he could in that position, he can surely find ways to assist his father on Raisina Hill. But the Lok Sabha is not for him as yet.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/descent-of-the-republic/article3679351.ece
25,7,2012,Romanian gymnastics,"There were times when the country’s gymnasts would routinely hit headlines during the Olympics. May be they will at London as well. But right now, it is Romania’s ruling coalition, the Social Liberal Union (USL), which is hogging the limelight for what is being viewed as power-grabbing calisthenics. The goings-on are proving an embarrassment to the European Union of which Romania is a member. Prime Minister Victor Ponta has used his parliamentary majority to suspend President Traian Bãsescu, alleging that he has failed to live up to the position of neutrality expected of an incumbent of the high office. Mr. Ponta, who is himself facing accusations of having plagiarised portions of his PhD thesis, rewrote the country’s electoral law on impeachment to remove the requirement of at least a 50 per cent turnout. When the constitutional court voided this change, some within the USL sought to replace the judges. Thanks to pressure from the EU, better sense prevailed. As a result, Mr. Bãsescu, who is expected to lose the impeachment vote, may still survive if the turnout at this Sunday’s referendum is low.
If popular discontent over austerity measures is the proximate cause for the tension between the leftist USL government and the rightist President Bãsescu, what has brought the crisis to breaking point is the semi-presidential constitutional system in which executive authority vests with both head of government and head of state. Now that the political turmoil has reached a high pitch, the national currency, the leu, has taken a knock and there are doubts about the promised billion dollar credit line from the EU. A relatively late entrant to the bloc of 27 countries, Romania is already under close monitoring from EU authorities over the tackling of organised crime and child trafficking. Recent developments have now raised more basic concerns about Bucharest’s respect for democratic values, the rule of law and an independent judiciary. The country’s EU scrutiny has been extended further and put paid to any hopes of admission to the Schengen visa-free travel zone. Under pressure from the European Commission, Mr. Ponta has promised to govern in a manner befitting a liberal democracy. But the EU would do well to not settle for mere verbal assurances. The recent developments in Romania are similar in spirit to the authoritarian clamp down on media freedom by Hungary’s right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orbán last year. The consolidation and stability of parliamentary institutions in countries of Eastern Europe is of paramount importance for the bloc as a whole and its future expansion into the Balkans.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/romanian-gymnastics/article3679348.ece
26,7,2012,Assam’s sorrow,"Often enough in much of Assam, all that it takes to set alight the sub-surface nodes of volatility is a mere spark. Now, an ethnic-communal spectre looms over the western parts of the State once again. Confronting each other are violent elements among the Bodos and Muslims. Gang violence that started in Kokrajhar spread to more districts including Chirang, Dhubri and Bongaigaon, claiming some 40 lives. The rioting and torching has triggered an exodus. Over 1,70,000 people belonging to both the affected communities, as well as others, in the four districts have taken shelter in relief camps. The trigger was the firing on two student leaders of the All Bodoland Minority Students’ Union and the All Assam Minority Students’ Union in Kokrajhar. Thereupon, four former Bodo Liberation Tigers cadres were killed; that led to further attacks and counter-attacks. With the Bodos’ nationalistic assertion forming the historical backdrop to the tensions, aggressive elements from the two communities have clashed sporadically. The confrontation has been labelled ‘ethnic,’ but economic and even educational anxieties are as much at work as the desire to preserve socio-cultural and ethnic identities. Insecurities relating to land, forest rights and a shrinking job market have created a combustible mix.
The immediate task is to contain the violence and tackle the serious humanitarian crisis. Those who have had to abandon home and hearth should be enabled to return. Transport links with the rest of the country need to be restored; thousands of passengers remain stranded in railway and bus stations. Talks between the adversary organisations should be quickly facilitated. The administration failed to react quickly after the first signs of trouble on July 19. Considering that there was a build-up of tensions over the past few months, vulnerable areas ought to have been identified and adequate forces deployed. It has been pointed out that in many of the places overrun by violence, the security forces were not visible at all. The deployment of the Army seems to have come too late in the day. The mapping of stress-spots on the basis of adequate intelligence inputs should be a priority at least from now. The long-term goal, obviously, is to re-envision Assam as a place where ascriptive identities do not disrupt civic relationships. The state needs to keep working on achieving the right balance of development activity. The key to this will be restoration of mutual trust. This should be based primarily on systematic measures to address fears over loss of ownership and right to land, and concerns over denial of access to resources, development, and means of livelihood.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/assams-sorrow/article3683327.ece
26,7,2012,Paan Singh Tumour,"The noose is finally tightening around the manufacturers of one of the most potent killer products in the world — chewable tobacco such as gutka and tobacco containing paan masala. A few States — Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Bihar, Maharashtra and Rajasthan — have by the stroke of a pen banned the manufacture, storage, distribution and sale of such products. These substances may soon face the same fate in more States where the process of proscribing them has been initiated. Maharashtra has banned all paan masala brands (immaterial of the presence of tobacco) that contain magnesium carbonate above permissible levels. It is highly commendable that State governments have begun to crack down on this dangerous produce just months after the notification of the Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restriction on Sales) Regulation, 2011. The FSS Act prohibits the presence of tobacco in food products. The industry, which successfully scuttled a ban by many States in 2004, is now in the dock. There is inviolable evidence of harm caused by chewing tobacco. A Lancet study published this year highlighted the scale of the problem in India and made a strong case for reducing the consumption of these substances. In 2010, chewing tobacco was responsible for about 20 per cent of the 120,000 tobacco-related cancer deaths. It killed twice the number of people as lung cancer, and was the leading cause of death in men in both urban and rural areas.
The FSS Act provides the much needed teeth for States to act against food items containing tobacco. Unfortunately, the Act has ignored betel nut (areca nut) — a well known carcinogen found in both gutka and paan masala. That the Union government failed to include it despite a voluminous and indisputable body of evidence clearly pointing out its carcinogenic effect is indeed shocking. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organisation had in a 2008 monograph stated that “areca nut is carcinogenic to humans (Group I).” There is “sufficient evidence” of the carcinogenicity of betel quid [paan] with and without added tobacco, it noted. Even if eaten without added tobacco, paan causes cancers of the oral cavity and oesophagus; a “positive association” has also been found between exposure to betel quid and liver cancer. Hence banning these products based on the presence of betel nut will result in a sharp fall in oral cancer mortality. So what is preventing the Union government from acting? Betel nut is the “second most consumed” carcinogen after tobacco. But unlike tobacco, there is gross and widespread ignorance of its harmful effects. Hence, increasing awareness levels should be given equal priority.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/paan-singh-tumour/article3683330.ece
27,7,2012,Politics of heritage,"Yet again, communal politics has insidiously turned a potentially significant archaeological site into a theatre of violence and vandalism. A complacent government, oblivious to the vulnerability of historical remains in religious zones, failed to prevent it from happening. Early this month, construction of the underground metro rail network in a park in front of the Jama Masjid in Delhi revealed traces of a building and yielded artefacts datable to the Mughal period. Instead of quickly mobilising experts to scientifically evaluate the evidence, assess the archaeological potential of the area and protect the site, the authorities were irresponsibly lax. Vested groups quickly rushed in to capitalise on the situation and claimed that the unravelled structure is a part of the well known, but now lost Akbarabadi Mosque built during the rule of Shahjahan in the 17th century. This claim has to be professionally verified. Whatever be the final conclusion, there is no justification for scheming politicians and self-appointed religious leaders to forcefully occupy the site, construct a ‘mosque’ over it and prevent proper archaeological investigation. In the past, authorities have allowed religious worship in monuments such as Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur without impeding its conservation. But it is possible to do so and limited only to religious structures that are in use. Insisting on offering prayers at newly unearthed historical sites is not permissible and smacks of an agenda that has more to do with land grabbing than God worshipping.
Experiences at Ayodhya and Sidhpur ought to have taught the Indian state that constant vigil and proactive planning are needed to prevent lumpen elements from mindlessly destroying historical structures. Had the lessons been learnt, Delhi could have avoided the recent damage and conflict. As early as 2009, the Delhi Urban Arts Commission reviewing the redevelopment plan for Jama Masjid pointed out that the park in front is a potential archaeological site. It recommended that the open space be excavated before developing the area. The municipal corporation, which owns the property, failed to heed the advice. At least the Archaeological Survey of India, which is headquartered in Delhi, could have assessed the site before the metro rail construction commenced. This too did not happen. The ASI cannot hide behind the excuse that excavations would take time and hurried work would damage potential evidence. It is well aware that less invasive tools such as three-dimensional, multi-offset ground-penetrating radar imaging are available which could safely detect structures below ground without having to dig. It is still not too late. Delhi can quickly adopt Archaeological Prospection to identify its hidden heritage and prepare a comprehensive road map to protect them. As for the ruins at Subhas Park, no quarter must be given to the troublemakers who are hell-bent on destroying what could be a valuable piece of Delhi’s history.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/politics-of-heritage/article3687862.ece
27,7,2012,Ensuring DGCA’s independence,"At long last, the dispute — or “misunderstanding” — between the Civil Aviation Ministry, the Prime Minister's Office and Cabinet Secretariat over the appointment of a new full-time Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) looks like heading towards a solution. The recent, unexplained removal of Bharat Bhushan — an officer respected for his independence and probity — left a bad taste in the mouth, especially since he had been given an extension till December, by when a full-time replacement was supposed to be appointed. Instead, Mr. Bhushan was sent off to the departure gate ahead of schedule and another Civil Aviation official given temporary charge as DGCA. This while the Aviation Ministry noted that the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet was sitting upon a recommendation for the appointment of the next DGCA. The whole controversy acquired an additional dimension because of the persisting turbulence in the civil aviation sector. The sudden shift gave the impression that the government felt it inconvenient to have Mr. Bhushan around at a time when files relating to Kingfisher Airlines were coming up for decision.
With the appointment of Arun Misra, another IAS officer on deputation to the Civil Aviation Ministry, this unseemly episode is likely to come to an end. The office of the DGCA has not exactly covered itself with glory as a regulator or safety board for the aviation sector. In the present environment when the airline industry is passing through a crucial phase, it becomes imperative to have a full-time, qualified DGCA who can function professionally and independently as a regulator. Key decisions on maintenance and safety standards adopted by airlines, operational schedules, airport fees for aircraft as well as passengers are among the key issues decided by the DGCA. Sending civil aviation officials on deputation to function as DGCA has affected the credibility of the institution, that too when critical decisions on the public sector Air India have yet to be taken and implemented. One can only hope that the new DGCA, when he takes charge, will be allowed to function with the maximum degree of professional independence, given the climate of strikes by pilots, non-payment of salaries to airline employees, questions on maintenance of aircraft, and the fluctuations in air fare.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ensuring-dgcas-independence/article3687866.ece
28,7,2012,Blind to reason,"The heavy hand of commerce has dealt a blow to the efforts of blind and disabled people around the world to get reading materials in special formats excluded from copyright restrictions. The United States and the European Union have resisted the move to adopt a legally binding treaty under the World Intellectual Property Organisation, aimed at helping the disabled. Such a treaty would facilitate the creation and international distribution of books for people with visual impairment, or forms of disability that prevent them from reading printed text. Books in Braille, electronic text or audio format could then be produced without copyright restrictions and shipped to millions of disabled individuals around the world, particularly in developing countries. Regrettably, the affluent nations pressed on with their backward looking policy at the 24th session of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights in Geneva. Under the shadow of lobbies, they have avoided a commitment to a binding treaty and postponed any progress to the next meeting of the SCCR. Only after it clears that hurdle can the text be put through the formal procedures of the WIPO for adoption. This is a disappointing negation of the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which call upon state parties to take all measures to provide access to cultural materials in accessible formats.
For nearly 285 million blind and vision impaired individuals in 190 countries, being able to access books in special formats such as Braille and audio books is essential for active participation in the community. India, with a large number of such individuals, has a lot more to do to make actual materials available, but it has taken the progressive step of amending its copyright law to allow special format production for the disabled. It must use its global voice in support of the developing countries, who look forward to an agreed text at the WIPO SCCR. That will pave the way for a diplomatic conference to be held in 2013, and the adoption of the agreement. Unless governments agree to remove copyright as a barrier to the creation of special format materials, visually impaired and disabled people will be prevented from leading rich and satisfying lives. It is shocking that the fear of marginal loss of revenue for publishers should be allowed to come in the way of basic human decency. The European Parliament has already recognised the importance of the proposed WIPO move and endorsed the call for limitations on copyright to help the blind and vision impaired; the EU officials, however, ignored that mandate at Geneva. The U.S. and the EU must stop blocking this path-breaking treaty.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/blind-to-reason/article3693331.ece
28,7,2012,Protectionism by another name,"Even as the global economy is making a slow, uneven recovery, there are indications that the broad agreement among leading countries to co-ordinate their trade and other macroeconomic policies has started fraying at the edges. Much has been expected from mutually supportive trade policies that would enable orderly, coordinated international trade with few fetters. This would not only counter the worst features of the crisis but perhaps help individual countries avoid the kind of mutually destructive protectionist policies that plunged the global economy into a deep depression in the 1930s. The G20 countries — together accounting for 85 per cent of the world’s GDP — have been alive to the potential of orderly trade to lift the sagging global economy. Trade has figured prominently in all G20 summits, including the recent one in Los Cabos. This time, though, while upholding their promise not to protect their own businesses by restricting trade, the group’s leaders decided to extend the pledge through 2014 only after much discussion and acrimony.
That even in better times trade issues have been non-controversial is a myth. Eleven years on, the Doha round of trade talks is going nowhere. The World Trade Organisation, which is overseeing the talks, as well as all its members have pledged unequivocally to embrace multilateralism, which is the only sure safeguard against protectionist tendencies. But in the wake of the Doha round’s failure, countries have rushed to conclude bilateral agreements and regional trade pacts which are only a second best option. The WTO, the European Union and a number of independent think tanks are worried over the steady rise in trade barriers, which come in myriad forms ranging from higher tariffs to costly import licences and customs controls. Some new trade restrictions are subtle, difficult to spot by a watchdog and make an impact indirectly. The U.S. government’s tightening of visa rules for Indian IT professionals and the frequent politically motivated attacks on outsourcing of jobs by American companies to India are a case in point. Recent developments in the U.S. demonstrate that short-term political compulsions will always trump sound economics such as a commitment to free, multilateral trade. Notwithstanding claims to the contrary, some of the new trade barriers will not be dismantled once specific national concerns are met. The other worrying development is that some of these are no longer aimed at combating the temporary effects of the crisis but are meant to stimulate recovery. Long after the current crisis passes, then, the protectionism it is engendering will remain.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/protectionism-by-another-name/article3693334.ece
4,8,2012,RSVP yes,"From about 2005, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has believed it is important for him to visit Pakistan, but linked such a visit to a grand moment in bilateral ties. This is somewhat contradictory for a government that believes progress in this complex and difficult relationship is incremental, and that the process is part of the solution. Moreover, there has never been a time in recent years when the right diplomatic moment for such a visit has coincided with the right political moment in both countries. Available now is an opportunity to break out of this self-inflicted dead end. President Asif Ali Zardari’s invitation to him to visit Pakistan in November this year, and to include his ancestral village Gah in the itinerary so as to be there for the Guru Nanak Jayanti celebrations, is an offer Prime Minister Singh should accept. A prime ministerial visit at a time when India-Pakistan relations are stable will have huge symbolic value and provide political direction to the dialogue process. Pakistan's political establishment feels such a visit is long overdue. Its own leaders have not stood on any formality in their outings to India. In 2011, cricket provided the backdrop for Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani’s visit to Mohali. Four months ago, it was President Asif Ali Zardari’s visit, via a pilgrimage to Ajmer, that provided a new model for high-level bilateral visits. Despite their political and institutional weakness, President Zardari and the PPP government have come off seeming bolder than Prime Minister Singh, despite his grand vision of peace with Pakistan.
This year has seen India and Pakistan taking concrete steps towards improving trade with each other. What is more, India has now opened the door to investments from Pakistan, unthinkable just months ago. Of course, Pakistan’s inability or unwillingness to deal firmly with the culprits behind the Mumbai attacks remains a sore point. This has shown up all the more starkly since India’s arrest of Abu Jundal, a key Indian participant in the attacks. It is for this reason that public opinion on this side of the border remains suspicious of the other side’s intentions — and why Prime Minister Singh remains hesitant about embarking on his dream trip. But staying away would not help produce the desired result either. On the other hand, visiting Pakistan may provide Dr. Singh the right opening to drive home Indian concerns more forcefully. External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna is to visit Islamabad in September to review the dialogue process that began in 2011. That should provide the opportunity for the two sides to work towards ensuring that the Prime Minister does take up the invitation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rsvp-yes/article3723593.ece
4,8,2012,Teaching the basics of finance,"The Reserve Bank of India is certainly not short on ambition with its draft strategy for financial education for consumers. The discussion paper, now thrown open for public comments, recognises the important role financial literacy and financial education play in promoting financial inclusion and inclusive growth. As a first crucial step towards reaching those important national goals, the draft paper discusses ways of creating awareness and educating consumers on access to financial services, availability of various types of products and their features. The strategy makes a strong pitch for conditioning the changing attitudes of consumers so that the knowledge gained through financial education is translated into responsible consumer behaviour. Finally, consumers of financial products need to be made aware of their rights and obligations. The RBI’s approach to financial education is in line with those of many other countries which, especially since the beginning of this century, have realised the full potential of spreading financial literacy through national projects. Given the large number of stakeholders, including the Central and State governments, banks and financial institutions, a coordinated national project rather than piecemeal approaches at different levels will be more beneficial.
Financial inclusion, by itself, is one of the top policy priorities of the government. It is also an essential part of the larger social inclusion agenda. Financial education will help in promoting knowledge and skills which a relatively youthful population needs to avoid the pitfall of reckless spending through, say, the indiscriminate use of credit cards, a habit vigorously promoted by irresponsible marketing schemes. Financial education in that sense is akin to the investor education programmes conducted by the Securities and Exchange Board of India and affiliated investor associations. Such initiatives have not had the impact hoped for. One hopes that the national level financial education programme starting at the primary school level will make up for the shortfalls in the sector specific programmes. Financial education will have a positive, multiplier effect as ordinary citizens get to know the nuances of savings and investment. In turn, there will be a welcome deepening of the financial markets. While the RBI’s draft paper is comprehensive, what is missing is a recognition of the existing skills shortage in the financial sector and the steps to be taken to overcome this basic problem. For the financial sector, the biggest challenge is to train and retain manpower for not only its more traditional functions but also to further highly desirable social goals such as financial education.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/teaching-the-basics-of-finance/article3723637.ece
6,8,2012,Facing up to a drought,"What started as a dismal monsoon has since gone from bad to worse. It reached the subcontinent a few days late and its progress northwards thereafter was anything but vigorous. By the end of June, large swathes of the country had received hardly any rain and the nationwide rainfall deficit soared to 29 per cent. Even at that stage, however, there was a chance that the monsoon could recover and turn into a “below normal” one, a category that the India Meteorological Department (IMD) defines as a season with nationwide rainfall between 90 per cent and 96 per cent of the long-term average. Indeed, the department’s probabilistic forecast issued in late June put the chances of the monsoon ending up in this category at twice the climatological probability (which is based on the outcome of past years). But, in addition, the rainfall record for over a century showed that the monsoon might slip below the 90 per cent mark and end up as a drought. In other words, at the end of June, the odds clearly favoured a monsoon with seasonal rainfall below 96 per cent, with the possibility of a drought. What, one wonders, compelled the IMD to declare in its updated June forecast that the monsoon was “most likely” to be in the “normal” category with rainfall between 96 per cent and 104 per cent?
Poor rains in July have made a recovery improbable and the IMD’s latest forecast shows that the monsoon will most likely end as a drought. Over half the country has still received too little rain. With a substantial part of the country’s agriculture dependent on those rains, the drought has taken a toll on kharif crops such as rice, coarse cereals, pulses and oilseeds. An immediate priority for governments both at the centre and in the States must be to protect livelihoods, especially in rural areas, and prevent food scarcity and soaring prices from taking hold. Fortunately, the government is holding stocks of tens of millions of tonnes of rice and wheat. Strangely, just last month, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved the export of two million tonnes of wheat from its stocks on the grounds of inadequate storage space. Those buffer stocks will now come in handy and must be deployed judiciously. This will be the fourth drought in the space of 11 years and it will not be the last, particularly since the monsoon is in a low rainfall phase. Greater resilience must, therefore, become an integral part of planning for the future and coping with a changing climate. Water will have to be seen as a critical resource for the common good that must be carefully conserved and rationally used by all. It is not going to be easy to make those sorts of changes, but it must be done.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/facing-up-to-a-drought/article3731468.ece
6,8,2012,All in it together,"Big emerging economies like China, India, Brazil and a few others underpinned the global economy during the worst phase of the recent crisis and spearheaded growth in the recovery phase. Their role in picking up the slack has been highlighted by global financial institutions, including the IMF and the World Bank. Well into the recovery, albeit an anaemic one, they continue to be ahead of the developed countries in terms of economic growth. However, there is one big difference. A decade or so of frenetic growth has ended, probably for good. Investors who bet heavily that extraordinary returns from emerging markets were the new normal are having second thoughts. Recent economic news reports are hardly flattering. China posted its lowest growth in three years. India’s recent GDP growth has been the lowest since 2004. Brazil’s economy has virtually stalled. The IMF in a recent publication has cut the growth forecast for three of the four BRIC countries for the current year. Pointing out that the growth slowdown in the emerging markets has been a bit more severe than expected, the IMF revised the forecast for China down from 8.2 to 8 per cent, for India from 6.9 to 6.1 per cent and for Brazil from 3.0 to 2.5 per cent. Low exports and low investment are the proximate causes for the deceleration, although quite obviously there is variation across countries.
The IMF, among others, expects the big emerging economies to have a soft landing, but at lower growth rates. The challenges from now on will be varied and different for each of them. Can India expand at 8 per cent levels while simultaneously taking care of its high fiscal and current account deficits and persistently high inflation? China is planning a shift away from investment-driven growth to a more sustainable one driven by consumption, even if that means a lower GDP growth rate. Brazil, an important commodities exporter, has welcomed the recent depreciation of its currency, the real, quite in contrast to the reactions that have greeted the rupee’s recent fall. Russia will have to reduce its overdependence on oil and gas. While no uniform prescriptions for either the emerging economies or for that matter the developed ones are possible, it is time again to re-emphasise the mutual interdependence of all countries. The festering euro crisis is a global problem and a fair resolution will benefit even countries outside the eurozone. A stronger U.S. economy will stimulate world trade. The financial markets have already discredited the “decoupling” theory, which held that emerging markets can grow independent of negative influences from the West.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/all-in-it-together/article3731469.ece
7,8,2012,America’s gun psychosis,"We may never know what demons haunted Wade Michael Page’s mind in the minutes, hours and days before he entered the Oak Creek gurdwara in Wisconsin, determined to deliver death to those inside it. A former soldier in the United States army, Page has been linked by a civil rights group to white supremacist politics and it is almost certain that Sunday’s massacre was not just a random act of terror but a targeted hate crime as well. One of the oldest Asian communities in North America, the Sikhs faced prejudice and discrimination at the start of the 20th century before finally establishing themselves in different walks of life; in the wake of 9/11, they found themselves targeted by racists who saw in their turbans a resemblance to Osama bin Laden. The sole victim of a hate killing after 9/11 was a Sikh petrol station owner in Mesa, Arizona, and prudence suggests that even though the reason Page chose the gurdwara for his rampage is not yet known, extra security must be provided to Sikh, Muslim and Hindu places of worship across the U.S.
The real lesson from the Oak Creek killings isn’t, however, about the threat to one particular religious community. Even the most hate-filled ideas, after all, cannot kill. The real problem is America’s bizarre relationship with guns. It has long been apparent almost nothing can push the U.S. to clamp down on the criminally-easy access its laws give to guns: not the killings at Oak Creek, not the massacre at the Aurora movie theatre near Denver, not the attempted assassination of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, not the Columbine carnage. Wisconsin last year, actually passed a law making it easier for its residents to obtain firearms. In population-adjusted terms, civilians in some parts of the U.S. are more likely to become the victim of a firearms-related murder than their counterparts in war-torn regions like Iraq or Afghanistan. In 2010, the last year for which figures are available, 16.02 of every 100,000 residents of the District of Columbia were killed in a firearms murder; in Afghanistan, U.N. data shows, the civilian fatality rate was 7.90 per 100,000. The classic right-wing argument is that potential victims need guns to protect themselves. Leaving aside the fact that the statistics falsify this claim, it stands on poor rational legs. In the wake of the Denver massacre, both President Barack Obama and his challenger Mitt Romney showed a remarkable unwillingness to deal with the issue head-on. Their lack of leadership will, tragically, ensure the deaths of thousands of their fellow Americans year after year.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/americas-gun-psychosis/article3735139.ece
7,8,2012,In pursuit of life,"Everything in the seven-minute action-packed entry sequence, starting with the spacecraft hurtling in at over 21,000 km per hour and ending with the six-wheeled robotic rover being lowered by nylon cords to the surface of Mars, went just as planned. Back on the home planet, controllers and mission staff assembled at the famed Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the U.S. jumped up in elation and celebrated when word came through in the form of radio signals that Curiosity, as the rover is called, had indeed landed safely. Soon afterwards, the first grainy picture taken by a camera on the rover came through. The plan is for the car-sized rover to spend the next two years trundling about, looking for indications that Mars could, at least in the past, have supported life. Humans have long been excited by ideas of life that might exist on the neighbouring planet. In the early years of the last century, it was thought that intelligent beings there had constructed a network of irrigation channels. From that, with a bit more imagination, ‘Little Green Men’, who might have designs on Earth, emerged.
But in the years since then, it has become clear that Martians, if they indeed existed, would be microscopic and microbial, rather than the swashbuckling sort found in science fiction. Spacecraft that surveyed Mars from orbit and earlier rovers that wandered its surface have found convincing evidence that although the planet is now dry, liquid water once existed on its surface. Where there is water, there could have been life. Curiosity has been put down in the Gale Crater, which appears to have once held a large body of water. The rover’s instruments will look for more evidence of water and how the environment in the crater changed over time. It will study whether other ingredients needed to support life, such as key chemical elements and sources of energy, were present. If organic molecules are discovered, that might suggest life had existed, assuming that non-biological origins could be ruled out. Perhaps the most exciting possibility is finding unmistakable indications that life in some form still survives somewhere on the planet. India’s Mars mission, which was recently cleared by the Cabinet and is scheduled to be launched at the end of next year, should be able to contribute to such a search by scrutinising the planet’s atmosphere from orbit. There may be methane in the atmosphere, which could have a biological origin. The next logical step in the exploration of Mars will be to bring rock and soil samples back to Earth for detailed analysis. Such an ambitious and costly effort could well be an international one. Only then will the issue of life on that planet be finally settled.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/in-pursuit-of-life/article3735145.ece
8,8,2012,"Winning friends, influencing people","As expected, the election of Hamid Ansari for a second term as the Vice-President was non-controversial and smooth. The surprise, if any, was not in the outcome, but in the political churning that overflowed from the presidential election. After the Bharatiya Janata Party made an overambitious attempt to disrupt Pranab Mukherjee’s bid for the presidency, this was an occasion to recover lost ground. The party sought to first retain its old allies such as the Shiv Sena and the Janata Dal (United), and then win over non-Congress allies such as the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, instead of looking to poach disgruntled elements within the UPA. The less ambitious strategy was not intended to win the election for its candidate, Jaswant Singh, but to keep the National Democratic Alliance united and in fighting mode for the 2014 Lok Sabha election. If there is a lesson to be drawn from the churning and twisting, it is that the BJP needs more allies. The Telugu Desam Party, a one-time ally, is unlikely to come over to the NDA, and even if it did, will not be as useful as it was in 1998 and 1999. The AIADMK, despite having voted for Mr. Singh, will sit on the fence for longer, maybe, even till after the general election, to leverage for itself the best power-sharing deal possible. Similarly, the Biju Janata Dal might not want to return to the NDA in a hurry.
No wonder then that the BJP’s most senior leader, L.K. Advani, has begun talking of the possibility of a non-Congress, non-BJP Prime Minister after 2014. Whether this is intended as bait to bring in more allies, or as philosophical acceptance of harsh realities, the end-result is that the BJP is now shown up as a party desperately seeking partners. The Advani prognosis might actually encourage regional satraps like Chandrababu Naidu of the TDP, Ms. Jayalalithaa of the AIADMK and Naveen Patnaik of the BJD to expect either the Congress or the BJP to support a third alternative from the outside. As Mr. Advani conceded, such formations, which offer little to the two principal parties, would not last long. But that would not stop these smaller players from actively seeking power. For the BJP, the real problem is that Hindutva poster boy Narendra Modi, who is the only one acceptable to its core constituency, is the one leader most unacceptable to prospective alliance partners. The core is too small to propel the BJP to power, and broadbasing of the NDA is impossible without alienating this very core. In any case, neither the Congress nor the BJP can hope to come to power on its own. Who gets to rule in 2014 depends as much on winning alliance partners as on influencing voters.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/winning-friends-influencing-people/article3738929.ece
8,8,2012,Walk the (pep) talk,"On expected lines it may have been but the incoming Finance Minister’s action plan to stimulate the economy and revive the confidence of investors and financial markets ought to be seen as only a starting point. Its broad contours are, without doubt, welcome but the problem lies in the implementation. Some of the objectives are antithetical to one another. Take, for instance, the goal of moderating inflation over the medium term while striving to reduce interest rates almost immediately. So far, the onus has been on the RBI although recently, all evidence points to inflation being driven up by high food prices and other supply side factors over which monetary policy has very little effect. The RBI has often been left to fight the inflation battle singlehandedly and without the support of fiscal policy. As expected, P. Chidambaram has put fiscal consolidation high on the agenda and promised a road map within the next few weeks. Adjustments will be made to both revenue and expenditure while pursuing this goal. More than in any other action point, there is a sense of déjà vu here. No Finance Minister has consciously shunned fiscal consolidation. In fact the Union budget is committed to reining in the Centre’s fiscal deficit at 5.1 per cent of GDP, a figure which, although considered too high by many fiscal purists, was realistic under the circumstances.
Any fiscal consolidation roadmap must naturally address the politically sensitive issues of food and fuel subsidies. It is here that the Finance Minister’s assurance of equitably sharing the burden of consolidation will be closely watched. Always a difficult task, reining in subsidies has become infinitely more difficult in a drought year. Mr. Chidambaram’s proposed review of retrospective amendments to the Income Tax Act and the General Anti-Avoidance Rules have, predictably, been received well by stock market investors. However, it would be premature to conclude that the government has decided to do a U-turn on these, especially given the political damage which may ensue. While his announcements on stimulating exports and manufacturing are unexceptionable, managing expectations will be a huge challenge for Mr. Chidambaram. India’s GDP growth estimates have been slipping, from a highly unrealistic 7.6 per cent claimed in the budget for the current year down to 6.5 per cent by the RBI and even lower according to some international agencies. The official tendency to talk up growth and talk down inflation has been counterproductive. A realistic assessment of economic prospects rather than some exaggerated notions of growth is what is needed today.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/walk-the-pep-talk/article3738931.ece
9,8,2012,Zero loss R.I.P.,"The Union Cabinet’s decision to fix Rs 14,000 crore as the base price for 5 Megahertz of 2G spectrum in the upcoming auctions must surely bring closure to the contentious debate over exactly how much the 2G scam cost the exchequer. For one, it validates the Comptroller and Auditor General’s Rs 1.76 lakh crore upper-end loss calculation and methodology for the 2008 2G spectrum sale. Broken down, the CAG’s figures lead to a Rs 3,350 crore/MHz value for 2G spectrum. Ironically, the same government that had discredited the CAG, splitting hairs between ‘notional’ and ‘presumptive’ loss, has now itself estimated the value of spectrum at Rs 2,800 crore/MHz. Except that this is just the price at which bidding begins. The expectation is that the final bid price will be higher. The Cabinet seal for a high base price, supported by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s rigorous analysis of a near negligible increase in customer tariffs, confirms that spectrum was as valuable in 2008 as it is now. This should effectively silence the claims of Cabinet ministers and even some economists that high spectrum costs would lead to higher tariffs. If tariffs didn’t go up in 2010 after the 3G auctions, they wouldn’t have gone up in 2008, simply because the bid amount is amortized across the 20-year licence period.
Spectrum pricing should be determined by scarcity and consumer tariffs by competition and if that fails, through TRAI intervention. The government has itself established the flimsiness of its excuse that revenue must be foregone in order to subsidise consumer tariffs for spectrum and other natural resources. Another important learning is that institutions must be allowed to do their job free from political pressure. Investigating and estimating losses to the exchequer on account of flaws in policy implementation are very much in the CAG’s domain. Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal’s attempt to discredit the CAG at a press conference in January 2011 by insisting there was “zero loss” from A. Raja’s 2G spectrum sale did as much damage to the credibility of the government as the original audit report. Since the United Progressive Alliance government is reluctant to learn from the CAG — whom it has ridiculed without remorse since November 2010 — or the Supreme Court, whose licence cancellation judgment of 2012 it challenged immediately through three different petitions, it is best that it learn from itself. And the top lesson is this: if due process — including the engagement of an independent regulator and the adoption of a transparent price discovery mechanism — is followed, scams and shame can be avoided.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/zero-loss-rip/article3742967.ece
9,8,2012,Stretching the limits,"How fast can the fastest man in the world run? There is an overpowering compulsion to find an answer ever since Usain Bolt struck the world of 100 metres racing. After a record-breaking 9.69 seconds at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, he went on to better his record the very next year at the World Championship in Berlin with a 9.58 seconds sprint. So in a matter of just one year he sliced the record time from the pre-Beijing 9.72 seconds to 9.58 seconds. But can humans continue to shave off a few milliseconds and set newer records? And what is the defining maximum speed for humans competing in the shortest form of the sprint? Breaking the 10-second barrier was once considered a formidable task until Carl Lewis achieved it way back in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics with a timing of 9.99 seconds in a low altitude condition. The barrier has since lost its significance as several others have accomplished it. That seven of the eight athletes ran well under 10 seconds in the just concluded final in the London Olympics reveals how insignificant that glass barrier is. A December 2008 paper in The Journal of Experimental Biology noted that unlike thoroughbreds and greyhounds, which have already reached their biological speed limit, the outer limit for male sprinters “is only a few per cent greater than that observed to date.” For women, the running speeds for 100 metres “appear to have plateaued during the 1970s.”
How fast humans can run depends on stride length and frequency of strides. At slow-paced running, the contact time of the foot with the ground is long and hence there is sufficient time for the foot to generate larger forces required to increase the stride length. But as the speed increases, the contact time with the ground shrinks and hence the force with which the limb strikes the ground reduces. It is a fact that the foot-ground contact time is less than one-tenth of one second in the case of top-rated sprinters. Beyond a 7 metres per second speed, sprinters “shift” from increasing the stride length to increasing the frequency of strides. It is not clear if the force with which the limb strikes the ground during the fleeting moment of contact has already peaked. A 2010 study found that the ground forces applied when the subjects were hopping at top speed was 30 per cent more than top-speed running, giving hope for improvement. Aside from human physiology, improved nutrition, scientifically advanced and rigorous training, sophisticated accessories, and superior track technology may continue to propel humans into running faster than ever before, even if that improvement is in the order of a couple of milliseconds.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/stretching-the-limits/article3742970.ece
10,8,2012,Much ado about nothing,"In his eagerness to deride the United Progressive Alliance government any which way he could, BJP leader L.K. Advani appears to have been searching the lexicon for new terms and expressions. But “illegitimate” was the wrong word to use for a government legitimately elected by the people. That said, there was really no reason for the Congress Members of Parliament, on cue from party president Sonia Gandhi, to react the way they did in the Lok Sabha. Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde chose this occasion to make his first intervention as Leader of the House. Other Congress MPs were on their feet in protest and Speaker Meira Kumar forced Mr. Advani to withdraw the remark almost under the threat of expunction. The BJP stalwart, sensing he had gone a word too far, tried to make amends by admitting he had made a mistake, and clarifying that what he had in mind was not UPA-II (elected in 2009), but UPA-I after the 2008 vote of confidence, which, according to him, was won by the government only because it spent crores of rupees. In a foretaste of the political battles which lie ahead as the country moves slowly towards the next cycle of State elections and then 2014 itself, the Congress sensed an opportunity and pressed ahead with its advantage. In the House, Ms Gandhi was politically shrewd to recognise that Mr. Advani had made an intemperate remark, while outside Parliament, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with more than a touch of hyperbole, described the remark as “disgraceful and unfortunate.”
If the Congress was overly aggressive, was the BJP leader overly defensive? Or has the veteran fighter of four decades lost his political touch? A few days ago, he annoyed several leaders on his side of the divide by blogging about the dim prospects of the next Prime Minister being from the BJP. In the dock on Wednesday for using the “i” word, Mr. Advani found himself without ammunition. All the adverse moral connotations of “illegitimate” must have been playing on the BJP leader’s mind when he sought to clarify his remark. Besides, for Mr. Advani, the 2009 loss, when he was the prime ministerial candidate of the NDA, must have hurt a lot more than the loss in 2004, when the NDA faced the election under A.B. Vajpayee. Whether this clouded his mind while speaking in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday is difficult to say, but, with his subsequent clarification, the noise over this needless controversy should be laid to rest. Nothing would be farther from the truth than to say that Mr. Advani was questioning the legitimacy of a democratically held, constitutionally validated, general election. Surely, the Congress and the BJP have more serious issues to tackle in Parliament and outside.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/much-ado-about-nothing/article3747054.ece
10,8,2012,The theft of history,"Despite domestic laws and international conventions, the theft and smuggling of illicit antiquities remain unabated. As a result, stolen Indian artefacts surface in antique shops and auction houses across the world on a distressingly regular basis. The recent seizure of artefacts estimated at Rs. 90 crore from a storage facility of an antique dealer in New York by the U.S. customs officials confirms that archaeological sites, religious places and even museums in the country remain as vulnerable as ever. Trade in illicit antiquities inflicts double jeopardy: the illegal removal of objects from their archaeological setting erases critical historical information; and it depletes a nation’s cultural capital. In 2003, the Ministry of Culture announced that it would amend the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act (1972) to make trading in stolen antiquities a non-bailable offence, prevent unauthorised production of replicas of antiquities and enhance the process of verification of art objects. Till date, none of this has happened. Even the database of existing antiquities is incomplete. In 2007, the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquities was launched to create a register of artefacts. After five years, only five lakh objects of the estimated eight lakh have been recorded.
International indifference has not helped either. Import controls are lax in some countries such as Switzerland, making them safe havens for smugglers. Criminal laws in market countries have not deterred buyers and dealers of tainted art objects. For instance, the Dealing in Cultural Objects (Offences) Act 2003, operational in England, Wales & Northern Ireland, provides for sentencing dealers in tainted artefacts to prison, but it has hardly changed the situation. Many museums and collectors conveniently overlook the doubtful provenance of antiquities, making it easier for traders — and themselves — to acquire stolen antiquities. It is imperative that India, working through international organisations such as UNESCO, persuade countries to give up their apathy. But first, it should put its own house in order. Taking a cue from the success story of the Portable Antiquities Scheme, implemented in England and Wales, existing acts must be revised to encourage local communities voluntarily to report and register the discovery of artefacts with the help of experts. Museums have to be vastly improved to host antiquities in a meaningful manner and effectively perform their educative role. Setting up a well equipped, efficiently trained and dedicated investigating agency to track and prevent art theft is also critical. The loot has to be stopped and our precious heritage protected.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-theft-of-history/article3747053.ece
11,8,2012,A salve for Bhopal,"The Supreme Court’s directive to document and monitor the medical treatment being given to the victims of the Bhopal gas disaster should bring significant relief to those who are struggling to cope with its lasting effects. That the court is having to entrust the supervision of medical relief to an Empowered Monitoring Committee is a strong indictment of the Madhya Pradesh government, and the Centre, which by law is the sole representative of the victims for compensatory claims. Far from displaying any anxiety in alleviating the misery of innumerable gas victims, the State government unleashed police repression on them last December during a protest on the anniversary of the disaster. It is therefore heartening that the highest court of the land has struck a blow to protect the fundamental right to life of those affected, under Article 21. Among the key gaps in the delivery of care to the victims is the absence of accurate disease profiles. Now that the Court has laid down the task and the method, the Centre and the MP government should waste no time in doing what is necessary: creating an electronic medical records database for victims, referring them to appropriate specialists, and instituting a sound diagnostic and therapeutic regime that includes provision of free treatments including renal dialysis, and all essential medications.
The comprehensive failure to address the toxic legacy of Bhopal includes the business-as-usual approach of the Centre and the MP government towards disposal of the waste lying at the disaster site. It is now left to the Empowered Monitoring Committee and two other mandated organisations to pursue this critical question, subject, of course, to the final decision of another bench hearing the matter. By several accounts, the chemical is leaching into the ground and contaminating several square km of the surrounding environment. Only last month, the government announced clearance for the waste to be shipped to Germany. That project will now hopefully gather pace and result in a final solution. In its totality, the response of governments to the chronic and painful Bhopal saga raises troubling questions about the failure of representative democracy and the rule of law. The Centre is already on weak ground, having not secured compensation for the victims on a scale that matches the horrendous tragedy. It is also increasingly seen as unwilling to pass on the cost of environmental harm to polluters, blinkered as it is by a narrow vision of what economic growth means. State governments are unfortunately marching lockstep with it. The intervention of the Supreme Court in Bhopal should occasion a review, and the interests of people made central to the development equation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-salve-for-bhopal/article3751189.ece
11,8,2012,Stop playing road rash,"The Centre’s decision to provide seed capital to each State during the Twelfth Plan to start a road safety fund is a positive step. As a populous country with an extensive but mostly broken road network, and high volume vehicle sales, India has been remarkably indifferent to the effects of motorisation: 142,485 people killed and more than half a million injured in 2011. Mortality and injury in absolute terms have been rising over the years, and injury is grossly underreported. The litany of problems confronting road safety is discussed piously in several forums, particularly during annual government-led Road Safety Week events. Yet, when it comes to systemic course correction that will strengthen education, enforcement, engineering and emergency care, our policymakers have been found seriously wanting. The carnage on Indian roads has exacted a heavy toll, and is today a full-blown public health crisis. It would thus be naive to expect a new safety fund alone to bring about dramatic change when there is not much action on fundamentals. But the model that the Centre proposes is promising. The sanctioned fund will, for one thing, be non-lapsable and constantly augmented with 50 per cent of the penalty amounts realised from violators of the Motor Vehicles Act. State governments can spend the money only on area-specific activities approved by Road Safety Councils.
Two years ago, the Centre approved a road safety policy and committed itself to reducing death and disability caused by road accidents. Disappointingly, though, it did not follow up its promise with speedy action. In May this year, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways acknowledged that it had not been able to legislate a National Road Safety and Traffic Management Board, after the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture recommended the withdrawal of a 2010 Bill on the subject because it was not comprehensive enough. Among the issues the panel underscored was the need to eliminate corruption. That challenge remains, and must be met. Equally, a new safety paradigm focussed on the plight of vulnerable road users is needed to help walkers — children and the disabled in particular. Road projects must be approved only when they conform at least to Indian Roads Congress standards for pedestrians. The National Urban Transport Policy 2006 affirmed support for people-centric development, but road building unabashedly favours motorised vehicles even now. By credible estimates, pedestrians and non-motorised transport users suffer the most in India. The new fund can start by working to reverse this trend. That would make the roads safer for walkers and bicycle riders who form the majority of users.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/stop-playing-road-rash/article3751193.ece
13,8,2012,Déjà vu in Mumbai,"Saturday’s arson and vandalism during protests by Muslim groups against the ethnic killings in Assam and Myanmar caught the Mumbai police on the wrong foot, and not for the first time. The violence erupted despite advance intelligence reports and the deployment of an 800-strong police force and is a sad commentary on the state of law and order management in the city. Inflammatory speeches by irresponsible Muslim ‘leaders’ goaded the crowds to go on a rampage, burning media OB vans and vehicles, smashing buses and paralysing South Mumbai for a while. The police itself bore the brunt of the mob’s fury. The manner in which the violence unfolded points to pre-planned disruption and even city police commissioner Arup Patnaik, who made an attempt to pacify the crowds, admitted it was a close call. The media too came under fire and had to run for cover with many photographers and TV crew assaulted. While the madness lasted, a sense of insecurity and terror prevailed in the city with protesters taking over local trains and, for a while, the roads in front of Azad Maidan. For a police force that had reasons to fear the rally might end in violence, the failure to deploy and plan adequately was glaring.
That is not to say that political protests — even those built around the emotional pull of religious solidarity — must not be allowed in the city. In the past too, the roads of Mumbai and the sprawling Azad Maidan have been jammed with Muslim groups demonstrating against the Iraq war and earlier over the Supreme Court's Shah Bano judgment. Despite the overwhelming numbers, the protests were peaceful except during the 1989 rally in Bhendi Bazar against Salman Rushdie’s book, The Satanic Verses, which resulted in nine deaths in police firing. After that, Mumbai witnessed its worst communal carnage in 1992-93 in which hundreds of Muslims lost their lives. In the 20 years after the riots, the city has witnessed many bomb blasts after its first in 1993, the terror strike of 2008 and the serial blasts last year. There is a sense of fear, especially among Muslims, after each bomb blast since they are on the radar of suspicion. The failure of the criminal justice system to punish the instigators and facilitators of the 1992-93 violence also rankles them. This is the emotional terrain that self-styled community leaders and aspiring politicians are quick to cash in on by playing on the insecurities of the Muslim community. Saturday’s violence could well be the result of such mischievous instigation. Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan must now take swift action against these vested interests and prevent the city from turning into a cauldron of hate.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dj-vu-in-mumbai/article3758393.ece
13,8,2012,The craft of graft,"Everything in excess is opposed to nature, Hippocrates famously said. About a century later, Aristotle — who held the ancient Greek physician in enormous regard — developed the theory of the golden mean, positing there was virtue in treading the middle path between two extremes, a way of life that enables people to live according to their nature. Should we give Shivpal Yadav, the beleaguered Uttar Pradesh Minister for Public Works, the benefit of the doubt? When he briefed PWD officials that it was all right for them to “steal a little” but not “loot” or commit “dacoity”, could he have been advancing a subtle moral proposition, a piece of contemporary Aristotelianism? The individualistic and controversy-prone Minister, whose every word was captured on camera, has vociferously maintained he has been quoted out of context. Have we then missed the intricate shades of grey in his complex moral reasoning? Misunderstood him, as many ancient Greek philosophers were, as well as his bold stab at Nicomachean ethics? Should we be persuaded to ignore the leeway he extended for a little stealing and focus rather on his stern injunctions against loot and dacoity, which he claims are backed up by the suspension of 125 officials belonging to the PWD, Cooperative and Irrigation departments on suspicions of graft over the last few months?
On a more serious, but arguably mundane note, Shivpal Yadav is no ordinary politician, being the brother of former Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav and uncle of the incumbent Akilesh Yadav. The Chief Minister has shown no inclination yet to act against his elderly relative, whose sacking has been stridently demanded by the Opposition. As for the Samajwadi Party, it has responded to the controversy in the traditional and time-honoured way — issuing a statement alleging the existence of a conspiracy to malign the government by communal and casteist forces backed by corporate interests. However, the party would do well to remember that it was voted to power in U.P. by an electorate that was palpably fed up with what it perceived as the Mayawati government’s corruption and misgovernance. The image of Mr. Akilesh Yadav’s fledgling government is likely to be dented if it continues to adopt an ostrich-like posture to Mr. Shivpal Yadav’s reckless remarks. While the relationship between the two may be somewhat strained, it does the young Chief Minister no good to be perceived as a man who is unable to act against a family member. In the absence of this, we may be persuaded to believe what we already know — that corruption has eroded the vitals of our democracy and that we could do with a Hippocratic oath for our politicians.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-craft-of-graft/article3758392.ece
14,8,2012,"Time to celebrate, and introspect","India might have been hoping for a double-digit medal tally, but the half-dozen that she ended up with in the London Olympics represents her best ever result on the biggest sporting stage in the world. The fact that the country had won just seven individual medals in the Olympics since Independence should help put the latest achievement in perspective. The absence of a gold medal, in contrast to the Beijing effort, is certainly a dampener and so too the overall slide in the medals ranking from 50 to 55. The consolation, apart from the medals including two silvers, should be in nine other top-eight performances, and the promise held out by several youngsters. For a country with an annual sports budget of just over Rs 721 crore, where bureaucrats and sports administrators test the endurance of athletes even before they qualify for the Olympics, the London show should be considered encouraging even if it failed to live up to the hype created by over-ambitious official agencies and fanned by the media. The Indian medal winners — Gagan Narang, Vijay Kumar, Saina Nehwal, Mary Kom, Yogeshwar Dutt and Sushil Kumar — deserve all the accolades, including substantial cash awards that have been announced. The setbacks in boxing, attributed mainly to unfair judging, and the failure of the archers were factors that pulled India down. That the country plunged to an all-time low in hockey is a matter of shame and no time should be lost by the government in overhauling the faction-ridden administration or in preparing a blueprint for the grassroots-level development of the game.
Not unexpectedly, China had to make room at the top for the United States to regain its position in the medals tally with a total of 104, six less than last time, but with a gold count of 46, ten more than in Beijing. China’s gold collection came down from 51 to 38 while Britain exceeded a host country's expectations by taking 29 gold medals in a total of 65. Despite gloomy forecasts, and a whopping bill of $14 billion in hosting the Games, London pulled it off with great credit. Praise should go to organising committee chairman Sebastian Coe, a great middle distance runner of his era, for a job well done. Going into the pages of history, among many other breathtaking feats and world records were U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps’s all-time record Olympic medal haul of 22 and Usain Bolt’s unmatched brilliance in the sprints where he completed a back-to-back sweep of three gold medals to claim a legendary status for himself. Achievements like these allow people around the world to go beyond a narrow attachment to flag and nation for at least a brief while. Which is what the spirit of the Olympics is all about.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/time-to-celebrate-and-introspect/article3765395.ece
14,8,2012,A question of autonomy,"Public sector banks that continue to occupy a pivotal position in the Indian financial sector have reasons to be upset over recent circulars of the Union Finance Ministry which, they say, are an attack on their autonomy. The banks’ specific allegation is that over the past year, the government has been trying to “micro-manage” them by issuing as many as 36 directives setting new rules as well as reiterating existing ones. All of these, it is claimed, impinge on their freedom to take independent decisions even in areas that are considered very basic. The reform of the financial sector in the 1990s hinged on a fundamental compact: new private players were to be let in but an effort would also be made to ensure that the PSBs were equipped to take on the resultant competition. One of the important measures in that regard was the conferment of autonomy on public sector banks so that they could take commercial decisions independent of the government, which remains their largest shareholder. The extent of such autonomy has varied from bank to bank but in all cases it was hoped that the government would respect their autonomous status. The advent of new shareholders has further strengthened the case for autonomy.
The arrangement between banks and the government is tilted towards the latter. It calls for very seasoned bureaucrats to draw a line between exercising rights that arise out of majority ownership and those that are regulatory in nature. Obviously it would be desirable if the government sticks to policy making and allows banks the freedom to take decisions in an increasingly competitive environment. Reserve Bank governor D. Subbarao and his predecessor, Y.V. Reddy, have come out on the side of the banks. Micro-management is bad for banks and, in the long run, hurts the interests of the major shareholder, the government too. Of course, minority shareholders suffer the most and in these days of shareholder activism the government should not risk antagonising them. As Dr. Reddy has argued, the government should demonstrate exemplary corporate governance by exercising its ownership rights through its nominees on the boards of banks. The developments in the banking sector have a bearing on the government’s dealings with top-notch public sector enterprises. In their case, autonomy has been sanctified by signing MOUs, the conferment of navratna/maharatna status and so on, which basically expand the administrative and financial powers delegated to them. So, not just banks but a much larger constituency would be interested to know how the new Finance Minister intends to find a way out of this entirely avoidable area of friction.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-question-of-autonomy/article3765396.ece
15,8,2012,Outsourcing vote-catching,"Their cause was always clear: fighting corruption. And now their target too is in focus: the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre. As the 2014 general election draws near, the movement of civil society groups against corruption is turning into an electoral battle. When Team Anna announced its intention to enter practical politics and challenge all hitherto existing parties, the campaign for a Lokpal to eliminate corruption was effectively scaled up to a fight for political power. Not to be left behind, Baba Ramdev, whose original agenda was the repatriation of black money, began another agitation in New Delhi and declared an “all-out war” on the Congress. The Bharatiya Janata Party, far from leading the fight against the Congress, has lined up behind the yoga guru, seeking his approval in the guise of offering support. Indeed, among those hanging on to the Baba’s angavastram are some parties not exactly known for their commitment to probity in public life. Even the BJP, whose leader L.K. Advani was among the first to make the case for repatriation of black money at every available public forum, is tailing the Baba on this issue now. All of this despite growing evidence that popular support for Anna and Ramdev is nowhere near what it was earlier. Clearly, the BJP is low on confidence and is looking for every available crutch in the run-up to the general election. Unable to convert the public disaffection with the ruling establishment to its own advantage, and conscious of the limited purchase the Ram Mandir and Hindutva planks can offer, the BJP seems ready to court Ramdev for whatever he is worth. But this is a risky strategy. Although the sangh parivar did mobilise numbers for Ramdev’s agitation, if and when the flag-waving movement snowballs into a major political protest, the BJP might not be the one in control.
With Team Anna and Baba Ramdev going political, the Congress might feel vindicated in having stopped engaging the civil society groups in the drafting of an effective Lokpal Bill. But it would be suicidal to dismiss the growing public disenchantment with the corruption-laden governance system as politically-inspired from beginning to end. In the absence of a counter-strategy, and meaningful steps on the ground to reassure voters that corruption is being tackled effectively, the UPA could well turn into a lightning rod for public anger. But although corruption is a serious issue with great public resonance, there is no saying how it would play out in an election. With the BJP and its allies yielding the opposition space to sundry outfits, and many claimants for the leadership role in the campaign against corruption, all those votes cast in anger might not fall any one way.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/outsourcing-votecatching/article3772113.ece
15,8,2012,Pride and prejudice,"Faster, Higher, Stronger may be the Olympic motto, but when 16-year-old Chinese Ye Shiwen improved her personal best by 5.36 seconds and broke the women’s 400-metre individual medley world record, there was no all round applause. Instead, some western swimming experts and commentators suspected she had used performance-enhancing drugs to help her pull off a stunning performance. The reason — she swam the last split faster than the first three, and in the last stretch of 50 metres she was faster than Ryan Lochte, the American gold medallist in the men’s 400-metre individual medley event. Many Chinese swimmers may have tested positive for doping in the past few years, but in her case the needle of suspicion refused to go away despite the post-race drug test returning negative. Ironically, not all breathtaking and unexpected wins aroused the same suspicion. Take the case of Ruta Meilutyte who won the gold medal in the 100 metres breaststroke. She is a 15-year-old schoolgirl from Plymouth, England, representing Lithuania, who came into the contest ranked 14th in the world. In contrast to Ye, “it is doubtful if any of [the other swimmers] had ever heard of her before this week,” a commentator in the Daily Telegraph noted. But “she has become one of the unexpected stars of the Olympics.” British newspapers heaped praise on her performance, but not a word on doping.
If the stark double standard displayed by the western media is not surprising, it is disturbing that Nature, one of the most reputed and respected popular science journals, also joined the chorus. The original subtitle of a news item it carried — “‘Performance profiling’ could help catch sports cheats” — which was later changed, along with Ye’s picture, was a clear give away of the intent. The story set out to “examine how science can help resolve debates over extraordinary performances.” But, much like the newspapers, it made a simplistic and scientifically invalid way of comparing the performance of the two athletes in just the last 50 metres of the race. It had cherry-picked the data, showed brazen disregard to the scientifically correct way of analysing the data, and ignored other vital details. For instance, other male swimmers too had clocked a faster speed than Lochte in that stretch of the race. As Lai Jiang from the University of Pennsylvania commented in the journal, failing to mention that Lochte was faster than Ye by 23.25 seconds overall is mischievous as it misleads the readers. Nature’s editor regretted the “absence of a more detailed discussion of the statistics,” but the regret came a week too late.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pride-and-prejudice/article3772117.ece
16,8,2012,Arrest the slippage,"If economic concerns trumped security issues in the Prime Minister’s Independence Day speech, this is because the past few weeks and months have not been kind to the macro economy or its planners. On August 9, the global rating agency, Moody’s, revised downwards its estimate of India’s growth to 5.5 per cent during the current year. That is a level many investment banks and financial institutions — Citi, Crisil, CLSA, among others, had estimated even earlier. Another agency, Fitch Ratings, which recently lowered India’s credit outlook to negative, has said there is a good chance it might be forced to downgrade the country’s sovereign rating in the next 12 to 24 months. Among official agencies, the Reserve Bank of India, in its July 31 policy statement, had trimmed its GDP forecast to 6.5 per cent from 7 per cent earlier. At the same time, the central bank had warned of many downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation — factors that might well drag India’s economic growth even lower. In the last quarter of 2011-12, the GDP growth rate was a measly 5.3 per cent. The most recent data showed factory output declining sharply by 1.8 per cent in June, driven by a slump in manufacturing. The Index of Industrial Production declined by 0.1 per cent during the April-June quarter.
Despite growing much more slowly than before, some have claimed that India can still boast of being among the fastest growing economies in the world today. Though valid in a narrow sense, such statements miss the point that the Indian economy has been slipping badly and is weighed down by structural factors. In his speech, the Prime Minister underlined the need to grow faster in the interests of national security. India’s economic woes are exacerbated by a combination of domestic and global factors operating in tandem. The continuing fall in export volumes — in July they contracted by nearly 15 per cent from a year ago — and the firming of global oil prices are not good news in the context of a large current account deficit. The very large dependence on short-term capital flows to bridge the CAD points to danger ahead. The rating downgrades will increase risk aversion on the part of overseas investors in India and make external borrowing by the Indian corporate sector costly. Inflation for July has been lower but this good news must be tempered by the fact that the full impact of the insufficient monsoons has not yet been fully factored in. Dr. Singh’s assertion that the economy can grow even faster than the 6.5 per cent clocked last year will sound more credible if it is backed by a robust action plan.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/arrest-the-slippage/article3776200.ece
16,8,2012,Second flush in Darjeeling,"The Gorkhaland Territorial Administration is finally in place, a little more than a year after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee took the initiative and got the GTA agreement signed. It marks the fulfilment of one of her key electoral promises in the face of some scepticism over whether it was a feasible target. The GTA, with Bimal Gurung of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha as its chief executive, has even got from the Central government Rs. 200 crore at the outset for development activity. Logically speaking, the Darjeeling region should now be able to put behind it the period of turmoil. But it has to be seen how far, and for how long, the GJM would be able to resist any pressures to bring back the pitch for ‘Gorkhaland.’ The sagacity and maturity that the GJM is able to muster is what will decide the developmental future of the region, which faces a multitude of woes. These include power and water shortages, inadequate infrastructure development and lack of employment avenues. These are some of the sectors in which the Subhas Ghising-led Gorkha National Liberation Front let down the region during its 23-year-long reign from 1988. The GNLF used divisive slogans as leveraging points to strike bargains for itself — and was finally hoist with its own petard. It is to be hoped that under the GJM, the autonomous administrative body would not go down the same slippery path. If the GJM is still secretly nursing the dream of a separate state, and is only keeping the demand on the backburner until it is politically opportune to revive it, that will be bad news.
The territorial delineation of the GTA remains to be fixed, and the question of bringing the tribal areas within its jurisdiction hangs fire. A majority of residents in Siliguri and parts of the Dooars and Terai regions on the plains of north Bengal have not come to terms with moves to attach them to the GTA. As the Fact-Verification Committee appointed by the State government to review the recommendations of the Shyamal Sen Committee works its way through this tricky thicket, it needs to be ensured that more feathers are not ruffled than have been smoothened out. “We’re happy that finally Darjeeling is going to have a direction to peace and development,” said Ms Banerjee at the August 4 function where GTA members took their oath. For a region that has suffered from neglect and is poor in infrastructure despite its enormous potential, enlightened administration is essential. All stakeholders — including the political parties and the West Bengal and Central governments — must ensure that the people of the Darjeeling hills are not cheated out of their right to development.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/second-flush-in-darjeeling/article3776201.ece
17,8,2012,The enemy lies within,"The attack on Pakistan’s Kamra air force base, for which the Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility, is one more sign — as if more were still required — that the country’s enemy lurks within its boundaries. Militants wearing air force uniforms infiltrated the base that is rumoured to house a part of Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal, in a manner reminiscent of the May 2011 raid at PNS Mehran, and at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi two years earlier. Armed with RPGs and automatic rifles, and wearing suicide vests, they damaged one aircraft at the base and killed at least one air man. Though the militants were eventually eliminated, the question Pakistan should be asking is why no lessons were learnt from the earlier attacks. Only two days ago, in an address at the Kakul Military Academy on Pakistan’s Independence Day, Army chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani said the country needs to fight terrorism and militancy for its own sake. But it is unclear how far the military has addressed the spread of radicalism within its ranks, or if it even sees this as a problem. After the PNS Mehran incident, a journalist who wrote that militants had developed extensive links within the Navy paid with his life; the Pakistani media openly blamed the country’s Inter-Services Intelligence for the killing. In the latest instance too, the attackers seemed to have insider knowledge of the sprawling air base located at Attock in the Punjab province. A Pakistani newspaper had only a few days ago warned that the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan was planning a raid on a PAF base, giving August 16 as a possible date, but even with such specific information, the military was caught unawares.
While General Kayani’s remarks and a much-speculated upon military operation in North Waziristan cannot be ruled out as triggers for the attack, the problem really lies with how the Pakistani state continues to see some militants as useful to strategic regional objectives, with others to be tolerated so long as they do not undermine Pakistani interests. The differentiation between “good” and “bad”’ militancy has led to such deep-rooted confusion that it is no longer clear to anyone what those interests are. Otherwise, let alone the Laskhar-e-Taiba that targets India, why should a state and its political class tolerate a group like the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, that kills with impunity citizens of a particular religious denomination? Addressing the roots of extremism, militancy and terrorism will need nothing less than an overhaul of the ideological drivers of the Pakistani state — the reliance on an exclusivist reading of Islam, the negation of provincial aspirations by a Punjab-centric establishment, the domination of the military — but the country is clearly not yet ready for this.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-enemy-lies-within/article3781086.ece
17,8,2012,Don’t take the wrong pill,"The Planning Commission must not make the mistake of letting short-term fiscal concerns overturn the national aspiration for Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Some elements of the draft Twelfth Plan on health have caused alarm, as they run counter to key recommendations of the Commission’s own High Level Expert Group. The Plan panel wants to reduce out-of-pocket spending on health from 71 per cent to 50 per cent during the Plan period, to mitigate the biggest factor that leads to impoverishment of many families. But that will be impossible without substantial fiscal support. Regrettably, there appears to be a quiet attempt to peg targeted public spending on health at 1.58 per cent of GDP, ignoring the HLEG recommendation for an increase to 2.5 per cent over five years, and to 3 per cent by 2022. Among comparable nations, India brings up the rear in public spending on health at 1.2 per cent of GDP. It is now crucial for the Centre and the States to come together and launch a UHC model funded by general taxation that meets the essential health requirements of all people. The success of legal reform in the United States to regulate a socially disconnected, for-profit health industry, and the remarkable equity achieved by other welfare-oriented countries should persuade Indian leaders on launching a national plan.
At the polio summit in February, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh emphasised the need to strengthen public health systems, and accelerate efforts to achieve universal access to care. It would defeat this idea if UHC were to rely on for-profit providers of care and insurance under a ‘managed care’ model. The Planning Commission would do well to steer away from the siren songs of corporatisation, and focus on the core challenge: the need to set up an independent regulatory framework at the national and State level for all types of care institutions, regulate drugs to lower costs and promote generics, identify standard treatment and management guidelines, and provide resources to fund the essential health package. It is of course encouraging that the Commission has distanced itself from reports of reliance on corporate providers, but it is essential to state the vision clearly in the Plan. Also worth pointing out is the potential of UHC to create a large number of jobs and spur economic growth. India needs many more professionals to achieve the ideal norm of one doctor for 1,000 people, and three nurses and midwives per doctor. Here, the HLEG provides a useful roadmap for expansion of teaching institutions, which can quickly raise the capacity of many remote hospitals.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dont-take-the-wrong-pill/article3781087.ece
18,8,2012,Please come back,"Howsoever intangible the source or origin of rumours, their effect on normal, everyday life can be devastatingly real. As students and workers from Assam and other north-eastern States flee south Indian cities fearing ethnically-targeted violence, India’s tenuous social fabric is once again under severe strain. Mysterious calls and text messages about impending attacks in retaliation for the violence against Muslims in Assam have spread panic among people from the northeast working or studying in south Indian cities. Apart from a handful of minor incidents in Bangalore, there was no violence on the ground there or in any south Indian city that saw thousands of people from the northeast quit jobs and leave their studies midway to return home. That rumours could set off such panic speaks to the sense of insecurity that the young migrants lived under. While people from the northeast had no difficulty in getting jobs and gaining admission to educational institutions in the south, they have discovered that their distinctive physical features always marked them out as outsiders. They filled a gap in the market economy, but found no social acceptance beyond their immediate environment. A few months ago, Richard Loitam, a student from Manipur, died under mysterious circumstances after he was assaulted by college mates over a trivial issue. Well before the current crisis, his death caught the headlines and unsettled migrants from the northeast in cosmopolitan Bangalore.
For all the technical means at their disposal, the authorities concerned do not appear to have expended much energy in trying to trace the source of this sinister rumour-mongering. Many of the SMSs circulating contain fabricated information about attacks by Muslims on people from the northeast, including killings, suggesting there are unknown individuals and groups out there actively trying to create panic and drive a wedge between these two minority groups. The intelligence agencies must spare no effort to identify these elements. Reassurances of security aside, what the panic-stricken people need are immediate, evident steps on the ground that enhance security and ensure peace. Over the long-term, ‘mainland’ India needs to be more welcoming toward its fellow-citizens from the northeast. Discrimination and harassment at the workplace and at educational institutions can breed deep insecurity, which could then, at the slightest trigger, lead to panic situations. There should be zero-tolerance of prejudice against ethnic or other minorities. This is the assurance with which every effort must be made to bring all those who have fled in the last 72 hours back to their homes, jobs and studies in the south.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/please-come-back/article3785888.ece
18,8,2012,Raising the bar,"Since it alters the entire mechanism for investigating allegations of misbehaviour against members of the higher judiciary and simplifies the procedure for their removal, the Judicial Standards and Accountability Bill is a hugely significant piece of legislation. The proposed law, which seeks to replace the outmoded Judges Inquiry Act 1968, under which cumbersome impeachment trials are necessary to dismiss erring judges, lays down enforceable norms for their conduct and enables a wider range of disciplinary action for proven misbehaviour. Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia’s cautionary advice that the independence of the judiciary must not be trampled upon by the process of making judges more accountable deserves serious examination. On the one hand, there is no doubt about the need for an alternative and more effective statutory framework to address complaints against judges, which have increased vastly in recent years. It was the comfort of knowing how difficult the impeachment process was that led to the unabashed show of defiance by Chief Justice P.D. Dinakaran of the Sikkim High Court and Justice Soumitra Sen of the Calcutta High Court, who clung to office until it became certain they would be forced out.
On the other, it is imperative, as Justice Kapadia has suggested, that any new law maintains a sensitive balance between holding judges accountable and preserving the independence of the judiciary. It is no secret that some provisions of the Judicial Standards and Accountability Bill, passed by the Lok Sabha in March this year, have caused consternation not only within the higher judiciary but also among legal scholars and professionals. For instance, the so-called gag clause, which prevented judges from making “unwarranted” oral observations against constitutional authorities, has raised judicial hackles — and quite rightly so. Questions have been raised about the propriety, indeed constitutionality, of having non-judicial members in the Oversight Committee, which deals with complaints about judges. There have been doubts raised about the effectiveness of Scrutiny Panels, which vet and filter out frivolous complaints, peopled by members of the same court as the one complained about. From all appearances, the Centre, which has kick-started a process of consulting various stakeholders, is showing an open mind about bringing an amended version. But it must also show the necessary resolve to see that minor objections don’t hold up the passage of an improved version of the Bill. It would be a pity if this Bill goes the way of its anti-corruption cousin, the Lokpal Bill, which is all but mothballed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/raising-the-bar/article3785890.ece
20,8,2012,A watchdog that bites,"One of the first principles that students of auditing are taught is that auditors are watchdogs and not bloodhounds. The Manmohan Singh government would have us believe, in the wake of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India’s reports first in the 2G case and now in the coal mining issue, that this basic principle is being violated by the incumbent CAG. Why should the CAG comment on the adequacy or otherwise of government processes, Ministers ask. Isn’t this overreach? The reason these concerns are misplaced is that unlike private companies that have internal auditors who keep an eye on systems and processes, the government has none. And given the blatant rent-seeking behaviour of politicians who are de facto custodians of the country’s natural resources, be it spectrum or coal, the CAG has the responsibility of playing whistle-blower. Yes, the mind-blowing numbers it has come up with in the 2G case and now in the coal mine allocation issue as loss suffered by the exchequer are only presumptive. But the reserve price the Union Cabinet itself fixed recently for the sale of spectrum has validated the logic underlying the CAG’s numbers. Far from being pilloried, the CAG’s auditors deserve to be congratulated for their professionalism and integrity.
It is clear from the reports that we need a fair and objective system for allocation of scarce natural resources that will also generate optimal value for the exchequer. The auction method, already mandated by the Supreme Court in its 2G judgment for allocation, has also been incorporated into the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act. This is a fair method provided the auction process is well designed and transparent. There are those, including some policymakers, who objected to the method when the Supreme Court recommended it. But the fact is that when a valuable resource is scarce, those in authority invariably attempt to extract a rent from it by virtue of their control over its allocation. Auctions are the best way to neutralise this danger. The three CAG reports that were tabled in the Rajya Sabha on Friday are bound to raise a storm especially because the Coal Ministry was under the Prime Minister’s direct control when some of the allocations were made. A large part of the sting may have been taken out given that the coal findings were leaked a few months ago but the fact is that the report ensures corruption will continue to remain at the top of political discourse in the weeks and months ahead. As their skills are put to the test inside and outside Parliament, the government’s crisis managers should resist the temptation to shoot the watchdog. Any attempt to do so will only backfire on them.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-watchdog-that-bites/article3796000.ece
20,8,2012,Choosing Privatiser Ryan,"The Republican nominee for the 2012 United States presidential election, Mitt Romney, has caused a splash by choosing as his running mate Paul Ryan, one of Wisconsin’s eight members of the House of Representatives. Mr. Ryan, a professional politician aged 42 is serving his seventh two-year term in the House; he had already interned there before winning election to the chamber. Mr. Romney has chosen Mr. Ryan despite his own stated preference for politicians to have prior private-sector experience — he once proposed a constitutional amendment which would have required that — but the selection is clear testimony to his nominee’s standing in the Republican Party, particularly among fellow party members in the House. Mr. Ryan has gained a reputation as a hard-right ideologue and the author of a budget plan which would involve substantial tax cuts for the very rich; he apparently intends that the lost revenues will be compensated by deep cuts in public spending and the abolition of current tax breaks for the middle classes.
Mr. Ryan will almost certainly have an impact on voters in November. A devout Catholic, he is likely to attract conservative Christians who may be suspicious of Mr. Romney for his committed Mormonism, and he is also likely to unite the rest of the Republican right behind the party’s presidential nominee. Secondly, his federal experience — he chairs the House Budget Committee — will add weight to the ticket. Thirdly, his anti-government ideology will fill what even some Republican supporters call a Romney policy void. Above all, Mr. Ryan is a clever operator; in 2002, he managed to get draft federal legislation altered so that his state, Wisconsin, would have lower targets for the law requiring states to get people off benefits and back into work. In addition, he avoids specifying what his budget cuts would mean for ordinary voters; for example, his plan to introduce vouchers for the senior citizens’ Medicare scheme will reduce the vouchers’ value as treatment costs rise. So the Romney-Ryan campaign is likely to rely on attacking Barack Obama, for example over his Affordable Health Care Act, despite its similarity to the health care laws Mr. Romney himself got passed in Massachusetts. Yet attacks alone will probably not be enough to win the White House. Mr. Ryan may help unite the Republicans, but Mr. Romney is already saying he will write his own budget, and the Democrats are attacking the implications of the Ryan plan. Media attention will be no substitute for serious policy, and Mr. Ryan’s ideological simplicities may well prove hard to defend in the public glare of the campaign.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/choosing-privatiser-ryan/article3796001.ece
21,8,2012,Packaging punch,"Indian policymakers should take a long hard look at the recent decision of Australia’s high court upholding landmark legislation passed by Canberra last year to introduce plain packaging of cigarettes. The verdict sends a strong message — public health concerns are supreme and override intellectual property rights and trademark devaluation. In fact, the World Health Organisation recommends plain packaging for effective tobacco control, and Australia has complied with it in letter and spirit. Under the country’s plain packaging laws, large text warnings and shocking pictures of the diseases and conditions caused by smoking must cover 75 per cent of the face of cigarette packages and 90 per cent of the back from December 1, 2012. More importantly, the packages cannot carry brand logos and colourful designs; even the brand name and variant will be in a standard size, font and colour in an olive green strip at the bottom. The ruling has in effect allowed the country to turn the very purpose of cigarette packaging on its head. Cigarette packets will cease to be a marketing tool for reinforcing brand image and promoting smoking as a status symbol. Instead, they will become effective vehicles for spreading public health messages and dissuading consumption at no cost to the government. The verdict will go down in history as a game changer by choking an industry that is responsible for the mortality and morbidity of millions of people every year for the last several decades. The case has been closely followed by Britain, Norway, New Zealand, Uruguay and Canada, which are planning to come up with similar legislation. The European Commission is planning to make legislative proposals to introduce plain packaging across Europe.
Using stringent rules to reduce tobacco consumption is nothing new for Australia. Cigarette advertising in television and radio was banned as early as 1976; a similar ban for the print media followed in 1989. The ban on smoking at workplaces came into effect in 1986, followed by a ban in 2000 on smoking in public places. Pictorial warnings were introduced in 2006, and since 2010 cigarettes are required to be kept out of sight at retail outlets. Starting 1978, the price of cigarettes has been increasing steadily; currently a pack of 25 cigarettes costs 16 Australian dollars. There are many lessons that India should learn from Australia. To begin with, India should introduce larger and shocking pictorial warnings on cigarette and bidi packets, and chewing tobacco sachets and reverse its retrograde decision of changing the warnings only once every two years. According to The Lancet, the number of tobacco users in India is 275 million. How long can the government continue to abdicate its responsibility?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/packaging-punch/article3800090.ece
21,8,2012,Tackling hunger’s ecosystem,"With much of the world facing the twin threats of poor harvest and high food prices due to severe droughts and deficit rainfall, the hunger summit at the end of the London Olympics did not come a day soon. For a country reeling under the worst recession and crippling austerity in its post-war history, Britain’s stance on Overseas Development Assistance must seem paradoxical at home and perhaps even paternalistic. But the picture looks rather different for people in Sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of South Asia. Here, it is one of promises of international aid that largely remain on paper and politicians and policymakers who refuse to learn from past mistakes. Many European countries have cut back on aid under the weight of austerity, whereas Britain is on course to fulfil its commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of gross national income on ODA. The global development community, while criticising the stringent conditionalities linked to aid, has broadly welcomed Britain’s initiatives at the vaccines summit in 2011 and the family planning summit in June. The momentum on some of these important issues of human wellbeing is expected to create a platform for Britain’s presidency of the G8 countries next year.
Hunger summit co-hosts Britain and Brazil zeroed in on a priority befitting the sporting season. They have agreed a target to achieve reductions in stunted development due to malnourishment by 17 million by the time of the 2016 games. Given its importance on a range of health indicators, besides the adverse impact on children’s intellectual development and learning outcomes, the wider significance of tackling chronic malnutrition cannot be overstated. But then, its causal links to the spikes in the prices of cereals, pulses and meat, themselves connected to distortions in the cultivation of crops and commodity speculation, cannot also be overlooked. Thus, tackling malnutrition or any other impediment to basic health depends on the adoption of a more comprehensive approach to the many dimensions of the global food crisis. They include combating climate change, the search for renewable energy and giving a fresh impetus to agriculture. The terrible social and political upheavals caused in more than 20 countries during the 2007-2008 manifestations of the global crisis and subsequent episodes hold important lessons. First, a fire-fighting attitude towards food crises will only see the world stumble from one crisis to the next. The other is that the lack of a concerted and long-term effort will push nations to adopt beggar-thy-neighbour policies that further aggravate the overall situation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tackling-hungers-ecosystem/article3800091.ece
22,8,2012,Winning the mind game,"A country with over 900 million mobile phone subscribers across different social strata eminently fits the description of a network society, in which information can be both created and transmitted instantaneously. In normal times, such an enviable user base keeps the cash registers of corporates ringing with call minutes, Internet access and countless SMS texts. But that apple cart can be upset when the power of the networks surprises the elites in unexpected ways. For, as the sociologist Manuel Castells argues, by producing mass media messages and developing horizontal networks of communication, citizens of the Information Age are able to invent new programmes for their lives based on their sufferings, fears, dreams and hopes. They achieve that using the same channels that make governments nervous, but businesses prosperous. That is the essence of the crisis: false text messages, real fears and eroded governmental credibility provoked thousands of people from the northeast to flee the dynamic cities that gave them jobs and hope of a better life, back to the safety of their homes in distant places. Managing a challenge of this sort requires an approach that addresses the new citizen power of autonomous communication. Using a kill switch to cut access can only fuel public resentment.
Evidently, governments have much to do to restore confidence in their systems and processes. It is no secret that to the average citizen, the credibility of the political class as a whole is dangerously low. The corruption of institutions of governance has alienated millions. The insecurity is made worse by the climate of intolerance and bigotry that is asserting itself in the public space. All this provides fertile ground for the kind of mischief witnessed recently, in the form of distorted pictures, baseless threats and fictional reports of violence being used to cause an exodus of people. The speed with which messages flowed in the digital realm was obviously too much to handle for a government that has an antiquated vision of power enforced mainly through physical means. It must respond to the new reality in two ways — use the same power of the networks to tell the real story and ensure reform on the ground by building trust in institutions starting with the police. Social media present some examples of such confidence building by government departments, although they are quickly and publicly exposed by citizens when they err. Choking off SMS gateways may offer a reprieve, but they must inevitably reopen, and will then be available for the next big scare. Influencing the public mind with the correct messages and dispelling the atmosphere of fear are the more effective antidotes to such crises.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/winning-the-mind-game/article3804288.ece
22,8,2012,Giving the markets a regulatory boost,"A slew of measures announced by the capital market regulator SEBI on August 16 will, it is claimed, help in achieving certain salutary objectives such as imparting greater transparency in the primary market process, ensuring higher allotment to retail investors and improving the reach of IPOs. SEBI also announced steps to “re-energise” the mutual funds industry, which has recently been languishing for lack of regulatory clarity in certain cases and an inadequate remuneration structure. The success of both these sets of measures will ultimately depend on how well they impact favourably on the capital market edifice as a whole, comprising the regulator, stock exchanges, market intermediaries and investors. In that sense, like nearly all previous changes in the regulatory rules that have been announced from time to time, the recent ones are incremental in nature, valid at a given point in time, but subject to review as the environment changes. SEBI itself has conceded that point in its approach to small investors. While the new rules seek to confer benefits to small investors — a minimum amount of shares and wider access to IPOs — SEBI has hardly been consistent in this area. As recently as in January this year, two new methods for increasing minimum public shareholding of companies — the Institutional Placement programme and the Offer for Sale of Shares through the stock exchanges — favour large investors over small ones.
For many reasons the small investor’s sense of alienation in the IPO process will remain. But that is not to say that the new changes are unwelcome or ineffectual. The minimum application size has been raised and this will enable investors to get more shares. By throwing open the existing brokers’ terminals at more than 1000 centres to IPOs, SEBI is welcoming more retail investors. The parallel moves to alter the mutual fund rules by incentivising the distributors, encouraging investments from small towns, and rationalising service tax are justified as they seek to address specific lacunae. But the strongest case for encouraging mutual funds rests on the ground that they are a time-tested and globally validated method for channelling retail investment to the stock markets. The SEBI chairman is on strong ground in seeking to extend the Rajiv Gandhi Equity Scheme, proposed in the last budget, to mutual fund investments. Looking beyond these measures, the mutual fund industry needs to be more transparent and less formal, so as to attract retail investment from small towns. As always consumer education is the key.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/giving-the-markets-a-regulatory-boost/article3804290.ece
23,8,2012,Avoiding a minefield,"The Bharatiya Janata Party has played true to form in immobilising Parliament over its demand that the Prime Minister resign in the wake of the Comptroller and Auditor-General’s adverse report on the allocation of coal blocks. It is a behaviour pattern witnessed ever since the BJP moved to the Opposition benches following its shock defeat in the 2004 general election. Rather than use the platform provided by Parliament to grill and expose the government on its failings, the party has revelled in obstructionist theatrics, leading to the unfortunate impression that the principal Opposition is dodging a debate either because it is not well-armed with facts, or worse, because it has something to hide regarding its own conduct. The BJP’s case is that since Coalgate happened partly under Manmohan Singh’s watch, he must resign owning moral responsibility for the scam. Fair enough. But in that case, the BJP ought to have grabbed the UPA government’s offer to hold a discussion on the issue. Joining the argument would have achieved many things for the party: it would have forced the government to explain why and how it came to preside over what has come to be seen as the biggest scam to date. It would have showcased the BJP’s abundant debating talent. And it would have shown that its unsavoury past actions notwithstanding, the party can and will uphold Parliament's best practices and traditions.
Indeed, on the rare occasion that they have taken the floor, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley have turned in sterling performances, skewering the government for the world at large to see. Could the BJP be avoiding a discussion on Coalgate because the audit story has turned out to be equally unflattering to itself? As the CAG’s report records, two BJP State governments of the time, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, had opposed competitive bidding in coal block allocation. In response to a 2005 letter from the Union Coal Ministry, Chhattisgarh’s Chief Secretary had argued that bidding of coal blocks would make steel projects unviable. For her part, Vasundhara Raje, who was Rajasthan Chief Minister at the time, had taken cover under federalism, projecting bidding as Central interference in the State’s autonomy and decision-making powers. The BJP’s problem is that for every finger it points at its opponent, it has three pointing back at itself. It cannot start a crusade against corruption without questions being raised about the liberties it offered to the mining mafia in Karnataka. Were it not for these fatal chinks in the Opposition’s armour, the Congress would have been on the mat by now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/avoiding-a-minefield/article3808402.ece
23,8,2012,Indian cricket’s tricky transition,"Indian cricket has entered a critical period with the retirements of V.V.S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid. History shows us that teams struggle with restoration after the departure of a great generation. Dravid and Laxman were, together with Anil Kumble, Sachin Tendulkar, Zaheer Khan, Virender Sehwag, and Sourav Ganguly, the nucleus of a side that ascended to the top of Test cricket. That era ended with the eight defeats in England and Australia, and Dravid and Laxman have made space for renewal in the Indian middle-order. It’s crucial the next generation isn’t condemned by comparison, for these were two of the finest in setting up and winning Test matches. This generation is vulnerable to both the short and the moving ball. How would they not be when they hardly experience such things growing up? Bowling, cricket’s only act of creation, shapes the batting that counters it. India’s bowling, domestically, hasn’t improved in the 2000s, the period of incubation for the current batting generation. Nor have the pitches helped. Matting wickets, which sharpen back-foot play in young batsmen, aren’t as prevalent. A vast majority of the turf wickets are batting beauties; others, often in matches of consequence, underdone turners. Neither enables the maturation of all-round batsmen.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India appears to have addressed this with the increased frequency of ‘A’ tours. But the pitches at home demand greater attention. There must be a range of surfaces that preserve the contest between bat and ball. Just as important is the balance between formats: there is a very real danger that the Indian Premier League, because it’s so lucrative, will weaken a player’s loyalty to longer duration cricket. Virat Kohli is a case study of the many problems a young Indian batsman has to overcome. First, the IPL’s good life very nearly claimed him. Then, after he had committed his entire being to becoming a top-class batsman, the pressure of expectation and the fear of failure affected him in the first two Tests in Australia. Kohli managed a spectacular turnaround because he focused on his preparation in the lengthy period between the second and third Test: the work he did was as important as the change of focus from result to process. It helped greatly that the team management backed him. This is exactly what’s needed as Cheteshwar Pujara, Suresh Raina, and S. Badrinath join Kohli in building around Tendulkar, who won’t be around forever. It will be a difficult, tricky period. Unless the board and the team are in it together, patiently tackling the problems at every level, aiming only at improvement, greatness will prove elusive.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/indian-crickets-tricky-transition/article3808401.ece
24,8,2012,"Wanted, a law for refugees","It is a common failure to obscure the distinction between refugees — those forced to flee their countries and unable to return for fear of persecution — and migrants, who leave in the hope of a better life. Refugees are victims of challenging social circumstances such as civil war, violence and discrimination over which they have no control, and the importance of a uniform and humanitarian policy towards them cannot be overstated. The recent plight of Hindu and Sikh refugees from Pakistan and the Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar are sad reminders that India — despite being a signatory to a slew of international conventions on human rights, some of which implicitly endorse the principle of non-refoulement — does not have a specific statute dealing with refugees. As a result, refugees are covered by the omnibus Foreigners Act 1946, an archaic piece of legislation that governs the stay and exit of non-nationals as a homogenous category. A 2004 amendment introduced by the erstwhile National Democratic Alliance government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee prescribes stiff imprisonment for any foreigner who enters without valid papers or who overstays his or her visa. As a result, the very Hindu refugees from Pakistan for whom the Bharatiya Janata Party’s heart now rightly bleeds are liable under the law to arrest and eventual deportation.
In the absence of enlightened, rational policy, ad hocism prevails. Some classes of refugees — for example, Tibetans and Sri Lankan Tamils — have historically fared better than others. Security considerations, heightened by the presence of extremist groups in some neighbouring countries, are often cited to argue against the desirability of a refugee law. But this is something of a red herring. All laws relating to refugees involve a thorough scrutiny of the evidence provided by the asylum seeker, with additional corroborative safeguards, as a part of the determination process. But since there is no refugee law in India, there is no process and no clear standards for the lakhs of de facto refugees whose presence the Indian state tolerates but whose status it will not formalise. A few years ago, former Chief Justice P.N. Bhagwati drew up a ‘model law’ for India. Although this became the basis for a draft bill by the Centre, there has been no concerted effort to see this through thanks to a lack of political will. Given its pre-eminence in South Asia, and the fact that it shelters a large refugee population, India should show the way by acceding to the 1951 Refugee Convention and enacting a refugee law that is humanitarian, equitable and consistent with its international obligations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/wanted-a-law-for-refugees/article3812816.ece
24,8,2012,Soldiers and suicides,"Suicides in the 1.1 million-strong Indian Army have come down marginally in recent years. From an all-time high of 129 in 2006, they dipped to 102 in 2011. But until July 31 this year, 62 Indian soldiers have taken their lives. Every such incident will remain a cause for concern. The suicide of a soldier at an Army unit in Samba in Jammu and Kashmir led to a round of tensions involving officers and soldiers this month. The case of an Army man who spent five days atop a mobile phone tower in the heart of Delhi to highlight his grievances — he threatened to jump but was somehow brought down safely this week — seemed to epitomise the crisis. Incidents of ‘fragging,’ or the fratricidal killing of fellow soldiers or superiors, also continue. It is clear that measures that were put in place by the armed forces after a study done by the Defence Institute of Psychological Research to identify stress-points are not efficacious enough. Some senior officers have contended that more than the physical and mental strain that extended deployment in counter-insurgency roles exerts, domestic, family and financial problems account for much of the distress. Defence Minister A.K. Antony, who is known to have taken a personal interest in the issue, has written to Chief Ministers to make the administration more responsive to the grievances and complaints of serving soldiers and their families. The Ministry of Defence appointed more psychological counsellors at the unit level, introduced yoga sessions and also issued guidelines to liberalise leave-granting practices. But more needs to be done. The armed forces have to introspect on how far the issue of the quality of its leadership at multiple levels may be involved here.
It is cold comfort that in India, suicide rates in the armed forces are less than those of the general population. The argument that in affluent countries such as the United States, military suicide rates have been rising at an alarming rate does not help the debate either. While the U.S. military reported 301 cases of suicide through 2011, this year the rate seems set to reach one a day. In fact, in the U.S. armed forces, suicide as a cause of death has overtaken combat deaths and motor vehicle accident deaths. At the end of the day, it all boils down to the question of the general morale of a force. Suicide is a tough enemy, but one that can be beaten with the right measures. At the force level, individuals need to be aided to improve their resilience and helped to cope with what life throws at them. The military, it seems, also needs to battle some demons within.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/soldiers-and-suicides/article3812811.ece
25,8,2012,Beyond the reprieve,"There are crimes, and there are mistakes. There is criminal conspiracy, and there is political mismanagement. But no matter what courts say, there is always a political price to pay for poor governance. Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram deservedly obtained a reprieve from the Supreme Court in the case filed by Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy seeking to make him an accused in the 2G spectrum case, but the United Progressive Alliance government can have no great cause for cheer on this issue. Irrespective of how the case relating to the underselling of valuable spectrum turns out, the UPA still has a lot to answer for. The national exchequer suffered a huge loss on account of the manner in which it allowed spectrum to be sold in 2008 by A. Raja, who was Communications Minister at the time. The scam was made possible by two decisions: foregoing an auction and then cherry-picking the lucky allottees. The first element flowed from naïveté, inertia or devious intent and led to a revenue loss; the second from a criminal conspiracy and led to private gain for individual players. This element is the subject of a criminal trial. But the first is subject to political judgment. And the jury will have its say in 2014.
In trying to force the premature delivery of that political judgment through a poorly argued judicial operation, the Opposition has not only given Mr. Chidambaram the satisfaction of obtaining a personal reprieve from the Supreme Court but has also allowed the UPA government to proclaim a wider and wholly unwarranted innocence. In his petition, Dr. Swamy was, in effect, seeking to implicate Mr. Chidambaram for having discussed spectrum pricing with Mr. Raja. If the petition were to have been allowed, all those who are party to policy decisions in which revenue is foregone would have had to be held jointly and individually culpable for any losses despite the absence of criminal intent. This would have disastrous consequences for decision-making at the highest levels. By Dr. Swamy’s logic, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh too could have been arraigned in the 2G case because he too went along with the decision to forego an auction. It is a different matter that Dr. Singh and his Cabinet colleagues have shown themselves to be poor custodians of public funds. They have also learned nothing from the 2G fiasco. The coal is still in the ground so where is the question of a loss, its ministers said on Friday while rubbishing the CAG’s latest report on preferential coal allotments. If the logic sounds familiar, this is because it is something a hoarder of grain might say when he is caught with a bursting godown. “I’m innocent! Look, I haven’t sold a single bushel yet”.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/beyond-the-reprieve/article3817238.ece
25,8,2012,Tweets and twits,"The orders issued by the Ministry of Communication and IT to block more than 300 items on the Internet, including Twitter handles, Facebook pages, YouTube videos, blogposts, pages of certain websites, and in some cases entire websites, tell a revealing story of a government that has simply not applied its mind to the issue of how to deal with hate speech, both cyber and traditional. There can be no argument against taking down material that can incite violence, and some of the targeted content rightly needed to be blocked. But this should have been done transparently, with judicial oversight. In the present case, it is not clear what laws have been invoked to block the items specified in the four orders issued from August 18 to 21. Certainly, the orders themselves do not make reference to any law. As pointed out by the Centre for Internet and Society (http://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/analysing-blocked-sites-riots-communalism), if the government had acted under the Information Technology Act, the host servers of the affected sites should have been notified and given 48 hours to respond under the IT Rules of 2009; and if it used the emergency provision in the Rules, which are themselves opaque, the orders should have come up before an ‘examination of request’ committee within 48 hours. Another serious problem is that the orders do not mention the duration of the blocks.
Especially disturbing is the decision to block the Twitter handles of right-wing agitators and one pro-Hindutva journalist. Bad taste, warped logic and chauvinist comment do not, by themselves, add up to hate speech or criminal incitement. If an individual is really spreading hate through speech, print or the Internet, let the government proceed against him or her under the Indian Penal Code — where the courts will have the final word — rather than indulging in censorship that is pre-emptive and arbitrary. And mindless too: among the sites blocked is an anti-hate page on a Pakistani website which was one of the first to expose how fake photographs had been used to whip up Islamist passion on the Rakhine clashes in Myanmar. A London School of Economics- Guardian study of the 2011 London riots documents how Twitter was used extensively in a positive way, to organise community clean-up operations after the riots. On the other hand, their analysis of 2.5 million tweets showed, the response to messages inciting riots was ‘overwhelmingly negative’. The lesson from this is that it is possible to counter hate on social media through the same platform. This is really what the government should be doing, instead of the Sisyphean task of trying to block noxious content that will always find other ways of bubbling to the surface.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tweets-and-twits/article3817241.ece
27,8,2012,The way forward in the Assange case,"Britain’s threats against Quito for granting asylum to Julian Assange and Stockholm’s refusal to guarantee he will not eventually be rendered to the United States have overshadowed the debate over the WikiLeaks founder’s decision to seek refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London as a means of avoiding extradition to Sweden. Mr. Assange contends the British order for him to be questioned in Sweden over allegations of rape and sexual molestation is a political move to facilitate his extradition to the U.S. over WikiLeaks’s publication in 2010 of some 251,000 U.S. official documents. That act of leaking — many of the documents were also published in The Hindu as part of this newspaper’s partnership with WikiLeaks — made a significant contribution to public interest in India and other countries and greatly embarrassed Washington and its allies, as well as business corporations. At first sight, Mr. Assange’s fears seem misplaced. As signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights, neither Britain nor Sweden can extradite a suspect to a country where he could face the death penalty or “inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,” something Bradley Manning is already undergoing in the U.S. for his alleged involvement in the leaks.
Nevertheless, there are grounds to believe there is more to this case than meets the eye. The Swedish government can override court extradition orders (though not court refusals of such), but it refuses to respond to Ecuador’s request for assurances that it will not extradite Mr. Assange to the U.S. Secondly, in Sweden, charges are not laid until just before prosecution, but Stockholm, in contrast to its own previous practice, has rejected Ecuador’s invitation to question Mr. Assange at the London embassy. Thirdly, U.K. foreign minister William Hague hinted darkly and unwisely about revoking the embassy’s diplomatic status, though London has since assured Quito it has no intention of breaching the inviolability of the premises. It has also emerged that a British counterterrorism unit has been covertly involved in policing the embassy perimeter and in plans for arresting Mr. Assange if he leaves the premises. The onus is on Britain as host nation to find a diplomatic way out. The criminal case against Mr. Assange must be heard and the women who allege they suffered at his hands are entitled to a thorough investigation of their charges. A simple solution is already at hand. As Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa told the Guardian, “if Mr Assange goes to Sweden to face Swedish justice, as is his will and as is our will, he should receive a guarantee that he will not be extradited to a third country.” These are wise words. It costs nothing for London and Stockholm to act on them.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-way-forward-in-the-assange-case/article3824877.ece
27,8,2012,One step forward,"Myanmar has crossed an important milestone in its gradual and calibrated moves towards democracy. Last week, the government announced the abolition of pre-publication censorship. This means that for the first time in the half century since the military seized power, editors are exempt from submitting material to the Press Scrutiny and Registrations Department for approval before printing. After the decision to release democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest in 2010, this is the most far-reaching reform that the Thein Sein government has undertaken in a system that still remains heavily dominated by the military and its interests. Myanmar is way down the list in press freedom rankings. It has had the reputation for jailing journalists on the charge of threatening national peace whenever it sensed the slightest challenge to its authority. But in the past two years, alongside other reforms, the government had begun visibly to relax its iron grip on the media, allowing coverage of previously taboo topics such as Ms Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy. Last week, the government postponed the formation of a press council after journalists protested that it was a censor in disguise. Since June 2011, more than 200 publications covering sports, the economy, health, science and technology and other non-political subjects had already been exempted from censorship, and restrictions were also removed on thousands of internet sites, including YouTube. Now, all publications have been exempted.
Does this mean the Myanmar media is now free to report on the anti-Rohingya violence in Rakhine without fear or favour? Unfortunately, the answer is no. The government has not yet done away with the 1962 Printers and Publishers Registration Act, imposed soon after the Ne Win coup. Though 38 directives and 20 instructions in the Act have been revoked, journalists will have to abide by the remaining 13 directives and six instructions. Among the subjects that remain on the sensitive list are corruption in the Army, and foreign policy. The government recently warned against reportage of the communal clashes in Rakhine. In blacking out the events, Myanmar may have contributed to the misinformation that is reverberating right across the region, with some negative consequences for India. This, alongside its stubborn position that the Rohingyas are not its citizens, and the absence of a credible democratic voice from Myanmar on the events in Rakhine — Ms Suu Kyi has yet to make a proper statement — have regrettably taken some of the shine off Myanmar’s otherwise praiseworthy political reforms.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/one-step-forward/article3824851.ece
28,8,2012,Tread carefully,"The Central government’s decision to amend the Constitution to provide for reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in promotions in government service is a welcome move, though it is fraught with risks if implemented without careful thought and adequate groundwork. The SCs and STs are grossly under-represented in the upper echelons of government — as indeed they are in upper management elsewhere — and every effort must be made to undo this injustice brought about by centuries-old practices of social discrimination. However, this issue was before a constitution bench of the Supreme Court in 2006, which ruled that the state had to “collect quantifiable data showing backwardness of the class and inadequacy of representation of that class in public employment” before providing for reservation in promotions. Thus, even now, there is no bar on reservation in promotions. In the 2006 judgment on the extent to which reservation is permissible, the constitution bench had noted that the ceiling of 50 per cent, a concept of creamy layer and the statement of compelling reasons (backwardness, inadequacy of representation and overall administrative efficiency) were all constitutional requirements “without which the structure of equality of opportunity in Article 16 would collapse.” Any amendment then would have to frontally deal with Article 16 providing for equality of opportunity in matters of public employment. Otherwise, the legislation might fail before a challenge in the Supreme Court, and would come across as little more than a political ploy to win the support of the weaker sections.
Earlier, on the question of reservation for Muslims in Andhra Pradesh, the failure to back up the move with concrete data on backwardness and inadequacy of representation led to the effort being thrown out by the courts. The Union government must not repeat this mistake. Nor should it ignore complications like the sharp narrowing of the pyramid from the level of joint secretary upwards in the Indian Administrative Service. This is where actual data on the under-representation of SCs and STs in senior posts is essential. On the other hand, any quota for promotions should not end up becoming a ceiling for deserving SC and ST officers. There are no simple solutions, but if the government is sincere about making its offices truly representative, all obstacles can be overcome. However, if the government produces a hastily drafted amendment with the sole intention of political posturing, the entire effort would be struck down by the courts.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tread-carefully/article3828640.ece
28,8,2012,An uncharacteristic surrender,"The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) has branded Lance Armstrong a dope cheat and banned him for life. It has also stripped him of the record seven Tour de France titles he won on the trot from 1999 to 2005. It is a crushing blow to the iconic American cyclist, his legion of fans around the globe and the sport itself. Armstrong represents not just athletic endurance; his is an inspirational story of a man who fought back from testicular cancer in 1996 to excel at arguably the toughest sporting event in the world. The Tour de France, mostly run in France in 21 stages over 23 days over 3200km, had been likened to running a few marathons a week for nearly three weeks at a stretch. Armstrong’s success not only made the Tour hugely popular in the U.S. but also provided the much-needed image boost to a sport that had long been tainted by drug abuse. From 1996 onwards the Tour had often been plagued by doping allegations and disqualifications. Even as Armstrong had evoked admiration and awe among athletes, a question mark always remained about his feats. If anything, those suspicions grew through anecdotal evidence during the past decade, culminating in the denouement that the USADA has decreed, a year after his retirement.
Armstrong has expectedly dismissed the USADA’s charges, saying he had passed hundreds of dope controls in his long career. He has refused to subject himself to an independent hearing process, stating that he could not expect a fair trial in a one-sided “witch hunt”. For a man who epitomises courage and who has survived a Federal investigation, the latest ‘surrender’ is not just uncharacteristic, it virtually amounts to an acceptance of guilt. For many who admire him for the hope he has provided to cancer patients not just by raising millions through his foundation but through his indomitable spirit, he will continue to be a hero. For many others, he might already have become yet another fallen idol like Ben Johnson or Marion Jones. The argument that there is no scientific evidence against him but only the testimony of more than a dozen witnesses including his former team-mates might sound significant. But given the charges framed against him including trafficking in banned substances, the life ban may well stand further scrutiny. What is still contentious is the verdict of the USADA to take away all his seven Tour titles. The International cycling federation, which almost sided with Armstrong in his petition in a U.S. Federal court that was eventually thrown out, is not pleased. The rules stipulate that there can be no sanction for offences committed outside the eight-year time-frame dictated by the statute of limitations in the anti-doping Code. We haven’t heard the last on l’affaire Armstrong.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-uncharacteristic-surrender/article3828642.ece
29,8,2012,Waiting for winter,"When the monsoon session ends, can the winter session be far behind? This seems to be the operating principle of the United Progressive Alliance government as it seeks to weather the storm created by the Bharatiya Janata Party in Parliament over the damning report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the allocation of coal blocks. Of course, there is no way the UPA could have conceded the Opposition demand for the resignation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on this issue. But one of the ways for the government to break the logjam would have been to offer to cancel all the coal block allotments and introduce competitive bidding as originally envisioned in 2004. However, from the defence mounted by the Prime Minister — who held the Coal portfolio during the period of allocation — to the combative stance of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, everything points to the government preparing to keep the fight on the political plane. Instead of addressing the growing public perception of corruption in the wake of the CAG report, the Congress seems bent on discrediting the principal Opposition party. The reasoning is that the BJP, whose Chief Ministers in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh opposed competitive bidding, does not have the credibility for a sustained offensive on this issue, and will soon run out of breath. Other than seeking to clarify the points made in the CAG report through the Prime Minister’s statement in Parliament, the Congress is not willing to make any concession to the Opposition.
The government strategy to hold the ground until winter sets in is neither politically prudent nor morally defensible. If one were to accept Finance Minister P. Chidambaram’s argument that there was no loss in the allocation of coal blocks as the coal has not been “taken out of mother earth,” then surely the proper course would be to ensure that the companies which benefited from the discretionary allocation of the blocks are not allowed to profit from the coal that still remains unmined. The problem, of course, is that the government’s defence of the allocation is varied, full of holes, and contradictory. Apart from blaming Opposition-ruled States for the non-introduction of competitive bidding, the Prime Minister has disputed the computation of loss by the CAG, and pointed to the possible earnings for the government through taxation of the gains of the private parties. Thus, one defence of the government is that there is no loss because the coal is not mined; another is that the loss is partly offset by taxation of the mined coal. If only the government were ready to own up past mistakes, it would not have seemed so hurried in the defence of its policies, and so clumsy in its attacks on the Opposition.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/waiting-for-winter/article3832688.ece
29,8,2012,Let’s start at home,"Energy inefficient buildings impose a heavy burden on power supply. They inflate and skew urban energy requirements and contribute to the electricity crisis. Two recent reports published by UN-Habitat send a clear message to complacent Indian policymakers: energy saving solutions are imperative to sustain urban growth and the best place to begin is the building sector since it offers maximum potential for reduction and accounts for 40 per cent of worldwide energy use. In India, of the 7,02,144 GWh electricity annually consumed (IEA 2009), residences use about 20 per cent. Much of this could be easily reduced. Unintelligent design, poor choice of building materials and inefficient appliances have increased power consumption and thus demand. Large swathes of glass and aluminium, which have respectively 3.5 and 30 times more embodied energy than bricks, increase solar gain and consequently the cooling load of the buildings. Excessive concrete pavement combined with poor landscaping of cities has contributed to the creation of heat islands. This not only causes more climatic discomfort, but also adds to cooling-related electrical consumption. Poor fenestration designs have failed to take advantage of daylight and most of the artificial lighting solutions remain energy intensive.
By adopting green practices, buildings can reduce 29 per cent of their total energy consumption in a decade. For instance, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) has shown that a shaded roof and sensitively designed windows have the potential of annually saving 10 to 15 per cent of energy in air-conditioned buildings. Every unit of electricity saved, when factored by transmission loss, would amount to substantial monetary gain, and would cumulatively reduce energy supply investment. What has the Indian government done to take advantage of green building practices? In 2007, the Energy Conservation Building Code, meant to reduce energy consumption by about 1.7 billion units of electricity a year, was launched. Even after five years, this code remains a recommendatory provision and does not bind many buildings. Neither is it integrated with the National Building Code. State governments fare no better. City level regulations have ignored the energy performance of buildings. They are more concerned about the economics of real estate. It is time to make energy audits for large buildings mandatory and dovetail energy codes into local regulations. This is not difficult to achieve. TERI has demonstrated how to integrate green codes with the building byelaws of Bangalore city. What is required is will and wisdom.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lets-start-at-home/article3832693.ece
30,8,2012,A stunning verdict,"The conviction by a Gujarat court of BJP legislator Maya Kodnani and Bajrang Dal leader Babu Bajrangi along with 30 others for their role in the Naroda Patia massacre is the strongest judicial affirmation yet that large-scale communal violence is almost always a product of pre-meditated political planning and calculation. An estimated 95 Muslims, many of them hapless women and children, were hacked to death in Naroda, a minority neighbourhood in Ahmedabad targeted by armed mobs under the indulgent gaze of the Gujarat government in the wake of the February 27, 2002 Godhra train carnage. The verdict is a landmark one. It is for the first time that an Indian court has convicted a sitting MLA — Ms Kodnani was also a minister in the Narendra Modi government from 2007 to 2009 — for mob aggression against members of a religious community. Secondly, the court has not only upheld the charge of criminal conspiracy against the 32 individuals convicted, it has also found one of them guilty of rape and sexual harassment.
The establishment of conspiracy augurs well for the future of communal violence prosecutions, where the judicial trend so far has been to uphold murder but not conspiracy. It is a victory particularly for the Special Investigation Team that was brought into the picture by the Supreme Court following the failure of the State police to properly prosecute the post-Godhra riots cases. For the families of the Naroda victims, who identified the aggressors braving threats and intimidation and who were able to come forward to some extent because of the protection offered by the apex court, there cannot be a greater vindication than the trial court finding evidence of rape and molestation. It has been their plaintive cry that the violence was orchestrated and targeted against women, who were subjected to gang rape and worse before being slaughtered. Violence against women is a pattern established over and over in anti-minority pogroms, and the judgment has done yeoman service in foregrounding this fact. Needless to say, the conviction is a huge setback to the Gujarat Chief Minister personally. The fact that Ms Kodnani led the Naroda killings was common knowledge, yet Mr. Modi made her a minister, even putting her in charge of ‘women and child development’ as if to thumb his nose at the victims. A bigger worry for Mr. Modi ought to be the establishment of conspiracy. The Chief Minister has maintained all along that the “riots” were a spontaneous act by crowds enraged by Godhra. It stretches credulity that Ms Kodnani could enter into a conspiracy with her co-accused without the government getting a whiff of the group’s criminal intentions and conduct, before, during and after the killing.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-stunning-verdict/article3836698.ece
30,8,2012,A sure recipe for disaster,"The sceptics have been right, after all. By pulling away the shroud of secrecy and opaqueness that has been built into the system ever since the Atomic Energy Regulatory Body (AERB) was formed in 1983, the Comptroller and Auditor General has for the first time exposed several major inadequacies and shortcomings of the nuclear regulator. Despite the passage of three decades, the AERB is yet to prepare a radiation safety policy. The operator — Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) — has not put in place a decommissioning plan for any of the power plants, including the 10 plants that have come up after the regulator issued the safety manual. The reason — the manual is only advisory in nature. The regulator is toothless in demanding the district/State authorities take “corrective measures” in off-site emergency preparedness in the zone extending up to a 16 km radius from nuclear plants. The report also highlights the well-known, inherent weakness of AERB’s legal status — the regulator lacks the “independent power” of a statutory body by virtue of “not being created by any specific legislation.” This despite the recommendation of the Meckoni Committee way back in 1981 that the nuclear regulator be created as a statutory body. In effect, even today the AERB’s head continues to “report” to an official of an “organisation whose very activities [he or she] regulates.”
The AERB is also in the dark in matters concerning the number of radiation sources used in medical and non-medical institutions in the country. A mammoth check across the nation was carried out in the mid-1990s and an inventory of more than 30,000 units prepared. But, sadly, the inventory has not been updated. Even today, there is no effective accounting system in place despite the frantic efforts that began following the Mayapuri incident in New Delhi in 2010, where a gamma source was disposed in a callous manner resulting in the death of one person. Regulating these institutions and ensuring safe disposal will never become possible till such time the inventory is updated. “About 91 per cent of medical X-ray facilities operating in the country have no registration,” the CAG report states. If policing the small diagnostic centres and nursing homes mushrooming all over the country is difficult, can the problem not be solved by targeting manufacturers and vendors? A two-pronged effort is required to clear the mess. The AERB has to work in mission mode on several fronts to set its house in order. On its part, the government must expedite the passage of the Nuclear Safety Regulatory Authority Bill, which has already been vetted by a parliamentary committee.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-sure-recipe-for-disaster/article3836701.ece
31,8,2012,The medium as messenger,"The Supreme Court’s blunt rebuke of television channels which went into a careless and competitive feeding frenzy while covering the Mumbai 26/11 terror attack is almost entirely justified. However, its concluding remark that “the mainstream electronic media has done much harm to the argument that any regulatory mechanism … must come only from within” is misplaced. First, the reprimand. There is no doubt that the live coverage of 26/11 set a low in TV journalism with the most basic of norms — objectivity, verification, dispassion — making way for a heated, overzealous and inconsiderate jumble of words and images as channels fought each other to ‘break news’ and gather eyeballs. Worse, there is evidence that at times the frenzied coverage risked the lives of people trapped in the two Mumbai hotels and endangered the security forces. Transcripts of phone conversations between the terrorists and their Pakistani handlers clearly establish that the latter were issuing instructions on the basis of what they were watching. For instance, the terrorists in Taj Mahal Palace were told the dome of the hotel had caught fire; those holed up at The Oberoi were informed that the security forces were strengthening their positions on the roof.
The Supreme Court is right that, insofar as it risked violating the right to life of others, such TV coverage cannot be justified under the right to free expression. However, it is one thing to criticise over-the-top coverage and quite another to say something that could be interpreted as tacit endorsement of an external regulatory framework. Despite the occasional excesses, self-regulation of the broadcast media is the best way of striking a balance between preserving freedom of expression from state interference and preventing the abuse of its immense power. News broadcasters are not unaware of their obligations and the reasonable restrictions on their freedom to report events. The setting up of the News Broadcasters Association, comprising 45 news and current affairs channels, with its Code of Ethics and its Redressal Authority to address complaints from those aggrieved, is a significant step in the right direction. Stung by the criticism of the coverage of 26/11, the NBA has issued guidelines for reporting in emergency situations, which mandate, among other things, that no information be “given of pending rescue operations or regarding the number of security personnel involved or methods employed by them.” As TV coverage of subsequent incidents has shown, self-regulation is working reasonably well and there is no reason for external control.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-medium-as-messenger/article3840969.ece
31,8,2012,Trashing the suburbs,"The growing incidence of violent confrontations between peri-urban communities and municipal authorities in big cities over mindless dumping of garbage underscores the urgent need for environmentally sustainable solutions. Concentrated consumption in urban centres has resulted in solid waste volumes running into thousands of tonnes each day, and shrinking disposal choices. In much the same way that some industrialised nations export their trash to poor countries to keep their metros ‘clean’, Indian cities are increasingly looking at remote suburbs as dumping grounds. The sites chosen are invariably those that do not possess the political muscle to oppose top-down methods. Any opposition is met with a hardline response and even the use of force. Such an approach to garbage management is not just violative of the Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules 2000, but unjust and environmentally toxic. Thiruvananthapuram, Chennai and Bangalore have been witnessing protests by communities over decisions to locate new and bigger suburban dumpsites in their localities which are certain to affect groundwater, air quality and public health. A similar pattern of resistance has been witnessed in China, most recently near Shanghai. Clearly, the response to public concern must be in the form of genuine green solutions, not violence.
Transporting and disposing of waste in landfills is expensive. Germany does not resort to landfilling, and several other European countries recycle everything except about four per cent that they dump. Other solutions in the West include scientific landfills capable of removing methane emissions, and waste-to-energy projects which are expensive and carry significant environmental risks. India’s own response should therefore be to prioritise elegant solutions — such as composting of segregated wet waste, which forms the bulk of the garbage. This is possible at several levels — individuals, apartment complexes, gated communities and municipal wards; the rest of the waste can be recycled as envisaged under the MSW Rules. It is heartening that many citizens are ahead of local governments in adopting such green initiatives. Others can be encouraged to take charge of their waste and segregate and, if that fails, compelled to do so. Chennai offers a good example in the form of its compulsory rainwater harvesting requirement for buildings, which helped improve the groundwater table. But the key really lies in shunning a ‘use and throw’ lifestyle modelled after the United States, which generates the highest waste per capita and has 1,900 landfill eyesores. That is not the model India needs.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/trashing-the-suburbs/article3840965.ece
1,9,2012,The trend is clear,"The announcement of the growth data for the first quarter of the current year (April-June 2012) was keenly awaited for reasons other than the usual ones. During the last quarter of fiscal 2011-12, the GDP growth rate had slumped to a nine-year low of 5.3 per cent. The fear was that the rate for the first quarter of the current year would not be very different, an apprehension which came true with the news that growth was only marginally higher at 5.5 per cent. Last year, the growth rate was at 8 per cent over the corresponding period. Even before the official announcement, most private forecasters had discounted India’s growth prospects for the current year to below 6 per cent. Two official forecasters, the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister and the Reserve Bank of India, had concurred with the government’s expectation of 6.5 per cent growth, although the latter had qualified its rather optimistic projections with a number of caveats. However, worries over India’s faltering growth rates have been accompanied by more basic concerns over the accuracy and integrity of official economic data. There have been sharp and frequent revisions in important statistics. Consequently, there have been question marks over the policy decisions that had been based on such figures. Data relating to industrial output — the monthly IIP numbers — have drawn the maximum flak, including from the RBI Governor, but scepticism over the GDP figures has grown recently with reports of large revisions in data published as far back as 2007-08.
Although revisions in national income statistics are built into the process itself — they pass through many stages such as preliminary estimate, revised estimate and so on — they are expected to be minimal and, as far as possible, confined to the technical errors that are perhaps unavoidable in any large data collection machinery. The first quarter growth, at 5.5 per cent, has been bolstered by a better than expected 2.9 per cent increase in agriculture. Manufacturing has fared dismally, growing by just 0.2 per cent against 7.2 per cent last year. Mining and quarrying continue to be laggards, not surprising perhaps in the context of major lacunae in policies relating to them. The services sector, which was expected to offset the weaknesses in industry, has had a mixed run in the first quarter. The persistent weakness in manufacturing, considered to be symptomatic of the general slowdown, should indicate a softer interest rate policy. But as the RBI has consistently maintained, there cannot be just a single line of attack on a multi-faceted problem which the economic slowdown is.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-trend-is-clear/article3845026.ece
1,9,2012,The Modi index,"So now we know why Gujarat has such appalling numbers when it comes to malnourished children. Asked by the Wall Street Journal what he was doing about the persistently high rates of malnutrition in his State, Chief Minister Narendra Modi lamented the fact that young girls just don’t listen to mummy. “If a mother tells her daughter to have milk, they’ll have a fight. She’ll tell her mother, ‘I won’t drink milk. I’ll get fat’.” As Mr. Modi put it to the WSJ, Gujarat is “a middle class state. The middle class is more beauty conscious than health conscious.” If Mr. Modi’s startling revelation is true, it is another feather in the cap for Golden Gujarat. This must be the only place on the planet where girl children under the age of three, driven by blind, anorexic ambition, defy their unfortunate mothers. For that’s what the malnourished child numbers are about. According to the last National Family Health Survey (NFHS), the percentage of underweight children in the State actually went up between NFHS-2 (1998-99) and NFHS-3 (2005-06). And that was largely on Mr. Modi’s watch. He became Chief Minister in October 2001.
The NFHS-3 tells us that 47 per cent of children below the age of three in the State were underweight. That figure was 45 per cent in NFHS-2. That’s about twice the average for sub-Saharan Africa. It is also marginally higher than the nationwide average of 46 per cent. The percentage of Gujarat’s children who are ‘wasted’ also went up from 16 to 17 per cent between the two NFHS surveys. Mr. Modi also suggested malnourishment is a problem because “Gujarat is by and large a vegetarian State.” An interesting line of argument, but one based on the preposterous assumption that a vegetarian diet is incapable of keeping the human body well nourished. Truth to tell, the question that stumped Mr. Modi is one that even professional economists have struggled to answer. Throughout the world, anthropometric indicators of human well-being tend to move in tandem with growth rates. This is what makes Gujarat, which is a prosperous State in the macroeconomic sense, something of a puzzle. Some of its human development indicators are as bad as or worse than India’s poorest States. Any serious administrator would have already studied this problem and started taking remedial steps. What makes Mr. Modi’s hokey answer so distressing is that the problem of child malnutrition is clearly not even on his radar as Chief Minister. “We will try to get a drastic change in this,” he lamely promised. Maybe we’re seeing the birth of a new measure of insensitivity, if not malnourishment. The Modi Index?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-modi-index/article3845030.ece
3,9,2012,Proof of life,"Usually dismissed by the West as a Cold War relic, the Non-Aligned Movement attracted more interest than before with its 16th summit in Tehran last week. Both the venue and the turmoil in member-state Syria, where the Assad regime has been a close friend of Iran, gave this summit added significance. But if the United States was hoping the meet would lay bare the isolation of Iran, end in a quarrel over Syria, and expose NAM as an irrelevance, it must have been disappointed. Iran’s biggest international conference in several years drew a full house, including Egypt’s first democratically elected President Mohammed Morsi; Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states also sent representatives. And despite pressure by the U.S and Israel not to attend, the United Nations Secretary-General was present too. It’s another matter that both President Morsi, who described the Assad regime as an “occupation” of Syria, and Ban-ki Moon, who asked Iran to comply with U.N. demands or face isolation, did not play music in President Mahmoud Ahamdinejad’s ears. Still Iran came out looking better than it had before. For an Israel straining at the leash, this should be sufficient discouragement against any adventurism. Further, while western efforts to effect regime change in Syria have divided the world, and NAM’s members hold independent positions on the situation there, this did not affect the summit’s determination to press for equitable ‘global governance’ — diplomatic argot for an international order more representative than the present Security Council.
For India, the summit was an important occasion to send out two timely messages. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s assertion that external intervention in Syria would only lead to more problems for that country, and that a solution had to come from within, was New Delhi’s clearest statement of differences with the U.S. on this issue. India had voted for a UNSC resolution calling for sanctions against Syria in July, but abstained from a General Assembly resolution that included a reference to an Arab League demand for President Assad to step down. Second, Dr. Singh’s meetings with the Iranian leadership were an opportunity to demonstrate that New Delhi’s relations with Tehran would not be dictated by the U.S. Ever since the U.S stepped up its pressure on the nuclear front by threatening sanctions against countries buying Iranian oil, India has walked a fine balance between the two countries. The talks focussed on improving economic relations; Iran recommitted to facilitating the Chabahar route for India-Afghan trade. Foreign relations are not the zero sum game some powers would like it to be. India and Iran must now follow up with quick action on the ground.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/proof-of-life/article3851418.ece
3,9,2012,Let the machines take over,"Laws count for nothing when some of the worst offenders are government-run bodies, agencies and enterprises. The Central government is trying to push through the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Bill, 2012, under pressure from the Supreme Court; but, going by the experience of the past few decades, there is no cause to assume the dehumanising practice of manual removal of human excreta will soon come to an end. At the top of those employing manual scavengers are local bodies for clearing blocked sewer lines and the railways for cleaning soiled tracks at stations. Despite repeated calls for mechanisation, most of the work continues to be done manually, for the sake of either convenience or cost. Even as efforts are being made to ensure the conversion of dry latrines in rural areas to sanitary toilets, local bodies and the railways have stuck to the old ways. In India, unskilled labour remains cheap, and mechanisation of scavenging and modernisation of toilets in trains are unattractive in cost terms. But the issue cannot be allowed to revolve around cost; it must be made to deal with the legal and moral unacceptability of employing humans — mainly those belonging to some Scheduled Castes and Tribes — in dehumanising work.
So far, the implementation of the laws against manual scavenging has been inversely proportional to their stringency. The new Bill provides for penalties for employing people not only to clean dry latrines, but also septic tanks and sewers. The draft of the bill says the offences will be cognisable and non-bailable and tried by an executive magistrate. However, the issue was never one of deterrent punishment; it was always one of lax implementation. Till date, there has been no conviction under the 1993 Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act. Despite a communication from the Union Home Ministry to all States that employment of those belonging to SCs and STs could attract the provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, there is no evidence of any offender being charged under this law for employing manual scavengers. A key feature of the new draft law is the emphasis on rehabilitation. True, there have been schemes specifically aimed at rehabilitating manual scavengers, but the current bill will have a twin focus on prohibition of manual scavenging and rehabilitation of manual scavengers. After all, one is not possible without the other. But if the bill, waiting to be introduced in Parliament, is to be saved the fate of its earlier avatars, the local bodies and the Indian Railways will have to take the lead.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/let-the-machines-take-over/article3851422.ece
4,9,2012,A dangerous game,"Nothing could be more myopic than Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s outburst against the visit of a Sri Lankan school football team to Tamil Nadu and her decision to suspend an official for allowing a match to be played in the government-owned Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Chennai. Her action has harmed the image of the State and tarnished the reputation of India as an open and tolerant society. The reason for the official’s suspension is that he allowed a team from Royal College, Colombo, to play a friendly against a local Customs team at the stadium on August 31. As part of the fallout, the students and coach of a team from another school, Hilburn International College, Ratnapura, which was planning to play against a Chennai school, were sent packing on the Chief Minister’s insistence. It is tempting to see a connection between this hostile act towards innocent schoolchildren and the strident political demands Ms Jayalalithaa and other party leaders have been making in recent weeks that India put an end to its practice of training military personnel from Sri Lanka’s defence services. However, it is one thing to demand the government desist from training soldiers from the island nation and quite another to ask for — and then peremptorily impose — a virtual embargo on sporting and cultural ties with ordinary Sri Lankans.
For quite some time now, Tamil Nadu has been asking New Delhi to act on its Legislative Assembly resolution seeking early rehabilitation of war-displaced Tamils in Sri Lanka and restoration of their rights on a par with the Sinhalese majority. Far from taking note, the Government of India has actively sought to strengthen ties with Colombo, especially after it voted in the United Nations Human Rights Council in favour of a resolution that was critical of Sri Lanka. Popular sentiment in Tamil Nadu is against sacrificing the pursuit of equality, justice and dignity for the Tamils of Sri Lanka to the goal of preserving India’s political proximity to Colombo. Nor can it be denied that the Union government has been insensitive towards public opinion in the State. When the call for an end to military training arose, it merely shifted the Sri Lankan trainees from a facility in Tamil Nadu to another outside and got Minister of State for Defence M.M. Pallam Raju to say the military training could not be stopped since Sri Lanka is a friendly country. However, the Centre’s callous attitude cannot serve as an excuse for irresponsible grandstanding by Tamil Nadu politicians. We are already on a slippery slope. Today a school soccer match has been cancelled; tomorrow the demand will be for a ban on cricketers, tourists and pilgrims from Sri Lanka.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-dangerous-game/article3855340.ece
4,9,2012,Bad move on GAAR,"The recommendations of the Shome Committee which went into the General Anti Avoidance Rules (GAAR) proposed in the Budget should be sweet music to overseas investors and companies even as they are bound to disappoint the tax administration and all those interested in equity in taxation. By recommending that it should apply only to cases where tax benefit is the main objective of an arrangement or transaction and not one of the main objectives, the Committee has taken the sting out of GAAR as originally envisaged. Rarely, if ever, can tax authorities prove conclusively that obtaining tax benefit was the main objective of an arrangement or transaction. The Committee’s report should also warm the hearts of foreign investors routing funds into India through sham companies based in Mauritius — it has explicitly stated that “GAAR provisions shall not apply to examine the genuineness of the residency of an entity set up in Mauritius”. In other words, a Tax Residency Certificate from Mauritius is enough to override GAAR provisions. This kills one of the most laudable objectives of the rules as envisaged in the Budget — that of plugging a loophole which foreign institutional investors exploited to avoid paying capital gains tax in India.
The recommendation to defer implementation of even these watered-down proposals until 2016-17 is the final nail in the GAAR coffin. The ostensible reason for this is that tax officers first need to be trained in the finer aspects of international taxation. It is doubtful if even these three years will be enough to impart our officers such deep knowledge simply because the tax-payer versus Revenue conflict is a cat-and-mouse game that evolves constantly. The protest from investors and companies over GAAR is understandable for its intent is to ensure they pay their due taxes. What is not understandable, though, is the government’s diffidence in seeing the Budget proposal through, especially because it is not new and is part of the proposed Direct Taxes Bill. Nor is GAAR a strange animal to overseas investors as many countries including Canada, China and South Africa have codified it in their tax laws. The U.K. is consulting stakeholders over introducing GAAR in its tax laws and has set its sight on next year’s budget. To those arguing that the timing now is not right, the only answer is that no time can presumably be right for such proposals that run against the interests of powerful foreign investors. The government did attempt to plug the Mauritius loophole once in the past when economic conditions were not as bad as they are now but it still had to backtrack following howls from investors. It looks like the stage is being set for an encore now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bad-move-on-gaar/article3855349.ece
5,9,2012,The Pariwar’s comeuppance,"The Supreme Court’s landmark judgment in the case relating to two companies of the Sahara pariwar, or family — as the group chooses to call itself — strengthens the hands of financial sector regulators besides having important ramifications for corporate and securities law. At the core of the dispute are hybrid instruments called Optionally Fully Convertible Debentures which the two companies floated without seeking regulatory approval or having any intention to list them on the stock exchange. With their financial position and other material facts hidden behind a deliberately devised opaque structure, the Sahara group had the audacity to challenge the Securities and Exchange Board of India which, as far back as November 2010, had asked them to stop raising funds through OFCDs. The principle that mobilisation of public money above a very small amount invariably requires regulatory clearance is so well established and rooted in common sense that Sahara had no case whatsoever. Yet it kept appealing its case, losing at every stage but probably gaining time. The Supreme Court has finally put paid to any lingering hope the group might have had. In fact, it is the appeal against the order of the Securities Appellate Tribunal that has led to the Supreme Court judgment, which will be equally remembered for its stringent criticism of the appellants.
This is not the first time regulators have had a problem with the group. In 2008, the Reserve Bank of India ordered its residuary non-banking finance company, the Sahara Financial Corporation, to phase out its deposit collections. Sahara claimed to have complied ahead of schedule but things could be considerably more difficult this time. The two companies have been asked to quickly refund some Rs. 24,400 crore which they claim to have collected from 2.21 crore depositors. Failure to comply will invite penal action. Tough days lie ahead for the group which has sought publicity as keenly as it has attempted to avoid financial scrutiny. Its logo has adorned the apparel of India’s cricketers for more than a decade. Over the years Sahara, which started as a residuary non-banking finance company, diversified into various unrelated businesses — a township near Pune, an airline (since sold off), and a TV station, among others. More recently it acquired an IPL franchise and a stake in a Formula One team. True to form, in all these as well as in its acquisition of two landmark hotels in New York and London, no financial details have been made available. The Supreme Court order will force the group to shed its secrecy. On that score alone it should be welcomed by all.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-pariwars-comeuppance/article3859434.ece
5,9,2012,From Bodoland to Bangalore,"Six weeks after mob violence triggered the displacement of lakhs of traumatised Muslims and Bodos, the worst appears to be over for lower Assam. Large areas still remain curfew-bound. The death toll is 96. More than two lakh people remain in relief camps, even as the government claims hundreds of thousands have returned to their homes. Decisive action must now be taken to crack down on anyone indulging in provocative and inflammatory acts or statements. More measures are needed to instil confidence among the victims and ensure that those still in relief camps can return to their homes. At the ground level, this means the government must work hard to create trust between ordinary Muslims and Bodos. Confidence-building measures that go beyond ritual and rhetoric are essential. The State government should learn the lessons and improve its response time, and ensure agile arrangements to nip any trouble in the bud. A reply provided in the Lok Sabha by the Defence Minister made it clear that while the Assam government sought the deployment of the Army in Kokrajhar on July 21, three days after the violence had started, the Centre did not act for another three days. Only on July 24, when the State made a second request, did the Army arrive. Such delays are inexcusable.
Much has been made of the presence of foreign citizens in the Bodoland Territorial Area Districts but care is needed to disentangle the community of Bengali-speaking Indian nationals who migrated to western Assam before Partition from the undocumented migrants who have entered from East Pakistan and Bangladesh since 1947 or 1971. This will involve attending to the unfinished task of updating the National Register of Citizens, as has been agreed by all parties concerned. The completion of this process is bound to take the wind out of the sails of those seeking to make political careers out of the ‘inhabitant versus foreigner’ issue. Meanwhile, grievances relating to land and resources need to be attended to by means of thoughtful development policy prescriptions. Overall, it has been a difficult phase for Assam, coping also with the impact of an exodus of its people, along with those from other parts of northeastern India, from cities like Bangalore, Pune and Chennai following rumours of violence. When rumour, myth and insecurity dominate the mind, the smallest spark can set off panic or worse. In an era defined by mass migration and mass messaging, everything is connected. The exodus is a reminder to ‘mainland’ India that it cannot afford to ignore the travails of the east and northeast, nor can it afford to allow “sons of the soil” politics to take root.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/from-bodoland-to-bangalore/article3859435.ece
6,9,2012,"Sivakasi, the destroyer","The fireworks that light up the night sky during Diwali bear no trace of the hazardous working conditions in their place of origin: Sivakasi and its surrounding villages in southern Tamil Nadu. The tragic death of nearly 38 workers and onlookers at a fireworks unit in Mudalipatti village on Wednesday is another gruesome reminder of the dangers lurking behind small-scale cracker factories that neglect laws and rules in the search for quick and easy profits. Other than applying for and obtaining a licence, many of these units make no pretence of following statutory requirements for operating with explosive materials. In this case, the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation, mandated with responsibilities under the Explosives Act and the Petroleum Act, is reported to have suspended the licence of the unit just a day before the accident for a series of violations. But while there is little doubt about non-compliance with safety norms on the part of the unit, the tragedy is a telling statement on the failure of enforcement authorities, including PESO, in supervising these hazardous units at the peak of their activity in the weeks leading to Diwali. Both the national Factories Act, 1948, and the Tamil Nadu Fire Service Act, 1985, empower safety inspectors and fire service officers to demand that factory owners either adhere to safety norms or cease operations. Clearly, in this case, the officials failed in their preventive function.
Most of those killed in the accident were onlookers who rushed to the site on hearing the first explosion. The first explosion was followed by another which caused the maximum number of deaths. Other than some feeble attempts to push people back, the police appear to have done little to warn the crowd that had gathered of the impending danger. The sense of tragedy is the greater because not only were the explosions preventable, but the deaths in the explosions too could have been avoided with some foresight and greater effort, had the local authorities developed protocols for dealing with hazardous fires in a high-risk area like Sivakasi. At the end of the day, however, tough enforcement of production and storage rules is the only way to minimise and eliminate risk in the firecracker industry. Even the smallest of mistakes can have disastrous consequences. Everything, from the mixing and filling of raw materials to the stacking and storing of finished fireworks, will have to be done as per procedures carefully laid down. These rules are well established but the non-compliance is wilful, to save on costs and time. Cruelly, a part of the savings on costs is often spent on ensuring poor enforcement. Accidents, far from being preventable, therefore end up as inevitable.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sivakasi-the-destroyer/article3863056.ece
6,9,2012,A class apart,"There’s nothing like a drought to drive an elected representative to distraction. Earlier this year, in the midst of a discussion in the Karnataka Assembly on lack of rainfall in the State, a Minister was caught watching a pornographic clip on a mobile device. His excuse: he was really conducting research on atrocities against women. Six months later, when the State is reeling under the worst drought in four decades, this ardent desire to study is once again on display as legislators from the State clamber aboard planes bound for different points on the globe. Predictably, these jaunts have drawn public ridicule. They have also renewed questions about the quality of governance the first-ever Bharatiya Janata Party ministry in the South is providing. Despite the unfolding calamity that has affected the livelihoods of people living in vast swathes of the State, the Assembly Speaker had no problem sending 13 legislators on a junket to South America — euphemistically called a ‘study tour’ — at a cost to the exchequer of about Rs. 7 lakhs per person for the airfare alone. Felicitously, these eager “students” are drawn from all major parties.
Following the outrage, the Speaker now wants to postpone the visit of another 19 legislators to Russia, Scandinavia, Egypt and Israel for a 17-day trip starting September 27. Each legislator is eligible for a daily allowance of $350 plus $75 for two days of air travel. The 17-day tour will cost the government Rs. 2.97 lakhs per legislator. In addition, the tickets cost Rs. 6.80 lakhs per person. Moreover, the government faces the prospect of having to pay the travel agency a penalty of 40 per cent of the fare for each postponement of the trip. Meanwhile, as part of their course curriculum, the MLAs who are halfway through a 13 day trip, with 2 days in Dubai — have visited Buenos Aires, where they have been on a tour “highlighting the city’s major neighbourhoods and attractions” and taken in a tango performance. From Argentina, they have since moved on to Peru where they have “studied” the Inca palaces in Cusco and the magnificent ruins of Machu Picchu. Most of them are accompanied by their spouses, all the better to learn. The BJP government in Karnataka, which was elected in May 2008, has lurched from one crisis to another, and brazened through several scandals. These include a massive mining scam and a series of land scams, which forced its then Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa to resign and go to prison. With Assembly elections due soon, the BJP will have to contend with snowballing public disenchantment with its less-than-diligent performance in office.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-class-apart/article3863057.ece
7,9,2012,In the company of men,"The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Bill 2012, recently passed by the Lok Sabha, has an unlikely starting point — the brutal gang-rape of a brave Rajasthani woman. Her struggle to seek justice prompted the filing of a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court that resulted in a landmark 1997 judgment which, relying heavily on international conventions, laid down the so-called Vishaka guidelines — a framework for dealing with sexual harassment at the workplace. Although the guidelines were laid down as the law of the land, enforceable until a statute was enacted, they were not properly implemented in both the government and private sector spheres. It was thanks to a combination of writ petitions that sought full implementation, a drafting initiative by the National Commission for Women, and pressure from civil society that we are close to having a full-fledged law that attempts to strengthen the right of women to a secure and non-threatening environment at the workplace.
The legal framework of the Bill is erected on the mandatory constitution of Internal Complaints Committees in offices and the creation of Local Complaints Committees in every district, twin mechanisms for redressal of complaints. Its ambit is wide as it covers, in keeping with the Vishaka guidelines, the unorganised sector, which in relation to a workplace means any enterprise engaged in the production of goods or providing service of any kind including those that employ less than 10 workers. The definition of the sexual harassment is expansive as well, including sexually-coloured remarks and any non-verbal gesture of a sexual nature. Setting up Internal Complaints Committees, which must include one member from a NGO, in all offices and branches with more than 10 employees will take some doing. And it remains to be seen how these committees, which have been vested with the powers of a civil court, will function. The proposed law may have missed a trick in not being gender-neutral: Data from countries such as the United States reveal that more and more men are filing sexual harassment claims, often against their male superiors in the same organisation. The ambiguous status of large agricultural enterprises and the armed forces must also be ended so that women who work in these sectors are fully protected. Overall, however, the proposed law, which will make it possible to speed up disciplinary action against offenders, deserves to be warmly welcomed. It is a significant step towards promoting equality in employment, which will remain a chimera as long as there is sexual harassment at the workplace.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/in-the-company-of-men/article3867174.ece
7,9,2012,Sons who soil,"Raj Thackeray’s anti-Bihari invective, in the same vein as his rant against ‘outsiders from north India’ at the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena public meeting in August, should surprise no one. After the Bihar police protested at not being taken into confidence in the arrest of an Azad Maidan rioter by the Mumbai police in Sitamarhi, Raj threatened to brand all Biharis as ‘infiltrators’ and throw them out of Maharashtra if the Bihar government posed any impediments to the investigation. He also demanded registration of all migrants — read people from Uttar Pradesh or Bihar. The call was quickly endorsed by his cousin Uddhav in the Shiv Sena, who revived the demand for a permit system to keep out ‘Bangladeshis’. The MNS has got away with worse, beating up students from the north appearing for railway recruitment examinations and Bihari taxi drivers and shopkeepers in Mumbai, apart from pouring vitriol on all migrants. After all, the MNS has learnt its political style from the Shiv Sena. Its portrayal of the Bihari or “bhaiyya” from Uttar Pradesh as dirty and criminal is reminiscent of the way “Madrasis” were once caricatured by the Shiv Sena. While nothing better can be expected from the two Senas bent on capturing the Marathi vote bank, what is inexplicable is the consistently limp response of the ruling coalition in dealing with these threats.
Bal Thackeray’s father Keshav Sitaram Thackeray or Prabodhankar, who encouraged his son to form the Shiv Sena, wrote in his autobiography that the family hailed from a place near Nashik. He went to Kolkata for his studies, after which he moved to Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh before arriving in Mumbai, all in search of livelihood. That makes it plain that Prabodhankar was no less a migrant than the tens of thousands arriving in Mumbai every day. India’s commercial capital owes much to the sweat and toil of migrants. Over the centuries the city has welcomed them and benefited from them. Both the MNS and Sena should know that without its multi-ethnic workforce drawn from all corners of the country, Mumbai would not be the metropolis it is today. It is the constitutional right of every citizen to travel and live in any part of the country; it is the state’s duty to secure this right. Unfortunately, the Congress lacks the gumption to tackle the chauvinism of the Senas. Political expediency might be the reason the Prithviraj Chavan government lets the MNS get away with its provocations, but it can continue to play this game only at great risk to the social and economic fabric of India’s biggest metropolis. It is time the Maharashtra government stood up and showed that the state has not withered away.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sons-who-soil/article3867176.ece
8,9,2012,Making the right connection,"There are some hopeful signs that the government is finally waking up to the power of social media to connect with mass audiences. The consultation on free speech and imposition of lawful restrictions during crises, organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and involving multiple stakeholders — the government, internet service providers, Facebook, Google, and civil society — is a much-needed confidence building measure. It is encouraging that the Department of Telecommunications acknowledges the power of positive communication through online media to advance the government’s objectives, and forswears the use of censorship. Transparency has thus far taken a back seat when it comes to implementing the Information Technology Act. Only last month, in the wake of violence in Assam and Mumbai, and the rumour mongering that led to an exodus of northeast Indians from the south, some web pages with harmless content were clumsily blocked along with some hosting inflammatory videos, images and writings. What stood out even more was the inability of government to use the very same channels of communication to reassure and clarify. Building capabilities in this area is, therefore, important to manage future crises.
During the London riots of 2011, local government authorities used Facebook and Twitter to counter rumour, provide information, organise community engagement and identify sources of trouble. Some researchers have concluded that such an approach can produce significant positive effects during crisis events, particularly in aiding response and recovery, thanks to the immediacy, mobility and reach of social media. These characteristics of the new communications landscape — including SMS in the Indian context — hold the key to a successful social media strategy for government. Ficci’s suggestion to form crisis councils consisting of telecom companies, ISPs, social media and civil society is worth considering, as it could reach out quickly to influential virtual communities. All these initiatives can have good outcomes, but the unresolved question is that of the boundaries of free speech online. Here, the government must review the working of the IT Act to ensure its conformity with fundamental rights. Only those reasonable restrictions sanctioned under Article 19 (2) of the Constitution can be legitimate ground for imposition of curbs, that too through judicial due process. Unfortunately, not all decisions blocking web pages in the recent past pass muster and some are unacceptable. A clearly laid down, transparent process of law that involves notice, right of reply, judicial test and recourse is imperative for free internet speech.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/making-the-right-connection/article3871339.ece
8,9,2012,Missing at a home near you,"The malady of missing children in many parts of the country is a terrible commentary on our collective response to the complex web of socio-economic and gender-based injustices. Organised crime, bonded labour, drug peddling, and trafficking for sexual exploitation are among the reasons for the disappearances of children. The Central and State governments have now been issued notices by the Supreme Court on a petition alleging that about 55,000 children have gone missing in the past three years. In the Capital alone, over 19,000 children have disappeared since 2009, according to the Ministry of Home Affairs. Most are still untraced. If this malaise seems familiar, so does the cure. The committee set up in the aftermath of the gruesome Nithari incidents recommended strengthening the separate cell within the Central Bureau of Investigation to track the whereabouts of disappeared children. The apex court has, in its recent intervention, sought to know the current status of this cell. The recommendation dates back to a 2007 National Human Rights Commission report. The NHRC has repeatedly called for greater involvement and accountability on the part of the local administration and the police in protecting vulnerable children and their families.
Crimes involving child-smuggling transcend inter-State and international borders. A central repository of data harnessing forensic science and information technology would go a long way towards breaking the nexus between crime syndicates and errant officials. But addressing the root causes of child trafficking requires a more comprehensive response. Poor access to primary education and the lack of a stimulating learning environment to sustain initial school enrolments account for the still pervasive prevalence of bonded labour, as well as for runaways. It is also worth remembering that better wages for the adult workforce have historically been one of the surest ways of stopping families from sending children to work rather than to school. Cumulatively, such measures would add up to a strong case for replacing informality in India’s workforce — over 90 per cent of which is currently outside the organised sector — and investing more in social protection policies. None of this detracts from the immediate need for psycho-social counselling services for vulnerable or affected children and families. The police and the law enforcement machinery would also need to be sensitised to this all-important human dimension. Inculcating a culture of respect for the rights of children is essential to strengthen the traditional family-oriented value system.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/missing-at-a-home-near-you/article3871341.ece
10,9,2012,A magnificent 100,"Half a century has passed since India took its first steps towards establishing a space programme of its own. The country’s first experimental satellite, Aryabhata, was launched from the Soviet Union in 1975 and the first successful satellite launch from within the country, using the SLV-3 rocket, followed five years later. On Sunday, the Indian Space Research Organisation celebrated its 100th mission with a flawless launch of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) from Sriharikota. Given the long association between the French and Indian space programmes, it was particularly appropriate that this landmark launch carried France’s SPOT 6 satellite. A deal in the mid-1960s to make a small French two-stage rocket (known as a sounding rocket) in India catalysed the development of solid propulsion capabilities needed for the launch vehicle programme. A decade later, another deal gave ISRO access to French liquid propulsion technology, which has gone into the PSLV’s second stage. The PSLV has become a rugged workhorse with 21 consecutive successful launches behind it. It has taken over 50 satellites and spacecraft into space, half of them for foreign customers. Since it became operational, the PSLV has carried all of India’s remote sensing satellites and also launched the country’s first lunar probe, Chandrayaan-1. The first Indian mission to Mars too will travel on its shoulders next year.
With the PSLV, the country does not have to look abroad for launching its remote sensing satellites. But the same is not true with communication satellites. In contrast to the PSLV, the trouble-prone Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) has been hampered by delays in mastering the cryogenic technology required for it as well as other problems. Moreover, ISRO’s needs appear to go beyond the capabilities of this rocket, which was designed to carry two-tonne communication satellites. The Indian space agency has already launched three communication satellites weighing over three tonnes on Europe’s Ariane 5. A fourth satellite, GSAT-10, is to be carried on the Ariane 5 in two weeks’ time. Such foreign launches are expensive. In the case of the GSAT-8, which went into operation last year, it cost Rs. 300 crores to build the satellite and a similar sum went for its launch. The giant solid-propellant boosters and liquid-propellant core stage for the next generation GSLV Mark-III are ready and will be tested in an experimental flight. But this rocket, with the ability to carry four-tonne communication satellites, cannot be put to use till an entirely different cryogenic engine and stage have been perfected. That could take time. The Indian launch vehicle programme has a long way to go.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-magnificent-100/article3878115.ece
10,9,2012,Separation on the shelf,"The centre-left separatist Parti Québécois (PQ) has ended the nine-year dominance of the Quebec Liberal Party (PLQ), but only just. PQ leader Pauline Marois will become the Canadian province’s first woman premier. Although the PLQ’s Jean Charest lost his own constituency, the winners gained only 31.93 per cent of a 73 per cent turnout, and fell well short of the 63 seats they needed for an absolute majority in the 125-place National Assembly. Their 54 seats mean the péquistes will form a minority government. Ms Marois — whose victory speech was marred by a deadly shooting in which one person died — has said she will govern with all the other elected lawmakers. She may have little option; the PLQ’s 50 seats will give it more weight than it could have expected in opposition; its 31.2 vote-share is less than a percentage point behind PQ’s. François Legault’s third-placed Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ), a new party that wants the secession question put off indefinitely, won 19 seats on a 27.05 per cent share.
Unsurprisingly, Ms Marois has given no commitment on scheduling a secession referendum, although she has asserted her wish for sovereignty. Coalition compulsions may require her to rein in the party’s more radical secessionists. In any case the new government will be preoccupied with Quebec’s economic problems. The budget deficit is C$ 253 billion, 51 per cent of the province’s GDP, and unemployment at 8 per cent exceeds the national average of 7.5. When she was finance minister, Ms Marois balanced the province’s budget but that will be harder to do now, despite voter support for higher taxes on high earners. The key issues, however, may well have to do with both the political and the wider culture. Between February and June, the Charest government was rocked by massive student protests against a proposed rise in university tuition fees, and by even stronger public opposition to a bill restricting demonstrations. The protests, the largest acts of civil disobedience in Canadian history, contributed to Mr. Charest’s eventual downfall. Not surprisingly, one of the first pledges Ms Marois made after her victory was to cancel the tuition fee increase. Secondly, the left-leaning separatist Québec Solidaire party has won two seats, and is sure to demand policy concessions in return for supporting Ms Marois. In addition, new PQ figures like the student leader Léo Bureau-Blouin, who won the election in which he voted for the first time and at 21 has become Quebec’s youngest-ever assembly member, will have an effect on the party’s ethos. Whatever else, the old days of bipolar Québécois politics are over.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/separation-on-the-shelf/article3878119.ece
11,9,2012,Sedition? Seriously?,"“Take again Section 124-A of the Indian Penal Code,” Jawaharlal Nehru said during a parliamentary debate centred around freedom of speech in 1951. “Now as far as I am concerned that particular Section is highly objectionable and obnoxious and it should have no place…in any body of laws that we might pass. The sooner we get rid of it the better.” Ironically, the sedition clause not only remains on the statute book but is used periodically against human rights activists, journalists and intellectuals. The latest victim of this anachronistic colonial era law, for which the maximum punishment is life imprisonment, is a young cartoonist, arrested for no more than lampooning the corrupt and venal state of affairs in the country. Even if one were to admit, for the sake of argument, that some may find his work offensive or in bad taste, it is bizarre and unpardonable that he should be put behind bars on charges that include exciting “disaffection” towards or bringing “hatred and contempt” against the government. The use of sedition to silence speech has a long and infamous history in this country. When Mahatma Gandhi was charged with exciting disaffection in 1922, he pleaded guilty, saying cheekily that “affection cannot be manufactured or regulated by law.” Prosecuted twice, Bal Gangadhar Tilak sought to know whether he was guilty of sedition against the colonial government or India’s people. Recently, the sedition law was misapplied to convict civil rights activist Binayak Sen and register a case against writer Arundhati Roy and others for speeches they made on Kashmir.
While upholding the sedition law, the Supreme Court said it should apply only to cases where an accused person intended to create public disorder or incite violence ( Kedar Nath Singh v. State of Bihar). However, in carrying out arrests and slapping charges, the police and their political masters have rarely, if ever, respected this restriction. In the wake of the ruling against Binayak Sen, Veerappa Moily, then Law Minister, had announced there was a need to review the sedition law. With the continuing misuse of the law, however, there is only one reasonable course: scrap it at once, and quickly. It is no accident that the other charges against cartoonist Aseem Trivedi are the controversial ‘hate’ and ‘insult’ provisions in the Information Technology Act and the Prevention of Insult to National Honour Act. What constitutes an insult, what causes offence, and what can be construed as hate are deeply subjective issues. This ambiguity gives governments the legal handle to exercise an insidious form of censorship and control that goes well beyond the “reasonable restrictions” on free speech that the Constitution allows.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sedition-seriously/article3882414.ece
11,9,2012,Sharing water,"In times of scarcity and shortage, distinctions between need and greed mean little. Following a deficit southwest monsoon this year, Karnataka has been reluctant to share the Cauvery with its lower riparian neighbour Tamil Nadu, choosing instead to retain the river’s waters in its small and major reservoirs. When the monsoon fails, neither State can possibly satisfy its irrigation and drinking water requirements from the Cauvery’s flows. It is nobody’s case that Karnataka is building up a huge surplus by damming the water, but the burden of a deficit year will have to be shared equally. By agreeing before the Supreme Court to release 10,000 cusecs of water daily to Tamil Nadu till September 19 — when the Cauvery River Authority, headed by the Prime Minister, meets to decide the issue — Karnataka has indicated a readiness to arrive at an understanding with Tamil Nadu on a just sharing of the water. Tamil Nadu had sought two TMC ft (thousand million cubic feet) of water for irrigation in the Cauvery delta, and Karnataka’s undertaking before the court means the State will get less than half of what it wanted. The undertaking, as a sort of minimum guarantee, will be the starting point for the talks in the CRA, and Tamil Nadu can hope for a reasonable coverage of the long-term samba crop. With the southwest monsoon playing truant, the State has already lost the short-term kuruvai crop.
What is most disquieting about the Cauvery dispute that arises every season is the failure of the Centre and the two States to bring about an acceptable solution. Each time, it takes the intervention of the Supreme Court to force a compromise. Little wonder then, one of the judges in the Supreme Court Bench hearing the issue felt compelled to express displeasure at the failure of the Prime Minister’s Office to hold a meeting of the CRA. Instead of fixing a date taking into consideration the urgency of the issue, PMO officials spent time seeking convenient dates from the Chief Ministers of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry. The PMO seems to require constant prodding from the Supreme Court before it convenes the CRA. Clearly, the mechanism established for the heads of government to strive for a solution to the Cauvery water issue during deficit years is not working. The CRA is required to arrive at a pro rata sharing of the water among the Cauvery basin States under a distress-sharing formula. But the Centre — driven by the political compulsions of the government of the day — prefers not to take the lead in thrashing out a solution for fear of being seen taking sides.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sharing-water/article3882417.ece
12,9,2012,Don’t compromise open justice,"We live in a legal environment where the rule of sub judice is regarded as an anachronism, emanating from a time when all trials were decided by jurors susceptible to influence by what was published in the press. By and large, the law of sub judice, which regulates the dissemination of matter under the consideration of the court, is a dead letter. In such a context, the Supreme Court’s judgment justifying a temporary ban on the publication of court proceedings in certain cases is likely to have a chilling effect on the freedom of the press and the very idea of an open trial. Mercifully, the Court refused to lay down broad guidelines for reporting ongoing cases. But though its order looks like a restatement of the Mirajkar case in which a nine-member Bench ruled that the right to open justice is not absolute, the Court has likely upset the “difficult constitutional balance” between freedom of expression and the administration of justice that the landmark 1966 judgment established. Indeed, by emphasising the right of an aggrieved person to seek postponement of media coverage of an ongoing case by approaching the appropriate writ court, there is a danger that gag orders may become commonplace. At a minimum, the door has been opened to hundreds and thousands of additional writs — a burden our legal system is unprepared to handle — filed by accused persons with means.
The five-judge Bench cited precedents in many jurisdictions to maintain “there is power in the courts to postpone the reporting of judicial proceedings in the administration of justice.” Even in the U.S., where the First Amendment trumps any restriction placed on rights to free speech, the courts have evolved “neutralising devices” to prevent the corruption of the administration of justice. But set aside the judicial reasoning and consider its possible impact. Powerful defendants in high-profile cases will try their best to obtain postponement orders despite the very strict criteria laid down by the Supreme Court. Moreover, gag orders issued in contravention of the doctrines of necessity and proportionality may take a long time to vacate, thus robbing the public of its right to know. The public scrutiny of courts is critical in ensuring that judges do justice; a lack of awareness of what goes on in a courtroom can only undermine public confidence in the judicial system. The same Mirajkar judgment also said restraint on publication and closed door trials could apply only in exceptional cases. In all other cases, a court can launch contempt proceedings if a news report attempts to subvert the course of justice. When there is no evidence to show this system of checks and balances has failed, why try and move away from it?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dont-compromise-open-justice/article3886048.ece
12,9,2012,A giant small step,"At last, India and Pakistan have put their signatures to a visa agreement that is forward looking, even if it falls far short of the ideal of freeing up all travel between the two countries. The new agreement allows at least some categories of citizens in both countries to meet more easily, and with fewer restrictions. Earlier, citizens of either country could visit three cities in the other. This has now changed to five cities. Under the old system, visitors had to enter and exit through the same point; in the new one, they can exit and enter from any of three designated points, which in India now includes Chennai. Visitors over 65 years of age can obtain visas on arrival at the Wagah-Attari land crossing. But the two sides continue to remain firm on not allowing individual tourist visas, perhaps the only two countries in the world to do so. In keeping with the new trade winds blowing across the subcontinent, businesspersons are the main beneficiaries. Their visas are now in a separate category: they will be fast-tracked, issued for longer durations, and multiple visits to as many as 10 cities will be allowed. The SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry expects bilateral trade to double from its present annual level of $ 2.56 billion within a year as a result. That may be an exaggeration; there still remain other barriers that need to come down for trade to take off.
However deficient, the visa agreement is still a sign that the two countries can move beyond just talk of normalisation, to take a concrete step that may help achieve this goal. At their meeting in Islamabad, the foreign ministers of Pakistan and India emphasised the need to learn from history without being held hostage to it. India has shown it has the ability to move forward from the 2008 attacks in Mumbai while hoping Pakistan brings the perpetrators to book; for its own sake too, it is important that Islamabad does this, and clamps down on terror outfits. Both sides are only too aware of the challenge to ensure that the present dialogue process, which began two years after the Mumbai attacks, and that has been remarkable for the maturity with which both sides have addressed their differences, is not derailed or reversed again. There are other positive outcomes that can be easily achieved if the two sides can keep at it. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh mentioned the resolution of Sir Creek as one possibility recently. He must not shy away from visiting Pakistan in November this year, as requested by President Asif Ali Zardari. A visit by an Indian Prime Minister would provide the process the right amount of political energy to keep it going.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-giant-small-step/article3886049.ece
13,9,2012,The meltdown of reason,"The violence that the agitation against the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project degenerated into this week had an unfortunate ring of foreordination about it. It seemed to exemplify what happens when differences are not resolved through peaceful means. The Union and State governments had made no more than nominal efforts to engage the local people protesting against the project; experts had only made a cursory effort to address popular fears about the safety of the nuclear reactors, the manner of disposal of nuclear waste and the absence of a detailed public hearing; and the district administration had resorted to an emergency preparedness drill whose effectiveness was doubted by many. With the Madras High Court clearing the commissioning of the project, and the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board giving its nod for loading of fuel in the first unit, the next port of call for those opposed to the plant’s commissioning should have been the Supreme Court. Instead, a section of the protesters decided to step up their campaign. The apparent failure of the police to anticipate that some protesters may take the coastal route towards the plant resulted in a dramatic confrontation on the beach. The police, who at the best of times need little prompting to resort to force, responded with tear gas and lathis. In neighbouring Tuticorin, a fisherman was killed in police firing.
For a security establishment eager to criminalise the anti-nuclear movement, the battle on the beach was a gift from heaven. But the authorities must treat the unfortunate progression of events as a warning sign of what happens when popular sentiment is systematically brushed aside or dismissed as illegitimate, anti-national or foreign inspired. Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde’s comment that “foreign NGOs” were behind the protest suggests the Centre has learned nothing. Why did he choose not to name any NGO? If he has concrete information with him, why does he not initiate legal proceedings against those concerned, instead of defaming what is clearly a people’s movement comprising local fisherfolk? With the activists now knocking on the Supreme Court’s doors to revisit the clearances given to the plant, it is time all sides stepped back from their maximalist positions. Even after the first reactor at Kudankulam is eventually switched on, the Central and State governments must respect the right of anti-nuclear activists to campaign publicly and peacefully for the closure of the plant. Equally, the activists — like their counterparts in Europe or Japan — must focus on building public support for their cause in Tamil Nadu and elsewhere peacefully and persuasively and not resort to confrontations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-meltdown-of-reason/article3889704.ece
13,9,2012,Libya’s spiral of violence,"As people across the world remember the victims of 9/11, we have been served a reminder that the grim forces that brought it about are far from spent. Wednesday’s assassination of the American ambassador to Libya, amidst the storming of the country’s missions in Benghazi and Cairo, is all the more tragic because of its predictability. For months now, Libya has been witnessing an ever-escalating spiral of violence — spearheaded by jihadist groups hostile to the U.S. Egypt, for its part, has seen serious conflict in the Sinai. In both countries, jihadists have sought, with some success, to use violence and extremism to discredit their establishmentarian Islamist rivals, and overwhelm secular liberal forces. The protesters who attacked the U.S. missions in Cairo and Benghazi — some of them armed — were expressing anger against a film that abused Islam and the Prophet Muhammad. Produced by Israeli-American Sam Bacile, and promoted by Florida-based neo-fundamentalist Christian Terry Jones, the film had remained obscure until Tuesday, when jihadists saw in it an opportunity to mobilise support. In recent decades, the world has become depressingly familiar with religion-inspired fascists using violence to hijack the political agenda, feeding off each other’s deranged propaganda. In themselves, these forces have limited legitimacy. But lawless, ungoverned states have given them the resources, weapons and bases needed for a renaissance.
It has long been clear that the realities of the ‘new Middle East’ the West claimed to have midwifed during the so-called Arab Spring don’t quite match the hype. A resurgent jihadist movement, capitalising on the collapse of authoritarian states, has inflicted ever-worsening violence from Libya and Mali, to Somalia, Syria and Yemen. It is true that the regimes swept aside by public anger — and, in the case of Libya, U.S. and European bombs — were despotisms, with a contempt for freedoms and rights that their, at best, equivocal secularism did not mitigate. In country after country, though, it is becoming abundantly clear that evicting despots does not, in itself, give rise to either democracy or progress. Even in places where electoral democracy has made progress, like Egypt and Tunisia, extremist movements have inflicted real damage to cultural and gender freedoms. The assassinated American envoy helped establish U.S. presence in rebel-held Benghazi in the war that swept away Muammar Qaddafi’s regime. With presidential and Congressional elections around the corner, it will be tempting for U.S. politicians to respond to his killing with shows of machismo. In fact, a little introspection might prove more productive.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/libyas-spiral-of-violence/article3889705.ece
14,9,2012,A fair deal for domestic work,"The decade-long efforts to legislate decent working conditions for domestic labour globally are at last coming to fruition. The International Labour Organisation’s new global standard — Convention 189 — that seeks to regulate working conditions for millions of people employed in households and guarantee basic protection for them will enter into force next year. This follows the latest ratification of the Convention by the Philippines and a few months earlier by Uruguay. The provisions relating to reasonable working hours and weekly rest of at least 24 consecutive hours are of particular concern in the developing world, notoriously wanting in minimum safety measures for women workers. Given the peculiar characteristics of domestic work behind closed doors, monitoring and punishing violations can prove difficult. The Convention also incorporates stipulations to make the terms and conditions of employment explicit to workers, restrict in-kind payments and respect workers’ rights, including the right to association and collective bargaining. The effectiveness of these provisions would depend on the overall prospects of trade unions in the workplace generally, aided by a conducive political climate and a proactive judiciary. Significantly, but not surprisingly, stipulations on minimum wages are missing in the Convention. Notwithstanding this omission, the objectives entailed in the new standard could potentially alter the situation on the ground quite radically. Prevalent social attitudes on domestic work, that are at best paternalistic, should make way to a greater recognition of its status as an important economic activity.
When it comes to the situation in India, any attempt to regulate domestic work and streamline standards must surely be welcomed. Sadly, the Manmohan Singh government has not yet deemed it fit to ratify this path-breaking labour convention. Ironically, making the Convention part of domestic statute could strengthen some of the government’s steps in related areas. A case in point is the Cabinet’s approval to amend the law to completely abolish child labour in the country. The amendment would contribute to realising more fully the right to compulsory basic education for children. Similarly, regulating the conditions of domestic labour — an extremely laudable social objective in itself — would enormously augment the goal of expanding basic education, considering that large numbers of children are employed as household workers. Above all, according legal recognition to domestic work will complement the governments’ efforts to combat crimes against women and children.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-fair-deal-for-domestic-work/article3893602.ece
14,9,2012,New quartet takes stage,"Monday’s meeting of diplomats from Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Iran represents a bold and welcome move by regional powers to end the bloody civil war in Syria and push for a political settlement to the conflict there. Conceived by Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi at the September 4 meeting of the Arab League in Cairo, the most innovative aspect of the initiative is the decision to bring Damascus’s main backer, Iran, into the negotiations over Syria. At some level, the Morsi plan may well indicate discontent among ordinary Arabs that their own governments have done little to bring about an end to a conflict that has killed 23,000 people so far and is growing worse by the day, with atrocities reliably reported on both sides. The move shows democratic responsiveness, particularly in Egypt, to the voters who have given the Muslim Brotherhood’s political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party, both a parliamentary majority and the presidency, and have thereby legitimised a stance much less subservient to American policies and interests than earlier Egyptian positions. It also stands in sharp contrast to the League’s conduct over the West’s regime-change operation in Libya in 2011.
The members of what has been called the new Middle East quartet may well be concerned that the Syrian civil war could start a Sunni-Shia conflagration throughout the region, particularly after Iraq’s collapse into sectarian violence following the illegal United States-led invasion in 2003. A significant advantage of the new plan is Tehran’s positive reaction, which includes suggesting that Iraq be included. In addition, 45 representatives of Syrian opposition groups have published a discussion document which details proposals for institutions Syria could have in a post-Assad transition period, including a non-party military under civilian control. These and the new quartet’s proposals have the great merit of emerging from regional governments and other actors, despite their internal differences, but the U.S. and the United Kingdom have said they do not think Iran can play a constructive role. British foreign minister William Hague has gratuitously added that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s departure from power is “inevitable” and that his regime is “doomed.” Such negative responses can only imply that the major western powers are not interested in plans devised within the region and, worse still, might even want those to fail. One hopes, in the wake of this week’s deadly attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi — the first Arab city to be “liberated” by occidental ordnance since 2003 — that the dangers of imposing “regime change” on Syria will have become more apparent to the West.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/new-quartet-takes-stage/article3893604.ece
15,9,2012,Multi-brand Mulayam,"The political impact of the United Progressive Alliance government’s decision to allow foreign direct investment will revolve around the answer to a simple question: what will Mulayam Singh do? The Samajwadi leader is already on record as saying his party — which extends outside support to the UPA — will not back the Congress in Parliament if its allies start deserting. But will he carry out his implied threat if West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who opposes FDI in retail, backs a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the winter session? With Mulayam Singh adding his name to the crowd of Prime Ministerial contenders aspiring to succeed Dr. Singh after the next general election, the answer to these questions has become especially difficult. In 1996, the former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister came within a whisker of becoming Prime Minister and was pipped at the post by H.D. Deve Gowda, who himself was second choice to head the United Front Government after Jyoti Basu. In politics, a week is a long time and in the 16 years since Mr. Mulayam Singh’s unsuccessful bid, a whole new crop of potential Prime Ministers from different social segments has emerged, among them Rahul Gandhi, Nitish Kumar, J. Jayalalithaa and Mayawati, not to mention the half-dozen or so wannabes in the Bharatiya Janata Party. Besides, in recent days it has been rather difficult to figure out where exactly the SP leader stands.
Mr. Mulayam Singh’s quicksilver mood changes have seen him, by turns, seek the militant company of Ms. Banerjee, revert to the Congress as its supporter, and float the idea of an ever-elusive Third Front, with himself as leader, of course. Ahead of the recent presidential election, the SP chief joined hands with Ms Banerjee in rejecting Pranab Mukherjee’s name. Though the joint venture was a spectacular failure, the twosome have continued with their on-again, off-again collaboration. One big constraint is that Ms Banerjee and the Third Front are mutually exclusive. She cannot take membership of any front that has the Left parties and without the latter there cannot be a Third Front, which in any case seems very iffy what with no party in any hurry to sign up for it. For the SP to be taken seriously post-election, it would need to win 50-odd Lok Sabha seats from U.P., which is a tall order given the declining popularity of the Akhilesh Yadav government and the bridgeable three percentage point difference in vote share with the Bahujan Samaj Party. Mulayam’s best bet, then, might be to continue to dangle the carrot of support to the Congress, hoping no doubt to extract whatever legal concessions he can for himself and his family.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/multibrand-mulayam/article3897887.ece
15,9,2012,Inflation gets diesel power,"From a narrow fiscal perspective, Friday’s hike of Rs.5 a litre of diesel was probably unavoidable given the pressure on the finances of oil companies and the inability of the government to bail them out. Yet one cannot help but point out that the shock of such a large price increase, both on the economy and the common man, would have been lower if only the government had practised the policy of regular adjustment of oil product prices. A sudden release of pent-up price pressure can have a cascading effect on economy-wide prices that is greater than the cumulative impact of small increases. Inflation in August at 7.55 per cent is already higher than July’s 6.87 per cent and the effect across the economy of higher diesel prices will only push it up further. Consumers will be hit not just by higher prices of everything from transport to food commodities — freight operators have already increased rates — but also by the elimination of a part of the subsidy on cooking gas. The price increases and the rebound in latest inflation figures have probably put paid to any hopes of a reduction in interest rates in the upcoming mid-quarter monetary policy review next week.
The government will also, sooner than later, have to take a call on a dual pricing policy for diesel or on imposing higher duties on diesel cars and utility vehicles. Latest automobile sales data show that sport utility vehicles (SUVs), which are powered by diesel engines, are outselling passenger cars and within the latter category, diesel cars are fast overrunning petrol engine models. This is clearly a function of the wide gulf between petrol and diesel prices — after the increase, diesel will still be cheaper than petrol by an average of 31 per cent across the country. The difference in prices is baffling considering that refining costs are approximately the same for the two products. In fact, what we need is transparency in pricing of petroleum products, something that is currently absent. The government goes by the “under-recoveries” of the oil companies, which is the difference between landed import costs of petroleum products and their retail selling price. The former is always higher than the latter leading to “under-recoveries.” The oil companies need to be asked why diesel and petrol prices should be benchmarked to Dubai and Singapore market prices respectively when they are not imported from these places. Petroleum product prices should be a function of the cost of importing and refining crude oil in the country. The present pricing system is flawed and consumers pay for the inefficiencies of the oil companies",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/inflation-gets-diesel-power/article3897888.ece
17,9,2012,Irrational exuberance,"The stock market and large sections of the media have reacted with predictable euphoria to last week’s bold economic announcements, hoping that the latest reform measures will revive the ‘animal spirits’ of entrepreneurs and reverse the slowdown in growth. There is no doubt that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is telling global investors he is willing to take decisive action on contentious economic issues. As policy, however, the individual announcements do not amount to much on the macroeconomic plane. For instance, the stiff hike in the retail prices of diesel will inflict severe pain on the economy by driving up inflation, which is already at unacceptably high levels. Households will have to bear the burden of higher fuel charges and prices for other goods. Of course, the justification for the fuel hike is that it will, to an extent, rein in subsidies and help repair government finances. But this kind of shock therapy is not the most effective or rational way of sorting out the fisc, or indeed the financial health of the oil-marketing companies.
Despite widespread opposition, the government has permitted foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail, subject to a cap of 51 per cent on the share of foreign equity. Companies like Walmart and countries like the United States have lobbied aggressively for the doors of the Indian retail sector to be thrown open. By including this policy in the recent slew of liberalisation measures — even at the risk of losing some of its political legitimacy — the Congress is sending a message to international capital. However, since India’s quasi-federal structure complicates matters, the decision on whether to actually allow FDI in retail has been left to the State governments. As expected, many State governments have already said they have no intention of permitting FDI into this sector. Thus, signalling the commitment to reform seems more important than actually ensuring FDI entry into retail. The assumption seems to be that foreign investors would still respond positively, contributing to growth in output and employment somewhere, even if not in retail. However, growth has fallen and organised sector employment stagnated even though most areas are already open to foreign investors. The government’s optimism is, therefore, clearly misplaced.
Even within the retail trade, the government’s claim that FDI is good for the nation is difficult to defend. The success of large retail cannot be based only on the expansion of the retail space, but requires acquiring a share of the existing space occupied by small retailers. NSSO data for 2009-10 indicate that the occupational category consisting largely of the wholesale and retail trade employed 44 million Indians. The displacement of a substantial number of these workers is inevitable. Since the economies of scale and scope that size delivers in organised retailing are expected to reduce costs by raising labour productivity, the expansion of large retail will not compensate for this employment loss. Further, once cost reduction leads to displacement of traditional retailers, big players dominating the space would be in a position to increase retail margins, with implications for prices paid by consumers. Finally, cost reduction is ensured at the expense of the producers as well. When a few buyers dominate the retail trade, the prices paid to competing small suppliers, especially in agriculture, are depressed. The margin above production costs implicit in the retail price shifts in favour of the retailers at the expense of producers and consumers. Of course, such adverse outcomes would follow from increased domestic investment in organised retail as well. But the entry of foreign firms with deep pockets would hasten the rise to dominance of large retail and amplify the adverse consequences.
Turning to the other big headline, the decision to permit foreign airlines to take a 49 per cent stake in a domestic carrier may not benefit those who need such investment the most. Investment in tottering airlines can come only on very onerous terms to existing shareholders or, as was seen during the early days of private airlines in India, from murky sources. Whether in airlines or retail, then, the expectation of large, stable dollar inflows through foreign direct investment in these sectors may not materialise fast enough to make a difference to the economy’s near- or even medium-term growth prospects. It is evident, therefore, that the immediate hopes of the government are being pinned on the renewed push towards public sector disinvestment. The Congress is hoping that the sale of PSU shares will bring in revenue, boost the equity market and signal ‘reform’ to a corporate sector whose faith in the party is slowly flagging. Here too, the danger is that bright and cheerful signals may not be enough to turn things around. What the economy needs today is not the red herring of reform in retail but actual economic governance on the ground. Poor roads and ports and erratic power supply hurt the competitiveness of Indian manufacturing and are the main reason why the sector has slowed down. The ability for companies to earn easy resource rents from spectrum, gas, coal and iron ore is another. Tackling these problems requires strong, decisive leadership; unless the UPA is prepared to provide some, the applause it is getting from the investor community today will not add up to anything durable.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/irrational-exuberance/article3904601.ece
18,9,2012,An excessive remedy,"The Supreme Court order on the appointment of Information Commissioners has had an unsettling effect on the working of the Right to Information Act, an elegant seven-year old law that has immeasurably empowered the average citizen. What was designed as an easy-to-use legal tool for the poor and weak may now be at risk of getting tangled in a web of complexity. The Court has, inter alia, ruled that the competent authority should prefer a person who is or has been a judge of the High Court for appointment as Information Commissioners, while the head of the Information Commissions at the Centre or State shall only be a person who is or has been a Chief Justice of a High Court or a Judge of the Supreme Court. The reasoning is that these bodies perform judicial and quasi-judicial functions and such qualifications are essential to meet the ends of justice. The decision comes in the wake of complaints that the system of appointing Information Commissioners lacks transparency. That is true. Some States follow a closed-door appointments process, packing Commissions with favoured bureaucrats and political loyalists. Yet, the scale of the remedy is excessive. By specifying qualifications for appointments and instituting new working methodologies for Commissions, which it wants legislated, the court clearly intrudes into executive privilege.
The RTI Act has escaped many attempts by the Centre to whittle down its scope, with civil society rising to its defence each time. Given the culture of secrecy and pervasive corruption, the law is a nightmare for many in authority. But it has weathered the test of judicial scrutiny. Major questions on its scope have been decided by the courts, including high profile issues such as the judges’ assets case. Also, the majority of appeals before Information Commissions are those filed by citizens seeking simple information. The exceptions on disclosure under Section 8 of the RTI Act are clear, and the law leaves all other information held by public authorities open — there is little scope there for judicial interpretation. In any case, several orders of the Commissions in favour of citizens are challenged by officials in regular courts. So far, the appellate process has been refreshingly uncomplicated, as the applicant can appear in person, without the need for advocates, and the proceedings are in plain language. If poor citizens have to appear before a bench that has a judicial member and face lawyers employed by public authorities, the resulting asymmetry of power would clearly defeat the purpose of the law. The Supreme Court is correct in calling for due advertisement and a rational basis for appointments to Commissions. But it should leave that task to Parliament to execute.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-excessive-remedy/article3908067.ece
18,9,2012,Sound strategy,"The Reserve Bank of India has brought down the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) by 0.25 percentage points but left the policy repo rates unchanged. The reduction in the reserve ratio will release Rs.17, 000 crore into the banking system immediately. The expectation is that this extra liquidity will induce banks to reduce interest rates, an outcome keenly sought by sections of industry. The central bank’s approach is tactically sound: a more direct interest rate signal through a repo rate cut would be against the grain of recent monetary policy actions which have accorded primacy to curbing inflation, without entirely ignoring growth concerns. Headline WPI inflation has remained sticky at around 7.5 per cent throughout the financial year. For August it was at 7.55, up from a 32-month low of 6.87 per cent in July. Core inflation pressures remained firm with non-food manufactured products inflation inching up from 5.1 per cent in April to 5.6 per cent in August. In every category, the easing of price pressures on a few items has been offset by a rise in others. Fuel inflation in August has picked up on the back of an upward revision in electricity prices. The recent hike in diesel prices and rationalisation of LPG subsidy will add to overall price pressures.
Inflationary pressures are likely to be underpinned by the recent actions of the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve, which will have the overall effect of boosting global liquidity. That in turn will drive up global commodity prices. For India, imported inflation will remain a threat over the near term. All these suggest that there is no way to shift the monetary policy focus away from countering inflation and anchoring inflation expectations. However, even though domestic growth remains sluggish, the recent reform measures announced by the government have, according to the RBI, started reversing sentiments. Reducing fuel subsidies and selling stakes in public sector companies will lead to some fiscal consolidation. But these, like the moves to stimulate foreign direct investment, will take time before their potential benefits are realised. Without in any way discounting monetary policy’s role in supporting the growth revival, the RBI is categorical in stating that continuing inflationary pressures alongside risks emerging from the current account deficit and fiscal deficit constrain a stronger policy response to growth risks. Restricting monetary action to a CRR cut for now is a good idea. It gives the central bank time and space to reorient policy in response to the evolving growth-inflation dynamics.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sound-strategy/article3908065.ece
19,9,2012,A muddled campaign,"The current U.S. presidential election ratings showing Barack Obama leading his Republican challenger Mitt Romney by seven percentage points among registered voters and only three among likely voters reveal the uncertainty surrounding the whole election. As President, Mr. Obama faces new challenges in West Asia and North Africa, with public anger spreading throughout the region over the inflammatory internet film Innocence of Muslims. Washington’s strategy has been shaken by an attack in Benghazi, in which the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens, and three colleagues were killed. The attack may have been a premeditated one by al Qaeda and not a reaction to the film as had initially been assumed, underlining the fact that U.S.-led interventions from Afghanistan to Libya have not produced the sort of outcomes the American people were promised by their leaders. In addition, the risk is worsening of a confrontation with Iran and possibly Russia over Syria. As for the U.S. economy, unemployment may have fallen by about a fifth during Mr. Obama’s presidency, to 8.1 per cent, but that does not include those who have stopped seeking work, and the August job-creation figure of 96,000 was below the symbolic 100,000 mark.
Mr. Romney, for his part, faces an even messier picture. Eminent Republicans want him to state his policies so that voters might at least have some idea about what he would do in office, but the gaffe-prone candidate seems unable to come up with anything but gaffes. His criticism of the President over the Benghazi attack has been seen as all but anti-national in a time of crisis. Secondly, he has given the Democrats a gift by saying at a closed-door Republican donors’ meeting that the 47 per cent of Americans who would vote for Mr. Obama “no matter what” pay no income tax and believe they are “entitled to healthcare, to food, to housing, to you name it”. The President instantly replied that Mr. Romney had written off half the population. As if that were not enough, Mr. Romney’s aides in Madison, Wisconsin, called the police when workers at an Illinois factory funded by Mr. Romney’s former company Bain Capital tried to deliver a 35,000-signature petition asking it not to outsource jobs to China. Even Mr. Romney’s strategists are apparently divided, with the senior campaign organiser Stuart Stevens being blamed for a lacklustre party convention a fortnight ago. Nevertheless, Mr. Obama seems unable to make political capital out of the Republicans’ discomfiture. With an opponent like Mr. Romney, this election is his for the taking. Yet the gap between the two contenders is too close for comfort.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-muddled-campaign/article3911893.ece
19,9,2012,Taking off at last?,"Air India’s new ‘Dreamliner,’ the Boeing 787, makes its inaugural passenger flight today. In a twin strategy to attract passengers and also train more of its pilots to fly the new aircraft, the national carrier has decided to operate it on the Delhi-Chennai and Delhi-Bangalore routes, in addition to international destinations. Curious passengers are bound to be keen on flying in this aircraft, about which so much has been said and written. Of course, the airline has yet to sort out the ‘pilots issue’ with the two associations. Pilots from the ‘Air India’ stream of the national aviation company are not trained to fly this machine, and this ‘discrimination’ led to a devastating strike earlier this year. Coinciding with the delivery of the troubled airline’s first Dreamliner earlier this month, the Union Cabinet cleared a proposal to set up two subsidiaries to hive off the engineering and ground handling services. With these simultaneous developments, things may finally be looking up for the erstwhile ‘Maharajah.’ Between now and March 2013, 14 of these massive aircraft will be handed over to Air India, enabling it to operate long-haul flights across the world.
The move to set up the subsidiaries was cleared by the Air India Board two years ago, as a plan to create profit centres and hive off thousands of employees. Its aircraft-to-manpower ratio last year was 263, nearly double that of the other airlines operating in the country. While Air India Engineering Services Ltd. will take care of maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) operations in the country, Air India Transport Services Ltd. will take charge of ground handling services at the airports. The MRO wing will accommodate 7000 of Air India’s staff, and the ground handling services can absorb 12,000 employees. That will leave Air India itself with a staff of about 10,000. The creation of these subsidiaries involves equity of Rs. 768 crore, which will be part of the Central government’s rescue package for the national carrier. The expectation is that the MRO business could generate enough profits, considering that all airlines in India, and many in the Asia-Pacific region fly out to Europe, Dubai or Singapore for these works. The MRO business in the Asia-Pacific region alone is worth about $ 1.5 billion every year, and the new company could tap this huge and growing market. Ultimately, Air India will have to become profitable and start paying the Centre back for the generous infusion of capital and funds as and when required. Who knows, if the airline does become profitable, there could well be suitors for a stake in it, now that the Government of India has cleared 49 per cent FDI in the aviation sector.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/taking-off-at-last/article3911891.ece
20,9,2012,Mamata’s revolt,"Regardless of whether the conflict between the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance and the Trinamool Congress affects the lifespan of the government or not, one thing is clear: Mamata Banerjee was pushed to the brink by those in the Centre who callously assumed she would go against the interests of her core constituency. For all the West Bengal Chief Minister’s reputation for being deliberately difficult, this is one time when she cannot be faulted. Ms Banerjee’s vote base is formed overwhelmingly by the underprivileged and she could not have stayed on in the Manmohan Singh government without appearing to agree with the patently anti-poor thrust of its new economic announcements. The sharp increase in the price of diesel and the ceiling placed on subsidised cooking gas cylinders cannot but further burden those already severely distressed by runaway inflation and shrinking job opportunities. Matters were made worse by the insensitive handling of the crisis by Congress managers who not only aggressively pushed these measures — including foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail for which there is virtually no political support in Parliament — but also dared Ms Banerjee to act on her threat to withdraw support. The Trinamool leader saw the taunts as an assault on her self-respect and did precisely what the Congress believed she would not do. Twenty-four hours later, her language has toughened. The chances of her backing off can safely be assumed to be zero.
Ms Banerjee won the last Assembly election by positioning herself as a left alternative to the Left Front and cannot afford to change tack now. She was admittedly not the easiest of allies. And yet the Congress and the government had perforce to be sensible in dealing with her if only in view of the UPA’s precarious numbers in the Lok Sabha. On Friday, when the withdrawal of the TMC’s support for the UPA takes effect, the government will still command a majority in the Lok Sabha because of the outside support provided by the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party. Even in the event that Mulayam Singh joins forces with Ms Banerjee — both stand to gain from an early general election — the UPA will survive. But the Congress ought to introspect on the fact that it does not have the electoral mandate to pursue the kind of reform measures it is pushing. Last November, it decided not to go ahead with FDI in retail when it realised the majority of parties and MPs opposed the idea. Despite Mamata’s exit, Congress managers have the skill to win tactical skirmishes with the Opposition on the floor of the house. But in pursuing the chimera of Walmart-induced growth, the UPA runs the risk of losing the one big battle that is looming in 2014.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mamatas-revolt/article3915458.ece
20,9,2012,Kerala as investors’ paradise,"The complex challenges that Kerala faces on the development front are well known. Blessed with nature’s bounty and human development indices comparable to the best in the West, the State has been on an economic upswing thanks to an industrious and cash-rich emigrant population and a thriving, though at times battered, cash crop economy. Rising incomes have led to a boom in the consumer goods and services market. The labour scene has been relatively peaceful of late. So what’s the problem? A narrow agricultural and industrial production base, acute scarcity of land for big ticket investments and the absence of political consensus on the most suitable development trajectory have all been hampering Kerala’s efforts to embrace new-age development. If the plans unveiled at the ‘Emerging Kerala’ business and investment summit held last week are implemented, however, the State might well be on its way to finding solutions for these vexing issues.
Unlike the Global Investor Meet (GIM) held in 2003, which was focused on bagging investment promises then and there, the Emerging Kerala summit aimed to project the State as a friendly investment destination. Given the disappointing outcome of GIM, which resulted in a trifling sum flowing in by way of investment, the Oommen Chandy-led United Democratic Front government walked the knife’s edge, reassuring doubters on both sides of Kerala’s highly polarised political divide about its intentions and its resolve to play the game by the rules. In the event, the summit generated considerable interest in the business community both in and outside the country. The deliberations produced, by the State government’s reckoning, some 45 positively actionable investment proposals having a combined outlay of around Rs. 45,000 crore, many of these from non-resident Malayalis. There was keen investor interest in areas such as tourism, public infrastructure and transport, IT and total healthcare solutions. It is still too early to assess the summit’s outcome and what awaits the government is an obstacle course. The real test would come when the hard bargaining begins. The government would have to take the sensitivities of the local ecology and communities on board when deciding on land utilisation. Mr. Chandy and his team also have the difficult task of building political and civil society consensus on each project. That the Opposition, despite staying away from the summit, did not try to put a spanner in the summit works could be a good sign. But that is for starters and there is a good distance to cover before Kerala really emerges as a favoured destination for investment.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/kerala-as-investors-paradise/article3915459.ece
21,9,2012,Reason in distress,"A compromise that leaves both sides unhappy is usually fair. At the meeting of the Cauvery River Authority, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh must have been looking for the golden mean that would have gone some distance in meeting the water requirements of Tamil Nadu without overly depriving the upper riparian Karnataka. Not surprisingly, his ruling, as chairman of the CRA, that Karnataka release 9,000 cusecs of water daily (0.7 thousand million cubic feet) for 25 days till October 15, when the northeast monsoon is expected to bring rains in Tamil Nadu, saw both States dissatisfied to varying degrees. While Karnataka Chief Minister Jagdish Shettar walked out of the meeting in protest, Tamil Nadu Chief Minster Jayalalithaa announced that the State would again approach the Supreme Court. Actually, the quantum awarded to Tamil Nadu is less than the 10,000 cusecs a day (0.86 tmc ft) that Karnataka told the Supreme Court it was prepared to release to Tamil Nadu till the CRA meeting. Tamil Nadu had scaled down its demand to the “minimum” and sought at least one tmc ft a day for 30 days to save the 15 lakh acres of samba crop in the Cauvery delta. Now, it is not sure if Karnataka would even comply with the CRA chairman’s award, which is statutorily final in the event of consensus eluding the meeting. True, Karnataka will have to also meet the drinking water needs of Bangalore from the Cauvery, besides the irrigation needs in the basin. However, in years of water deficit, the States will have to share the distress equally, and Karnataka is obliged to abide by the ruling. To not do so under political compulsions is to seriously challenge the authority of the duly-constituted CRA and the Supreme Court, which ordered the convening of the CRA.
But the errant behaviour of Karnataka is no reason for Tamil Nadu too to reject the CRA ruling. By doing so, it is only damaging its own case. The proper course would have been to accept the ruling, even if under protest, and then approach the Supreme Court for additional water. Undermining the authority of the CRA can do Tamil Nadu no good, whether in the short-term or the long-term. In Karnataka, Mr. Shettar has called for an all-party meeting to discuss the outcome of the CRA meeting. By striving for a broader political consensus within the State on this sensitive issue, the BJP Chief Minister is attempting to buy political insurance. However, Ms Jayalalithaa will have more to gain, politically and otherwise, by adopting a reasoned, sober approach to this vexed issue. Matching Mr. Shettar in aggression and defiance will fetch neither popular support for her party nor water for the farmers in the delta.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/reason-in-distress/article3919024.ece
21,9,2012,Hold on to the savings,"Given the strong anecdotal evidence of households shifting their investments away from financial savings instruments, corroboration from official agencies was perhaps not needed. Even so, the Reserve Bank of India’s finding that household financial savings fell to 7.8 per cent of the GDP in 2011-12 is a major cause for concern. It is the lowest in 11 years and way below the average of 11 per cent in the three preceding years. Since government savings today are in negative territory and corporate retained earnings are under stress, the fall in household financial savings will have an adverse impact on the government’s efforts at stepping up investment. A number of factors are at play here. Many more individuals are investing in gold and physical assets such as real estate. Gold has always been in demand for making jewellery but its recent track record as an investment asset that delivers high returns that few forms of financial savings can match explains the phenomenal increase in its demand. Gold is more easily available to the ordinary man than ever before. A large number of banks sell gold. While banks have always lent against gold, a few non-banking finance companies, many from Kerala, have cashed in on the demand and exponentially increased their lending. The RBI, concerned with such rapid growth, has clamped down in a few cases. The other big macroeconomic worry arises from the fact that very large gold imports widen the trade imbalance and the current account deficit.
Policy measures to increase, if not at least retain, financial savings should involve a two pronged approach. The lure of gold cannot be countered by clamping down on imports: the trade will simply shift underground. Instead, innovative ways of integrating the bullion and the financial markets must be encouraged. Already, besides gold loans, exchange traded funds in gold have gained acceptance. Commercial banks should be given the wherewithal to offer gold backed deposit schemes of the type offered in important financial centres like Singapore. The other part of the strategy is to make the existing financial savings avenues more attractive to investors. Recently, the SEBI has tried to provide additional incentives to mutual funds and their distributors. The government has sought to popularise the equity cult among small investors with mixed results. Bank deposits continue to account for over 50 per cent of financial savings. But this is hardly an unequivocal endorsement of the most traditional form of savings. An average bank depositor has many valid reasons to complain. Limited tax concessions and the hassles in obtaining tax deduction certificates are just a few.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/hold-on-to-the-savings/article3919028.ece
22,9,2012,Sleeping with the enemy,"Sometimes, your most valuable friend is no more than your enemy’s enemy. For the beleaguered Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government, the fresh commitment of support from Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh on Friday is a lifeline in the nick of time. Mr. Singh’s support is conditional: he is as opposed to Foreign Direct Investment in retail as is Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee, whose withdrawal from the UPA created the present crisis for the government. But his political compulsions could see him propping up the government till 2014, when the next Lok Sabha election is due. Under pressure from his constituency of Muslims to deny the Bharatiya Janata Party even an inch of additional political space, Mr. Singh is often forced to speed into the open arms of the Congress. The Congress is an enemy of the SP but not bigger than the BJP, which must be stopped at all costs from gaining in the event of a mid-term poll. For all the SP’s stupendous performance in the February assembly election in U.P., the simple truth is that the Akhilesh Yadav government needs time to consolidate itself. If the SP is to go to the people in a general election, it would surely need to show results in U.P. A key factor here is Central assistance, which has already been promised to the State. In the event, Mr. Singh’s rationalisation of his decision to continue to support the UPA was predictable: to keep “communal forces” (read the BJP) at bay. Whether or not the Congress counted on the SP’s support while pushing Ms Banerjee over the brink is difficult to say but, surely, party managers were aware of the predicament of Mr. Singh: of having to keep one eye on the BJP while taking on the Congress.
All the talk of a Third Front will thus have to necessarily wait till 2014. A day after holding hands with leaders of the Left parties in support of the Bharat bandh against the hike in diesel price, the cap on the number of domestic LPG cylinders, and the reform measures of the UPA government, Mr. Singh thinks nothing of pronouncing support to the UPA. Honest about his prime ministerial ambitions, the SP leader is pragmatic too. While striving to increase his party’s leverage at the Centre, he would not do anything to bring down the Congress-led government unless he is sure of replacing it with a non-BJP government. Thus, the Congress-SP showdown is unlikely to happen before the next general election. Like partners in a marriage of convenience, the two parties cannot live with or without each other. After all, it is not love that holds them together, but the common hatred of a third party, the BJP.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sleeping-with-the-enemy/article3923432.ece
22,9,2012,Sayonara nuclear power,"The much needed big push towards low-cost, highly-efficient, cutting-edge renewable energy technologies was lacking till recently. Even the compulsion to cut down carbon dioxide emission levels by 2020 failed to overcome the inertia. But the landscape has squarely and dramatically changed following the 9 magnitude earthquake and killer tsunami waves that resulted in the catastrophic accident in the Fukushima nuclear reactor units in Japan. In what may appear as well co-ordinated announcements made very recently, Japan and France, both major nuclear power champions, have announced their departure from nuclear energy dependence. If March 11, 2011 has gone down in history as a dark day for Japan, the government’s September 14 decision to end its reliance on nuclear power by 2040 by closing down all 50 reactors will forever be remembered as a defining moment. This will, in all probability, mark the beginning of a renewable energy technology revolution. If after World War II, the Japanese people transformed their nation into one of the world’s most industrially developed ones, the possibility of the country producing an encore with alternative energy technology developments cannot be ruled out.
Japan is not alone. The Fukushima shiver has had its reverberations in France as well. By 2025, France will cut its reliance on nuclear energy by 25 per cent from the current level of 75 per cent by shutting down 24 reactors. Six months after the Fukushima catastrophe and following Germany’s decision to get out of nuclear energy by 2022, Siemens had made public its decision to exit nuclear power business. The engineering giant intends to shift its focus to alternative energies. By 2020 Germany intends to derive 35 per cent of its energy needs from renewable sources. While critics decry Japan’s plan to wait another three decades before switching off its last nuclear plant, the decision is not without basis. Some 30 per cent of the country’s power requirement is met by these plants. Decommissioning operating plants that have not completed their lifetime will mean economical suicide. This period also gives Japan the time to develop and scale up revolutionary technologies that are better adapted to harness power from even very low wind speed, and low-intensity sunlight for the better part of the year in countries situated in higher latitudes. The focus will also be on developing technologies for harnessing wave energy. To begin with, the cost of production using these alternative technologies may be higher than even nuclear. But costs are bound to fall over time and wider acceptance is inevitable.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sayonara-nuclear-power/article3923436.ece
24,9,2012,"Old arguments, warmed up","While seeking support from the aam aadmi for the “hard decisions” which his government took a few days earlier, Manmohan Singh’s televised address to the nation was devoid of any new messages. Reiterating the government’s stand, the Prime Minister maintained that the diesel price hike and the capping of cooking gas cylinders were unavoidable in the context of the burgeoning subsidy bill. If the government had not acted, the unsustainable fiscal situation would have led to a further rise in prices and a loss of confidence in the economy among domestic and foreign investors. What the Prime Minister left unanswered was the key question of why he waited so long to make the eventual hike so steep. Surely a transparent mechanism administered by an independent regulator to oversee the gradual and periodic transmission of global oil prices to the domestic retail sector would have been more equitable and politically acceptable. On the other contentious proposal of foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail, the Prime Minister provided no clues as to why a wider discussion with the States and other stakeholders to seek a consensus was not possible. Nor did he disabuse the notion that with the relaxation, foreign money will be available on tap.
The two measures announced last week by the Finance Minister, ostensibly to give a further impetus to economic reform, are not new either. They carry forward certain budgetary initiatives announced earlier this year. As part of a general easing of external commercial borrowings (ECB) norms, the government has notified a reduction in the withholding tax from 20 to 5 per cent for 3 years. The relaxation in the ECB policy, meant to facilitate cheaper overseas borrowing by Indian corporates including those engaged in infrastructure, will in practice increase the level of short-term external debt. That is why this concession is unwise from a macroeconomic perspective. Indeed, past policies have sought to restrain such loans which have, for the borrowers, involved the additional risk arising from exchange rate fluctuations. As for the sycophantically named Rajiv Gandhi Equity Savings Scheme (RGESS), it is intended to give a fillip to the equity cult by giving first time investors attractive tax concessions. The RGESS has now been extended to cover mutual fund investments but it is still going to be a mammoth task to assure first time investors that it is safe to invest their hard-earned savings in stocks and shares. While SEBI will provide operational details, the basic question of whether tax policy should at all be used to encourage inherently risky equity investments remains unanswered.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/old-arguments-warmed-up/article3929555.ece
24,9,2012,Bark without bite,"It is a principle of politics that the fortunes of the ruling dispensation and the principal Opposition should be inversely related. Apparently not so in the case of the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party. The final break between the United Progressive Alliance and estranged ally Trinamool Congress ought to have worked as a booster shot for the BJP which hasn’t had much to celebrate lately. Yet a day before UPA-Trinamool relations reached the anticipated denouement, Nitin Gadkari was assuring the Manmohan Singh government that his party would do nothing to destabilise it. The BJP chief might have been an avuncular elder feeling all protective about his wayward ward than a bitter adversary buoyed by the prospect of seizing victory. Mr. Gadkari’s perplexing answer to why the BJP was not at the forefront of the agitation against the government’s new economic measures was that his party was quite happy to take the backseat to the Left and the Samajwadi Party. A sober, reflective BJP is entirely out of character. It is odder still that the metamorphosis should have occurred at the precise moment when the Congress was at its most vulnerable.
The BJP boisterously disrupted the monsoon session of Parliament over Coalgate, ignoring the Opposition consensus on fighting the government on the floor of the House. Party leaders Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley declared that they would prefer “magnificent isolation” to compromising on critical national interests. It cannot be that the BJP does not see Manmohan Singh’s economic measures as seriously damaging the national interest because it has expressed itself rather strongly against them. Mr. Gadkari is simply making a virtue of necessity in refusing to take this opposition to its logical end. The BJP cannot topple the government as long as it is being propped up by the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party. Even if SP chief Mulayam Singh were to pull the plug at a later date, there is no certainty that the numbers will stack up against UPA-II, given the political resistance to facing an early poll. BJP stalwarts are unlikely to have forgotten the loss of face suffered by the party as a consequence of the UPA-I government winning the July 2008 vote of confidence. Quite aside from all this is the principal Opposition’s lack of battle readiness. A victory in the Gujarat Assembly election will unarguably restore the killer instinct except Narendra Modi’s resurgence will come with its own set of problems: any hint of a larger role for him will halt the NDA’s expansion plan which is a pre-requisite for the BJP to face the big battle.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bark-without-bite/article3929556.ece
25,9,2012,"No, Icann","The impending sanction of generic Top-Level Domains by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers poses serious questions on equity and competition. The importance of domain names to digital commerce cannot be overstated, and the power of the .com or .net is well understood. What Icann proposes to do is to add several hundred gTLDs, starting next year, including those that encompass a wide range of activity in the creative arts, publishing, lifestyle and even community activities. Any entity that is assigned a domain becomes the equivalent of a landlord in cyberspace, with the ability to extract rent from other users. Such control may not pose problems where corporates such as Google are assigned domains that are specific to their companies or brands, .google or .android, for instance. But giving companies monopolistic control over generic words such as .book, .site, .news, .beauty or .app even through an auction process would distort the openness that characterises the Internet. A more equitable arrangement would be to keep such resources accessible in a non-discriminatory way. It is such a broad open culture pioneered by Tim Berners-Lee and others that aided the growth of the Internet in the first place, and not one that narrowly focused on profits.
Internet gTLDs are affected by the digital divide, as the pattern of applications with Icann indicates. Most are from the developed world, and North America dominates; Africa is at a disadvantage due to the complexity and cost. Not many have the resources to pay the $ 185,000 fee for registration and the hardware and infrastructure necessary to run the domain. Even the concessional fee for public interest applicants in the ‘supported’ category remains too steep for most organisations. Governments in such countries could consider aiding national corporations, cities and public institutions to acquire the gTLDs that are of domestic concern. This can prevent monopolies. Equally important is the possibility of fraud. Unless Icann can credibly ascertain ownership of a top level domain, it could be hijacked and used to commit online fraud. Clearly, the more contentious issue is that of domains that are truly generic, such as .book. They require some anti-monopoly safeguards, such as a “no refusal” clause to be incorporated into the registration to protect the interests of all players in the field. In general, a set of predictable consequences for anti-competitive practices should be worth considering for inclusion. More so, since Icann has the stated objective of promoting competition in the gTLD scheme. Where there are credible objections to the distribution of important domain names, Icann would do well not to award them in haste.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-icann/article3932668.ece
25,9,2012,"After sayonara, second thoughts","Now that the dust has settled, the Japanese government’s failure formally to approve a cabinet panel proposal to phase out nuclear energy by 2040 is being seized upon by nuclear industry advocates intent on pressing for the deadline’s eventual abandonment. The government’s Energy and Environment Council — which consists of cabinet ministers — had set a 28-year target for a nuclear-free Japan but the full cabinet baulked at providing unqualified approval for the phase out plan. Instead, the 2040 deadline will only be taken “into consideration” while the government “promote[s] energy and environment policy under constant examination and review,” by engaging in a dialogue with local governments and communities, and seeking the public’s understanding. It is, of course, understandable that Japan — which relied on nuclear power for roughly 30 per cent of its energy requirements till the March 11, 2011 tsunami flooded the Fukushima plant — should exercise abundant caution before committing to abandon this source in about three decades. However, considering the cosy relationship the Japanese government shares with the nuclear industry, the Yoshihiko Noda cabinet’s talk of “examining” and “reviewing” energy policy is a clear signal of how and who will decide the country’s future nuclear landscape.
One has to look at the status of the two Oi nuclear reactors in Fukui Prefecture that were restarted a couple of months ago to understand why so many ordinary Japanese are wary of relying on nuclear reactors to partially power their country. A possibly active geological fault cuts across the Oi nuclear power plant site. According to a July 18 Asahi Shimbun report, active faults have been found or suspected to cut across the Shika nuclear power plant in Ishikawa Prefecture and a few other reactor plant sites. It was only in December 2010 that the old requirement that reactors should not be constructed above ‘active faults’ was replaced with ‘faults.’ The January 1995 Kobe earthquake that ripped the city, and the numerous faults that crisscross the country, is a reminder of how precariously located the reactors are. In the aftermath of the March 11, 2011 quake, stress levels would have increased along many of these faults. Hence, from a long-term safety point of view, it makes sense for the country to firmly commit itself to an increased percentage of energy production from renewable sources. The more work and money Japan puts into renewable energy research, the easier it will be to properly “take into consideration” the 2040 goal despite the obvious pressure.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/after-sayonara-second-thoughts/article3932671.ece
26,9,2012,Power boards get last chance,"The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs’ Rs.1.9 lakh crore debt recast package for State Electricity Boards and distribution companies (discoms) appears to be the last opportunity for the SEBs to set their house in order. The government of India gave the States an earlier opportunity to adopt power sector reforms and recommended the unbundling of the boards to improve their efficiency. Unfortunately, the losses of the electricity agencies have increased over the years and the energy deficit in the country has reached alarming proportions. Except for Gujarat, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, most States are resorting to power cuts and spot purchases from independent power producers to tide over crisis-like situations. The SEBs sometimes buy power at Rs.7 to Rs.8 per unit, and sell it to consumers at anything from Rs.3 to Rs.5 per unit, incurring additional losses. The estimated total losses run up by the SEBs has been pegged at Rs.1.9 lakh crore, which is the package the CCEA has now worked out. States have till December 31, 2012 to opt in. Of course, the money comes with reform strings attached and this is where State governments and their ruling parties have to bite the bullet.
The package has two parts: States have to take over 50 per cent of the liabilities of the SEBs as of March 31, 2012. This part can be converted into bonds to be issued by the discoms to lenders, under guarantee by the State government. The other half of the short-term liabilities will be rescheduled by lenders and serviced by discoms with a three-year moratorium on the principal. To avail themselves of this package, State governments must commit to revising their power tariff annually, through the regulatory boards. The tariff order for 2012-13 will have to be notified before the restructuring package gets approved. The SEBs must also commit to cutting transmission and distribution losses, which account for as much as 40 per cent of output in some States. Of course, revising the power tariff every year in line with the package calls for political will on the part of the State governments. Those States which provide free or cheap power to particular sections of consumers are already obliged to reimburse their SEBs every year. On the upside, rationalisation of tariffs will allow them to mop up more revenue and increase power generation so as to bridge the widening supply-demand deficit. Though there are bound to be political repercussions and even protests, now may well be the last opportunity for the States to revamp their electricity boards and put them on solid financial ground. Of course, it is vital that the regulatory boards objectively validate all tariff revisions, especially in those jurisdictions where private players have entered the distribution business.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/power-boards-get-last-chance/article3935922.ece
26,9,2012,Better planning for floods,"Flash floods and landslips that have followed unusually sustained rainfall since September 17 have left a deadly trail in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. In Sikkim, following a cloudburst in the Chungthang region, homes, bridges, and stretches of highways were washed away. Among those hit were personnel of the Border Roads Organisation and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police. No less than 70 landslips left whole regions cut off in the mountainous terrain. In Arunachal Pradesh, over two lakh people were affected in a wave of floods in five districts. An unusually heavy spell of rain is also threatening the stability of the famed Tawang Monastery in Arunachal Pradesh, precariously perched on a cliff-face, not far from the border with China. Meanwhile, more than 17 lakh people have been hit in 16 districts of Assam in a third round of floods this year. Assam’s human tragedy has been aggravated by the fact that in the Kaziranga National Park, some 75 per cent of the rhino habitat was submerged. The animals were forced to take shelter on high platforms or move across to the hills of Karbi Anglong district. The Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary also remains substantially submerged. In the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park in Tinsukia district, noted for its endangered animal species and wet evergreen forests, elephant calves were swept away by flood waters. Majuli, Asia’s largest inhabited river island in Jorhat district, is almost entirely submerged. It is cut off from the mainland with the ferry service across the Brahmaputra suspended.
Rescue and relief work undertaken by the Army, the Air Force, the National Disaster Response Force and the State Disaster Response Force have provided some comfort, but the scale of the task remains stupendous. The Brahmaputra and its tributaries are a blessing, but also a bane for the region. The river leaves the region fertile and irrigated, even aids mobility by hosting a thriving water transport system. But in its fury, the mighty and meandering hydraulic system has undone and effaced efforts over a long period of time to check and tame it. Lives and livelihoods, crops and infrastructure come under threat time and again. There is, of course, no telling how and when nature will vent its fury. Nevertheless, a clear plan of action based on the science of water management needs to be rolled out for the long term to mitigate damage and help people through what has effectively become an annual round of trouble for the region with the least possible discomfort. Working with the State governments concerned, the Centre should step in to ensure this.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/better-planning-for-floods/article3935914.ece
27,9,2012,Kashmir’s besieged panchayats,"In a State where tens of thousands have been killed in terrorist violence, the death of one more often passes unnoticed. Yet, the assassination on Sunday of Muhammad Shafi Naik, a member of the panchayat of the north Kashmir town of Kreeri, threatens to have seismic consequences. Forty panchs, including 3 sarpanchs, have submitted their resignations to district authorities since the attack; dozens more have put out newspaper advertisements announcing their intent to do so. In the grand scheme of things, these numbers are not large: there are some 35,000 panchs and sarpanchs in the State. Three panchayat leaders have been killed in Jammu and Kashmir this year — against over 40 in Bihar. Moreover, in two of those three murders, police investigations suggest, local feuds may have driven the choice of victims, rather than the fact that they held elected office. Fear is a powerful argument, though — so the trickle of resignations could turn into a deluge.
Should it do so, the consequences would be enormous. The key impact of local democracy in Jammu and Kashmir has been the rebirth of a grassroots political class — swept aside at gunpoint when the jihad in the State began in 1988. From April to June last year, a staggering 79 per cent of Jammu and Kashmir’s 5.07 million registered voters participated in what Chief Minister Omar Abdullah described as the State’s “first real panchayat elections in 33 years”. The 17-phase election saw the election of 4,130 sarpanchs and 29,719 panchs. Elections due in 2006 had been deferred because of security considerations; in 2001, no polling was held in the districts of Kupwara, Baramulla and Bandipora due to terrorist threats. In a speech delivered last December, the separatist Islamist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani showed he understood the threat this new class of politician poses to the cause he represents, saying its birth was part of a “planned conspiracy to mutilate the Muslim identity of Kashmir”. Ironically enough, though, the government has also worked to deny the new leadership real authority. The ruling National Conference has rejected the extension of 73rd amendment of the Indian Constitution, which gives panchayats significant rights and powers, to Jammu and Kashmir, arguing that this would erode the State’s autonomy. It has, however, also chosen not to deliver on promised State legislation to the same effect — thus ensuring that local government in Jammu and Kashmir has far less power than elsewhere in the country. Mr. Abdullah’s officials argue that they can’t post police officers to guard every panch. They are right.

27,9,2012,Rendition of justice,"In a decisive blow against the illegal U.S. policy of “extraordinary rendition’, Italy’s highest court, the Supreme Court of Cassation, has upheld the conviction of 23 American officials for the abduction of Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, in February 2003. The court also enhanced their sentences. Mr. Omar, a political asylee in Italy at the time, was kidnapped by the Central Intelligence Agency in Milan and transferred via Germany to Egypt, where he alleges he was tortured for seven months, often in the presence of American officials. The original trial had taken place in absentia; the Court of Cassation sentenced 22 defendants to seven years and the 23rd, former Milan station head Colonel Robert Seldon Lady, to nine. Upholding the Nuremberg principles, the court refused to accept the plea of many of those convicted that they were merely obeying orders. The court also awarded Mr. Omar € 1 million in damages and his wife half a million. The convicts — 22 of whom are believed to be from the CIA — are probably living in the U.S. and may well not serve their sentences, though they risk arrest if they enter any one of several European countries. U.S. Air Force colonel Joseph L. Romano, who commanded the Aviano Air Base through which Mr. Omar was transferred, plans to challenge his conviction before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, as is his right.
The case is significant because it has confirmed the authority of law over criminal conduct by U.S. officials abroad, even if the ostensible purpose for this illegality was the “war on terror”. Diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks and analysed by Der Spiegel also document how the Italian government turned from craven collaborator to active accomplice, bullying the judiciary at Washington’s behest. All that is history now: the fact that at least one victim of extraordinary rendition is finally getting something resembling justice is a cause for celebration. In the case of Maher Arar, a Canadian national rendered by the U.S. to Syria in 2002, monetary compensation was forthcoming but all efforts at fixing criminal responsibility on the American officials responsible for his removal and subsequent torture have failed with even the U.S. Supreme Court refusing to hear his appeals. Fortunately, Italian prosecutors and judges have shown a greater fidelity to the cause of justice than their North American or European counterparts. The prosecuting magistrate, who pursued the Omar case with great determination, will almost certainly ask for the extradition of the 23 American convicts. The Italian government must not, at that point, develop cold feet.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Rendition-of-justice/article12644171.ece
28,9,2012,Plain speaking to Colombo,"President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s visit to New Delhi last week has helped clear some of the air on India-Sri Lanka relations. Since India’s vote for a resolution pulling up Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva in March this year, Colombo has nursed a sense of betrayal. Competitive politics in Tamil Nadu, which has seen leaders of the Dravidian parties aggressively stake out positions against the Sri Lankan government, has only added to the island nation’s insecurities vis-à-vis India. A stopover by President Rajapaksa in New Delhi en route to Sanchi in Madhya Pradesh — he had been invited to participate in the foundation ceremonies of an international Buddhist university — provided the right opportunity for the two countries to reassert the essentials of their relationship. In the past two decades, the two sides have successfully built friendly ties, which have expanded to include robust economic links. Globally, India is Sri Lanka’s largest trade partner, and in South Asia, Sri Lanka is India’s largest trade partner. Aside from all this, tourist, religious, sporting and educational contacts have thrived. India played a critical diplomatic role in the Sri Lankan military’s defeat of the LTTE. It is no secret that New Delhi feels let down by the Rajapaksa government, which allowed Sinhala triumphalism to dictate political discourse on the Tamil question after its victory on the battlefield instead of moving to settle the issue. Reducing the reality of New Delhi’s interest in this to “Tamil Nadu politics” is to miss the point that India is committed to a peaceful and united Sri Lanka, for which a just resolution of the Tamil question is vital. Nor does the ‘China card’ or ‘Pakistan card’ alter the importance of this for India.
Aside from reiterating shared security interests, India’s message to President Rajapaksa on the urgency of finalising a roadmap towards a political resolution of Tamil aspirations comes not a moment too soon. Talks between the government and the Tamil National Alliance, the political grouping that is an electorally proven representative of the Tamils, have so far gone nowhere. The TNA is sceptical of joining a parliamentary select committee; the labours of previous committees to find a solution to the Tamil question have been unceremoniously shelved. With such a track record, the Sri Lankan government has the greater responsibility in taking steps that will convince Tamils of its sincerity. The holding of elections in the Northern Province is the essential first step. An early announcement of a date for the election would make the path to reconciliation in Sri Lanka that much easier.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/plain-speaking-to-colombo/article3942748.ece
28,9,2012,Uncles and nephews,"Few will believe the claim made by Supriya Sule that her cousin Ajit Pawar resigned from the post of Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra after he listened to his “inner voice” on allegations of a multi-crore scam in the irrigation sector headed by him earlier. Fewer still will believe his reasons for quitting were prompted by the noble intent of paving the way for an impartial white paper on the matter as promised by his bête noire, Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan. The marketplace is rife with resignation theories and chief among them is that Ajit has thrown down the gauntlet in a bid to wrest control of the Nationalist Congress Party from his redoubtable uncle and party president Sharad Pawar. The second most popular theory is the succession issue: that he is miffed after the elder Pawar nominated Ms Sule, who is his daughter, president of the prestigious Yashwantrao Chavan Pratishthan. Ms Sule also heads the NCP’s recently launched Yuvati Congress and is travelling across Maharashtra in an effort to woo young women into the party. Then there is always Ajit Pawar’s dislike of Mr. Chavan and how he is unable to work with him. He took a dim view of the Chief Minister’s action against the corrupt NCP-controlled Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank last year. The alacrity with which Mr. Chavan promised a white paper on irrigation a few months ago also upset his deputy.
Theories apart, it is clear that Ajit Pawar is sulking. He staged a show of dissent in 2009 when the party chose Chhagan Bhujbal as Deputy CM, an arrangement that barely lasted a year. This time, Ajit’s tactics are not working. Sharad Pawar has said that his resignation will be accepted and that the issue is over for the party. He also made it clear that the resignations of the 19 other NCP ministers who quit in solidarity will not be accepted. Though the ministers hastily put in their papers in a show of support for the younger Pawar, most are relieved their resignations can now be taken back. By acting impulsively, Ajit Pawar has put himself in a difficult situation. Even though he continues to be head of the NCP legislature party for now, he needs all the support he can muster to fulfil his dream of heading the State in the next elections. In 2009 he drummed up support from the majority of NCP legislators to demand that he be made Deputy CM. That rush of blood seems to have run cold for now. Sharad Pawar has made it clear that he is still calling the shots. By repressing his nephew’s antics for the time being, he has ensured that unless something more dramatic happens, the shaky coalition in the State will survive.

29,9,2012,"Auctions are dead, long live auctions","No matter how the Manmohan Singh government spins the 2G Presidential Reference judgment, the principle at stake in the Supreme Court’s hearing on the allocation of natural resources was not the method of allotment but the need for transparency and fair play. Air and water, for example, are natural resources that no sane person would suggest allocating via an auction. But in the case of 2G spectrum and coal, the allocations made were arbitrary and often mala fide. The government gave the resources away knowing full well there was a better way of allocating them. Aiming to keep call and power prices low was an afterthought, a “policy” invoked to justify caprice. Senior Ministers are now hailing the court’s acknowledgment that the government has the right to allocate natural resources and that auctions, though preferred, are not mandatory. But even as they toast their “victory,” government managers ought to realise what the court has handed them is a poisoned chalice. Indeed, its opinion has placed new riders that will make it harder for discretionary powers to be abused. From now on, the state’s actions have to “be fair, reasonable, non-discriminatory, transparent, non-capricious, unbiased, without favouritism or nepotism, in pursuit of promotion of healthy competition and equitable treatment. It should conform to the norms which are rational, informed with reasons and guided by public interest, etc. All these principles are inherent in the fundamental conception of Article 14,” the judgment says, invoking the constitutional guarantee of equality.
This language makes it virtually impossible for the government to resort to any arbitrary process of allocating scarce, valuable resources, since methods like first-come-first-served, lotteries and beauty parades cannot even begin to pass the new tests. In essence, then, the government can have any process for allocation it wants, so long as it’s an auction. The order’s carefully worded tests on allocation allow an aggrieved party to approach the courts to get an unfair or capricious allocation set aside, even those involving auctions. After all, auctions too can be compromised, as some of the privatisation deals struck by the former National Democratic Alliance government most likely were. While the court said policymaking is the government’s domain, it added “the implementation of policy will be tested and interfered with when found wanting”. The government can celebrate all it wants, but the court’s opinion in no way diminishes the scam taint from 2G and coal. If anything, the court has dealt a blow to crony capitalism by making the process for future allocations far stricter.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/auctions-are-dead-long-live-auctions/article3946322.ece
29,9,2012,Tweet talk helps,"When Sam Pitroda, the Prime Minister’s adviser on Public Information Infrastructure and Innovations, opted for Twitter to outline his vision for a democratised information system, the response was naturally overwhelming. As all such interactions go, there were more questions posed than answered. That is understandable, given that a large, horizontal network on social media can produce a deluge of questions and opinion in real time. What makes the initiative significant is that it directly addressed those sections of the online community that can actively collaborate in advancing India’s digital initiatives. Arguably, the most significant challenge in this area is to quickly complete the task of building good information infrastructure leading to better service delivery. Another major task is to usefully deploy the National Knowledge Network, a gigabit-speed Information Technology backbone that is scheduled to connect all public universities and research laboratories by the end of 2012. It aims to link libraries, health and agricultural institutions too. Equally important is India’s Open Data project, which can potentially bring a large volume of government statistics to the public realm. With useful applications built around the data, the objective of ensuring the right to information will be greatly strengthened.
The ‘thumbs down’ sentiments expressed by some on the Twitter interaction should be viewed as a signal that such events must become more frequent, rather than less. It is also natural for Twitter users to expect sharp technical answers from a technology expert. As Mr. Pitroda himself notes, Twitter attracts those who are really interested, does not allow participants to ramble on, and demands that they focus on a point. That characteristic of targeting information can be effectively used to flag key messages. A few of these did come across during the chat, such as the suggestion that State governments show greater interest to leverage the capacity of the National Knowledge Network, which is now available up to the block level. That is the crux of the issue. Even with a strong infrastructure backbone, much will depend on the response of government departments. Would they be ready to give up their monopoly on general data, and enable a reengineering of processes to strengthen e-governance? A transformation would depend on whether they are open to new measures that eliminate fragmentation and duplication, increase transparency, modernise procedures and bring about greater accountability to the citizen. These are urgent tasks and they are vital to remove some of the bottlenecks that impede development.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Tweet-talk-helps/article12646986.ece
1,10,2012,Means greater than ends,"The Supreme Court’s recent judgment overturning the convictions of 11 persons mainly under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) cuts through the clutter to arrive at the essence of justice-delivery in terrorism-related cases. There is undoubtedly an element of drama in the judgment, which makes reference to a recent Hindi film. Yet the line — “My name is Khan and I’m not a terrorist” — succinctly captures the trauma of a community that has carried the cross of terrorism for far too long and whose members feel defensive and answerable each time terror strikes anywhere in the country. Nonetheless, laudable as the judgment’s human rights approach is, its greater significance lies in going beyond and taking an unequivocal position on the principles of fair investigation and trial, which have somehow come to be seen as dispensable in terrorism cases. In the case under question, the prosecution had argued that disregarding a key requirement of TADA was a technical error which, therefore, could not become a ground for setting aside the convictions. Although the draconian TADA lapsed in 1995, some safeguards were introduced in the law while it was in force, and among them was the addition of a section which made it mandatory for every FIR registered under the Act to have prior permission from the District Superintendent of Police.
The prosecution first tried to falsify evidence by producing a copy of the DSP’s permission. When the Court established that no such permission existed, it argued that the permission was a technical requirement that ought not to have a bearing on the case. The judges rejected the argument saying TADA was an extraordinarily harsh law that could not be interpreted liberally. In the country of the Mahatma “the means are more important than the end,” the judges said, enunciating a truth that the police and the investigating agencies have tended to overlook in their rush to solve terror cases. Thin or fabricated evidence and shoddy investigation do not necessarily help the cause of fighting terror. Far from it, they allow the real terrorists to escape while tarnishing the reputations of innocents. Case after case of arbitrary detentions made on the flimsiest grounds or on trumped up charges, have come to light recently via lower court judgments that have expressed amazement at the state of terror prosecutions in the country. Disturbingly, police forces across India have tended not to take the right lessons from this, seeing terror acquittals as “technical” verdicts arising out of the difficulty in gathering evidence, rather than as a sign that their investigative abilities need serious and urgent improvement.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Means-greater-than-ends/article12540144.ece
1,10,2012,A road too far,"It is unusual for the government to distance itself from key recommendations of an expert committee set up by it on the very day its report enters the public domain. Yet this is precisely what has happened in the case of the panel headed by Vijay Kelkar, whose road map for fiscal consolidation — prepared at the instance of Finance Minister P. Chidambaram — suggests a journey too risky for the tastes of its sponsors. The recommendations in question, calling for “a frontal attack on inequitable subsidies” as a means of dealing with deteriorating government finances, though not new, have always been contentious. More so when they appear, as a government spokesperson claimed, to be contrary to “the objective of sustained and inclusive growth.” Of specific concern is the impact these recommendations might have on the roll-out of the proposed food security bill, which is expected to be the United Progressive Alliance government’s flagship welfare programme, with enormous socio-economic and, potentially, political implications. Not in any hurry to act, the government has circulated the report for wider discussion by all stakeholders.
It is no one’s case that government finances should not be brought under control. High fiscal deficits can lead to higher inflation, reduce room for monetary stimulus, increase the risk of external imbalances and dampen private sector investment, growth and employment. Purely from a technical standpoint, the committee might have presented a case for a midterm correction during the current year and a strategy for the next few years but clearly some of its recommendations fall short of its own requirement of being feasible from the perspective of contemporary political economy. As the Kelkar Committee, and before it, the 13th Finance Commission, found out, striking a balance between the needs of fiscal consolidation and protecting social objectives is a thankless task, at least in the short-term. Drastically pruning food and fuel subsidies, for instance, would aggravate the problems of the poor even if this helps power growth over the longer haul. Mr. Kelkar and his team members are aware of the possibility of their recommended fiscal consolidation measures inflicting pain on the weaker sections but expect everyone to benefit eventually. They are also realistic enough to advocate a gradual approach in phasing out, say, the diesel subsidy. The government’s eventual response to the report should also be guided by similar gradualism. Some of its less controversial recommendations, such as those relating to direct and indirect taxes and monetising surplus government land, deserve more immediate attention.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-road-too-far/article12540143.ece
2,10,2012,Paralysis is not an option,"Deferring a decision on a contentious issue can be a short-term tactic, but never a long-term strategy. If the Centre and the Andhra Pradesh government were looking for further proof of popular support for a separate State of Telangana in the region, it came in the form of the Sagara Haaram rally in Hyderabad on Sunday. As tens of thousands gathered to demand statehood for Telangana, the Congress government reacted as if it were another law and order challenge, nothing more than an evening’s headache for the police. Quite astonishingly, even years after the revival of the Telangana struggle, and evidence of growing support for statehood demonstrated through by-elections and mass agitations, the Congress and the governments it heads at the Centre and in the State are still hoping they can eventually wear down the movement by their inaction. The Congress tactic is, of course, engendered by the fear that any decision either for or against Telangana could set off violent reactions, either in Telangana or in Coastal Andhra, where large sections of the people are opposed to any division of the State. But inaction does not guarantee peace; indeed, there is no alternative to dealing with this political issue head-on. Instead of trying to find a consensus on the basis of the B.N. Srikrishna Committee report, which offered various viable options for it to consider, the government was happy doing nothing at all. However, there is a price to pay for being reactive and defensive. Those on the streets are now the agenda-setters, with the government constantly in crisis-aversion mode.
The Sagara Haaram must be seen as another opportunity to engage with the advocates of Telangana and explore the way to a solution on the basis of a structured consensus-building process started with the help of the Centre. But both sides need to give up their maximalist positions. For instance, questions relating to the post-bifurcation status of Hyderabad — which is within the Telangana region but is a cosmopolitan city with links to the whole of undivided Andhra Pradesh — will have to be sorted out through broad-based consultations. What the Centre and the AP government ought not to do is equally clear: make a solution part of a political deal between the Congress and the Telangana Rashtra Samiti. Irrespective of whether the offer of TRS president K. Chandrasekhara Rao to merge his party with the Congress in the event of statehood being granted to Telangana is a political ploy or not, the dangers in such a barter deal are self-evident. Political exigencies and electoral compulsions should not be allowed to decide the future of Andhra Pradesh.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Paralysis-is-not-an-option/article12541375.ece
2,10,2012,No room for haste,"The past year has witnessed unprecedented official efforts to rein in the growing tuberculosis epidemic. In 2011 alone, 1.2 million new TB cases were reported while 60,000 patients already inflicted died. In reality, the real incidence, most likely was much higher — the number of new cases diagnosed and treated by private practitioners has not been factored in. It is to change this that TB was made a notifiable disease in May this year. The government had to bite the bullet as effective interventions can be taken only if a system is in place to capture the true incidence and prevalence of the disease, including the drug-resistant cases. Herein lies the biggest challenge — ensuring every new case diagnosed by the private health sector is accounted for. This can be achieved only if the government engages with the private sector by first taking it into confidence. The draft versions of the Joint Monitoring Mission (JMM) and the National Strategic Plan for TB Control, 2012-2017 have made strong recommendations to engage the private health sector to stem the spread of TB. The government, which very recently sent out guidelines on notification, requires every private health institution, including laboratories, to provide the personal details of a patient — name, address, mobile number and unique identification number (Aadhar or driving licence). The objective is to provide a support system to patients seeking private healthcare in terms of treatment initiation, adherence, follow-up and default retrieval — tasks that are beyond the private sector’s capacity.
The goal is laudable but it is quite unlikely that the TB Control programme can achieve all of its highly ambitious objectives in the short term. The most significant obstacle will be the reluctance of patients and some doctors to part with personal data. This despite the fact that such sharing is mandatory in the U.S. and many other developed countries, and that the Medical Council of India’s code of ethics warrants such sharing. Hence, consensus and confidence-building measures have to be undertaken on a massive scale to bring private healthcare providers on board and make them open to the idea of sharing details. According to the draft JMM report, about one million TB cases per year are not reported. While the National Rural Health Mission has found some innovative ways of increasing manpower, urban areas lack the infrastructure to handle additional cases. This needs fixing. Most importantly, the TB control programme, which uses the interrupted regimen, has to show flexibility and allow the private sector to continue following the WHO recommended daily fixed-dose regimen.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/No-room-for-haste/article12541374.ece
3,10,2012,"Ready to whine, afraid to bark","Those too weak to strike can only cringe in the face of provocation. After its Central ministers were caught in controversies over the allocation of spectrum and grant of telecom licences, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam — especially once it lost power in Tamil Nadu — knew it no longer held the upper hand vis-à-vis the Congress. Indeed, over the past couple of years, power equations between the two parties have altered dramatically with the southern party keener to keep the alliance going than the senior partner at the national level. But with the exit of the Trinamool Congress from the United Progressive Alliance, the DMK is now hoping to correct the imbalance without putting the alliance itself at risk. Against this backdrop, its decision to support any Opposition-sponsored resolution in Parliament against Foreign Direct Investment in multi-brand retail is no more than another cynical manoeuvre to get the Congress to do its bidding on other issues. Not surprisingly, the DMK threat on the FDI issue came along with a fresh demand: the Centre should bring a review petition in the Supreme Court against the cancellation of 122 telecom licences issued when the party’s A. Raja was Communications Minister. As a part of the UPA government, the DMK cannot disown collective responsibility and distance itself from Union Cabinet decisions. The opportunity to fight the FDI approval from within the government is long gone. Surely, running with the hare and hunting with the hounds is an exercise impossible to keep up.
Although the DMK is working with limited options, the risk-return-ratio thrown up by its calculations is tied to its perception of the political fortunes of the Congress in 2014. Closer to the general election, the party might not be as risk-averse as it is now. That it does not want to be seen as irretrievably attached to the Congress is evident from its decision to not seek its original quota of ministerial berths. The DMK would also take into consideration the possibility of its principal rival in Tamil Nadu, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, taking its place in the government at the Centre if it chooses to exit the UPA. Hostile governments at both the Centre and the State might make the political situation in Tamil Nadu too hot for the DMK to handle. And, in such a scenario, the DMK can expect no sympathy from Delhi in the cases related to the telecom scams. What remains to be seen is whether the party would pick up the courage in the near future to bark, if not bite. Right now, its lot is to whine and whimper, and not to dwell too much on the insults and injuries of the past.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Ready-to-whine-afraid-to-bark/article12542593.ece
3,10,2012,Securing the rhino’s future,"The bouncing back of the great Indian one-horned rhinoceros from perilous decline is a century-old example of successful conservation. The iconic animal recovered dramatically from a long phase of colonial era hunting and habitat loss. Assam in general and Kaziranga in particular have nurtured the maximum number of rhinos. As per the 2012 census, the population estimate is of the order of 2,505 animals. The conservation challenge in the 21st century is to protect the rhino during the annual flooding of Kaziranga National Park and its contiguous areas. Recent incidents make it clear that poachers will stop at nothing. The world has seen the shocking spectacle of rhinos being shot as they fled flood waters to safer highlands, and their faces hacked for the horn — a compact mass of keratin fibres that commands staggering prices in the international market. The response to this crisis has to be internationally coordinated and two-pronged, aimed at choking off illegal trade channels using improved field intelligence and creating secure migration paths for the animals on the ground.
All critically endangered flagship animals need habitats that have viable size, and adequate protection. In the case of the great Indian rhino, the earliest measures date back to 1908, when 56,544 acres were set apart as reserved forest and hunting was banned. Kaziranga, which harbours the largest number of rhinos, has the reputation of being better-policed than other national parks. Park security was significantly strengthened two decades ago by setting up anti-poaching camps. Armed patrols here make it risky for poachers to enter, as they can be shot. Many have died in such attempts. Unsurprisingly, attacks on rhinos now often take place during the flooding season, when they migrate to areas where ensuring security is difficult. It may therefore be worth examining the possibility of further expansion of the park boundaries, and creation of additional conservation highlands. The Assam Forest Department and the Indian Army built such highlands after devastating floods in Kaziranga killed many rhinos in 1998. Restoration of wildlife corridors north and south of the Brahmaputra river to provide an escape route for rhinos may also be beneficial. The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau’s investigations into the recent poaching incidents should lead to coordinated Centre-State action on smuggling syndicates. The Assam government’s move to enhance armed park security is also promising. In the long term, it is crucial to create migratory corridors for rhinos and other animals to use during floods, and secure these pathways.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Securing-the-rhino%E2%80%99s-future/article12542590.ece
4,10,2012,"Join the party, Mr. Kejriwal","When Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal came together 17 months ago, the air throbbed with magic and hope, the response was sensational, and India seemed on the brink of heady, inspirational change. But like all transient curiosities, the pair that promised to banish corruption from public life has faded from memory even as the scams and scandals it fought against have attained a size and scale unimaginable in an earlier time. This is not all. In an ironic imitation of the politics that Team Anna relentlessly lampooned, it has split vertically, with one faction led by Mr. Kejriwal deciding to enter the electoral arena while Anna himself continues to be implacably opposed to politics, seeing it as a cesspool that only the irredeemably venal would plunge into. Why did the movement not reach its objective? Team Anna’s maximalist position on the Jan Lokpal Bill, which it projected as a one-stop cure for all problems, scared away even those committed to probity in public life. Political support which was forthcoming in the early stages of the Bill’s formulation, disappeared in part because of a genuine concern that the Jan Lokpal was designed to be structurally overarching and in part because of Team Anna’s vilification of politicians and even politics.
Over the following months, as Anna’s repetitive rallies and fasts began to attract fewer and fewer crowds, the veteran and his team found themselves hard pressed to answer a hostile counter question: If politics was so dirty, why not assume responsibility and clean it from inside instead of grandstanding from a safe distance? It is to Mr. Kejriwal’s credit that he did not resist the idea for too long. Anna’s estranged lieutenant has taken courage in his hand and floated a party with idealistic goals in an environment heavily contaminated by sleaze money and big corporate interests. As he ponders the next steps, Mr. Kerjriwal will surely experience for himself the challenge of practising politics without its attendant ills. He will also find the going tough in the absence of the charismatic Anna who drew his legitimacy from being seen as a selfless, modern-day savant. And yet Anna often failed to distinguish between sincere supporters who wanted a systemic overhaul and right-wing elements who infiltrated his campaign to further their divisive agenda. Though initially taken with the likes of the hugely popular Swami Ramdev, Mr. Kejriwal realised in time that neutrality was vital for his kind of politics. If he makes even a small difference to the popular perception of politics, he will have done a lot.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Join-the-party-Mr.-Kejriwal/article12543672.ece
4,10,2012,The status of Malayalam,"As Tamil, Telugu and Kannada received the status of a ‘Classical Language’ over the past few years, Malayalam’s claim to that imprimatur has remained unmet — although it essentially belongs to the same Dravidian linguistic family. As a language with a continuous history of more than 2,300 years and a long record of ancient and modern literary works of acknowledged excellence, its claim is incontestable, at least in relative terms. The antiquity of the language, the richness and diversity of its literature and Kerala’s pluralistic civilisational backdrop that the language has helped shape, stand it in good stead. The previous LDF government in the State had brought up the issue in a forceful manner two years ago, and the baton has since then been carried forward with matching vigour by the UDF government. An expert committee of scholars constituted by the government to present a considered opinion on the matter submitted its detailed report in 2010, supporting the claim. But movement since then has been confined to periodic assurances from New Delhi. This is a patent anomaly, almost an injustice, which needs to be set right.
The grant of such status should not, however, remain merely of symbolic value. The resources that come with it should be utilised meaningfully to develop the language on the basis of a clearly laid-out plan. The government should roll out a plan to ensure the language retains its integrity, purity and vibrancy — while allowing for the fact that a language has to evolve. There are worrying trends of corruption in spoken and written use, and a certain lack of rigour in terms of grammar and script is creeping in, the process often aided by lackadaisical use in the visual media. Also, not all Malayalam newspapers seem particularly keen to avoid borrowing words indiscriminately from English: by resorting to such short-cuts, they do a disservice to the language. Malayalam may be the official language of the State on paper but it is not yet fully so. One glaring gap relates to judicial proceedings. Malayalam has achieved a significant degree of web compliance over the last few years. However, the technical complications relating to the ‘chil’ element of the script is an issue that needs to be addressed, so that Malayalam becomes a language of the digital age. There is also a need to encourage the younger generation of Malayalees, those who live in Kerala and elsewhere in the world, to take pride in learning and handling it well. Malayalam thus needs to be enriched and energised — even as it co-exists in a pragmatic manner with major languages such as English and Hindi in order that its horizons remain wide and open.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-status-of-Malayalam/article12543668.ece
5,10,2012,"Romney, this time","The first televised debate in the 2012 United States presidential election campaign was a low-key, at times pedantic, exchange, with both candidates, President Barack Obama and challenger Governor Mitt Romney, trading charges on questions of economic policy. The surprise element of the debate was Mr. Romney’s sharp tenor, which handed him the dominant edge at several points in the discussion. Contrarily, Mr. Obama appeared cautious and reactive, even opening the debate on a soft note by wishing his wife a happy anniversary. Mr. Romney though spared no effort to take aim at Mr. Obama’s record in office, with the criticism that unemployment has been at 8 per cent or above for 43 successive months, and the budget deficit appears as uncontrollable as it was when the President took office. He also targeted potential Republican voters with repeated claims about the likely costs of Mr. Obama’s flagship Affordable Health Care Act. The Governor then contrasted the partisanship which had ensured the Act’s passage through Congress with the consensus he had achieved to get a similar bill passed in his own State, Massachusetts.
The President countered with attacks on Mr. Romney’s avoidance of specifics, in particular asking how he expected to reduce the budget deficit while at the same time expanding military spending and cutting taxes on corporates and the very rich. Mr. Obama landed some telling blows, not least when his adversary said nobody over 60 needed to think about health insurance and he replied, looking directly at the camera, that everyone now aged 54 or 55 would need to think about it. Both candidates, however, stayed off ideological issues, with the challenger probably startling his own supporters by favouring regulation of business and claiming that he would not cut public education funding. Mr. Romney also raised eyebrows when, for the first time on such a high-profile platform, he spoke strongly in favour of not raising tax on the middle class and not reducing taxes for the rich. While he has sometimes struggled to hold the support of hardcore Republicans, the aim of the party faithful to oust the incumbent may guarantee him a basic level of backing. Mr. Obama however needs to keep floating voters interested, particularly as the economy is still in trouble. Yet curiously, the President missed the chance to remind Mr. Romney of his recent gaffe in which he had written off 47 per cent of Americans for allegedly paying no tax. The post-event consensus is that he lost this opening debate on points. The next two debates will focus more on serious questions of U.S. foreign policy. In particular Washington’s disastrous policies in West Asia and Afghanistan may be examined, forays that neither Mr. Obama nor his challenger seems to know how to handle.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Romney-this-time/article12544937.ece
5,10,2012,(Mis)treating Ms Gandhi,"Politicians should be cut some slack for making exaggerated claims and launching strong and satirical attacks on their rivals in the heat of electioneering. But Gujarat’s Chief Minister Narendra Modi has displayed shockingly bad taste in making an issue about the money allegedly spent on Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s foreign travels in recent years, often for medical treatment. First, he repeated, on the basis of an unsourced newspaper report, that the Centre had spent a wildly improbable Rs. 1,880 crore on her overseas trips. When he came under fire for this unsubstantiated attack, Mr. Modi simply changed tack. All right, he argued, if it was not Rs. 1,880 crore tell us how much? And then, in a hugely unconvincing attempt to retrieve a hopeless situation, he demanded the United Progressive Alliance government disclose how much public money was spent on her foreign trips from 2004, or well before she took ill. With the Central Information Commission clarifying that Ms Gandhi had not sought any reimbursement from the Centre for her medical expenditure, Mr. Modi’s attack seems even more malicious and insulting. That he chose to score points off a political rival’s illness shows the moral depths he is prepared to plumb in his pursuit of power.
It is possible that Mr. Modi simply put his foot in his mouth in levelling this wild allegation. But his recent election speeches suggest that targeting the Gandhi family is part of a larger political strategy. First he attacked Rahul Gandhi for having a mother who was born outside India, saying that he could win an election in Italy if he liked. And now this. Mr. Modi may well believe that identifying the Gandhis as his principal rival is a clever way of signalling his ambition to climb the national political stage before the 2014 general election. While he must be unreservedly condemned for saying what he did, the likelihood of such a controversy erupting would be far less had there not been such an impenetrable veil of secrecy drawn over Ms Gandhi’s medical condition and treatment. An individual’s medical treatment is private information and, as the CIC has correctly pointed out, any personal expenditure on it cannot be the subject matter of an RTI application. But Ms Gandhi, as Chairperson of the UPA and the National Advisory Council, is a public figure and the degree of secrecy surrounding her medical condition is unusual for a democracy. While her privacy, like the privacy of all citizens, is paramount, the Congress high command should realise it is precisely the absence of any authoritative information that provides fertile ground for rumours and canards to spread.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mistreating-Ms-Gandhi/article12544935.ece
6,10,2012,Premium on regulation,"At first blush, the wave of financial sector reforms unveiled by the government on Thursday appears to have pulled off the impossible. The rapturous surge witnessed on the stock market tells us the investing classes are happy, while the somewhat muted reaction of Opposition parties suggests the insurance and pension sector initiatives cannot easily be painted as “anti-people.” If the entry of multinational retail behemoths raises fears about the potential loss of jobs and livelihoods, insurance and pension reforms hold out the prospect of better social security for the middle class without the immediate danger of a “employment displacement” effect. In insurance, at least, the reform being contemplated is also quite modest: foreign insurance companies will be allowed to hold 49 per cent equity in their Indian operations but this still does not make for majority control. The private insurance sector is starved for capital and the increase in foreign equity cap will enable foreign partners to pump in money. Whether they will actually do so is another matter, given their own financial problems and their inability to crack the Indian market. For those squeamish about opening the pension sector to foreign investment, the reform has a silver lining: the regulator for the sector will finally acquire teeth. Banks and some mutual funds have already evinced interest in offering pension fund products and passage of the pension Bill will facilitate this process.
As junior partners restricted to a 49 per cent equity share, foreign pension fund companies may not be the threat some believe them to be. But the pension reforms being introduced are hardly a remedy to the absence of a viable and well-funded system of social security in India. On the positive side, millions of private sector employees and the self-employed — most of whom have no viable pension plans to subscribe to today — may get new options as a result. Remember, the government is in no mood or position to offer its services here; some of its own employees are now governed by the National Pension Scheme. On the negative side, the Western, especially American, private pension model has not exactly been an unqualified success on its home turf. Millions of Americans are unprotected or their retirement benefits have been compromised because of insufficient regulation and the lack of official oversight. As for insurance, many of the companies looking to enhance their positions in India were key players in the 2008 global financial meltdown. That is why Parliament needs to focus sharply on the quality of the regulator and regulations that will govern the pension and insurance business from now on, especially since it will increasingly be in private hands.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Premium-on-regulation/article12546352.ece
6,10,2012,Le Corbusier’s concrete visions,"No one has animated the world of architecture and town planning as much as Le Corbusier, the Swiss-born French architect who designed the iconic Indian city Chandigarh. Through his visionary ideas, prolific writing and at times controversial proposals, Le Corbusier substantially shaped the course of modern architecture. Today, October 6, marks his 125th birth anniversary, and is an occasion to remind planners of the need to invest in quality design. Le Corbusier, known as Charles-Édouard Jeanneret until 1920, was one of the few architects to grasp the challenges of the times: rapid industrialisation, the melting of old orders and tectonic shifts in art. He invented prototypes to meet the emerging needs of new housing and urban planning. Placing a building on stilts to free the ground for greenery, gaze and automobiles is a solution that is taken for granted today, but designers owe this to Le Corbusier. So it is with open plans, pure forms, terrace gardens and the creative use of concrete. Villa Savoye in Poissy and the Chapel in Ronchamp and the High Court in Chandigarh are some of the evocative examples of his creative abilities and are undoubtedly among the best in the world. His ideas had a deep impact on the making of new cities; the work of Brasilia’s principal designers Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer is a case in point.
Le Corbusier joined the Chandigarh design team in 1950. He changed the core ideas of the first plan, bringing an approach that split a complex city into organisable components such as residential sectors, a commercial core and an administrative zone. Deftly woven with different types of roads and sumptuous open spaces, the resultant city was hailed by Nehru as a “great creation,” a new icon of modern India that was “unfettered by traditions of the past.” The plan for Chandigarh was not free of deficiencies. Hierarchical zoning, lifeless streets and less inclusive spaces all needed correction. However, the leap of imagination and value of design that Le Corbusier conveyed stirred the imagination of Indian architects and pushed many cities to aspire to better planning. Sadly, Indian planners have lost their way in the 50 years or so since Chandigarh was completed. Cities today are looked upon only as sites of economic growth, missing the importance of holistic planning and aesthetics. Chandigarh itself stands neglected. Furniture and manhole covers designed for the city found their way to auction houses. When efforts were made two years ago to declare select buildings as World Heritage sites, the authorities refused to back the move. Today, however, it is essential that the iconic city and its most striking buildings be properly looked after.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Le-Corbusier%E2%80%99s-concrete-visions/article12546349.ece
8,10,2012,So many helping hands,"It is a given that all good partymen will rush to the aid of the First Family when its honour is under attack. So when the pesky duo of Arvind Kejriwal and Prashan Bhushan made bold to draw attention to the maze of business dealings between real estate giant DLF and Robert Vadra, the entire Congress came out to bat for Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law. From party functionaries to A-list Ministers, the defence mounted on behalf of Mr. Vadra was robust, though there is nothing on record to suggest the Congress chief herself solicited this support. Law and Justice Minister Salman Khurshid called the charges “preposterous and stupid,” even as he threatened to teach Messrs Kejriwal and Bhushan a lesson or two — “in the law”. Another minister wanted to know if Mr. Vadra’s family connections meant that he ought to be put out to starve. In rushing to form a protective cordon around the family, Congress leaders realised that if not demolished with the force of a sledgehammer the allegation of impropriety could cause incalculable long-term harm to 10, Janpath and, by extension, the party. And yet, for all the outrage of its shouting brigade, the Congress has not really managed to shed light on why DLF helped invest in Mr. Vadra's businesses — relying on sound and fury to make its point when what was required was a clear and cogent explanation.
The Congress’s resort to obfuscation is at least understandable. But what explains the Bharatiya Janata Party’s refusal to grab a first-rate opportunity handed to it on a platter? BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad’s initial reaction was that the party will seek an independent probe into what he described as Mr. Vadra’s “wheeling-dealing.” But BJP president Nitin Gadkari quickly disabused Mr. Prasad of the fanciful notion, saying there was no real evidence in the case. Having himself been at the receiving end of allegations concerning an irrigation project in Maharashtra, the BJP chief obviously knows better than to throw stones from a glass house. Remarkably, Mr. Gadkari admitted to knowing that the Vadra papers had been in circulation. The principal Opposition’s biggest problem is that its own blotted record on corruption has left it with no face to fight the Congress on the issue. The BJP destabilised the previous session of Parliament over Coalgate only to find the scam attaching itself to some key party figures. The unfortunate truth is that a lot of the political noise on graft today is just that — noise. The Congress resolutely ignored the coincidental rise of Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s son-in-law Ranjan Bhattacharya during the National Democratic Alliance’s six years in office. Perhaps the favour is now being returned.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/So-many-helping-hands/article12548972.ece
8,10,2012,The ghosts of Khalistan,"The recent assassination attempt on Lieutenant-General Kuldip Singh Brar in London is a grim reminder that the ghosts of the Punjab insurgency are still with us so many years after the last shots were fired. Indira Gandhi’s decision to send troops into the Golden Temple in June 1984 — troops Gen. Brar commanded — set off events which would claim tens of thousands of lives, including her own. Historians have long debated if Mrs Gandhi’s decision to storm the temple was correct. This much, though, there is a consensus on: the murderous events of the summer of 1984 were an outcome of a vicious political dance, in which Mrs Gandhi’s Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal sought to outmanoeuvre each other by using Sikh militancy. Helped by Pakistan’s intelligence services, the religious fanatics both parties patronised made a determined push to create a separate Sikh state, Khalistan. Punjab has since become one of India’s most peaceful States, a product of not only a bloody counter-insurgency campaign, but the rejection by ordinary Sikhs and Hindus of the cult of death which ruled Punjab from 1983 to 1993. In recent years, though, Khalistan groups have been re-emerging, particularly in the diaspora. The arrests made in Britain in connection with the attempt on Gen. Brar’s life make it clear such organisations have regained resources and organisational capacities.
If the ghosts of the Khalistan movement have reappeared today, it is at least in part because politicians have been busy opening up the crypts into which its memory had been consigned. Inside the Golden Temple, an 18-foot memorial to the Khalistan terrorists is being built next to the Akal Takht, the highest seat of Sikhs’ spiritual authority. Pro-Khalistan posters have reappeared in many towns; even as the government has ignored these, it has cracked down on heterodox religious groupings. Having shown itself unable to address simmering economic frustration among its core landed-peasant constituency, the SAD-led alliance government has embraced religious-chauvinist causes, seeking to secure its political flanks from attack. This is a profoundly misguided strategy. Parkash Singh Badal, himself long a key target of terrorists, knows better than most that the Khalistan movement never represented Sikh opinion. Indeed, the Akalis and the Congress must realise that peace in Punjab can only be sustained by unequivocal support for the secular culture and traditions of the State. And by ensuring that the raw wound left by the Indian legal system’s failure to punish the perpetrators of the November 1984 massacre of Sikhs is healed quickly with the balm of justice.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-ghosts-of-Khalistan/article12548971.ece
9,10,2012,Another Chávez triumph,"Venezuela’s President Hugo Chávez has decisively won election to a fourth term following a tough campaign by the challenger, Henrique Capriles Radonski. A record 80.4 per cent of the country’s 19 million registered voters turned out, re-electing Mr. Chávez by 54.4 per cent to 44.9 for Mr. Capriles, with about 90 per cent of the votes counted. The public themselves proved portents of violence wrong, and the substantial numbers of armed national guard personnel on the streets had little to do. The procedure itself was strict: voters, who were identified by a digital thumbprint reader, made their choice on centrally-connected touch-screens and printed out their vote to check it before it went into a ballot-box. This election is the closest any rival has come to the President, who won by 16 per cent in 1998 and 26 in 2006. Pre-election indications were that Mr. Capriles was pressing President Chávez hard, though the incumbent’s core supporters among the poorer classes clearly valued the difference he has made to them with state aid after natural disasters, subsidised food, free medical care, and adult education. Moreover, Mr. Capriles got votes from people who thought the country needed a change but who also believed his promises to retain many Chávez policies.
The strong showing by Mr. Capriles is good for Venezuelan democracy, and indeed for the success of Mr. Chavez’s ‘Bolivarian Revolution’ — which might otherwise meander or lose direction without the constant accountability that only a robust opposition can ensure. Venezuela faces major domestic challenges, including corruption and a high murder rate. Poorly maintained infrastructure has reduced oil production, the country’s principal source of income. In the six additional years he now has before him, Mr. Chávez must not ignore these problems, even as he pushes ahead with his promise to decentralise power to local councils and take on the might of powerful private players in sectors like retail and transport through the promotion of public companies. His plans for the oil sector involve closer collaboration between the state-owned corporation PDVSA and international players like Rosneft and Lukoil from Russia. Chevron is also a player here, but that will not end open U.S. vilification of Mr. Chávez, not least for putting his country’s oil wealth to enlightened geopolitical use in Latin America and beyond. The newly reelected President’s health following treatment for cancer remains in question, but delivering even some further improvements to the lives of ordinary Venezuelans will be a triumph both for him and for the model of ‘21st century socialism’ he espouses.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Another-Ch%C3%A1vez-triumph/article12550191.ece
9,10,2012,Decoding Nasheed,"Eight months after the political upheaval in the Maldives that saw Mohammed Nasheed resign as President, fresh turmoil there has belied hopes that the nation would slowly settle down. Mr. Nasheed, who alleged after resigning that he was ousted in a coup, has been arrested for defying a court order. Charged with detaining a judge unlawfully on January 16 while he was still in power, and ordered by the court to remain in Male for the period of the trial, the former President opted to break free of his ‘island arrest’, going off to the southern islands in the archipelago to attend political rallies. He believes that the charges are politically motivated, designed to convict and make him ineligible to contest elections. If that is correct, he is now responsible for handing the courts a far simpler way to achieve the same objective, by convicting him on a possible charge of contempt. Evidently, Mr. Nasheed thinks brinkmanship serves better his political objectives, especially after the Commission of National Inquiry — constituted to go into political events from January 14 to February 8 — destroyed some of his political planning by concluding there had been no coup in the Maldives. It said the change of President was legal and constitutional, and that what happened was a “reaction” to Mr. Nasheed’s own actions as President. Though he has refused to accept the conclusions of the report, he can hardly accuse the Commission of bias. It was at his bidding that its mandate was rewritten; additionally, a Maldivian member of his choice, plus an international co-chair and two other international observers, were added to it.
With the Commission vindicating its stance, the present Maldivian dispensation could have taken the lead in hastening national reconciliation by reviewing the need to bring Mr. Nasheed to trial. And, instead of rebelling himself out of the democratic system that he struggled so hard to establish over two decades, Mr. Nasheed ought to have asked his Maldivian Democratic Party, the single largest in the Majlis, to play a constructive parliamentary role. The CoNI report recommended reforms aimed at making the police, judiciary, the election commission, parliament and the human rights commission more effective and accountable. This is the only part of the report that the MDP accepted, but such reforms are not born overnight; they have to be built through the parliamentary process. India can help by encouraging all sides. It must not be seen as promoting or backing one or the other leader, as was the unfortunate impression created by the recent trip to New Delhi of Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, the former Maldivian dictator-turned opposition leader.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Decoding-Nasheed/article12550190.ece
10,10,2012,A stinking mess,"Census 2011 threw up a malodorous statistic: people in 49.8 per cent of households have no toilet facilities and defecate in the open. In contrast, 63.2 per cent of households have a telephone connection, of which 52.3 per cent have cell phones; as for televisions, almost half of the country’s households possess one. Nobody would even whisper in protest if someone, struck by this perverse anomaly, were to say that Indians needs toilets more than they do television sets and telephones. So why is there such blather over some perfectly reasonable remarks by Union Minister of Rural Development Jairam Ramesh which were intended to stress that India requires more toilets than it does more temples? His suggestion that India has more temples than toilets was not part of an anti-religious tirade but a piece of hyperbole to stress the importance of sanitation in a speech to panchayat-level workers at the launch of a campaign to end open defecation. To suggest, as some have, that it was an insidious attempt to hyphenate toilets and temples in an ugly alliterative juxtaposition is rank nonsense.
In a country where politics hungrily attempts to feed off prickly religious sensitivities, Mr. Ramesh’s comments have been twisted out of context and blown out of all proportion. BJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy has alleged that such comments would destroy the “fine fabric of religion and faith” and the fierce chorus of protests have led the Congress to forsake principle for expedience and distance itself from Mr. Ramesh’s remarks. Predictably, in this republic of hurt sentiments, at least one complaint has already been lodged with the police asking that a case be booked against him for outraging religious feelings — which, given the circumstances, reads like poor toilet humour. The only voice in favour of Mr. Ramesh emerged from Sulabh International, an NGO committed to the building of toilets. Organisations like these understand how vital toilets are to the well-being of India. A World Bank study conducted a couple of years ago estimated the economic impact of the lack of toilets and sanitation facilities, which it pegged at a staggering Rs. 24,000 crore annually — or 6.4 per cent of India’s GDP. This loss is created by deaths, especially of children, the cost of treating hygiene-related illnesses, losses from reduced productivity and educed tourism revenues. Open defecation is an ugly reminder of the country’s poverty and the failure of the government to provide adequate water and sanitation facilities. But it is more than a matter of shame and embarrassment — it has social and economic implications that this country can hardly afford.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-stinking-mess/article12551378.ece
10,10,2012,Turning the clock back,"The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded on Monday to Sir John B. Gurdon of the Gurdon Institute in Cambridge and Dr. Shinya Yamanaka from Kyoto University for their path-breaking discoveries was not unexpected. Dr. Yamanaka had won two other prestigious science awards — the Albert Lasker Award in 2009 and the Wolf Prize in 2011. Winning the crowning glory of science awards just six years after publishing his landmark experiment shows how pathbreaking his work is. If Sir John laid the foundation in 1962 by showing that the nucleus of a matured intestinal frog cell inserted into a denucleated frog egg cell could develop into a normal tadpole, Dr. Yamanaka proved that inserting four critical genes into (differentiated) adult cells was sufficient to turn the clock back and make them behave like pluripotent stem cells. Much like the embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are immature cells capable of becoming any of the over 200 specialised adult cells. The 2006 publication of his paradigm-shifting work on mouse skin cells, repeated in 2007 with human cells, shook the very foundation of developmental biology by demonstrating that cell specialisation is reversible. The publication of Dr. Yamanaka’s results, which helps to sidestep the ethical controversy surrounding embryonic stem cell research, could not have been better timed. It came about a month after George W. Bush, who was U.S. President at the time, vetoed a Bill seeking to enlarge federal funding for embryonic stem cell research.
Avoiding the ethical landmine is only a minor issue in the whole scheme of things. The real advantages will come from a wide gamut of applications. The most important and immediate application is using patient-derived iPSCs for studying disease mechanisms. Pharmaceutical companies have taken it to the next level by using stem cells, either embryonic or iPS cells, for screening drug candidates — for toxicity and potential new treatments. Several major drug companies have already jumped on the bandwagon of using them to screen drugs. After all, when it comes to drug discovery, human stem cells (embryonic and iPSC) are far superior to testing on animals. While scientists have found safer alternatives of introducing the genes into adult cells, certain critical issues pertaining to production and safety need to be resolved. The efficiency of turning adult cells into iPS cells is at present very low at about 1 per cent, and the great promise of using iPSCs for therapeutic purposes is still many years away. But according to Nature, it has not stopped the Japanese laureate from starting an ambitious project to produce by 2020 75 iPS cell lines for therapeutic use.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Turning-the-clock-back/article12551376.ece
11,10,2012,Don’t ink this NIB,"The Finance Ministry proposal to create a National Investment Board with extraordinary authority to supersede individual ministries and decide the fate of expensive infrastructure projects is a retrograde measure that strikes at the root of democratic governance. The basic tenets of all law-making include public participation, equity and justice, more so when it comes to the environment and welfare. India’s laws on protection of the environment, forests, wildlife and tribal welfare enshrine these principles, and the country has been centre-staging them when negotiating international treaties and protocols. But a brazen attempt is being made using the fig leaf of ‘delays’ in grant of regulatory approvals and clearances to negate all this and strip individual ministries of their lawful role, and to transfer their decision-making powers to an NIB. The Ministry of Environment and Forests, which is cast by industry as the villain when it comes to project clearances, is justified in opposing this misadventure. The stated objective of forming an NIB chaired by the Prime Minister, under the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961, is to prescribe time limits for approvals. Its functions, however, are far-reaching and would seriously erode the powers and autonomy of individual ministries. Their procedures and decisions will become subject to review by an investment-focused superior entity, with predictable consequences.
For nearly a decade now, the MoEF has been under pressure to dilute its mandatory systems in order to facilitate speedy regulatory clearances. After many decisions made on the basis of faulty Environment Impact Assessments — commissioned by project promoters themselves — the Ministry has started looking at its shortcomings. Two years ago, Jairam Ramesh, who was Minister at the time, said about the rejection of Vedanta’s mining proposal for Niyamgiri in Orissa, that his Ministry could not abdicate its responsibility of enforcing laws passed by Parliament. His successor, Jayanthi Natarajan, has done well to now stand up to the pressure to constitute the NIB. Taking the long view, Board proponents would do well to remember that they seek to exploit a stock of invaluable, limited natural capital. There is, thus, a need to assess the sustainability of development, and not be guided solely by narrow measures of economic performance. Considering the authoritarian character that an all-powerful committee will inevitably acquire, it would be prudent for the Cabinet to give up the NIB proposal. It can achieve better outcomes by focusing on administrative elements within ministries, and introducing accountability in project approvals.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Don%E2%80%99t-ink-this-NIB/article12552485.ece
11,10,2012,The drive for exclusivism,"A pattern of mobilisations and terror campaigns by groups to demarcate exclusive areas for themselves and establish territorial recognition has been a marked feature of Assam’s political scene in recent decades. Others living in that space who fear being excluded — often, despite the historicity of their own presence — consequently resort to their own devices to defeat these moves. The memorandum of settlement that the Union government and Assam government signed in New Delhi with the twin factions of the Dima Halam Daogah, the DHD-J and the DHD-N, runs the risk of going the same way unless implemented with care and sensitivity. Supported by a violent campaign, the militants were demanding a state for the Dimasa tribe. But they went through a process of weakening and surrender, and negotiations followed. Under the terms of the settlement, the two factions are to dissolve themselves within six months and a time-bound process is to be initiated to bring about greater devolution of power in Dima Hasao district. The North Cachar Hills Autonomous Council is to be renamed the Dima Hasao Autonomous Territorial Council. The State government will reorganise the district into three administrative units for development management. A Rs.200-crore economic package will be provided to the DHATC over the next five years. The hope has been expressed that all this would help bring the DHDs into the democratic mainstream.
Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde cheerfully claimed that the settlement “has sent out a message to the entire nation that if one district demands peace, then there is no way it cannot happen.” How the other sections of the population in the region would respond to the move, is a matter of some concern. The non-Dimasa population — which includes Zeme Nagas, Kukis and Hmars — has opposed the settlement and demanded bifurcation of the district. Discontent over the proposed deal has been brewing for some time, and on the evening before the settlement was signed, three explosions rocked the district headquarters of Haflong. The Indigenous People’s Forum representing non-Dimasa groups wants areas inhabited by them to be kept outside the purview of the proposed Territorial Council. One Naga leader has held out the prospect of “turmoil and civil war” in the event of the Dimasas’ demand being accepted. The prospect of real peace in the region will depend on the sense of realism with which the non-Dimasa groups approach the issue, the degree to which the Dimasa factions are able to ensure inclusive collaboration — and the government’s ability to keep the peace. The settlement should not end up creating problems while solving old issues.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-drive-for-exclusivism/article12552484.ece
12,10,2012,Give the Cauvery award a chance,"An inadequate monsoon has always been a prelude to the eruption of the festering sore that the dispute over the sharing of Cauvery waters between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu has become. We have seen this in 1991-92, 1995-96, 2002-2003, and now again in 2012. What distinguishes this year’s showdown is that it is the first after the February 2007 final award of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal was announced, a scheme that swiftly went into cold storage thanks to Special Leave Petitions that all four Cauvery basin States filed in the Supreme Court. With the final award in legal deep-freeze, the interim award as implemented by the Cauvery River Authority remains the sole guide for adjudicating the allocation and release of water, especially in a poor monsoon year. The current quarrel has become one of claims versus counter-claims, with both States pressing their case for water, yet supremely blind to each other’s distress. On September 19, the CRA, which is headed by the Prime Minister, directed Karnataka to release 9000 cusecs of water every day from September 21 to October 15, an order upheld by the Supreme Court on September 28, and with which Karnataka partially complied. This triggered a wave of protests in the basin districts. On October 8, Karnataka stopped releases from the Krishnaraja Sagar reservoir. In response, the Tamil Nadu government has moved the Supreme Court charging the Karnataka government with contempt.
Clearly, dispute-resolution between two States, especially over a resource as vital as water, cannot be conducted through court directives. Nor can this process be reduced to short bursts of intense confrontation whenever a crisis hits. The Cauvery Tribunal’s final award came after 17 years of adjudication, and it must be given a chance to work. For this to happen, the disputing parties must agree to bring it out of cold storage by withdrawing the objections filed in the Supreme Court, and instead pursue their engagement with the Cauvery Tribunal — whose vacancies must immediately be filled — for clarifications and amendments to the final order. Until then, the CRA has the unenviable and politically fraught task of deciding the volume of water to be released and the courts must not brook any defiance of its decisions. The absence of legal closure allows parochial political forces to compete with each other in cashing in on distress. It is, therefore, incumbent on all stake-holders to show the political will and statesmanship needed to tide over the current standoff and clear the hurdles for the final award of the Cauvery Tribunal to be given a chance to work, so that the Cauvery basin may begin to realise its full agro-economic potential.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Give-the-Cauvery-award-a-chance/article12553725.ece
12,10,2012,Netanyahu’s agendas,"The Israeli Prime Minister’s announcement of an early general election to take place in January or February 2013, about eight months before the current Knesset’s term ends, has yet again shown Binyamin Netanyahu’s ability to work to several agendas at once. The current coalition between the right-wing Likud party and its centre-right partner Kadima, with support from the Zionist extreme-right Yisrael Beiteinu, was formed amidst political chaos in May 2012, when the Prime Minister wrong-footed his opponents by getting the Knesset to dissolve itself and then reversed his stated plans to hold elections in September. Instead, he invited Kadima, which was facing electoral meltdown, into the ruling coalition. One left party called the manoeuvre a “stinking” deal, but it gave Mr. Netanyahu 94 out of 120 Knesset seats and ensured him total legislative approval. For example, in the rush to pass vote-winning laws before September, the Knesset gave second and third readings to proposals granting tax exemptions to organisations which “encourage settlement activity”. Furthermore, keeping Kadima on board meant the government could reduce damage from the possible corruption indictment of Foreign Minister and Yisrael Beiteinu leader Avigdor Lieberman. In addition, with the economy in trouble and no budget approved for 2012, proroguing the Knesset enables the government to work to the 2011 budget, thereby implementing further austerity measures sub rosa.
The Prime Minister’s capacity to startle domestic rivals is nevertheless minor when compared to his influence over the world’s most powerful geostrategic entities. Mr. Netanyahu will very probably focus on the threat he thinks Iran poses, and his language is likely to be even more inflammatory than it has been so far. Yet for all his rhetoric, Mr. Netanyahu’s 27 September U.N. speech in which he dramatically drew a red line on a supposed Iranian nuclear bomb suggests Israel will not rush to precipitate a war over Iran’s alleged nuclear weapons programme until at least early next year. Of course, the Israeli leader’s claims about Iran are meant to manipulate the United States and the European Union into imposing progressively tougher sanctions on Iran. On all the evidence, that ruse works and even though western leaders almost certainly know it is a ruse, they dare not stand up to any Israeli government. The real Israeli agenda, of course, is something else: it is to shout so loudly about Iran that the entirely legitimate demand of the Palestinians for the return of the Occupied Territories is drowned out and the country they have a right to — as much as the Israelis have to their own — is slowly effaced off the map.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Netanyahu%E2%80%99s-agendas/article12553724.ece
13,10,2012,A patch to call their own,"The frustration behind the Jan Satyagraha, the long march of the landless to Delhi, was justified. Reforms meant to help the poor access land have been on the policy agenda since Independence, but the ground situation has hardly changed. Against the potential ceiling surplus of 21 million hectares, only about 2.7 million hectares have so far been taken possession of and distributed to the needy. As a result, the number of landless poor in rural India is still as high as about 18 million and half among them live without a home of their own. Frequent eviction and forced land acquisition have added to the numbers, especially of adivasis. It is in this context that Ekta Parishad, a federation of about 11,000 community organisations, proposed the march to highlight the persisting apathy. The swelling numbers of protesters brought the heat on the United Progressive Alliance government and forced a rethink. To his credit, Jairam Ramesh, Minister for Rural Development, though initially reluctant, accepted there were valid reasons behind the march. The 10-point agreement he signed with Ekta Parishad has the potential to lead to a comprehensive new policy that would reduce the number of the landless and enhance the protection of land rights of the marginalised.
For that to happen, though, the promises made have to translate into concrete and meaningful action. They should not slither into mere tokenism as in 2007, when a similar march was held. The government then promised to set up a National Council for Land Reforms under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister. This council has done nothing since its inception in 2008. Land is central to alleviating rural poverty. Wherever reforms have been implemented and plots even as small as 10 cents — 1/10th of an acre — allotted, they have enhanced the food intake and income of the poor and facilitated construction of dwellings. For these reasons, the Eleventh Five Year Plan had recommended that 10 to 15 cents of land be given to each landless family with priority given to “female-headed families.” The Plan envisioned that this process be completed by 2012, but that goal remains a distant dream. Land is a State subject and much will depend on the commitment of local governments. Barring a few States such as West Bengal and Kerala, others have not done enough. Of the 53.98 lakh beneficiaries who gained from land redistribution, West Bengal alone accounts for half the number. Protecting tenancy rights and preventing forced displacement are the other two critical aspects that need attention. Inclusive growth is impossible without an equitable and just distribution of land and it is imperative to achieve it through well thought out reforms.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-patch-to-call-their-own/article12555195.ece
13,10,2012,Lower the barriers,"The draft bill on the rights of persons with disabilities — intended to replace the 1995 law — is a daring attempt to combat historically-rooted discrimination based on a person’s disability through legal guarantees of equality of opportunity. The wide-ranging commitments in the area of employment are but one instance of an attempt at inclusion and empowerment. Foremost is the increase, up to five per cent, in the proportion of reservation in recruitment to all government employment. The two percentage point increase is perhaps appropriate, considering the greater number of disabilities that are to be accorded protection under the new law. There is also a private sector corollary to quotas in the form of incentives and disincentives for firms that hire disabled employees and those that do not. Establishments that comprise more than five per cent of the workforce from this category would be allowed to deduct the salaries of every additional employee from their taxable earnings. Conversely, those that fall below the prescribed minimum would be required to add to their taxable income an amount equivalent to the shortfall.
The draft bill makes provision for the identification of posts suitable for disabled candidates and also for periodic review. While the identification of positions may raise awareness among employers on suitable avenues to create openings, this could also prove potentially restrictive, say, when applicants have the prerequisites for positions that are not listed. The new law should instead reflect current policy, wherein government departments are free to make additions, but not deletions, from a pre-determined catalogue of jobs appropriate for disabled aspirants. Such freedom and flexibility would be necessary to overcome procedural shortcomings that may hamper the disabled from taking advantage of new openings. Similarly, the current rotation system should be modified in a manner that vacancies do not lapse just because a candidate with a particular disability was not available. All such self-defeating procedures should give way to more proactive policy adjustments. The underlying objective of the proposed change is to harmonise current law with the letter and spirit of the 2007 United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities — one which India was among the earliest to ratify. While initiatives in the arena of employment can critically alter the lives of the disabled, the extent of their realisation would depend on the provision of quality education and universal access. It is time the Centre moved towards expeditious enactment of the new legislation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Lower-the-barriers/article12555176.ece
15,10,2012,Keeping the peace in Europe,"The Nobel peace prize awarded to the European Union is recognition of the historic triumph of democratic solidarity over ideologies based on narrow nationalism, jingoism and militarism. Small wonder that Friday’s announcement has been received with derision and scorn by Eurosceptic and far-right forces that have stoked popular fears over the bloc’s enlargement into Eastern Europe. In the face of record unemployment and crippling austerity, the honour must be read no less as an appeal to the EU’s current leadership to live up to the original promise of promoting peace and prosperity among its people. The EU deserves credit for helping keep the peace in a continent that has been responsible for more death and bloodshed than any other in the world. But its current policies are responsible for an austerity drive so intense that it threatens the disintegration of the European project. Europe’s statesmen of the post-war generation endeavoured to institutionalise the principles of democratic reconciliation, respect for human rights and the rule of law within and between nations. These values form the bedrock of the Council of Europe, the European Court of Human Rights and the EU. Few would dispute that a response to today’s resurgent nationalist extremism and religious fundamentalism globally must ultimately draw upon and build on these principles.
Europe’s visionaries were also shrewd enough to recognise that solidarity among countries could not be sustained without material prosperity for their people. This understanding led to the pooling of Franco-German coal and steel resources and the steady removal of trade and customs tariffs between France, Germany, Italy and the Benelux countries. These visionary steps were precursors to the single market, the Schengen borderless area and the single currency. Whether they say so or not, most regional trading blocs around the world are attempts to replicate more or less the European model. To be sure, the EU’s record in the defence and promotion of human rights and democracy has been less than creditable since 9/11. Key EU states refused to endorse the illegal American invasion of Iraq but the willingness of many European countries to assist in the kidnapping and ‘rendition’ of terror suspects by the United States has exposed them to the charge of double standards and hypocrisy. A more scrupulous adherence to norms would be no less in the bloc’s own interest considering its enlargement into the Balkans where democratic institution-building remains a challenge. The EU has much work to do still to be truly worthy of the Nobel prize for peace. It should not sit on its laurels. For a globalised world has much at stake in the success of European integration.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Keeping-the-peace-in-Europe/article12557776.ece
15,10,2012,The rape of reason,"It is not unusual to hear people talk of fighting fire with fire, but is it appropriate to recommend fighting crime with crime? Former Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala apparently thinks it is. Endorsing the regressive views of some khap panchayat leaders in his State, Mr. Chautala suggested that the growing incidence of rape be addressed by relaxing the laws relating to child marriage (an offence under Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006). This is a rape of reason, based on a dangerous and completely false idea that masks the distinction between sexual desire and rape. While the first is a natural human desire, the second is a violent act borne principally out of an aggressive urge to dominate the victim; power and humiliation are integral to this act of violence rather than sexual fulfilment. The belief that there will be a radical reduction in rape incidents if men and women were allowed to marry before they turn 18 is easily disproved by some basic facts about this and other forms of sexual assault. It is stupid to assume that only single men are perpetrators of this crime; married men are rapists as well. Similarly, married women are frequent victims of rape. Finally, the idea that rape will be dissolved by marriage ignores the fact that it can — and does — take place within marriages as well.
There has been a spate of rape incidents in Haryana recently — as many as 17 in a month — in which a number of victims have been Dalit women. Already under pressure, the Haryana government and the Congress party at the State and the Centre must also contend with the ridiculous statement of a State minister explaining away most rapes as the outcome of consensual sex. Apart from taking action against the minister for making light of a serious problem, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who visited Haryana, ought to have led from the front in condemning the child marriage ‘remedy’ for rape. It is hugely ironic that this argument is raised in a country where child marriages frequently take place. Recently, four U.N. agencies estimated that more than 40 per cent of the world’s child marriages take place in India; also that in eight States of the country, over 50 per cent of young girls are married before they reach the age of 18. Mercifully, the Jat Mahapanchayat, which comprises khap panchayat leaders from across Haryana, has distanced itself from the demand of some members that the marriage age for girls be brought down to 16. Child marriages are a violation of fundamental rights and a major impediment to the empowerment of women and the establishment of gender equality.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-rape-of-reason/article12557775.ece
16,10,2012,A probe we all can trust in,"In the hubbub of sharp disagreement and the welter of allegation and counter-allegation relating to Law Minister Salman Khurshid’s charitable trust, there is a small but significant matter on which there is broad agreement. Namely, that a probe be ordered into the working of the Dr. Zakir Hussain Memorial Trust to determine if there was any misuse of Central government funds. Mr. Khurshid and his wife themselves have declared they are in favour of one and the allegations are serious enough to merit an impartial and thoroughgoing criminal investigation. Unfortunately, the need for a quick and effective probe is being lost in the flaming heat of the controversy. It has, for instance, been clouded by corruption activist Arvind Kejriwal’s strident campaign for Mr. Khurshid’s arrest and dismissal as minister — demands that are extreme at this juncture. At the same time, the issue is not — despite attempts by the Khurshids to give it such a spin — about their being subject to a trial by media. While the Khurshids may well be innocent of any wrongdoing, the charges against the trust cannot be brushed away by the Centre and the Congress leadership on the usual tired old grounds, by questioning motives and raising the bogey of political conspiracy. Or, as Union Steel Minister Beni Prasad Verma shockingly tried to do, by making light of the relatively small amount — Rs.71.5 lakh — in this era of multi-crore scandals.
There are two broad charges against the trust, relating to the acquisition of funds and their disbursement. The first relates to a letter with a forged signature by an Uttar Pradesh government official on the basis of which funds were sanctioned by the Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. Mr. Khurshid does not deny this, but argues that this is something that must be looked into and verified by the State government. The second and more contentious charge relates to whether forged documents were used to show that the trust had distributed tricycles and hearing aids to the differently abled. A draft inquiry by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) points to irregularities but the Khurshids say this is only an internal inspection report subject to revision after the audit is complete and that duly audited reports of what has been distributed and to whom have been submitted to the government. The fact that the U.P. police’s economic offences wing has started collecting documents in relation to the alleged financial irregularities is a start, though it remains to be seen whether this develops into a sincere and full-fledged probe. Since Mr. Khurshid has vociferously proclaimed his innocence, it is in his own interests to see that his name is cleared by an investigation — and quickly.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-probe-we-all-can-trust-in/article12561247.ece
16,10,2012,Still not out of the woods,"A sharp reduction in the current account deficit (CAD) from $21.8 billion in the last quarter of 2011-12 (January-March 2012) to $16.8 billion in the first quarter of the current year (April-June 2012) appears to have brought some joy to macroeconomic planners. It has been possible to bridge the lower CAD with almost the same level of capital flows that obtained during the previous quarter. India’s balance of payments is back in surplus. Important as this development has been in the management of the external economy, it is unwise to exaggerate its significance. The level of deficit is still way above what is considered prudent and manageable. Besides, the fall in the CAD is due to all the wrong reasons — falling imports that corroborate the slowdown, and decelerating exports. The outlook for software export earnings is not bright amidst the global slowdown. Expressed as a percentage of GDP, the CAD has fallen from 4.5 per cent to 3.9 per cent. Most experts have projected the CAD for 2012-13 at 3.5 per cent or lower, on the basis of certain key assumptions: that the economy will grow at a reasonably fast clip of around 6.5 per cent; oil prices will not go very much higher than current levels of around $100 a barrel; and most important of all, the actions of the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve will help in bringing economic growth in Europe and the U.S. back on track. The last point will have an all-round bearing on India’s external economy. It could help India’s faltering exports regain traction. Second, there would be far less uncertainty on the movement of capital flows to India.
There is of course a flip side to all of this. India’s growth has already slipped by most accounts to below five per cent. The cheap money policy of the Federal Reserve will boost inflation worldwide. Although it is customary to view the CAD on a par with the fiscal deficit — the menace of twin deficits as they are usually referred to — it is the latter that has received greater attention. Besides, the government seems determined to adopt questionable means to finance the deficit rather than be proactive in reining it in. For instance, recent announcements to ease external commercial borrowings and encourage capital market flows from abroad might have had the intended effect of boosting stock prices. But these are not sound policies from the point of view of the macroeconomy. Encouraging foreign currency borrowing to take advantage of the surfeit of funds circulating abroad is hardly the right strategy for an economy whose level of short-term debt has been rising and exchange reserves falling.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Still-not-out-of-the-woods/article12558900.ece
17,10,2012,Shome panel’s wrong call,"The stage, it appears, is being set for giving the issue of retrospective taxation, introduced in the last Budget, a quiet burial. The Parthasarathi Shome committee, originally constituted to frame guidelines for General Anti Avoidance Rules (GAAR), was handed the additional mandate of examining the taxation principles on transfer of shares in a foreign company with underlying assets in India. The immediate provocation for this was the furore over the retrospective amendment to tax laws in the last Budget that rendered Vodafone liable to pay a tax of Rs. 11,200 crore despite the Supreme Court ruling in its favour early this year. Amidst threats that this amendment would permanently antagonise foreign investors, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh referred the issue to the Shome committee well after the man who started it all in the Budget, Pranab Mukherjee, was safely settled in Rashtrapati Bhavan. The committee has now delivered its draft report, which should be music to the ears of Vodafone and other foreign investors. If accepted, the recommendations will completely nullify the Budget proposal and let not just Vodafone off the hook but also foreign portfolio investors investing in the stock market through the undesirable route of participatory notes (P-notes).
The committee has rightly said that the retrospective application of tax law should happen in the rarest of rare cases and for one of three reasons only: to correct anomalies in the statute, to matters that are clarificatory in nature such as technical/procedural defects that vitiate the substantive law and, lastly, to protect the tax base from abusive tax planning schemes whose main purpose is to avoid tax. Yet, in a touching display of affection for Vodafone, Mr. Shome’s report says that even in the exceptional situations where the law is applied retrospectively on the indirect transfer of assets, the taxpayer in question should not be slapped with interest and penalties on the tax deemed as payable. The grounds? There should be “no undue hardship caused to the taxpayer” even if the taxpayer in question is guilty of aggressive tax planning — a concession that is not extended to common taxpayers who are penalised even for small lapses. The Shome panel may also have given a leg-up to foreign portfolio investors using the P-note route, which has been frowned upon by the stock market regulator SEBI, as it hides the identity of the investor. This route has been used by industrialists to rig up their share prices in the recent past and SEBI had placed temporary restrictions on P-notes a couple of years ago. Given this, it is surprising that the committee has now recommended that they should not be taxed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Shome-panel%E2%80%99s-wrong-call/article12560101.ece
17,10,2012,In denial over Malala,"If there is anything more chilling than a teenage girl being shot in the head for merely demanding that she and other girls should be allowed to attend school, it is the twisted mindset that has buried the targeted attack on Malala Yousafzai in conspiracy theories. The initial outrage across Pakistan at the targeted shooting of the 14-year-old by the Taliban has degenerated into a slanging contest between ‘us’ and ‘them’. The ‘us’ are those who, at their generous best, see her shooting as ‘collateral damage’ — an inevitable by-product of drone attacks and Pakistan’s partnership in the U.S.-led war on terror. At their cynical worst, they see it as a western conspiracy to pressure Pakistan into conducting a military operation in North Waziristan. Some even claim the shooting was staged, and portray Malala and her father as western agents. On the other side are ‘them’, Pakistanis filled with revulsion that some of their fellow countrymen could target a child. But their hope that this would be a turning point has been belied; the ‘us’ are walking away with the narrative. The past few days have seen the reactivation of propagandists of the Pakistani establishment. Ironically, they did so at a time the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, which claimed the shooting, began to feel the heat of public anger against it.
Once again, an opportunity to mould opinion against terrorism in Pakistan has come and gone. Clearly, it is not easy to abandon a studiously created narrative of a citadel of Islam that is built on the denial of geographical and historical moorings and an over-eagerness to align itself with the culturally alien Arab world. The Pakistan military has tried to sound committed to fighting terrorism, but it will take more than a few speeches by the Chief of Army Staff. Indeed, no one is convinced that the security establishment has turned its back on its strategic assets. Conveniently, the Army has declared it is for the political leadership to decide on a North Waziristan operation, knowing full well the limitations of these leaders, that too, in the months before a general election. There is no gainsaying that the civilian leadership should be more assertive, but it is also no secret that the current dispensation exchanged its right to frame security policy with the military for its survival. A year ago, an all-party meeting offered an olive branch to the Taliban as part of a ‘give-peace-a-chance’ strategy but in vain. The number of terror strikes has dropped but the clock continues to tick in the form of the quiet but steadily creeping radicalisation of society that provides terrorism its ideological space. It will take more than an operation in remote North Waziristan to deal with that.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/In-denial-over-Malala/article12560100.ece
18,10,2012,A public-private partnership,"Ever since India Against Corruption cited business information in the public domain to allege the existence of a nexus between Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law Robert Vadra and real estate giant DLF, Congress leaders have insisted that no probe is needed since the impugned transactions were between “private individuals.” The argument is an absurd one for a seasoned political party to make because perception is everything in politics and the public simply isn’t buying it. The party high command ought to have realised that Mr. Vadra, who is a part of the Congress’s first family, must, like Pompeia, be well and truly above suspicion. Instead of taking measures to reassure the public that the business dealings of Mr. Vadra — who has accumulated assets worth hundreds of crores of rupees in the past five years — were indeed above board, senior ministers and spokespersons said he was a private citizen who had nothing to answer for. Today, that argument makes even less sense in the light of what seems like the punitive transfer of Haryana’s top land official shortly after he initiated an internal probe into Mr. Vadra’s land dealings. The official, Ashok Khemka, discovered irregularities in at least one of the deals struck between Mr. Vadra and DLF. He also ordered an inquiry into the possible undervaluation of properties sold or bought by Mr. Vadra in four districts of the State.
Given the questionable decision to transfer Mr. Khemka, the suspicion that the DLF-Vadra private partnership has official support can no longer be sidestepped or dismissed. Admittedly, nothing in the documents produced by the IAC so far establishes or proves wrongdoing on the part of Mr. Vadra or DLF. But the whiff of impropriety is all around and if the party high command still believes it can brazen things out it is making a serious mistake. The more the Congress and the Central and State governments resist or foreclose the launching of a probe into his dealings, the greater will be the public perception that Mr. Vadra used his friendships and relationships with people in high places to further his own business interests. The Haryana government has offered a most unconvincing explanation for why Mr. Khemka was removed from his post as Director General for Land Consolidation and Inspector General of Registration after serving barely three months of a tenure that is meant to run for a minimum of two years as per the rules of the Department of Personnel and Training. The Haryana government says it will now look into Mr. Vadra’s land deals but any probe it launches is unlikely to have credibility. Instead, Mr. Khemka must be reinstated in his post and allowed to complete the inquiries he initiated.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-public-private-partnership/article12561246.ece
18,10,2012,"Mantel, once more","There is something reassuringly comforting in Hilary Mantel’s second Booker Prize — a feeling engendered by the knowledge that the judges were not influenced by a clutch of extraneous reasons. For instance, that she had won before (the only previous two-time winners in Booker history are J.M. Coetzee and Peter Carey), that she had won only recently (for Wolf Hall in 2009), or that her novel, Bring Up The Bodies, is the middle novel of a trilogy (and so, by some obscure yardstick of literary assessment, less deserving of awards). In a shortlist that included Will Self’s much-fancied and audaciously experimental Umbrella, it may be tempting to see Mantel’s historical fiction as the conservative choice. The truth, however, is anything but that, as Mantel has, through a combination of sheer erudition and talent for imaginative interpretation, recast the game of historical fiction. Far more complex than the frothy Jean Plaidy-esque accounts that we have come to associate with the genre, Mantel’s story is much more than a retelling; it is a reimagining that combines a flair for storytelling with a gift for interpreting history in a most compelling way.
Bring Up The Bodies, which spans a period of the few months leading up to the fall and execution of Henry VIII’s second wife Anne Boleyn, is a sharper and more immersive work than her monumental Wolf Hall. Told through the eyes of Thomas Cromwell, the blacksmith’s son who rose to power on the back of Henry VIII’s royal favour, the two books take place against the tumultuous backdrop of the English Reformation. This is historical fiction with a point of view — the scheming Cromwell is pencilled in a sympathetic light while the saintly halo of Thomas More is redrawn as a ring of stubborn fanaticism. When Mantel is done with her third novel, called The Mirror And The Light, there seems little doubt that she would be regarded as having written one of the great epics of modern literature. “You wait for 20 years and then two come along at once,” she said in her acceptance speech. The humorous quip could well be an allusion to how late recognition has been in coming. After all, her A Place of Greater Safety, set during the French Revolution and woven around Robespierre, Danton and Desmoulins, is another raw and compelling masterpiece. Her first attempt at a novel, Mantel began work on this at a time when historical fiction was well out of fashion and it took years for her to find a publisher. Meanwhile, she had begun to experiment with other genres and arguably lost her way somewhat. The two Booker prizes validate a great writer but also the recovery of her original voice.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mantel-once-more/article12561244.ece
19,10,2012,How the plots thicken,"For the second time in less than a month, the Bharatiya Janata Party has had to speak up on behalf of its president Nitin Gadkari. The first was when anti-corruption activist Anjali Damania alleged that he refused to take a stand on the irrigation scam in Maharashtra citing business relations with Sharad Pawar of the Nationalist Congress Party. Even before she had named Mr. Gadkari, the BJP jumped in to say that the party president and Ms Damania had never met. It was Ms Damania’s word against the BJP leader and few will believe such a nexus is impossible. The BJP admittedly goofed up in its eagerness to issue a denial because documents the party later released showed that Mr Gadkari had indeed met Ms Damania. This time round, a relieved BJP pantheon dismissed the disclosures by India Against Corruption which showed the NCP’s Ajit Pawar had granted Mr. Gadkari’s NGO favours while allotting land plots acquired from farmers in Vidarbha.
Mr. Gadkari is contesting the next Lok Sabha polls and there is reason to believe he is keen on becoming Prime Minister. At a time when a clean image could help, the Damanias and Kejriwals have come along with a sheaf of documents. Even if the BJP brushes aside the latest allegations, there is a perception created in the public mind about an unholy nexus and quid pro quo. Mr. Gadkari’s detractors within the BJP too had to defend him sotto voce. It is significant that two new entrants from the BJP into politics in Maharashtra are Mitesh Bhangdia, MLC and Ajay Sancheti, Rajya Sabha MP. Both are leading contractors from Vidarbha and both are said to be close to Mr. Gadkari. Mr. Bhangdia had NCP support too in his election triumph. The old cliché — in politics there are no permanent enemies — is operative here and the rightwing parties and the Congress-NCP have been rather chummy by all accounts in Maharashtra. So the Shiv Sena supports Pratibha Patil and later Pranab Mukherjee for President, while the NCP has teamed up with the BJP to control corporations and local bodies. It may be difficult to prove a nexus between political parties in a court of law but the insinuation is enough to a weary public that has long suspected it. Mr. Kejriwal’s exposé may not have been the bombshell the BJP expected but it is damaging to the party that aims to make a difference. The question is whether these sporadic allegations and exposures can sustain themselves in the public mind till the next general elections. In any case, no party can afford to ignore them, especially in the age of the Right to Information when documentary evidence of impropriety and wrongdoing abounds.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/How-the-plots-thicken/article12562596.ece
19,10,2012,An Obama comeback,"The second United States presidential election debate, held on October 16 between the incumbent Barack Obama and his challenger Mitt Romney at Hofstra University in New York State, was dramatically different from the first. Perhaps buoyed by running mate Joe Biden’s win in the vice-presidential encounter, President Obama was unrecognisably more assertive about his facts and his achievements. Governor Romney stopped trying to connect personally with the 82-member audience of undecided voters and gave his full attention to the tussle, which saw both men walking around, attacking and counterattacking as the tension rose palpably and the moderator repeatedly reminded them to address the questions. Predictably, Mr. Romney criticised the President’s economic record and plans, but that was because he was himself under fire, and he stretched the facts in the process. For example, Mr. Obama’s comment that Romney companies outsource jobs to China brought the reaction that the President’s own pension funds had investments in China — yet the point refers to Mr. Obama’s pension from his Illinois senatorship, and the incumbent drew laughter when he told the multimillionaire Mr. Romney, ‘My pension’s not as big as yours.’ Mr. Obama, for his part, had to work to answer an attack over the reduction in licences to exploit energy resources below federal land; his reply that the companies involved had to use the licences or lose them did not really register in the din.
The only foreign policy issue the candidates covered in detail was the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. The President did not really answer the question about who was responsible for not responding to the consulate’s request for more security. Mr. Obama, however, rose in stature with the comment that for him national security is not a party-political issue. Mr. Romney’s attack on the administration’s alleged inactivity over Iran — whether Iran is really a threat to the U.S. went unexamined — and his accusation that the President wanted to put daylight between the U.S. and Israel brought a sarcastic reaction from Mr. Obama that he had pulled the country out of Iraq, killed Osama bin Laden, and was leaving Afghanistan. But given voter anxiety about jobs, the focus was unsurprisingly on the economy. Mr. Obama deflected criticism of his economic record by stating that the challenger will not close the loopholes that help corporations make tax-free profits from offshoring or outsourcing. Mr. Romney will have startled his own team by saying he would raise federal grants for college study. While it is the President did not get as much political capital from this debate as Mr. Romney did from the first one, this election remains a close contest.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/An-Obama-comeback/article12562592.ece
20,10,2012,The quest for Naga accord,"A process that could lead to an honourable settlement of the six-decades-old Naga problem seems to be in the making. With the Prime Minister giving the go-ahead, the Union Home Ministry has begun discussing with all regional stakeholders the broad contours of a proposal that was hammered out earlier in negotiations between the Union government and the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah). The NSCN (I-M), the major player among Naga groups, has accepted — at least for the “interim” — the impracticality of demanding the integration of contiguous Naga-inhabited areas including those in Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh, and of redrawing State boundaries. More importantly, it has tempered its demand for “Naga sovereignty,” thereby allowing an outcome that can conform to the basic structure of the Constitution. An agreement being stitched up before the State Assembly elections that are due by March 2013 will enable former insurgent groups to take part in the democratic process. The larger political environment appears conducive for a democratic reconciliation.
But there is still a long way to go, and many minefields to cross. Several concessions on the government’s part, including grant of a special brand of autonomy and freedom for Nagaland, will be required. For the grant of special status, additions will need to be made to Article 371A, under which no Act of Parliament applies to Nagaland in respect of the religious or social practices of the Nagas, administration of civil and criminal justice involving decisions under customary Naga law, and ownership and transfer of land and its resources, unless its Assembly so decides. The creation of a pan-Naga social body to highlight the identity of the people appears to be a key element of the formula. Its role, scope and powers need to be defined with clarity in order to avoid difficulties. The constitutional amendment that some of these proposals will entail requires national political consensus. Even the question of decommissioning weapons held by militants needs to be resolved. In the short term, a consensus will be needed to meet a demand that has been raised by Nagaland legislators for an alternative interim administrative arrangement. There is no time like the present to let the process reach its logical culmination. But every strand in this complex tapestry needs to be laid in place carefully. A prudent balance needs to be struck between what the Centre can concede and what the insurgents can accept. This has to be done on the basis of a clear understanding of the changing social and political dynamics of the region as a whole.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-quest-for-naga-accord/article4013767.ece
20,10,2012,Sanctity of heritage,"It is a settled principle in law that worship in any form cannot be permitted in notified monuments. But the Jamiat-Ulama-i-Hind, unmindful of the consequences, has made a sinister request to the National Commission for Minorities to allow prayers in 31 Delhi mosques which are protected monuments of national importance and are managed by the Archaeological Survey of India. The Commission appears not to be keen on allowing worship in heritage monuments, but it has also not categorically rejected the Jamiat’s move as untenable. Rather it has suggested to the government that the structures in question be surveyed along with other ancient mosques to evolve guidelines for worship and repair. Religious structures of architectural and historical significance which are more than 100 years old can be notified as monuments of importance under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958. If at the time of notification the structure had been in disuse and worship had stopped, the Act does not permit the introduction of religious activities. Whenever fringe groups have attempted to breach these provisions, such as at the Qutub Minar complex in 2009, the government, to its credit, has successfully resisted it.
The courts too have unambiguously objected to any change in the heritage character of monuments. In Satinder Kumar and Ors. Vs Union of India (2007), the Himachal Pradesh High Court pronounced that “once a monument has been declared to be a protected monument and is owned by the Government, then the congregation cannot insist that the place of worship must actually and actively be used for religious services.” This judgment effectively stalled one of the Christian communities in Shimla from performing religious functions in the church located within the Rashtrapati Nivas — a national monument under ASI care. Even in monuments where worship is permitted because religious activities were ongoing at the time of notification, the law prohibits changes to the original arrangement. The Rock Cut Temples at Thirumalpuram, Tamil Nadu, are a case in point. When a Hindu religious group wanted to extend the duration of worship in this protected monument, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court agreed with ASI’s objections and refused permission. Radical groups often put forth specious arguments that monuments could be better protected by introducing religious activities. Conservation of monuments has to be improved where it falls short, but the issue of maintenance cannot be an excuse to appropriate monuments. What is at stake is also communal harmony. The government must protect our ancient monuments from religious zealots.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sanctity-of-heritage/article4013923.ece
22,10,2012,A sobering report on hunger,"One in eight people, or 12.5 per cent of the world’s population, is chronically undernourished today says the latest State of Food Insecurity (SOFI) report. The grave ethical and practical implications of this abominable statistic from the three Rome-based United Nations agencies are obvious. Not least because mass hunger is a man-made phenomenon. Historically, hunger and starvation have been caused not by shortfalls in food production but rather by distortions in commodity markets, deficiencies in distribution and political inaction. We also know the long-term effects of chronic malnourishment on maternal and neonatal health and developmental outcomes among children. That said, a positive finding from SOFI is that the number of malnourished people has declined overall in the past two decades. So the Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of the hungry and malnourished in developing countries by 2015 is still within reach, provided governments initiate effective intervention. But progress has by no means been uniform. Asia and Latin America are on track to meet this target, while Africa has fallen behind due to regression in Sub-Saharan Africa. The proportion of the malnourished in South Asia has in fact increased from 32.7 per cent to 35, while South-Eastern Asia has seen a nearly 50 per cent decline. Fiscal hawks who tend to view public investment in basic services as an impediment to growth ought to take notice of this contrast.
Indeed, the key message in the report is that economic growth by itself is not sufficient to eradicate hunger and malnourishment (just as relatively modest growth is not an excuse for poor nutritional results). Among the remedies proposed are a greater impetus to agriculture, where most of the poor are concentrated, and nutrition and gender sensitive policies. It lays particular emphasis on the public provision of goods and services in health care and sanitation for the most needy. The world financial, food and fuel crises of 2007-2008 have eroded the nutritive gains achieved in earlier years, says the report. But the impact may have been an indirect one of the negative influence food price spikes exert on dietary choices. A common refrain during the recurrent food crises of recent years has been that small-holder farming, rather than large-scale land acquisitions by giant corporations, must be strengthened to protect the worst affected. Policy and decision-makers would do well to remember this. Equally, the costs and benefits of the diversion of food grains and feed for the production of biofuels cannot be overlooked, especially since the jury is out on the latter’s environmental effects.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-sobering-report-on-hunger/article4023193.ece
22,10,2012,The economics of nature,"The strongest message to emerge from the global conference of the Convention on Biological Diversity in Hyderabad is that countries allowing their natural capital to be rapidly depleted and destroyed in pursuit of short-term goals are dangerously risking their future. Many examples from around the world underscore the importance of diverse plant and animal species to agriculture, human health, climate and the complex web of interactions that make up an ecosystem. It is important to note, for example, that the latest update of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species classifies 20,219 of the 65,518 species listed, as facing extinction. Given the rising threat, the Conference of the Parties to the CBD have done well to commit themselves to a doubling of biodiversity funding for developing countries, although from a modest baseline. India, which has assumed the presidency of the conference and is itself biodiversity-rich, must show leadership by mainstreaming ecosystem concerns in development policy. It has won plaudits by allocating $50 million towards building technical and human capacity to attain biodiversity conservation goals in the country. But the real test lies in its commitment towards strengthening and implementing national laws on environment protection, forests, wetlands, marine areas, wildlife, tribal welfare, air quality and urban development. Some key laws, notably the Environment (Protection) Act, are weakly enforced at present, if at all. State governments share a considerable part of the blame for rendering the law sterile.
Arguably, some of the most important takeaways for participants of the Hyderabad meet come from the findings of The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity studies. They show that nature is critically important to the livelihood of millions, and in India, 47 per cent of the ‘GDP of the Poor’ comes from ecosystem services. It is heartening that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh acknowledged this contribution of natural capital to the economy of the less affluent — in comparison with conventional GDP measurements. There are valuable insights also for urban areas in the ‘Cities and Biodiversity Outlook’ study. A preliminary assessment of Bangalore, for instance, has demonstrated the value of biodiversity to slum livelihoods, in the form of food and herbal medicines. Local body governments, however, were found to have insufficient knowledge on sustainable development. These are pointers to the work that lies ahead. The CBD’s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity and its Aichi Targets for 2020 call for speedy action to stem losses. India must lead by example over the next two years.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-economics-of-nature/article4019667.ece
22,10,2012,Lost childhood,"The alarmingly high prevalence of child marriages in India became known globally when International Day of the Girl Child was celebrated for the first time on October 11. According to UNICEF, girl child marriages in India stood at 43 per cent in 2007-2008; it was 54 per cent in 1992-1993. A recent report of the United National Population Fund (UNPFA) also underlines the magnitude of the problem. Forty-seven per cent of women between the ages 20 to 24 were married before they turned 18 during the period 2000-2011, it stated. In 2006 alone, 11 States had 40 to 61 per cent of women in the 20-24 age group who were married by age 18. No wonder that India accounts for over 40 per cent of the world’s child marriages. Three consecutive household surveys (1992-1993, 1999 and 2005-2006) show the rate of child marriage among girls below 15 years had fallen from 26 per cent in 1992-1993 to 18 per cent in 2005-2006, an overall drop of 30 per cent. The corresponding rate of reduction during the same time period in girls below 18 years was only 12.5 per cent. While this drop, for girls below 15 years, provides some reason to cheer, it is “still not sufficient to guarantee children their full rights,” UNFPA notes.
The slow pace of decline is frustrating as the spectre of child marriage manifests itself in multiple ways — the abrupt termination of education and life-threatening health problems. A body of evidence indicates that teenage girls are less aware of contraceptives, very often do not have access to them and lack the bargaining power to use them. Thus they end up with unwanted pregnancies at a very early stage. Complications from pregnancy and childbirth are the prime cause of death in teenage mothers and their babies in low- and middle-income countries. Lack of education, rural settings and poor economic status are some of the key determinants of teenage wedlock. The UNFPA report indicates that girls from rural areas in India were twice more likely to be married than urban girls. Those with nil education were thrice more likely to become victims compared to those with secondary or higher education. While minor girls from the poorest families had a 75 per cent possibility of being married, 16 per cent from the richest households ended up the same way. Aside from poverty and lack of education, social norms and perceptions are important factors too. Hence the approach to deal with the two strata should have many commonalities and yet be different. Providing education, creating awareness and offering incentives linked to delayed marriages are more important for the lower strata. Changing social perceptions should be the priority in the case of rich parents.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lost-childhood/article4019668.ece
23,10,2012,Beginning of the end,"Does the Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s (DGCA) decision to temporarily suspend the licence of Kingfisher Airlines until it comes up with a concrete and reliable revival plan mark the end of the road for the company? Assuming that the airline does come up with such a plan in the next couple of weeks, the DGCA and Civil Aviation Ministry will still take their time to review the airworthiness of the now limited fleet of aircraft available with Kingfisher and also assess the financial viability of the airline before renewing its licence. On the airline management’s part, negotiations with striking employees will continue in search of an evasive settlement. With their pay several months in arrears, how can employees be expected to resume duty with the offer of a month or two’s salary? Now that virtually all domestic financing options have been exhausted and lenders are working on properties they can attach, Kingfisher is hoping foreign investment will provide it some muscle to revive operations. The Airports Authority of India has made it clear that it will not allow anybody else to lay hands on the aircraft, which are being stripped of their vital parts. Unless its promoter Vijay Mallya manages to pull another rabbit out of his hat, this really looks like the beginning of the end for the high profile airline.
In the normal course, and given the facts of the case, there are minimal chances of survival for Kingfisher since it suffers from “terminal illness.” Though Air India may be in very much the same condition, it survives because it is government-owned and much of its sickness comes from the government's own mismanagement of the airline over the years. Till now, Mr. Mallya has tried every trick to save his airline. Many shares of United Breweries Holdings — the flagship company of his group — and property development assets have been pledged to keep the banks happy. And yet the airline has run up accumulated losses of over Rs. 8000 crore and debts of about Rs. 7000 crore. Kingfisher owes huge sums to the AAI, the oil companies, the consortium of banks, and above all, has not paid salaries to a vast majority of its staff. Where can management possibly find the resources to meet these commitments and then resume operations? Though the Centre has allowed foreign direct investment in airline companies up to 49 per cent of equity, the fact is that given its precarious financial condition there may not be any suitor for Kingfisher. About the only valuable assets that it can claim are landing and take-off slots at major airports across the country along with parking rights. They are still not attractive enough to compensate for the liabilities that will come along.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/beginning-of-the-end/article4023190.ece
24,10,2012,Mobility for everyone,"The Delhi High Court order dismissing a challenge to the Bus Rapid Transit System in the national capital is praiseworthy for its assertion that the urban commons, represented by road space, is a public good. The judgment correctly observes that governments pursue the principal purpose of promoting welfare of the maximum number of people, rather than distributing public goods in a restrictive manner. Delightfully, the court makes short work of the NGO petitioner’s elitist argument, that wealth creators who ride in cars deserve special consideration — in the form of more road space — over those who take public transport. In Delhi, the opening of the 5.6 km section of the new bus system has met with fierce resistance from car users on the ground that they now have less space. It is now for the Delhi government to remove any road engineering bottlenecks in the system that threatened to overturn the egalitarian BRT idea. But another important part of the court’s order pertains to the evidence on lopsided official transport priorities. Delhi has deployed most of the funds from the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission to create facilities for cars and private motorised vehicles. This is the national pattern now and it is starving public transport, walking and cycling facilities of investments. What this exposes is cynical contempt among policymakers towards the needs of the largest number of road users. Clearly, they have been failed by the UPA government which announced the National Urban Transport Policy six years ago.
In what now appears to be nothing more than a pious declaration, the NUTP said it would bring about “a more equitable allocation of road space with people, rather than vehicles, as its main focus.” Central funding would be offered to encourage more people to use public transport. But very little action has followed. It is time the Centre took its own policy seriously and introduced firm conditions that the States must meet while accessing funding under JNNURM and other Plan schemes. Integrating various modes of transport for seamless city travel covering train, bus and feeder systems is an important NUTP goal. Again, hardly any progress has been made on this. Enhancing comfort and safety is important to shift commuters from personal vehicles to public transport. The way forward is to introduce a congestion charge for personal cars and use the funds to cross-subsidise modern public transport in cities. The idea is not new, and remains on the list of gridlock-reducing measures for Delhi since last year. Car and two-wheeler users do have a point about poor quality and supply of public mobility options. Integration, sensible fares, adequate infrastructure and pedestrianisation can win them over.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mobility-for-everyone/article4026261.ece
24,10,2012,Pre-poll footfalls,"Padayatras are the mass contact programmes of Indian politicians. Whether to highlight one dominant issue or merely to ask for the voter’s indulgence during a low phase, politicians, especially those in the opposition, take to walkathons like a fish to water. But even so, Andhra Pradesh is getting more than its share of padayatras this season. While Telugu Desam Party president N. Chandrababu Naidu is on a ‘Vastunna Meekosam’ (“I am coming to you”) campaign, YSR Congress leader Sharmila is on ‘Maro Praja Prasthanam’ (“Another journey to the people”). The opposition space seems to be up for grabs as the TDP and the YSR Congress target the Congress government of Kiran Kumar Reddy for failing to implement, and even diluting, schemes beneficial to the people. Mr. Naidu’s yatra is part-apology, part-boast, and part-promise. He admits to past mistakes, speaks of successful projects implemented while he was in power, and promises change for the better if voted to govern again. With the rise of the Telangana Rashtra Samiti in Telangana, and the YSR Congress in Rayalaseema, the TDP is struggling to keep its share of the anti-Congress votes. Popular disenchantment with the Congress will not automatically translate into votes for Mr. Naidu. Quite strangely for an opposition party, the TDP found itself being asked to spell out its stand on bifurcation of the State as Mr. Naidu entered the Telangana region.
As for Ms Sharmila, who is hoping to revive memories of her late father Y.S. Rajashekhara Reddy’s long march, the task is to attack both the Congress and the TDP at the same time in order to project the YSR Congress as a viable alternative in the next election. While laying claim to the YSR legacy, Ms Sharmila is also taking credit for the schemes implemented by the Congress government under her father. However, all this does not mean the people of Andhra Pradesh are spoilt for choice at election-time. Political fragmentation means that different issues will be the focus in different areas of the State. The TRS is a one-issue party as of now with statehood for Telangana as its sole concern. The YSR Congress is seeking to politically encash the YSR charisma, but with its leadership deeply mired in corruption charges the party is not an automatic choice as an alternative to the Congress beyond a certain geographical reach. The TDP, in the years since it was voted out in 2004, has done little to win back the people’s confidence. Thus, while the erosion of support for the Congress is evident, no one opposition party is the gainer. In such a situation, post-poll alliances could decide the contours of the next government in Andhra Pradesh as much as pre-poll seat adjustments.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/prepoll-footfalls/article4026262.ece
24,10,2012,An irresponsible escalation,"The European Union’s recent announcement of stronger sanctions against Iran shows the extent of current western hostility towards that country. The latest sanctions will freeze assets held in the EU by 30 Iranian bodies, including the National Iranian Oil Company, the National Iranian Tanker Company, and the Naftiran Intertrade Company. Restrictions have also been imposed on Iran’s Central bank and other Iranian banks. The main European satellite provider Eutelsat has also stopped carrying 19 Iranian state-run stations, though in Europe these are still accessible on the internet. Other sanctions already in place often make it necessary for Iranian civil aircraft to leave Iran with full tanks and reduced cargo, and then to interrupt return flights for refuelling in non-EU countries. Of course the sanctions also protect specific western interests; for example, the Shah Deniz oil project in Azerbaijan, which is jointly led by BP and Norway’s Statoil and in which Naftiran has a 10 per cent stake, will be exempt. The EU claims the measures, which now cover natural gas and apply over and above the progressively strengthened and widened ones the United States has imposed on Iran since 1987, are meant to put more pressure on President Ahmadinejad’s government in Tehran over its nuclear enrichment and missile programmes. Iran denies having a nuclear weapons programme, and its strongest international supporter, Russia, says the EU move is a blow to the unity of the six countries — the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany — which are negotiating nuclear issues with Tehran.
The entire western approach, however, is raising tensions without cease, and harming ordinary Iranians. The average Iranian passenger plane is 24 years old; with international maintenance contracts in abeyance, grounded machines are being cannibalised for spare parts. Air travel by the country’s carriers is increasingly dangerous. The greatest hurt, however, is being caused to millions of Iranian citizens; lives are at risk because shipments of medicines, including those from individuals to their families, are being blocked. Iranian opposition figures are on record saying sanctions will only encourage the country’s hardliners. Yet U.S. politicians have adopted an increasingly menacing tone. Representative Brad Sherman says of harm to the Iranian people, “…we need to do just that.” Senator Mark Kirk says so much suffering must be inflicted on the people that they rebel. Prudence suggests the U.S. and the EU must leave all parties room for compromise, or war will loom ever larger. The West has clearly learned nothing from its misadventures in West Asia.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-irresponsible-escalation/article4026248.ece
25,10,2012,"Suspect, by all accounts","Exposure is a risk that comes with secrecy. As suspicions about his possible involvement with a steel major refuse to die down, former Union Minister of Steel and Himachal Pradesh Congress leader Virbhadra Singh can have no choice but face up to a full-fledged inquiry into his financial dealings over the past few years. Protests and denials will no longer do. While he may choose to continue to ridicule opposition politicians and rebuke journalists, Mr. Singh will also have to answer some tough queries relating to the phenomenal increase of Rs.6.57 crore in his agricultural income declared through a revised filing of Income Tax returns for three years. Even as the Income Tax authorities scrutinise his claimed agricultural income, documents already in the public realm necessitate a thorough investigation into the possibility of corrupt quid pro quo deals between him and the steel company. The Opposition alleges that the revised filing of returns for three assessment years beginning 2009-10, on March 2, 2012, could be linked not to earnings from Mr. Singh’s apple orchard but to cash payments made by the Ispat group to one ‘VBS,’ according to documents seized by the tax authorities.
Given the sums involved, Mr. Singh surely has a lot of explaining to do. However, over the last few days, he has shown no willingness to come forward and clear his name. Instead of responding to the specific charges against him, Mr. Singh chose to behave as though all this was no more than an elaborate political ploy by the Opposition just before the Himachal Pradesh Assembly election. That leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party who highlighted the allegations are politically motivated is no doubt true, but how has this got anything to do with his own proclaimed innocence? The issue is not the political partisanship of his accusers, but the gaps in his own accounting. Secretive deals kept away from the columns of an accounting ledger have a way of cropping up at even more inconvenient places. If the allegations are false, as Mr. Singh insists they are, then the truth is his best defence. The Congress leader should show the courage to place all the relevant facts before the people and even ask for a thorough investigation into the management of his finances. At the same time, this is not a question of one former minister battling a corruption charge. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh dropped Mr. Virbhadra Singh from his cabinet soon after the diary entries were discovered. Was his ouster a mere coincidence? Even if it was, the Prime Minister still needs to get the facts that have come to light since then properly investigated. Sadly, it has become something of a pattern with the government that graft charges are probed only after the courts or auditors or the media start pointing fingers, not before.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/suspect-by-all-accounts/article4028445.ece
25,10,2012,"Well intentioned, wrong headed","Two recent moves by the capital market regulator to enhance the quality of investor protection, though well intentioned, are likely to be counterproductive in practice. Earlier this month, SEBI issued a formal order laying down broad criteria for rejecting the draft offer documents filed by prospective issuers of securities. Last month, through a discussion paper, SEBI revived an old idea of introducing a mandatory safety net mechanism for specified securities in public issues. Both these seek to enhance the quality of the primary market, the first one by screening the draft prospectuses to weed out undesirable or ineligible public offers and the second, by ushering in a support price mechanism in the post issue period. The task of laying down standards for draft offer documents has obviously not been easy. Inevitably, the regulator has only been able to prescribe broad yardsticks which have ended up being too vague. For instance, one of the grounds for rejection is when SEBI has reasonable grounds to believe that the draft offer document is deficient from the point of view of adequacy and quality of disclosures. Those are areas where subjective judgements by the regulator might smack of misuse of its discretionary powers. Moreover, unless the promoters brazenly violate guidelines in areas such as deliberately fudging the objects of the issue, or the sources of their initial capital contribution, it will be beyond the regulator to spot malfeasance and reject the offer document.
An even more general argument against both the recent SEBI initiatives arises out of the fact that primary market investments, as much as those in the secondary market, involve risk taking by investors. It is the duty of the regulator to prescribe reasonable safeguards and disclosures of risks. But it is an entirely different matter for capital market regulators to try and ensure total safety of equity investments, even assuming they have the wherewithal. The proposal to introduce a safety net for small investors long after the shares are listed will be another example of regulatory overreach. Since the issuers of securities will have to buy a fixed quantity of shares at the issue price if their market quotation falls below certain benchmarks, the expenses of the issue will further mount and be a serious disincentive to fund raising. Besides, the proposal erroneously assumes that all initial public offers, after they are listed, will follow the same price patterns in sync with identified stock market indices. The regulator is not helping the new issue market and its participants with these two proposals.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/well-intentioned-wrong-headed/article4028447.ece
31,10,2012,Pragmatic stance,"The second quarter monetary policy review has further reinforced the Reserve Bank of India’s credentials as a pragmatic inflation fighter, not swayed by either market expectations or overt signals from the Finance Minister favouring a cut in policy rates. The traditional monetary policy dilemma of supporting growth versus reining in inflation has remained. Growth considerations are behind the decision to lower the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 0.25 percentage points — to release Rs.17,500 crore of primary liquidity — while leaving the repo rate unchanged. Thus over two consecutive policy statements, the RBI has chosen to influence interest rates through liquidity-augmenting CRR reductions rather than through the more traditional method of policy rate cuts. The expectation is that fresh injections of liquidity will induce banks to lower interest rates. A repo rate cut, on the other hand, might convey the impression that the central bank is loosening its monetary policy prematurely. In the event, the RBI has done well to emphasise the point that managing inflation and inflation expectations must remain the core focus of monetary policy, especially when inflationary pressures have persisted even as growth has moderated. Headline inflation for September has been at a 10-month high of 7.8 per cent and is expected to ease only by the fourth quarter of the year. Of particular concern has been the stickiness of core inflation due to supply constraints and the cost-push effects of the rupee’s depreciation. The RBI has raised its inflation forecast for March 2013 to 7.5 per cent from 7 per cent indicated in July.
In line with expectations, the RBI has lowered its growth forecast for the current year to 5.8 per cent. Almost all private forecasters and several international agencies, including the IMF, have already downgraded India’s growth prospects. The slowdown is attributed to the worsening global environment, weak industrial activity and slower than anticipated growth in services. The large current account and fiscal deficits continue to pose significant risks to both growth and macroeconomic stability. The RBI has obviously not been swayed by the government’s recent policy announcements aimed at attracting foreign direct investment. They might have positively impacted sentiment, but need to be followed up with concrete action on the ground to revive investment. Much also depends on how efficaciously the government implements the fiscal consolidation map outlined by the Finance Minister on Monday, according to which the fiscal deficit is to be contained to within 5.3 per cent of GDP by March 2013 and then to 3 per cent over a five-year period.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pragmatic-stance/article4048246.ece
31,10,2012,Mali on the brink,"The October 12 United Nations Security Council Resolution confirming the possibility, under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, of military intervention in northern Mali is a clear sign of the severe internal divisions in the country. The resolution requires the regional powers and the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) to work with U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in preparing a “detailed and actionable” plan within 45 days, without which the U.N. will not pass a further resolution authorising intervention. Training and other support from the European Union and the United States will also aid the proposed force of 3,200, which in any case will not be ready until the end of the year. Meanwhile the African Union is trying to encourage political engagement; its Peace and Security Council (AUPSC) has readmitted Mali following the suspension imposed when a military coup on March 22 deposed the then President Amadou Toumani Toure. The military junta under Captain Amadou Sanogo gave way to an interim government of national unity under Dioncounda Traore, and elections are scheduled for the first quarter of 2013.
On the ground, however, regional states have shown little enthusiasm to contribute troops or actually to take on the formidable task of intervention. First of all, relations between Mali’s government and its military are at best fragile. Secondly, the military’s own justification for the coup, namely the claim that the civilian government had failed to defeat the secessionist groups in northern Mali, was itself hollow. The military themselves soon lost the cities of Timbuktu and Gao, and since then Bamako has lost control of the northern part of the country, an area bigger than France or Texas. The Islamist group Ansar Dine, which has now merged with Tuareg fighters, has declared northern Mali an Islamic state, with the approval of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Ansar Dine, which imposes a very rigid form of the Sharia law, has destroyed world heritage sites in areas it controls, and the International Criminal Court has launched an investigation into allegations of severe brutality, particularly against women. In addition, weapons left over from the western-imposed regime change in Libya are flooding into northern Mali, and any military action against the secessionists will face fierce resistance. Yet it was Ecowas and the Malian government which had themselves made the initial approach to the U.N.; but with little current prospect of decisive and concerted action by Ecowas and major neighbours like Algeria, Mali remains likely to descend into a terrible and catastrophic civil war.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mali-on-the-brink/article4048247.ece
1,11,2012,The original sin of November 1984,"Twenty-eight years ago in New Delhi, Kanpur and Bokaro, a murderous attack was launched against Indians of the Sikh faith by mobs organised and instigated by Congress politicians bent upon using the tragic assassination of Indira Gandhi as an occasion for political manipulation and gain. In the capital, the police stood mute witness to the killing of 2,733 Sikhs. That inaction and the failure to register cases or properly investigate those that were eventually filed are testimony to the official patronage the killings enjoyed. Rajiv Gandhi, who was Prime Minister at the time, made light of the pogrom, describing them as a reaction — “the earth always trembles when a big tree falls” — to the killing of his mother. Senior Congress leaders like H.K.L. Bhagat who were identified by survivors and eyewitnesses as instigators of the violence were rewarded with ministerial berths. A Commission of Inquiry headed by Justice Ranganath Mishra concluded, astonishingly, that the organised massacre was a spontaneous and “involuntary reaction” by ordinary citizens stricken by grief at Mrs Gandhi’s assassination. Subsequent commissions indicted the police for acts of commission and omission but the bitter reality is that the victims of the massacre are no closer to justice today than they were in 1984.
The issue at stake is not simply a moral one. The fact that the politicians and police officers responsible for 1984 not only escaped indictment but actually prospered had grave implications for minorities elsewhere in India. The riot system perfected by the Congress on the streets of Delhi was unveiled again in Bombay in 1993 and, finally, by the Bharatiya Janata Party government of Gujarat in 2002. The parallels between 1984 and 2002 are striking. Like Rajiv Gandhi’s ‘Newtonian’ logic, Chief Minister Narendra Modi described the killing of innocent Muslims in his State as a spontaneous reaction to the burning of Hindu train passengers at Godhra. BJP and sangh parivar activists led the mobs in various places and were rewarded, like Maya Kodnani, with plum jobs. The Gujarat police used the same tactics as their Delhi counterparts to ensure the criminal investigation of major riot cases went nowhere. The big difference between now and then, of course, is the vigilance of the Supreme Court, which intervened when it became apparent that Mr. Modi’s government was not going to provide justice. Difficult though it seems, therefore, judicial intervention is needed even at this late stage to punish the guilty. In the absence of justice, the least the country can do is build a fitting monument in Delhi to honour the memory of the victims. The government may frown on such an act of remembrance but future generations of Indians must never forget there was a time the state looked away while innocent citizens were killed in the very Capital of the Republic simply because of their religion.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-original-sin-of-November-1984/article12490905.ece
1,11,2012,Unfinished tasks at HRD,"The new team at the Human Resource Development Ministry led by M. M. Pallam Raju has a challenging set of tasks ahead — the Right to Education Act must be supported to achieve good outcomes, significant resources mobilised for school, vocational and higher education, and important regulatory legislation passed. The mettle of Mr. Raju and his junior colleagues in the Ministry, Jitin Prasada and Shashi Tharoor, will be quickly tested as the Twelfth Plan is crucial to realising the so-called demographic dividend available to India by 2020: that is, a population with an average age of 29 compared with 37 and 38 for China and the United States respectively. But then, if young Indians are to meaningfully participate in the economy and contribute to growth, they need a reformed system. At present, millions of gullible students are paying huge amounts to colleges with weak academic credentials; the distance education system is in a mess, and vocational education needs massive investments. The Ministry must therefore vigorously pursue changes to the regulatory framework. Several Bills introduced during Kapil Sibal’s tenure as Minister have faced stiff political opposition, including a major measure on accreditation of higher education institutions.
The pending HRD Bills aim to eliminate the multiplicity of agencies governing higher education. They also seek to prohibit unfair practices such as capitation fee collection. One Bill pertains to creation of tribunals for settlement of disputes involving teachers, students and institutions. On all these, wider consultation is necessary. Other important areas too call for action. One is the low esteem that vocational education enjoys in India. If the Centre is indeed committed to creating many more skilled jobs, as Mr. Prasada has promised, the Ministry must strengthen basic schooling and invest substantially in the National Vocational Education Qualifications Framework. This scheme allows the graduate the flexibility of pursuing higher studies at a later date. It is imperative to improve the quality of teaching in schools. The Justice Verma Committee has identified many inadequacies in teacher training institutions in Maharashtra — and its recommendations are relevant for other States. On the broader question of equitable access to education, it is pertinent to point out that a for-profit model is bound to act as a barrier. Universal education does not require huge outlays. That is the way to go.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unfinished-tasks-at-hrd/article4051655.ece
2,11,2012,An attack on media freedom,"The arrest of a Puducherry activist for alleging on Twitter that the Union Finance Minister’s son had “amassed more wealth than Vadra” is a disturbing reminder that the Information Technology Act is serving as a convenient tool to curb free speech. What is particularly shocking is that it took only an email complaint from Karti Chidambaram for a posse of policemen to practically drag the ‘India Against Corruption’ volunteer out of bed at dawn and place him under arrest. This high-handed action is the latest in a series, carried out under Section 66A of the IT Act, with the objective of stopping critical views from circulating in electronic form. This is just plain censorship and must be strongly condemned and opposed. In the realm of law, it is unlikely that this particular provision of the Act, introduced through an amendment in 2008, can pass muster on its constitutionality. It is a bad piece of legislative work, decidedly vague, poorly defined and lethal to well-tested free speech protections under Article 19 (1) (a). Moreover, to criminalise communication on the ground that it is “grossly offensive”, “of menacing character”, causing “annoyance” or “inconvenience” would be to unleash a regime of arbitrary enforcement — which is what the country has witnessed in recent months.
India has an established tradition of free speech and judicial interpretations of fundamental rights should serve all media forms equally well. It is inconceivable that journalists would be summarily jailed for printing or broadcasting the many allegations that people in public life routinely make. Also, it must be emphasised that defamation — which is what Karti Chidambaram might plausibly accuse the IAC activist of indulging in — is essentially a civil matter. Moreover, the law is clear on due process, which involves the serving of notices, opportunity to reply, and institution of legal proceedings. Any argument that the rapidly growing online media must be treated differently deserves to be dismissed. Unfortunately, even the public outcry over the arrest of cartoonist Aseem Trivedi in Mumbai and Professor Ambikesh Mahapatra of Jadavpur University along with his neighbour, for publishing or circulating materials critical of influential people in electronic form, has not persuaded the Centre to conduct a review of the IT law. This is so, in spite of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission finding the police guilty of harassing the two individuals in Bengal and ordering compensation. The entire IT Act needs a multi-stakeholder review, now that it is the anti-free speech weapon of choice.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-attack-on-media-freedom/article4055267.ece
2,11,2012,"Govern more, politick less","Deepa Dasmunsi, the new Union Minister of State for Urban Development, seems to be labouring under the illusion that her office is best used to further petty political rivalries rather than delivering good governance to the people of India. While she is entitled to believe her appointment was part of a grand Congress strategy to counter the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal, Ms Dasmunsi cannot be allowed to use the powers and resources at the command of the ministry to carry on a political battle in her home State. One of her first actions as Minister was to announce a probe into the West Bengal government’s spending under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. Of course, there is an urgent need to tighten the monitoring of the utilisation of Central funds, including those under the JNNURM, but Ms Dasmunsi seems singularly focused on the TMC-controlled Kolkata Corporation for all the wrong reasons. She described her own appointment and that of two other ministers from West Bengal as a “fitting reply” to the Trinamool, and made no attempt to hide her intention to use this elevation to “strengthen” the Congress at the State level. Sure, Ms Dasmunsi may fancy herself as a vocal and fierce political rival to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, but she should not wield the Urban Development Ministry as a weapon in her hand. Governance must not be sacrificed in a game of political one-upmanship.
Disconcertingly, Ms Dasmunsi’s actions and words seem like a throwback to the era of Congress dominance at the Centre, especially during the period of Indira Gandhi as Prime Minister, when States ruled by Opposition parties were constantly under pressure from Union ministers. While no one would grudge the new minister the right to oversee the use of Central funds or to check any misuse, any overbearing Big Brother attitude on the part of Central ministers could have adverse consequences for Centre-State relations and the democratic functioning of political institutions. The message Ms Dasmunsi succeeded in sending out was that the Centre’s attitude to West Bengal hinges on the relationship between the Congress and the Trinamool, and that she is the one tasked with ensuring the latter behaves in a manner politically acceptable to the Congress. Clearly, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh needs to disabuse Ms Dasmunsi of the notion that her primary duty is expanding the political space for the Congress in West Bengal. If taking on the Trinamool is what interests her, Ms Dasmunsi should opt for organisational responsibilities in the Congress, and not waste her time and effort in the Urban Development Ministry.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/govern-more-politick-less/article4055269.ece
3,11,2012,Making cities liveable,"When none of the Indian cities figured in the first 200 ranks of the Global Urban Competitiveness Report compiled last year by a group of international experts, debates about the narrow economic focus of the ranking method offered some consolation to policymakers. But if anyone seriously believes Indian metropolises might compare favourably with the good ones in the world if only the scale of measurement were better, here comes a reality check: UN-Habitat recently expanded the definition of a ‘prosperous city’ to include quality of life, equitable development and environmental sustainability parameters along with productivity and infrastructure. Based on this matured framework, it has worked out a new comprehensive measure — City Prosperity Index (CPI) — to gauge cities. Even in this new analysis, Indian cities are yet to reach the top bracket. When a select group of urban centres across the world were calibrated with the new measure, the two alpha cities of India, Mumbai and Delhi, have come out as mediocre places. They are ranked below Sao Paulo, Shanghai and Ankara. Jakarta, which is similar to Mumbai in terms of productivity, has turned out to be a better city in terms of environment quality and equity. Seoul outdoes Delhi on all counts and turns out as a far superior metropolis.
Indian policymakers should not rush to unwisely dismiss this index as yet another irrelevant ranking. The importance of the CPI lies in its ability to show how and why one city outscores the other and the precise policy corrections it can engender. Though Indian cities do well in terms of productivity, they are environmental nightmares. Delhi, with an environment index of 0.448 (maximum being 1.000) is at the bottom of the pile of the 69 cities studied. Deteriorating air quality, inefficient management of waste, depletion of the ground water table and vanishing water bodies have compromised the advantages offered by Indian urban centres. Insensitive encroachment of open spaces, and depleted green cover have only added to the woes. In contrast, Chongqing in China has increased the amount of public space by 16 times in three decades and Singapore has covered 50 per cent of its surface area with greenery. The second challenge that daunts Indian cities is the issue of equity. Dhaka has a better equity index than Delhi. This is because plans here have paid less attention to the marginalised, resulting in inadequate social housing, eviction of street vendors, and flawed land policies. Achieving economic prosperity along with better quality of life and inclusive growth is imperative not just to climb the rank ladder, but to make our cities desirable places to live.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/making-cities-liveable/article4059001.ece
3,11,2012,"Open, Sesame","If in 2004, Nucleic Acids Research made an overnight switch from being a subscription-based journal to an open access (OA) one, 10 years later high-energy physics as a field will make such a shift when nearly 90 per cent of papers published in a dozen journals will become freely accessible. The Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics (SCOAP3) has negotiated a deal with journals and is now coordinating with countries and institutions that publish papers in high-energy physics to complete the transition. It is one of the most dramatic instances of institutions and publishers embracing the concept to allow the free dissemination of scientific literature. Open access has come a long way since the Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI) campaigned for free access in December 2001. Over the last decade, the relative share of OA has been steadily increasing by one per cent annually. So much so that about 12 per cent of scientific literature published last year was in open access journals; another five per cent of papers in subscription journals became freely available a year after publication, notes BMC Medicine.
Heightened public demand for access to more papers was demonstrated during an online signature campaign a few months ago — within a week, 17,000 people signed a petition urging U.S. President Barack Obama to make all papers arising from federal-funded research freely available. Currently, the National Institutes of Health is the only funding agency that demands free access to papers no later than a year after publication. Despite only 75 per cent compliance, about 90,000 of NIH-funded papers are deposited in an online archive every year. In the case of India, in 2009, nearly 16 per cent of papers by researchers based here were published in OA journals. This is more than the global average of 8.5-10 per cent. Yet, it is unfortunate that the country, which stands to gain tremendously from open access initiatives, has not fared well in facilitating it. It was only in late 2011 that the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) “suggested” meeting the expenses towards OA publication. It is for agencies like the CSIR that BOAI recently sent out a message: “OA for publicly-funded research benefits taxpayers and increases the return on their investment in research.” Worse, not all laboratories have responded to CSIR’s mandate of setting up a repository for self-archiving even a year after the target date. Self-archiving incurs much less investment and all institutions need to quickly embrace it to make results freely available.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/open-sesame/article4059000.ece
5,11,2012,The power of RTI,"The Right to Information Act was a marvel in a country that boasted unbreachable barriers between the ruler and the ruled. It was outside the imagination of the ordinary folk raised in a cloistered environment of fear and secrecy that they could actually call for and obtain records of decisions that critically impacted their lives. Yet in only seven years, the RTI law has not just penetrated the fortress that was official India, but more miraculously, acquired a resilience that its authors could not have envisaged. It is a testimony to the Act’s strong survival instinct that last week the Union Cabinet finally withdrew a set of draft amendments to the Act which it cleared in 2006 but did not place before Parliament for fear of alienating the growing army of RTI stakeholders: citizens, activists and information commissioners. Two among the proposed amendments were potentially lethal: Disallowing access to government file notings in all areas except those deemed to be falling in the category of social and development, and placing ongoing executive decisions entirely outside the purview of the Act. Had the amendments gone through, they would have virtually rendered the government out of bounds for any RTI query, more so given that Cabinet papers, including records of deliberations of the Council of Ministers, are already exempt from disclosure till such time as the decisions are considered final and complete.
Of the slew of rights-based laws initiated by the first UPA government, only the RTI Act has met with an impressive degree of success. The law has been empowering for the common person. And it has played an invaluable role in uncovering scams and scandals that would have been shut out of sight in an earlier era. From the Commonwealth Games to the 2G scam, RTI queries have been the starting point of exposure in a score of recent cases of corruption. Not surprisingly, the success of the law has been its greatest threat. Though the UPA government birthed the law with great fanfare, its effort from the beginning has been to restrict its use. It fought to exempt file notings from the Act knowing notings were tell-tale in nature; they could reveal why, how and under what pressure an official decision was taken. A few days ago, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh cautioned against the Act’s misuse, and expressed himself in favour of privacy as opposed to disclosure. The same line was taken by the Supreme Court which also mandated that judges must be appointed to all Information Commissions. But whatever the challenge, the information law cannot be beaten back; the genie is out of the bottle.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-power-of-RTI/article12496098.ece
5,11,2012,All that gas,"The comprehensive clean-up that the public sector oil marketing companies recently initiated in the liquefied petroleum gas distribution system is a commendable if long overdue effort to check what had evidently become a free-for-all game. Groaning under the “subsidy burden” in a market sector where consumption levels of the convenience fuel had skyrocketed over the decades, the companies first moved collectively to computerise data with regard to LPG consumers in terms of address locations and consumption patterns. Even as price increases were effected, the government capped at six a year the number of subsidised cylinders that each consumer would be entitled to — a move that brought forth a volley of protests. The OMCs then initiated a process of verifying the particulars of each account, to weed out ghost consumers, multiple connections in the same name or for the same family unit. Such connections, it now turns out, add up to a whopping fourth of the total. There is a case to plug loopholes further, stemming pilferage and diversion for commercial and automobile use. Simultaneously, efforts should be made to ensure that cylinders issued to connections that now stand cancelled, and that may lie around unused, are duly surrendered. Given that the deposit amounts were quite low until recently, the consumer may not feel compelled to carry them to the dealer and surrender them. A system needs to be put in place to ensure that tens of thousands of such cylinders are freed, especially since diversion of refilled cylinders for motor transport poses safety risks. It is also important to sort out supply cap issues in residential complexes that get bulk delivery through in situ storage tanks from which metered supply is made to kitchens.
Now that a large number of connections are being freed, the delivery system needs to be streamlined, supply shortages have to be avoided and safety protocols improved. New connections should be made available smoothly to all legitimate applicants. There may even be a case to relax the six-a-year cap, also in view of the fact that the subsidy burden has come down thanks to the cancelled connections: several States have already raised the cap, although the modalities remain to be finalised. Over the past half-century, the blue flame freed many Indian kitchens from the soot and fumes that typically characterised fuels like kerosene. The OMCs should take this opportunity to ensure the widest geographical availability of LPG even as infrastructure for the supply of piped natural gas catches up. This round of reform should also aim to send across the larger message that those who unscrupulously milk the system and cause losses to the exchequer will no longer be able to get away with it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/all-that-gas/article4064959.ece
6,11,2012,Farewell to the mango people,"Bluster must come naturally to those sinking deeper and deeper into helplessness. Sunday’s Congress rally in the Capital showcased an organisation desperately trying to spin its way out of multiple adversity. The Congress was accused of forcing its economic reforms package — including foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail — on an unwilling nation. In answer, the party which once spoke of the ‘ aam aadmi,’ flexed its reform muscles for all to see: Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and son Rahul cheered the package, promised more action of the same kind, and asked Congresspersons not to be apologetic about the new charter. Confronted with a do or die situation, party and government have clearly decided on offence as the best defence. From battling cascading corruption charges through losing the Trinamool Congress as an alliance partner to posting unremarkable electoral performances, not to mention being accused of policy paralysis, it’s been a blizzard of bad news for the leader of UPA-II. Accusations hurled at the once feted pair of Dr. Singh and Ms Gandhi have cut too close to the bone. The Prime Minister has been targeted for the coal scam, while Ms Gandhi has been left deeply embarrassed by the unexplained riches of son-in-law Robert Vadra.
In the event, the burst of aggression seen over the past month, starting with the unilateral announcement of FDI in multi-brand retail and climaxing in the rally, is less a sign of real confidence than bravado of a regime increasingly unsure of winning the next election. That the Congress has launched Rahul as its bright new face against this background speaks even less of its wisdom. The Congress’s aam aadmi slogan worked brilliantly in 2004. The coinage shred to ribbons the Bharatiya Janata Party’s claim that India shone for all. Eight years on, the Congress finds itself saddled with the same misplaced, out-of-sync-with-reality optimism about the state of the economy that cost the BJP so dear at the hustings. The irony is compounded by Mr. Vadra’s wisecrack description of the aam aadmi, pointing fingers at his enormous land holdings, as “mango people (living) in a banana republic.” The younger Gandhi must ask himself if he is ready to ride into Elections 2014 with economic reforms as the party’s platform. The question becomes unavoidable because the Congress is still dining out on the string of rights-based legislation it unveiled as part of UPA-I. The same card cannot work thrice in succession, especially given that the rights laws have begun to yield less and less. Today’s reality is back-breaking inflation for the poor contrasted by the accumulation of wealth and assets — including land — by the rich. While it is easy to be delusional, the Congress must remember it has not had a single convincing Assembly election victory since it won the big battle in 2009.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/farewell-to-the-mango-people/article4068103.ece
6,11,2012,Little to choose,"It is not often that an opposition party finds itself as much on the defensive as the ruling party. In Himachal Pradesh, the Congress campaign to dislodge the Bharatiya Janata Party from power is in the hands of former Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh, who is himself facing serious corruption charges. For voters who have tired of the BJP government led by Prem Kumar Dhumal in the last five years, the alternative in Sunday’s polls could not have been very appealing. Recent Assembly elections have seen a pronounced incumbency disadvantage: since 1985, when the Congress retained power, no party has been able to win a second successive term in office. Not just electoral history, his own performance in government is against Mr. Dhumal. After a lacklustre term, the promises of the party outweigh the achievements of the government. However, in an effort to turn the attention away from his own failures, the Chief Minister, during electioneering, tried to deflect some of the anti-incumbency ire of the people toward the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre. At his public meetings, the BJP leader harped on the hike in the price of diesel, the fuel for the road transport-dependent economy of the mountainous State, and the cap on the number of subsidised LPG cylinders for domestic use. One of Mr. Dhumal’s propaganda offensives was the promise of free energy-efficient induction cook-tops to compensate for the cap on LPG cylinders.
But in addition to the Congress, Mr. Dhumal will have to reckon with the Himachal Lokhit Party, a newly-formed umbrella organisation of BJP dissidents. Even a marginal away-swing in the polls can make a huge difference in small States such as Himachal Pradesh, which have fewer electors per Assembly constituency and lower victory margins. However, just as the BJP fears the HLP, the Congress will have to be wary of the Bahujan Samaj Party encroaching upon its Dalit support base. Large sections of Dalits have traditionally favoured the Congress, and a strong showing by the BSP, which won over seven per cent of the votes in the last election, could indirectly work to the benefit of the BJP. The influence of other parties, including the Left, the Nationalist Congress Party and the Trinamool Congress, will only be minimal irrespective of whether the election is closely fought or not. While corruption and price rise matter in the election, for the voters exercised over these issues there is little to choose between the BJP and the Congress.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/little-to-choose/article4068244.ece
7,11,2012,"Needed, a permanent solution","As if the flooding in Andhra Pradesh following the severe cyclonic storm ‘Nilam’ was not bad enough, the State government and the Indian Meteorological Department are now arguing over what actually happened. Was the flood just the aftermath following the landfall of ‘Nilam’ or did a fresh low pressure system ravage coastal Andhra? The State administration has taken on the IMD for not warning it about the low pressure in the Bay of Bengal immediately following the storm but the met office says it did not have any information to share. The other point that has come up is that the department is better equipped to handle the Southwest monsoon and not the Northeast. But the damage has been done and at least eight districts of Andhra Pradesh — with Visakhapatnam and Srikakulam bearing the brunt — were left floating for days before the flood waters drained off. More than the warning or the rains, it is the lack of a proper drainage system along the east coast that led to such a tragedy, claiming over 20 lives and causing extensive damage to property and crops alike. And this damage can be prevented.
This is the sort of question the National Disaster Management Authority should start grappling with. NDMA teams visited the coastal States ahead of the monsoon and reviewed the preparedness of the administration in each of them. When the floods were in full flow, special teams of trained experts were there to rescue people and provide relief. The entire coast along the Bay, from Tamil Nadu to Odisha, and even parts of West Bengal, are vulnerable to storms and cyclones every year. The super cyclone that hit Odisha in 1999 and the 1977 floods that played havoc in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh ought to have taught enough lessons to the authorities. Unfortunately, neither the Centre nor the States seem to have responded in the way they should have. Instead of spending thousands of crores every year on compensation and flood relief, the Centre and the coastal States would do well to invest in permanent solutions, which include a proper drainage system for the flood waters to empty into the sea. All natural avenues for drainage have been blocked over the decades and must be reactivated. The Monsoon Mission that the Centre cleared about six months ago must be implemented at least before the 2013 season. The blame game and haggling over compensation does not help anybody. The NDMA has already laid down the basic framework that must now be implemented.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/needed-a-permanent-solution/article4071603.ece
7,11,2012,End the deadlock in Nepal,"Since the term of Nepal’s Constituent Assembly (CA) ended in May without the constitution being written, the new republic has been stuck in a political and constitutional deadlock. The government announced fresh elections for a new CA, but the opposition has made Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai’s resignation a pre-condition for any agreement. The interim constitution does not envisage a second CA poll, and the only way to amend the statute is through the use of special presidential powers which President Ram Baran Yadav has refused to exercise unless there is consensus. The President’s office has emphatically denied allegations that Dr. Yadav, a former Nepali Congress (NC) leader, has flirted with the idea of replacing the Prime Minister to break the impasse. This is reassuring, for any presidential adventurism will be unconstitutional and undemocratic, and would only deepen the political polarisation. It will radicalise the Maoists, who have met their peace process commitments by disbanding the People’s Liberation Army, and are staying within the confines of multi-party democracy. Party chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ and Dr. Bhattarai have done so at the cost of a radical splinter group accusing them of ‘selling-out’. If the government is dismissed, it can only give ammunition to the ultra-left’s argument that the ‘peace and constitution’ line was a mistake. Any unilateral move by the President would also strengthen the royalists and extreme-right, who are questioning the legitimacy of the interim constitution.
President Yadav is, however, correct in pushing for consensus. Nepal’s political parties have acted irresponsibly by being immersed in short-term power games. They must strike a deal on four inter-related issues — how to preserve the work done by the old CA; new election dates; the election system; and the nature of the government. The final issue remains the trickiest, with both the Maoists and the NC claiming leadership. The core question, of course, is how to ensure a free and fair election and devise a power-sharing arrangement which does not give any side an opportunity to misuse the state apparatus. Several options are on the table — converting the present government into a national unity formation with key ministries, including home, given to the opposition parties; a government headed by a neutral figure and a political cabinet; an acceptable leader from a smaller party becoming Prime Minister. Even as they discuss the exact government composition, Nepal’s politicians should not squander away the gains of the 2006 movement only for leadership of an interim government with a brief tenure and limited mandate. A deal by November-end is essential to hold polls next spring, otherwise the impasse may continue till 2014. It is time to end the deadlock and go back to the people.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/end-the-deadlock-in-nepal/article4071460.ece
8,11,2012,More work to do,"Barack Obama‘s reelection to the United States presidency, after a close contest which raised questions about registration, voting procedures and campaign finance, will be a huge relief to his supporters, to the Democratic Party, and no doubt to a world which must have wondered what American foreign policy would have looked like had the conservative challenger Mitt Romney won. Final figures are still awaited, but the electoral college votes Mr. Obama got for winning the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Ohio put the result beyond doubt. The entire election season, with a third of the Senate and the whole House of Representatives at stake, has been the most expensive in history. According to analyses of Federal Election Commission data by the New York Times, the candidates, their Super PACs and outside supporters, spent more than $6 billion combined, some $700 million more than the previous highest. The presidential poll alone accounted for $2 billion. The high spending results from the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in the Citizens United case, which prohibits government from restricting political contributions by private corporations and bodies like trade unions. Such donors do not have to reveal their funding sources. Big business put in most of the Citizens United money, giving nearly $600 million to Republican causes, but the Obama team raised $166 million more than its opponents, and no less than 34 per cent of the money was in donations of $200 or less.
Mr. Obama’s win comes after a gruelling first term in which he had to address the domestic economic crash. He withdrew troops from Iraq but failed to close the infamous Guantánamo Bay prison camp. He has also had to face the consequences of enforced regime change in Libya, including angry resistance from Russia and China to United Nations intervention in Syria. Those issues still stand, as do climate change, terrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and multiple crises in West Asia stemming from the nuclear standoff with Iran and Israel’s refusal to end its illegal occupation of Palestine. The President may have won popular endorsement for his economic plans, but, at the time of writing, with the Republicans leading the House of Representatives by 232 seats to 191, the 52-45 Democratic majority in the Senate (there is one Independent and two others are undecided), will count for little unless the White House can make deals with Republican lawmakers. Right after his swearing-in early in 2013, the President’s skills will be tested by the pressing need to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff and the deep cuts in public expenditure it could generate. With the economy still in a fragile position, the administration cannot afford to adopt an abrasive attitude towards Congress.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/more-work-to-do/article4074857.ece
8,11,2012,New vaccines for old foe,"Tuberculosis and the microbe that causes it, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have dogged humanity down the millennia. This ancient plague continues to blight human lives, leading to almost nine million new cases and causing 1.4 million deaths globally each year. India shoulders the highest burden of TB in the world and some three lakh people could die of the disease this year. In recent times, there have been determined efforts to develop new and more effective vaccines that could curb this disease and thereby reduce human suffering and deaths. The only vaccine available at present, ‘bacille Calmette-Guérin’ (BCG), can protect infants and young children. But it has often not stopped infected adolescents and adults from developing active forms of the disease. Moreover, as BCG uses a live but greatly weakened version of a closely related bacterium, the vaccine has been found to be unsafe for babies infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). There are already about a dozen TB vaccines that are in various stages of clinical trials and more are in the pipeline. The current vaccine candidates are not intended to block infection right at the outset or mobilise the body’s defences to completely eliminate bacteria that have gained entry. Rather, the hope is that these vaccines can help prevent active TB, thus reducing sickness and death as well as limiting spread of the disease. In more than 90 per cent of those infected, the immune system is able to contain the bacterium and hold it in a latent state. How such protective immunity works is not fully understood, and the vaccines currently being tested could well fail to replicate it. As one review paper published in a journal earlier this year observed, “there is no guarantee that these vaccines will be significantly superior to … BCG.”
A vaccine that was originally developed at the National Institute of Immunology in Delhi against leprosy has completed the final stage of clinical trials to see if it can aid the treatment of those with tuberculosis. The vaccine uses a heat-killed bacterium, Mycobacterium w. Tests carried out in mice showed that it could be a useful adjunct to chemotherapy. The results of the latest clinical trials have not yet been released. But if in humans too the vaccine produces an enhanced immune response, it might be able to reduce the duration of chemotherapy that sufferers with active TB have to undergo and also allow better cure rates to be achieved. As with HIV, developing truly effective vaccines against tuberculosis could well be a long drawn-out process. Failures will occur, but the quest for better vaccines must not falter.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/new-vaccines-for-old-foe/article4074861.ece
9,11,2012,Living with volatility,"The recent sharp fall of the rupee in relation to the dollar must be viewed as yet another manifestation of the extreme volatility that has gripped financial markets, especially foreign exchange markets. Over a two-month period, the rupee has been on a roller coaster ride, gaining nearly 7 per cent in September and losing 4 per cent in October. Although volatility has always been an essential feature of foreign exchange markets, it is only after the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007 that it has increased exponentially. Consequently, banks and corporate entities have to reckon with a far higher degree of exchange risk than ever before. Since there is no way a reduction in volatility can be expected soon, their attention has perforce turned towards strengthening risk management systems to cover exchange rate and interest rate risks that are closely related. Prospects for global growth have diminished sharply as the big developing countries, notably China, India and a few others, who were spearheading the economic recovery, are themselves in the throes of a slowdown. Some unconventional policy measures in the West, such as quantitative easing by the American Federal Reserve to arrest the slowdown, have created uncertainties. These issues are being transferred to India and other developing countries through trade, finance, commodity prices and confidence channels. At the same time, India’s integration with the rest of the world has been growing fast. While this has many positive features, it has made risk management infinitely more complex.
The Reserve Bank of India has been taking steps to minimise volatility. The supply of dollars to the domestic market has been encouraged by relaxing relevant rules on inward remittances. While, as a general strategy that is the right thing to do, some of the specific steps are controversial. The greater leeway given to companies, for instance, to fund their long-gestation projects in India through short-period external commercial borrowings smacks of myopia. It will result in a ballooning of near-term external debt and that will not be good news for the balance of payments. Even more to the point, the RBI has found that many corporates run a serious exchange rate risk by not hedging their foreign exchange positions on the repayment of these loans. The reasons vary from unfamiliarity with hedging techniques — in which case banks need to strengthen their customer education programmes — to a dangerous tendency to speculate on foreign exchange rate movements. The RBI has tried to counter such practices by tightening the rules and directing banks to monitor uncovered foreign exchange exposures more closely.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/living-with-volatility/article4078250.ece
9,11,2012,Australia’s big bet on Asia,"It was the talk of teaching Hindi to schoolchildren down under that grabbed all the headlines in India but Canberra’s White Paper Australia in the Asian Century merits wider attention because governments today rarely state far-reaching plans of any kind, let alone those involving an epochal reorientation of political sensibility. Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who commissioned the paper and wrote the foreword, is clear that this century “will bring Asia’s rise;” she adds that its “unstoppable transformation” into the world’s economic powerhouse is gathering pace, and that economic weight means strategic weight. The paper goes further, saying that Asia will soon be the world’s largest producer and consumer of goods and services, and the Australian plan is to take the opportunities arising. All of Australian society is to be involved. For example, it is expected that larger businesses will recruit more staff who have worked in Asia and will routinely include “cultural competency training” for all. Secondly, Australia expects to contribute from its own considerable strengths. Trade unions will be part of the process. So will educational institutions and community groups; the former are to offer Asian languages as part of the normal curriculum. The document also states a commitment to maintaining and improving the country’s social systems, including financial ones, in an already diverse society.
The new relationships are intended to complement and not replace Canberra’s long-standing strategic collaboration with the United States. That collaboration will likely deepen with Washington all set to step up its presence in Asia. Cynics say the White Paper may remain declaratory policy, never to be implemented. Nevertheless, Ms Gillard’s recognition of Australia’s shared future with Asia and Asians tells a remarkable story of the mental distance the country has travelled from its ‘White Australia Policy’ days. For India, the Australian discovery of Asia couldn’t have come at a better time. There is a small but significant Indian diaspora in Australia and trade and investment are on the upswing as Indian companies eye Australian coal. The ‘student crisis’ is over and direct flights from Delhi to Melbourne are due to start soon. India and Australia have a common interest in inclusive regional architecture and issues like the security of shipping in the wider Indo-Pacific maritime region. Whether Aussie uranium is eventually exported to India is not clear but given the decline in global demand and prices for the nuclear fuel, this can hardly be considered a major obstacle in the bilateral relationship.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/australias-big-bet-on-asia/article4078251.ece
10,11,2012,A wedding and a funeral,"In an India that is fractured along caste lines, a marriage is never the simple establishment of a relationship between two independent, adult individuals. Instead, it can involve not only the two families, but whole communities as well. An inter-caste marriage without parental approval is, therefore, a potential trigger for violence in rural India. The caste group that is relatively higher in the social hierarchy sees any such marriage as a social affront, especially if the other caste group is Dalit. Wednesday’s attack on three Dalit colonies in Dharmapuri district of Tamil Nadu, which ended in the burning down of 268 houses, is another shocking instance of how social stigmas engendered by caste identities can provoke large-scale violence. The arson was the immediate fallout of the suicide of a caste Hindu man whose daughter had married a Dalit living in one of the colonies. Apparently unable to accept his daughter’s decision to marry a Dalit, the man opted to end his life. For a bride’s family, especially if it is higher in the caste ladder, the socially-sanctioned stigma associated with an inter-caste marriage is greater. Women carry a far heavier responsibility of having to protect the “family honour”, which is a euphemism for the feudal notions of social status and acceptance held by the senior male members of the family. Indeed, the prevalence of such notions is an indicator of the secondary status accorded to women in these communities.
Worryingly, in rural Tamil Nadu where caste conflicts over marriages, religious rituals or access to public resources are common, the police were slow to sense the potential for trouble. A few days before the violence, the newly wedded couple had approached the police for protection fearing attacks by members of the bride’s community. Other than providing assurances and holding out promises, the police seem to have taken no preventive steps. A self-styled court in the village ordered the Dalit man to send his wife back to her parents, but the woman refused to leave her husband. This should have alerted the police to the possibility of trouble. Although the suicide, the immediate trigger for the attack, could not have been predicted or prevented, the police had adequate reason to apprehend the tensions and ample time to take precautionary steps. The only reason that none in the Dalit colonies suffered any bodily harm is that all the residents had left their homes and taken shelter in another village. Social stigmas and caste inequalities cannot be wiped out overnight, but surely the law enforcers can show greater anticipation and quicker reflexes in familiar situations that give rise to tensions between caste groups.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-wedding-and-a-funeral/article4082063.ece
10,11,2012,Exemption raj,"At the root of many irregularities and frauds related to land is the blatant abuse of discretionary powers vested in State governments, particularly those relating to allotment and change of land use. But whether it was questionable allotments in Haryana, the impunity with which a select group of people obtained exemption from the rules in the Adarsh Cooperative Housing case in Mumbai, or the manipulation of legal provisions in cities such as Bhopal and Kolkata to offer land as largesse to a few, State governments have always manipulated discretionary powers to help the powerful and the favoured. Most Acts on land use provide for making rules on the fly and offer powers to exempt. The provisions — known as “Henry VIII clauses”, after the English monarch’s habit of getting parliament to give him more powers through proclamations — have been opposed by citizens’ groups as they privilege a few at the cost of common good and subvert organised development. Exemptions rightly raise questions about the rationale for permitting a few to stay outside rules that are meant for everyone. Why does the State not amend an Act if it is inadequate to address recurring problems, rather than slyly resorting to exemptions?
In their defence, policymakers say no legislation can exhaustively provide for all contingencies and that frequent amendments to the statute are impractical. Hence officials must be empowered to respond to new developments. While there could be some merit in these arguments, the repeated and unjustified use of such powers is a matter of concern. As one noted jurist insightfully remarked, discretionary provisions appear constructive in theory but are destructive in practice. For instance, in 1999, the Tamil Nadu government, using the discretionary powers embedded in the Town and Country Planning Act, exempted buildings from a series of deviations including land use changes and permissible floor area. When this was challenged in the Supreme Court, the exemptions were upheld as a one-time response to contingencies arising then. But in the last 13 years, the State government has evoked the same powers several times to repeatedly regularise violations. Discretionary powers have to be used as rarely as possible and cautiously. The Supreme Court noted in the above-mentioned case that exemptions cannot be given for the “mere asking” or “in the extra statutory field” and certainly not as an act of “benevolence.” Before exemptions are granted, projects should pass the test of public good and must not deny equitable access to common resources. To discourage misuse, all land and building related exemptions should be made transparent and put to unrestricted public scrutiny.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Exemption-raj/article12502175.ece
12,11,2012,Follow the money,"The latest set of revelations from India Against Corruption (IAC) and Arvind Kejriwal turns the spotlight squarely on the important issue of unaccounted money hoarded in banks abroad. Back in July 2011, the French government handed over a compact disc with details of 700 secret bank accounts held by Indians at HSBC Bank in Geneva. Yet for almost a year, the government staved off pressure from the Opposition and civil society to act on the dossier until May this year when the then Finance Minister, Pranab Mukherjee, released a White Paper on black money. The paper revealed that Indian citizens held deposits adding up to Rs 23,373 crore in Swiss banks in 2006. By 2010, this had come down to Rs 9,295 crore, ostensibly because part of the money had come back to India through the hawala route or was simply masquerading as foreign investment in the stock market. While the paper highlights the scale of the problem it still does not address the question of what exactly the dossier contained. Who were these 700 account holders? What were their holdings and how did they acquire that money? Mr. Kejriwal has revealed the identities of three individuals who were part of the list and made claims about a number of others but questions remain. Did the government probe all the names in the list or did it just cherry-pick the most “unconnected” ones to investigate in order to prove it was acting? If it has investigated all the 700 names, what has it discovered?
IAC’s latest exposé also raises important questions about the role of HSBC in allegedly laundering money through what amounts to hawala transactions. The charge that the bank would take cash in rupees for a deposit in dollars in its branch abroad and later reverse the transaction in similar fashion, all without anything on paper, is certainly worrying. This process, which three individuals in the list of 700 apparently admitted to using, clearly falls into a pattern given that HSBC is already under investigation in the U.S., where it is facing a $1.5 billion fine for money-laundering, and in the U.K., where it is being probed for opening offshore bank accounts for dodgy individuals and even well-known personalities. Given this, there is little doubt that the government needs to investigate the role of the bank in India and importantly, tie this in with the specific information received from France. To be sure, not every foreign bank account is illegitimate. But this fact cannot be established unless the government goes into the details of each of those accounts. A Finance Ministry statement on Saturday indicated that relevant agencies are indeed probing the matter. While that is reassuring, it is best if the broad results of this probe — including details of punitive action taken, if any — are made public as soon as possible.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/follow-the-money/article4088195.ece
12,11,2012,Bring these prisoners back,"On the face it, last week’s riots at a prison in the Sri Lankan capital should not be of any concern to India. But they are, in fact, a reminder of the Indian prisoners who languish there despite an agreement between the two countries for their repatriation. The deadly fighting that erupted in Welikade on November 9 between prisoners and personnel of the Special Task Force left 27 prisoners dead. The security forces personnel had gone into the jail to hunt down forbidden possessions, such as drugs and cell phones. With more than 3,000 prisoners, the jail is overcrowded and its inmates seething with resentment at the poor conditions in their wards, no different from many jails in India. During the search, some of the prisoners are said to have broken free from their cells, and taken on the security forces with weapons from the armoury. The 39 Indian prisoners are said to be unharmed but panic-stricken after the fighting. Most of them are serving sentences for drugs-related offences. But there is no reason they should be there, more than two years after India and Sri Lanka signed an agreement on “transfer of sentenced prisoners.” The 2010 agreement provides for transferring convicted prisoners who have served half their sentence back to India (or to Sri Lanka, in the case of Sri Lankans in Indian prisons). Under the terms, 31 prisoners in Welikade are eligible to be transferred. The repatriated prisoners are required to serve out the remainder of their sentence in prisons in their home States. Unfortunately, the authorities in India seem to have shown little urgency in speeding up the process to bring these prisoners back. Only some weeks ago, an Indian fisherman who had been in Welikade since 2004, and been identified for repatriation, died in the jail of a stroke.
Contrast this situation with the frequent furore in India over prisoners in Pakistan, the commitments that successive governments have made to have one particular death-row prisoner released from the Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore, and the ceremony with which the two countries regularly release each other’s nationals from their prisons, and it would be hard to fault the Indian prisoners in Welikade for thinking their country doesn’t really care for them. Sri Lanka seems to have no problem transferring the eligible Indian prisoners. Evidently, the role of the State governments is crucial, for they must decide the jails in which these prisoners have to be lodged when they are repatriated. Tamil Nadu, the State to which most of the prisoners belong, must speed up the required procedures so that these people can return quickly, and serve the rest of their sentences at home.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bring-these-prisoners-back/article4088196.ece
13,11,2012,Controlling the auditor,"Sometimes, what separates the seemingly innocuous from the sinister is the context. At another time and in another situation, Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office V. Narayanasamy could have gotten away with his statement that the Central government was considering making the Comptroller and Auditor General a multimember body. After all, the Centre is sitting on a report by the committee headed by former CAG V.K. Shunglu, which went into the charges of corruption in the conduct of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, recommending such a course of action. But not now, not when the government has been at the receiving end of a series of damning reports by the CAG on 2G spectrum, the Commonwealth Games and coal allocations. After his remark stirred up a national controversy, the Minister did make a feeble effort to distance himself from the news report, saying he was “misquoted” and that he had not specifically replied to any question on the constitution of the CAG. But, by then, he had already set off alarm bells in the ranks of the Opposition, and among anti-corruption activists and the rest of the civil society. Not surprisingly, almost everyone smelt a conspiracy to undermine the independent functioning of the CAG, and interpreted the move as directed at the incumbent, Vinod Rai, whose term is not due to end before 2014.
Whether or not Mr. Narayanasamy intended his remarks as a trial balloon to gauge public opinion, the hostile reaction he has provoked should serve as adequate warning to the government against pushing ahead with any such radical restructuring of the supreme audit institution of India. Indeed, any change in the nature and structure of the CAG is unwarranted in the current context. Whether or not a multimember body is better than a single-member body is open to debate, and any change should be preceded by wide-ranging consultations. An isolated recommendation in one of the reports of a committee is surely no reason to bring about a change that could have far-reaching implications for the CAG. Nothing in the functioning of the current CAG calls for such radical reconstitution. Instead, the government would do well to strengthen India’s premier audit body, allowing it to function with greater autonomy and freedom and with an updated mandate that unambiguously covers public-private partnerships (PPPs) and the use of public monies by non-governmental organisations. If at all there is a case for any change, it is in making the appointment of the CAG more transparent, free from any sort of political considerations. In all else, the government must stay its hand.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/controlling-the-auditor/article4091285.ece
13,11,2012,Afghanistan’s fraught future,"President Hamid Karzai’s visit to India comes at a time when his nation’s future, more than at any point since 9/11, is shrouded in a fog of fear. This weekend, shells fired by his troops were reported to have killed five civilians in Pakistan’s South Waziristan agency, the latest in a series of cross-border skirmishes. Pakistan’s intelligence services allege, with some justification, that their Afghan counterparts are backing the militia of Islamist warlord Maulana Fazlullah — in tit-for-tat retaliation against the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate’s backing for the jihadist networks led by Sirajuddin Haqqani. Levels of violence in the country remain higher than prior to 2010, when United States-led international forces began a surge it was hoped would break the back of the Taliban insurgency. Even though civilian casualties in the southern insurgent strongholds of Kandahar and Helmand have fallen, they have spiked in the eastern provinces. Efforts to reach a peace deal with the Taliban have been all but extinguished. For all the talk of ambitious economic development projects involving China, India and the Central Asian Republics, precious little has actually got off the ground. High-end property prices in Kabul are in free fall — perhaps illustrating a growing crisis of faith among the elite who have been the bedrock of Mr. Karzai’s regime.
Is Afghanistan’s lurch into the abyss, then, inevitable? The news isn’t, in fact, all bad. In April 2014, if elections are held as scheduled, Mr. Karzai will become the first elected Afghan head of state to complete his terms in office — and, perhaps more important, leave office in an orderly way. Mr. Karzai’s government has justly been criticised for incredible levels of corruption. Yet, that very corruption has given competing warlords equities in the survival of a stable — if not always functional — state structure. Even though the Afghan National Army remains undertrained and under-resourced, it has demonstrated an improved capacity to stage operations needed to keep key cities and transport arteries secure after United States combat troops withdraw in 2014. Perhaps most important, there is a generation of young Afghans who are committed to rebuilding their nation. These gains can be built on — but post-2014, pious promises notwithstanding, western support for Afghanistan will diminish. There is no doubt that an Afghanistan in meltdown will hurt the entire region, providing jihadist movements that threaten Central Asia, China and Pakistan a fresh lease of life. Indian diplomacy will be critical to corralling Afghanistan’s neighbours to put their money and resources into the long, hard job of rebuilding a state and a polity torn apart by decades of war.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/afghanistans-fraught-future/article4091286.ece
14,11,2012,Workers without borders,"It may no longer be just anecdotal that every third person in Kerala is a migrant worker from outside the State. Along with Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, Kerala is experiencing a massive influx of migrant workers into its emerging urban areas and its hinterland. High wages, and the shortage of skilled and unskilled labour due to high education levels and migration from the State to West Asian countries, make Kerala an attractive destination for workers from north, central and north-eastern India. Unofficial estimates put the number of migrant labourers in Kerala at 1.3 million, and it is estimated that the State’s migrant population will touch the 2.5 million mark in a decade. It is a veritable second wave, after the first one that made the ‘Green Revolution’ possible. The southern States must put in place effective mechanisms to ensure the welfare of migrant workers, and given the possibility of many of them settling down in their adopted homes, assist them in integration with the local communities. Kerala, for one, has set the ball rolling by beginning work on a piece of legislation specifically focused on migrant workers. Tentatively titled the Kerala Migrant Workers (Conditions of Service and Compulsory Registration) Social Security Bill, the proposed law could turn out to be yet another model from the State for the rest of the country if handled sensitively and imaginatively.
When Malayalis migrated to various parts of Asia and Africa during the days of the British Empire, they were in the forefront of struggles for workers’ rights. Today, Kerala legislators need to focus their efforts on creating not just another law, but one that would give substantive citizenship to the migrant labourers, and empower them to live with honour among their hosts. A large influx of outsiders does cause some worries to the local populace, some of which may be valid. However, if the initiative for a new law, which is to include registration, is driven purely by suspicion of outsiders, either as a threat to law and order, or even more astonishingly, as potential disease carriers, it could only contribute to reinforcing the sense of insecurity that migrants from afar often experience. At a broader level, there should be an effort to create dialogue mechanisms between host States and the home States of migrant workers. But this too may not be enough. Given the inter-State dimensions of labour migration, it might be advisable to have a revamped Inter-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act. This law came into being in 1979, and needs to take into account the new economic realities in the country. A pan-Indian law might help protect the interests of the migrant workers better while addressing the concerns of the host societies too.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/workers-without-borders/article4093603.ece
14,11,2012,Welcome to garbagopolis,"Bangalore’s international status as India’s first city-of-the-future — the site of a burgeoning IT industry, and a centre of cutting-edge technology and science — is, literally, sinking beneath a sea of garbage. If unregulated traffic and bad roads have tarnished its image, the inability of its civic authority to dispose of 4,500 tonnes of garbage generated daily by its 8.5 million residents only adds to the stink of its already compromised reputation. The crisis that hit the city a few weeks ago — when garbage contractors had nowhere to dump the lorry-loads they used to offload into a landfill on the outskirts of the city because angry village residents living nearby said No More — resulted in an invasion of trash onto pavements, streets and water bodies. Municipal garbage collectors stopped collecting waste, as there were no lorries to take the trash away. If this situation is now being managed with the same out-of-sight-is-out-of-mind approach, i.e., by the identification of new landfills on the outskirts of the city, the crisis, alas, has only been postponed. The new landfills will affect the health and living environments of new sections of people, who will doubtless follow the lead set by the residents of Mandur. The Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike set October 1 as a deadline for residents to segregate waste at source. The directive met with very partial success, with those who complied having to helplessly watch carefully segregated waste being re-aggregated in the trash lorries.
The long-term solution must find a place for garbage cleaners and recyclers. Many resourceful citizen groups have successfully experimented with waste management in their own localities. Wet waste must be composted, while paper, plastics, metals, and other recyclables sent to the vast network of unorganised but efficient recyclers that already exists. What remains — the harmless inerts that constitute 15 to 20 per cent of the total waste — should be sent to scientific landfills. In 2007, the State government erred disastrously in reducing the mandatory one kilometre buffer zone around landfills to just 50 metres. The privatisation of the waste-management system by the State government was an even bigger setback. Of 19,000 garbage cleaners, 15,000 are contract workers, poorly paid and pitifully ill-equipped. Of the 595 lorries that ferry trash, 490 belong to private contractors who routinely violate the terms of their contract under the Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000. The garbage crisis has revealed the dark underbelly of Bangalore’s growth story, and is a negative lesson in at least one aspect of planned urbanisation, namely, of post-facto civic intervention.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/welcome-to-garbagopolis/article4093602.ece
15,11,2012,A triple whammy,"Three sets of macroeconomic data released at the top of this week all reflect the downtrend in the economy. Even when viewed separately, each of these — the monthly industrial output data for September, retail inflation for October and the latest trade figures — is cause for concern, but together they reinforce the perception of gloom and speak to the absence of the right policy measures to reverse the downturn. There is a degree of correlation between these numbers. For instance, the fall in manufacturing as reflected in the index of industrial production (IIP) partly explains the deceleration in exports. Persistently high retail inflation, based on a new broad-based consumer price index, draws attention to the inadequacy of supply-side measures to check the steep increase in the price of sugar, pulses and edible oil, which are behind the general price rise. The broad story the figures tell may be the same but the signals they send to policy are mixed. The Reserve Bank of India, which faced a barrage of criticism recently for not relaxing monetary policy, can draw no firm conclusions. On the one hand, the contraction in industrial output has increased the clamour for a policy rate cut. On the other, high inflation seems to vindicate its action in holding on to the rates.
The disappointment of policymakers over the contraction in industrial output in September is understandable but it ought to have been anticipated. In August 2012, the IIP grew by 2.5 per cent over August last year, prompting many in the government to claim that the economy has turned the corner. Clearly the downward drift in industrial production is set to continue for a while. During the entire April-September period, the industrial sector expanded by just 0.1 per cent. Of particular concern has been the fall in the capital goods and consumer durables sectors. The former is a proxy for investment while the latter tracks consumer demand. The government’s efforts at talking up sentiment and reviving “animal spirits” will be keenly watched but it is clear that the Prime Minister and his colleagues, by themselves, will not be enough to reverse the downturn, which as the latest economic statistics clearly indicate, is all pervasive. The record trade deficit of $21 billion on the back of a continuous fall in exports and a surge in imports will pose further strains on the current account. Two points that merit special attention here are that exports have not benefited from the rupee’s depreciation and that the rise in imports is due to large oil and bullion purchases. Amidst the slowdown, the import of capital goods and other investment-related items is sluggish.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-triple-whammy/article4095607.ece
15,11,2012,Agenda for social justice,"Long considered an inconsequential way station for ascendant politicians or a punishment posting for inconvenient ones, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment finally has a minister with the nous to realise its emancipatory potential. In broad terms, Kumari Selja’s endeavour ought to be one that seeks to promote an entitlements-based model of human development as the lasting answer to historically-rooted disadvantages and discrimination. The appeal of such an ethically sound and economically pragmatic approach is becoming increasingly evident against the recent backdrop of extreme disparities of high incomes and severe deprivations. The MSJE’s target areas include the Scheduled Castes, Other Backward Classes, persons with disabilities and the elderly. The new minister’s immediate priority should be to strive towards enactment of the draft bill on persons with disabilities — estimated at about 10 per cent of India’s population — before the expiry of the current term of the Lok Sabha. A new law is critical to realise the legal guarantees and protections envisaged under the relevant United Nations Convention — one that New Delhi was among the earliest to ratify way back in 2007.
While the mutually reinforcing characteristics of poverty and disability are widely recognised, the burdens attendant to the process of ageing are inadequately appreciated. India’s elderly — those 60 years and above — who constitute 7.5 per cent of the total population according to credible estimates, are projected to touch 13 per cent by 2025. India is already committed to orienting its policies to promote healthy ageing and to address the special needs of disabled elderly persons when it adopted the Yogyakarta Declaration of the WHO South-East Asian Region in September 2012. Investing in the well-being of the disabled can also bring benefits for the elderly, as both face similar problems in certain situations. The Ministry also needs to examine the soundness of a 2007 law — in terms of principle, as well as practical enforceability — that fixes criminal responsibility for the neglect of elderly parents on their offspring while absolving the state of any role or responsibility. Continuing economic deprivation and even official complicity in the atrocities perpetrated against the Scheduled Castes and backward communities is a reality more than six decades after political independence. This bleak scenario is a commentary on the absence of both effective and impartial law enforcement and of genuine commitment to promote equality of opportunity. Ms Selja has her task cut out. With commitment and imagination, she could impart real meaning and substance to the name of her ministry.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/agenda-for-social-justice/article4095606.ece
16,11,2012,Lessons from a flop show,"The wretched outcome of the 2G spectrum auctions, netting just Rs.9,407.64 crore against a Rs.40,000 crore revenue target, has evoked predictable reactions from the Congress party. Its leaders have indirectly mocked the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Supreme Court and the media for tying the government’s hands — instead of expressing concern about the impact of the failed auctions on investor confidence and India’s worrying fiscal deficit. Their gloating fails to conceal the fact that the government has messed up and badly needs scapegoats to camouflage its sins. The loss calculated by the CAG was in reference to the year 2008 when the addressable market in telecom and consequently, the revenue potential, was substantially higher than it is in 2012. India then had only 234 million mobile subscribers, translating to a 24 per cent tele density level and an addressable market of nearly 800 million. Roughly eight-nine million mobile subscribers were being added every month, hitting a scorching 20 million per month in 2008-09. In 2012, the tables turned towards negative subscriber growth as the total mobile subscriber base hit 900 million, with a tele density of 70 per cent, significantly diminishing the addressable market and making any substantial investment unwise.
Similarly, the average revenue per user (ARPU) has also dipped to Rs.97/month from Rs.316/month in 2008. With these numbers, no company can hope to build a viable greenfield business by bidding for raw spectrum. Even where money supply and capital markets are concerned, on January 8, 2008, two days before the scam, the Sensex hit a peak of 21,078 and international funding was flowing like water. Little surprise then that 575 applicants had queued up, all of whom have since fled as the UPA struggles to defend itself against charges of rampant corruption, policy paralysis and crony capitalism. Market buoyancy equally played a role in 2010 during the 3G auctions, garnering the exchequer revenues of over Rs.1 lakh crore. In short, the UPA government deliberately forsook a great opportunity in 2008 to legitimately collect large revenues, bring in serious investors and hike tele density, while keeping the sector free of litigation. India is today at a crossroads where it can either admit to past transgressions and pursue a course correction or sink further in the quicksand of denial. Any attempt to get into a blame game will only create fresh havoc — impacting all sectors of the economy, which the nation can ill afford. The government would be better served by proactively correcting a situation gone horribly wrong rather than gloating over its opaque decision making, illegal acts and complete lack of foresight in matters of public policy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lessons-from-a-flop-show/article4098781.ece
16,11,2012,Change in China,"The Communist Party of China formally unveiled its new leaders on Thursday, marking an end to a turbulent few months that appeared to complicate the party’s once-in-10 year change in leadership. Hu Jintao, who served as General Secretary since 2002, has relinquished his posts as the head of the party and military, paving the way for Xi Jinping, who was anointed as his successor five years ago. Mr. Hu presided over a decade of rapid economic growth, which made China the world’s second-largest economy and raised per capita incomes fivefold. He left office stressing that the party would continue with its emphasis on development, pledging to double incomes by 2020. The Hu Jintao decade emphasised stability above all else: Even as the Chinese economy continued to grow, weathering the recession, the party maintained firm political control, showing little tolerance for dissent. Indeed, in his final address as party chief — he will continue as President until March — Mr. Hu stressed that China “would never copy a Western political system.”
The outgoing General Secretary also warned his successor that failure to tackle rampant corruption could “even cause the collapse of the party and the fall of the state.” Yet, despite the obvious link between corruption and the absence of political accountability, the party under Mr. Hu did little to push forward meaningful reforms. The purge of former Politburo member Bo Xilai, who will soon stand trial on corruption charges, embarrassed the party, revealing how one of its most powerful leaders amassed a fortune and held scant regard for the law. Corruption is only one of several challenges confronting Mr. Xi. As the new General Secretary himself put it in his first public remarks, the party faces “many pressing problems,” starting with its officials being increasingly “out of touch with the people.” Mr. Xi said he would prioritise addressing the demands of the public for better education, greater social security, improved health care and a cleaner environment. The CPC continues to enjoy wide legitimacy after presiding over two decades of economic growth. However, anger against local-level corruption is on the rise, sparking tens of thousands of protests every year. China is also facing an urgent challenge of delivering more balanced growth. The urban-rural income gap today is 68 per cent higher than it was in 1985. The transformation of China’s economic model away from state-driven export-led growth will also require difficult measures to curtail the rising influence of state-owned companies. If the party is to address these challenges effectively, it is clear that the leadership under Mr. Xi will have to be far bolder than the previous generation of leaders, both in thought and in action.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/change-in-china/article4098783.ece
17,11,2012,A necessary catharsis,"The internal report of the United Nations on its role in Sri Lanka raises troubling questions about its strategies and actions during critical stages of the conflict in the island nation. It unmasks yet another failure of the world body in preventing mass civilian casualties despite overwhelming evidence that a catastrophe was imminent. Its failure was ensured by a determined government that assembled a formidable diplomatic and strategic barrier around its military objectives. Sri Lanka was able to pass off its use of disproportionate force against a cowering population caught between an advancing army and a ruthless terrorist force that needed a civilian shield, as a necessary measure to eliminate terrorism. In the report, Sri Lanka emerges none the purer, as it contains cogent evidence of how Colombo worked to stave off international scrutiny and brazenly hounded U.N. and aid agencies out of the conflict zone so that there were no witnesses to its undoubted excesses. The U.N.’s internal narrative reveals a weak system that did not have the stomach to stand up for the rights of the people it was mandated to protect. The government deliberately underestimated the population trapped in the Vanni region and issued patently false denials about targeting no-fire zones and hospitals. It carried on a campaign of intimidation and calumny against U.N. officials, detained its national staff, and shelled convoys carrying essentials for the trapped population.
The emergence of the report should also occasion a sober reflection on the most appropriate response to a worsening conflict situation. One cannot forget that in those crucial months between late 2008 and May 2009, the international community faced the classic dilemma of the post-9/11 world — how long does one look away, if at all, when a democracy is fighting a “terrorist insurgency”? Could the U.N. have been expected to be out of sync with the global mood? To many, humanitarian aspects were clearly subordinate to the objective of eliminating terrorism. At least two permanent Security Council members — China and Russia — and India added heft to the Sri Lankan camp, and the diplomatic odds were stacked against the U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon has promised that the U.N. would learn from its mistakes and strengthen its responses. The world body cannot afford to give the impression that justice and accountability for past impunity have been forgotten. After perceived failures in Bosnia and Rwanda, and possibly Syria, the U.N. needs to find ways of insulating itself from the diplomatic clout of key players. Publication of its damning internal report on Sri Lanka serves as the perfect occasion for a break with the past.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-necessary-catharsis/article4102554.ece
17,11,2012,Coalition of the helpless,"The recognition by France and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), of a Syrian national coalition as a transitional government is tantamount to a formal, irrevocable declaration by the West that it is not interested in pursuing a ceasefire and negotiated end to a raging civil war that has lasted 20 months already and claimed the lives of an estimated 38,000 people. The new grouping, formally called the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, was founded in Doha on November 11 and comprises several dissident groups, some of which are based outside Syria. The United States has not formally recognised the coalition, but President Barack Obama has called it “a legitimate representative of the aspirations of the Syrian people.” The apparent intention is that western powers in particular could channel aid to a single body rather than to favoured factions; French President François Hollande has said military aid could follow. Damascus currently has tight restrictions on foreign aid agencies, and the European Union has banned arms sales to Syria. Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad has criticised the Coalition, stating that its first decision was to “reject dialogue and to continue the war.”
The background to the Coalition’s formation, however, reveals other kinds of agenda. The high-profile Syrian National Council (SNC), which has unsuccessfully attempted to coordinate rebel efforts, has recently elected George Sabra as chair, with Mohamad Faruq Tayfur as his deputy. Mr. Sabra, who has often been imprisoned by the Syrian regime, used to be in the now-defunct Syrian Communist Party; the successor body, the Syrian Democratic People’s Party, has abandoned Marxism-Leninism for a social-democratic ideology. Mr. Tayfur, for his part, belongs to the Muslim Brotherhood. Washington openly wants to reduce the influence of the SNC, which U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says is unrepresentative and “can no longer be viewed as the visible leader of the opposition.” The SNC, nevertheless, will hold 22 places in the Coalition and is not about to vanish. Thirdly, international concerns about the absence of Shia representation in the SNC may be understandable, but the GCC itself could be very nervous about any Shia presence in the Coalition and may try to prevent such broadbasing. In addition, even if the Coalition gets enough aid to overthrow Mr. Assad, there is no guarantee that it will be any freer of factional rivalries than existing rebel groups. In sum, the Coalition may well do no more than expose yet again the international community’s helplessness over Syria, while ordinary Syrians continue to die.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/coalition-of-the-helpless/article4102555.ece
24,11,2012,"Minimum proof, maximum sentence","The cavalier approach of the police, especially in Delhi, to terror investigations has long hampered the country’s fight against terrorism. In many cases, the real culprits remain at large even as responsibility is wrongly fixed on persons who are either innocent or only peripherally connected to a particular incident. The terrible consequences of this unprofessionalism were revealed on Thursday when the Delhi High Court ordered the acquittal of two men wrongly sentenced to death in the 1996 Lajpat Nagar market blasts case. The Court was unsparing of the prosecution which, it said, had gone beyond “lapses and inefficiencies” to produce evidence whose “nature and truthfulness” were in serious doubt. The message is inescapable: under pressure to show results, the police often fudge evidence, not bothering that this sleight of hand can rob an accused of the most precious gift ever — his life. In this case, the wrong done to Mirza Nissar Hussein and Mohammed Ali Bhatt was so enormous that when the higher court set it right, the two men found themselves dramatically transported from their condemned world of despair and death to full life and liberty.
In their judgment, Judges S. Ravindra Bhatt and G.P. Mittal made it a point to rebut the oft-used excuse in terror cases: that the nature of terrorism makes it difficult for the prosecution to meet the “impossible standards” of proof demanded by the courts: “In matters of liberty, the weakness of the state surely can’t be an excuse for lowering time-tested standards, especially in serious crimes where the accused stand to forfeit their life...” Indeed, with the court unequivocally reiterating a fundamental principle of justice-delivery, the time has truly come to reassess a state of affairs where manufactured evidence passes for investigation and acquittals are blamed on legal technicalities or on the unreliability of witnesses, more so in terror cases. In another judgment of great import delivered in October this year, the Supreme Court overturned 11 convictions under the Terrorism and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA), rejecting the prosecution’s plea that it had committed only a technical error in overlooking a key safeguard of TADA. The court’s answer to this was that in the land of Gandhi, the means were necessarily inseparable from the ends. Rather than going after innocents and building cases on evidentiary quicksand — as it appears they have been doing in many cases — investigative agencies prosecuting terrorist crimes must learn to rely on improved technical and forensic evidence. At the end of the day, that is the only way to prevent the escape of real terrorists.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Minimum-proof-maximum-sentence/article12519603.ece
24,11,2012,"Mamata scores, for Manmohan","From the very beginning, the no-confidence motion against the United Progressive Alliance government mooted by the Trinamool Congress was doomed to fail. A constituent of the UPA until recently, it was unrealistic for the Trinamool to have hoped the opposition would rally behind it. The Left parties, especially, saw the move as an opportunistic tactic designed to gain political mileage in West Bengal, where they too have high stakes. The main opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party, realised that a no-trust motion would have had less chance of being carried through in the Lok Sabha than a resolution on the Foreign Direct Investment under Rule 184 entailing voting. For one, a no-trust move would have immediately prompted all the constituents and backers of the UPA to close ranks and ward off the threat to the government. But about FDI in multi-brand retail, many of the UPA partners such as the DMK hold strong reservations as do supporting parties such as the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party. Even those not keen on unseating the government might thus feel pressured to vote against the government on a resolution against FDI in retail, a politically contentious issue. For the BJP, the less ambitious course held out more hope. Without the prospect of an alliance in West Bengal, the principal opposition party would have sensed no advantage in sailing with the Trinamool on this issue. As the Trinamool attempt to move the motion failed for want of the requisite numbers, another motion of no-confidence will have to wait for at least six more months. But, in the calculations of the BJP and the Left parties, this is a better outcome than the government surviving a no-confidence motion and emerging stronger with claims of Parliament’s endorsement for its policies and programmes.
Sadly, the Trinamool does not seem to have learnt much from the fiasco. Eager to be in the spotlight, the party had decided to move a no-confidence motion without consulting others. Mamata Banerjee now claims the Trinamool’s failed effort exposes the opposition parties that did not support the motion, but this is hardly any consolation. Ms Banerjee was hoping to project the Trinamool as the prime mover of all things, but such short-sighted tactics showed up her party as hot-headed and tactless. Given the composition of the current Lok Sabha, an alternative to a Congress-led government is almost impossible. And parties such as the SP and the BSP do not want to be seen as helping the BJP even if they were to topple the UPA government. While the government might have to face some more embarrassing situations, its survival is not in question in the immediate future.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mamata-scores-for-Manmohan/article12518347.ece
26,11,2012,A needless controversy,"The Bharatiya Janata Party’s objection to the appointment of Ranjit Sinha as Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is a peevish attempt to score a political point over the government. It is difficult to accept the party’s stand that the government should not have made the appointment at a time when the Rajya Sabha Select Committee’s Report on the Lokpal Bill — which, inter alia, suggests a mechanism by which the CBI Director is appointed by a collegium rather than by the government — had just been tabled and was pending consideration by Parliament. For one thing, the government was following existing law and procedure while filling up a post that was due to fall vacant on November 30: it had made the appointment based on a recommendation made by the Central Vigilance Commission, which shortlisted three names. Secondly, the Select Committee’s report is still some way from being considered, accepted and incorporated in the form of suitable amendments to the Lokpal Bill and taken up in Parliament. The objection may have had some substance had it been rooted in some specific opposition to the suitability of Mr. Sinha, but to argue that the government should wait for a new procedure to be established by law in future beats logic. It is doubtful if the appointment of a key position can be put on hold for an indefinite period until a set of recommendations on an issue that has divided the polity and has been the subject of acrimonious debate over the last two years is ultimately accepted and adopted by the legislature.
The Lokpal Bill, as passed by the Lok Sabha, envisages appointment of the CBI Director by the Central government on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and Chief Justice of India or a Judge of the Supreme Court. The Select Committee’s recommendation only modifies this a little by specifying appointment by a collegium comprising the same three authorities. It is possible to argue that the government could have awaited the bill’s enactment into law, as it has already agreed, in substance, to change the present system. But given recent parliamentary experience, wherein conduct of proceedings is only a rare exception to disruption and paralysis, it is doubtful if any government will wait for the Select Committee report to evolve into law. Perhaps, the government’s past conduct — when it imposed a controversial selection for the post of Central Vigilance Commissioner — breeds scepticism in the opposition ranks. As does the rather opaque functioning of the CBI in cases involving politicians. A remedy has to be found for this; but it will take more than a collegium-driven selection process for the Director to rid the agency of that fatal flaw.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-needless-controversy/article15616953.ece
26,11,2012,No time to die,"Suicides, and mental distress and illness that often lead to them, have been a bane across different population segments in India. While every life thus lost is a cause for concern, the sense of untimely tragedy is compounded when bright young students resort to the extreme step. Today, educational institutions are increasingly marked by competitive pressures and financial and other demands that put a burden which some students are just not able to bear. The decision of the Ministry of Human Resource Development to deploy a Task Force to look into cases of suicide in Central-funded higher technical institutions was well-founded in the context of 12 such incidents over 2010- 2011. The panel has now made its recommendations, essentially on predictable lines. These include a dedicated system of counselling involving faculty members, students, parents and mental health professionals to cater to the needs of students; a visible entity for the service with parity in the institution’s organisational structure, and a proactive and enabling environment for students with psychological needs. The panel has rightly sought better awareness and sensitivity towards issues of social justice including gender, class and caste.
However, this exercise needs to be scaled up to cover the entire spectrum of educational institutions in the country in order to address the underlying issues in a more meaningful and egalitarian manner. According to data for 2011, the number of suicidal deaths country-wide among students was 7,696. In 2010 the total was 7,379. The figures have consistently risen over recent years. According to one study published by Lancet, suicides have become the second leading cause of death among young adults in India, after road accidents for men and maternity-related complications for women. That study also indicated that in India, suicides have become more common among educated and young adults — in contrast to patterns observed in many developed societies. We need to pause and reflect: what is happening to our young people? An all-out effort should be launched to reach out to youths in distress, enabling close cooperation and collaboration between counselling services and the health services. As a part of this exercise, India should find ways to address its shortage of mental health professionals. Counselling processes should assist students who have social, academic, linguistic, financial, physical and other difficulties. More preventive and promotional mental wellness activities, as also sensitisation and awareness programmes, need to be put in place.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/No-time-to-die/article15616952.ece
27,11,2012,The plot thickens,"Not for nothing has Ram Jethmalani earned the sobriquet Battering Ram. The veteran lawyer and Bharatiya Janata Party member loves a good fight, a behavioural trait that has caused him often to clash with his party leadership. So at one level his suspension from the BJP — followed by a show-cause notice — is just a replay of history. Yet this time round there appears to be a conspiratorial backstory to Mr. Jethmalani’s rebellion which has clearly unsettled party president Nitin Gadkari and his backers, among them the ideological high priests at Jhandewalan. The senior Jethmalani straddles both sides of the ideological divide. If in his heyday he defended terror convicts with some élan, more recently he upset the legion of Hindutva warriors with his outbursts against Lord Ram. As against this, Mr. Jethmalani’s current passion is Narendra Modi, whom he appears determined to install as India’s Prime Minister, doing whatever it takes to achieve his objective — from lobbying the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to leading a campaign to oust Mr. Gadkari. It is this open plotting against the incumbent BJP chief — with all its attendant consequences — that has resulted in the party acting against Mr. Jethmalani.
It is apparent enough that the BJP has read deeper meanings into Mr. Jethmalani’s quarrels with the party leadership on the appointment of Ranjit Sinha as the new CBI chief. Mr. Jethmalani not only questioned the BJP’s “flawed” opposition to Mr. Sinha’s appointment, he made sure he was joined by other dissenting voices from within the party. It cannot have been a coincidence that the same set of rebels also back Mr. Modi for Prime Minister and want Mr. Gadkari despatched as a first step towards this larger goal. In other words, l’affaire Jethmalani is not so much about an individual’s misdemeanours as it is symptomatic of the turf battles raging within the BJP. A victory in Gujarat for Mr. Modi — especially if it is handsome — can only deepen the fissures, with the Chief Minister’s backers certain to pitch him as a superhero waiting to deliver India to the saffron fold. Yet the Gujarat Chief Minister evokes deep fears, both within the BJP and among its potential allies. The BJP knows that the organisation will turn into a one-man show under Mr. Modi leading to the virtual eclipse of those with higher ambitions. The RSS, which nurtured Mr. Modi, abhors the cult of personality which it sees as damaging to ideology. The BJP has so far had little luck with expanding its alliance of parties. With Mr. Modi in command, potential allies will have further cause to keep their distance from the BJP.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-plot-thickens/article15616945.ece
27,11,2012,"Daddy, can I have a bank?","After interest rates, the licensing of new commercial banks has become the latest issue on which the Central government and the Reserve Bank of India can’t seem to see eye to eye. According to reports, Finance Minister P. Chidambaram has asked the RBI to expedite the process of issuing new commercial bank licences by first finalising existing draft guidelines, as a prelude to receiving new applications. The RBI, on its part, does not want to move forward unless it is legally empowered to regulate the new entities more comprehensively than is possible now. That would include powers to supersede the boards of directors of recalcitrant banks if the need arises. Existing regulations, in the RBI’s view, are not sufficient to check possible violations by banks promoted by those for whom banking may not be the core or even the main business. A specific concern has been the need to ensure that promoter groups are kept at arm’s length from the new banks. The failure by big business houses to adhere to this basic principle with regard to banks in which they were major shareholders was one of the principal reasons behind Indira Gandhi’s bank nationalisation drive in 1969. Since then, the door has been shut for them. Even with the onset of liberalisation, while new private banks have come into being, none of them has had any connection with industrial houses.
In his 2010 budget speech, Pranab Mukherjee, who was Finance Minister at the time, announced that industrial houses, among others, would be allowed to start private banks. His proposal, predictably, caused a raging, if inconclusive debate, over the desirability of the move. The RBI circulated a discussion paper in August 2010 detailing the pros and cons and released draft guidelines a year later based on the feedback received. The minimum capital requirement is pegged at Rs 500 crore. To be eligible, promoters must have diversified ownership, sound credentials and integrity and a successful track record of at least 10 years. These and other criteria are meant to raise entry barriers. However, there are two sets of objections to letting industrial houses in even after the regulatory lacunae are plugged. The first arises out of a genuine apprehension that large industrial houses, already entrenched in several spheres of the financial sector, might, after getting a bank licence, indulge in regulatory arbitrage and even attempt regulatory capture. There is, besides, no reason to fundamentally alter the ownership structure of Indian banking by letting big business groups in. With the right policy measures and incentives, existing banks will be able to better achieve objectives such as financial inclusion.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Daddy-can-I-have-a-bank/article15616943.ece
28,11,2012,Aam Aadmi reborn,"The Congress has been left bewildered by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) which has come as if from nowhere to steal its thunder. If nothing else, Arvind Kejriwal deserves standing ovation for his dare-devilry in appropriating an idea that has been the core philosophical message of India’s oldest and largest political party. The Congress has always claimed the poor and the marginalised as its own. The image got all but cast in stone during the Indira years. Jawaharlal Nehru’s daughter had an iconic following among the masses which she used to great effect — both to push Left-liberal programmes and to differentiate herself from the Syndicate which unabashedly advocated the status quo. The coming of the proudly right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party sharpened the Congress’s identity as a party of the downtrodden. Indeed, the aam aadmi slogan, coined on the eve of the 2004 general election, brilliantly captured the party’s social conscience even as it mocked at the BJP’s ‘India Shining’ preoccupations.
It is a measure of how far to the right the Congress has travelled since then that an upstart party has been able to hijack its principal platform from under its nose. Mr. Kejriwal has got away with AAP precisely because the Congress has failed to protect the interests of its core constituency, the aam aadmi. Nothing illustrates this more than the irony of the Congress pushing market reforms in a political climate stridently opposed to them. That the BJP and the Left have fetched up on the same side on foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail is a commentary in itself. Indeed, Mr. Kejriwal has tapped into the anguish of those sections that have felt betrayed by India’s Grand Old Party. The scams and scandals have stuck to the Congress because it has shown itself willing to defend the unexplained wealth of a chosen few. A Congress spokesperson had the audacity to ask why it was wrong of banks and companies to advance unsecured loans to Robert Vadra. Mr. Vadra’s caricature of the aam aadmi as the mango people completed the damage. Unbeknown to himself the Gandhi son-in-law had played midwife to AAP. Mr. Kejriwal’s new-born has plenty of chutzpah, and he and his team have taken on the holy cows in the political class. But feisty oratory and press conferences are not substitutes for implementable policy and vision, and too many exposés too often can induce fatigue. The promise to enforce democracy through local self-governance and referendums is beyond reproach but repeated referrals to the grass-roots can also strengthen majoritarian impulses. AAP must move beyond fighting corruption to evolve into a party with an agenda that addresses all of India’s problems.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Aam-Aadmi-reborn/article15616942.ece
28,11,2012,Morsy decrees trouble,"Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy’s November 22 decree awarding himself vast new powers has both stirred up a political hornet’s nest and demonstrated the uncertainty and difficulty of the transition to consolidated democracy of one of the most important countries in the Arab world. The decree, which critics say is akin to former dictator Hosni Mubarak’s laws and may even go beyond any of them, gives Mr. Morsy the power to enact any law he wants, and in effect removes the current prosecutor general, so that no authority can now revoke any presidential decision; the President also gets the power to appoint a new prosecutor general for a four-year term. The edict, claimed by Mr. Morsy to be a way of ‘cleansing public institutions,’ will remain in force until a new parliament is elected — but that cannot be done until a new constitution is drafted — and Mr. Morsy has also extended the timeline for that process. The President issued the decree of his own accord, without consultation, in a move that has been likened to the Free Officers’ coup in 1954 and amounts to a sidelining of the judiciary. It is a contemporary version of a Henry VIII clause.
Substantial sections of the Egyptian public have, understandably, been horrified by the Morsy edict, and have taken to the iconic Tahrir Square; some of the initial protests, including those in Alexandria, turned violent as members of the Muslim Brotherhood, parent body to Mr. Morsy’s Freedom and Justice Party, confronted them, and at the time of writing four people have died. The judiciary, for its part, has gone on strike, and most courts are closed. The President says he means the new powers to apply only to “sovereignty-related issues”, but that is at best vague; the judiciary, for its part, is widely distrusted for its role during the 30-year-long Mubarak regime, and the President’s announcement of a special judicial group to reopen the trials of former members of the dictatorship may not go far enough. Mass demonstrations are planned, but for the present most of the public apparently do not wish open confrontation to go too far. The Muslim Brotherhood has abandoned plans for counter-demonstrations, and there are grounds for some optimism. Mr. Morsy’s dismissal of the senior military has reduced the army’s influence. Secondly, the decree has united the democratic opposition, including liberals, leftists, and other groups, in a new National Salvation Front. The key point is that Mr. Morsy’s decree is simply not a substitute for genuine democratic reform of major public institutions. That is where the real work lies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Morsy-decrees-trouble/article15616954.ece
29,11,2012,Making talks meaningful,"The Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have been quick to respond positively to the Supreme Court’s suggestion that they meet and find a political solution to the seemingly intractable Cauvery river water dispute. It ill-behoves anyone to balk at an opportunity for negotiations, regardless of the stage of litigation, especially when the highest court in the land suggests it. Since the need to adjudicate arose because years of negotiations ended in failure, the advice for further talks long after a duly constituted tribunal’s verdict has been delivered may seem strange. Yet, the executive has to take responsibility for the failure of institutional mechanisms to find a solution. A provision in the Constitution, a law on inter-State water disputes, the verdict of a tribunal formed under the law, and an authority headed by the Prime Minister and involving the Chief Ministers of the basin States — all these structural arrangements seem to fail in the face of political intransigence. Past experience shows that the dispute flares up only in years of distress and goes dormant whenever nature’s bounty renders the upper riparian’s opinion on the timing and quantum of release of Cauvery water irrelevant. As they sit down for talks on Thursday — the first time since 1997 that Chief Ministers from the two States find themselves at the negotiating table — it is not the political will to find an amicable solution in the interests of their farmers which brings them there; rather, they will be there at the court’s bidding, perhaps each seeing in it an opportunity to expose how intransigent the other side is.
If they wish to defy this realistic, if not cynical, assessment, they would do well to understand that this time they are armed with much more than good intentions to move forward: the final award of the Cauvery Tribunal, delivered in 2007, is available for guidance and refuge. In the upcoming round of talks, the two Chief Ministers would serve the farmers’ cause well if they do not stop with finding a way out of the current year’s water shortage. Here is an opportunity to move beyond the particular requirements of this season — as irony would have it, the two States even disagree on what constitutes a ‘season’ — and hammer out a lasting political solution to a dispute that persists five years after a final award which has the force and effect of a Supreme Court decree. They could accept broadly the terms of the award which apportions the water estimated to be available in the Cauvery basin among the four riparian States and look for ways to implement it. Only a meaningful agreement on operationalising the final award during normal years and sharing distress pro rata in years of shortage is the way out.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Making-talks-meaningful/article15616946.ece
29,11,2012,Managing the multibrand UPA,"Political wisdom had it that the Bharatiya Janata Party was the organisation with the grey cells while the Congress muddled along, good-intentioned but unfocussed on future goals and strategy. The BJP’s PR machinery has always been well-tuned to magnifying the smallest achievements in contrast to the Congress which didn’t seem to know or care about image management. All that might be history considering the role reversal we are currently witnessing between the Congress and the BJP. There is a gung-ho optimism to UPA-II which is completely at odds with a regime identified till recently with corruption and policy paralysis. Indeed, from a state of stupor to hyper-activity, Team Manmohan has undergone a metamorphosis which has stunned the Opposition as much as it has the UPA’s own allies. The government’s decision to push ahead with economic reforms — the key part here being Foreign Direct Investment in multi-brand retail — in the face of near-total opposition in Parliament reveals a daring that would have been unimaginable in the beginning months of UPA-II. The change began with the Prime Minister exhorting his officials to revive the economy’s “animal spirits.” Once P. Chidambaram had moved to the Union Finance Ministry, there was going to be no stopping the reform process which seemed able to withstand every obstacle, including the departure from the UPA of the formidable Mamata Banerjee.
With the government and Opposition implacably placed on FDI, a battle of wits between the two was a given in this session of Parliament. Yet the government’s biggest challenge turned out to be the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, which made known its opposition to the reform in categorical terms. The procedural wrangles over whether or not FDI should be put to vote were resolved once the DMK came on board; basking in the comfort of numbers, the government signalled its readiness for the vote. To be sure, a defeat on FDI would not have obliged the government to resign. But it would have exposed its lack of majority on the floor of the House, leading to the charge that the regime ruled without a mandate. For the Prime Minister, who has been the most strident on FDI, it would have been a personal embarrassment at a time when he was surely hoping to cement his legacy as the quintessential reforms man. The stakes were indeed high for Dr. Singh and the team he led, which explains why Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath put in the leg work he did to bring around the DMK as well as the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party. The BJP is bound to wonder where it lost its own famed skills at management.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Managing-the-multibrand-UPA/article15616949.ece
5,12,2012,No end to the faltering,"Growth data for the second quarter of the current fiscal year (July to September 2012), released by the Central Statistics Office last week, unambiguously confirms the slowdown which was captured by data of the previous quarters. GDP growth at 5.3 per cent is even lower than the 5.5 per cent of the first quarter (April-June 2012). This is the third consecutive quarter in which the GDP growth has hovered around these levels. The half-yearly growth rate of 5.4 per cent is much lower than the 7.3 per cent clocked over the same period last year. It is going to be a stupendous task for the economy to catch up during the second half of the fiscal year and post what would still be a modest six per cent for the whole year. The budget forecast of a 7.6 per cent growth rate appears to be a pipe dream at this juncture, and even the more realistic, scaled down forecast of 5.8 per cent by the Reserve Bank of India looks unachievable. Although some analysts expect the growth rate for the second half of the year to benefit from a favourable base effect — industrial growth was low during the corresponding period last year — the consensus opinion is that the economy will record its lowest annual growth rate in well over a decade. Industry remains the weak link, growing by just 2.8 per cent during the second quarter. Manufacturing, impacted by policy hurdles and slowing consumption and investment demand, grew by just 0.8 per cent.
Services, the best performing of the three sectors, posted a modest 7.2 per cent growth in the second quarter, sharply lower than the corresponding period last year. A few sub-sectors have, however, fared relatively well. For instance “financing, insurance, real estate and business services” grew by 9.4 per cent, and “community, social and personal services” by 7.5 per cent. Private consumption remained muted at 3.7 per cent due to depressed consumer sentiment and high interest rates. Global demand continues to be weak and this is reflected in the sharp decline in exports. Agriculture grew by 1.2 per cent, which is still creditable given the sharp decline in output of certain key kharif crops, including rice, coarse cereals, pulses and oilseeds. While government spokespersons, including the Finance Minister, have reconciled themselves to a lower growth trajectory, policy focus must now be on the measures needed to revive the economy. Much more than sentiment altering announcements, such as the opening up of multi-brand retail to foreign direct investors, is needed. Containing the fiscal deficit to within the budgeted 5.3 per cent of GDP is going to be a big challenge in an economy that is markedly slowing down.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/No-end-to-the-faltering/article14641192.ece
5,12,2012,Where there is a will,"The Andhra Pradesh Assembly did itself proud by passing a Bill aimed at bringing the State’s disadvantaged sections on a par with the rest of society in economic, educational and human development terms in the next 10 years. For far too long, the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes have had to remain content with empty promises of upliftment and empowerment by political parties whose real agenda was to mine their vote bank. What other conclusion can be drawn after successive governments made a mockery of the initiative taken in the Fifth Five Year Plan to end the dual disabilities of economic exploitation and social discrimination of SCs and STs by earmarking funds exclusively for them in each annual plan? The weaker sections constitute a majority of those living below the poverty line and it is the State’s duty to apply the Directive Principles to protect them. The reality, sadly, has been quite different. Funds earmarked under SC and ST sub-plans have regularly been diverted for sundry projects unconnected to their welfare and development, such as the cleaning of Hussainsagar Lake in Hyderabad.
A similar diversion of funds is taking place in many States with reckless disregard for Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s vision for the downtrodden. Ideally, in Andhra Pradesh, 22.8 per cent of the Annual Plan should be earmarked for SC and ST sub-plans in proportion to the total population. At best, implementation has been tardy and found lacking in sincerity of purpose and political will. The Special Component Plan funds for SCs in the 19-year period from 1992-93 to 2010-11 amounted to Rs. 40,830 crore and the allocation Rs. 32,954 crore. Shockingly, the actual expenditure was only Rs. 19,225 crore. A positive feature in the endeavour to reverse this deplorable trend has been the role played by civil society groups. They were instrumental in pressuring the government to enact a law, mandating not merely allocation of funds for SCs and STs but ensuring they are properly spent. Political parties fell in line, temporarily setting aside their narrow agendas for passage of the APSCs Sub-Plan and STs Sub-Plan (Planning, Allocation and Utilisation of Financial Resources) Bill, 2012. Leaders of the faction-ridden ruling Congress even saw in the legislation a political opportunity to project themselves as champions of the underprivileged by appropriating credit for the historic legislation. All this happened amid the uncertainty over Telangana and a fractious Congress leadership. Change, it has been proved, can be brought about peacefully and silently provided the cause is right.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/where-there-is-a-will/article4164628.ece
5,12,2012,Time to clean up our game,"The news about the International Olympic Committee suspending India has not been entirely unexpected though the pace with which events unfolded on Tuesday might have stunned many. That both sides adopted uncompromising postures while handling a most sensitive matter was unfortunate. The IOC did not wait for the Indian Olympics Association (IOA) elections to take place on Wednesday before suspending India, nor did it give a hearing to the Indian body, especially at a time when its representative in the country, Randhir Singh, happened to be an aspiring candidate in the elections. On its part, the IOA did not show the urgency or diplomacy that was warranted to deal with the situation. The IOA allowed things to drift even though contentious issues related to government guidelines on tenure of office-bearers — first enforced in 1975 — had been brewing for more than two years. It was the former Sports Minister, M. S. Gill, who pulled out the old guidelines from ‘cold storage’ in 2010, amended them and firmly told the IOA and the National Sports Federations (NSFs) to fall in line. Once the IOC warned the IOA that it should not go ahead with its elections under the National Sports Code as directed by the Delhi High Court, the suspension was a foregone conclusion.
If the IOC was on the IOA’s side in 2010 and subsequently, when the National Sports Development Bill was mooted in February 2011, the situation has changed completely with the IOC taking a rare stand against a National Olympic Committee because of what it perceives is the latter’s defiance. Factional fights within the Indian Olympic body have only helped divert the real issues that have plagued Indian sports administration for long, and delayed the reforms that are badly needed. Even as it has objected to government regulations dictating the IOA’s elections, the IOC has all but made it plain that it would not be averse to the idea of tenure restrictions if the measure is voluntarily adopted rather than imposed by the government. The IOA’s inability to sort things out with the government has led to this unprecedented suspension in its 88-year-old history. The Commonwealth Games scam that led to officials including IOA President Suresh Kalmadi and current Secretary-General-designate, Lalit Bhanot, being charge-sheeted, has only strengthened the public perception that sports bodies need to be brought under government regulation, especially when government funds are being utilised for the development of sports. The courts have concurred with the government view. The IOC’s sanction is not an intractable position but both the government and the IOA will need to come on board to clean up the mess without harming the interests of the athletes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/time-to-clean-up-our-game/article4164626.ece
6,12,2012,A party in retreat,"When identity-based political parties find their core constituency under threat, they take recourse to the coarsest forms of exclusivist, sectarian politics. In Tamil Nadu, the Pattali Makkal Katchi, a party predominantly of Vanniyars, a most backward class community of the northern districts, is now in a back-to-basics mode, opting for a limited, casteist agenda at the expense of an overly ambitious Tamil nationalist project. After finding itself on the losing side in two successive elections, the 2009 Lok Sabha election and the 2011 Assembly election, the PMK has been struggling to retain its original support base among rural Vanniyars. To win back some of this lost base, party founder S. Ramadoss has now hit upon the strategy of invoking familiar caste demons, pointing to the Dalit community as the natural enemy of the Vanniyars in a long-drawn social conflict. Although the immediate provocation for the revival of the PMK’s casteist agenda appears to be the recent caste-clash in Dharmapuri district following the marriage of a Vanniyar woman with a Dalit man, the real reasons run deeper. As a party too closely identified with Vanniyars, the PMK was unable to rally together large sections of other castes under the banner of Tamil nationalism. Actually, the party made sincere efforts to involve the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, a Dalit party with influence in the same northern parts of the State, in the Tamil nationalist project, using issues such as the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka and the Cauvery dispute. But a quantum jump in electoral fortunes eluded both parties. Indeed, for many Vanniyar youth who joined the party fired up on caste pride, the PMK began to lose its charm. It was then only a matter of time before the PMK again resorted to the Vanniyar card to keep the flock together.
However, in trying to win back Vanniyars, Dr. Ramadoss is stoking the embers of a caste conflict. Quite provocatively, the PMK founder is calling for amendments to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, to prevent what he describes as its “misuse” by Dalit youth. If anything, the law needs tightening to ensure better conviction rates. But, for Dr. Ramadoss, this is part of a strategy to draw in all those who want to counter Dalit assertion in northern Tamil Nadu. For a party like the PMK, which is trying to protect a shrinking voter base, caste conflict is the easiest way to polarise votes and mobilise support. But such cynical, manipulative politics offers limited purchase, and is doomed to fail over the long term. The sooner Dr. Ramadoss learns his lessons, the better it would be for the future of the PMK.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-party-in-retreat/article14641187.ece
7,12,2012,Who’s afraid of moral defeat?,"Irrespective of how the Rajya Sabha votes on the resolution against Foreign Direct Investment in multi-brand retail, the United Progressive Alliance government has won where it matters most: in the Lok Sabha. Given that some of the constituents and supporting parties of the UPA were against FDI in multi-brand retail, the government did well to tide over this mini-crisis, defeating the Opposition-sponsored resolution comfortably enough in the end. A loss in the Lok Sabha would have raised questions about the legitimacy of the government, and of the continuance of the pro-reforms push. However, the walkout by the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party, both opposed to FDI in multi-brand retail but supportive of the government, ensured the defeat of the resolution moved by the principal opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party. The fact that the numbers in support of the UPA did not add up to 272 or more, which is the absolute majority in the House, is the only consolation for the BJP, the Left parties and the Trinamool Congress, who were in the forefront of the battle against the government on this issue. But the Congress will have no problem in dealing with this “moral defeat” that means nothing at all in real terms.
The way the vote went is a pointer to emergence of key political fault-lines in the run up to the 2014 general election. Both the SP and the BSP were content to register their opposition on FDI and walk out without actually voting against the government. Obviously, in their calculations, the survival of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is much more important than the debate over multinational giants, kirana stores and farmers. After all, the government had left it to the States to decide whether or not to allow FDI. Despite the best efforts of the BJP, the resolution was seen by the two Uttar Pradesh-based parties in the context of the survival of a secular government at the Centre. The BJP was hoping to keep the focus on FDI, and away from the communal-secular divide, but for the SP and the BSP, as for the UPA, too much hinged on the FDI vote. Clearly the BJP is finding its communally divisive agenda difficult to live down. No matter what it professes in the immediate context, all its actions are viewed by other secular parties in the larger context of its communal politics. Fear of the BJP’s sectarian politics is enough to drive parties such as the SP and the BSP into the arms of the Congress. To the credit of Congress political managers, the FDI vote turned not just on the economy, but on the country’s social-democratic fabric too. While the BJP’s past wrongdoings are still helping the Congress, the Congress’s present wrongdoings are not coming to the aid of the BJP.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Who%E2%80%99s-afraid-of-moral-defeat/article14641179.ece
7,12,2012,Paper glitters more,"The surge in the domestic demand for gold has continued unabated even when gold prices are going through the roof and new records are becoming the order of the day. With very little of it mined within the country, India has been a massive importer of the precious metal. Last year (2011-12), imports aggregated 1067 tonnes at a value of $60 billion, sharply higher than the $40 billion spent on gold imports the previous year. The bulk of the demand within the country comes from households, both for jewellery making and — increasingly — for investment. In fact, the demand for gold bars and coins has grown tremendously in recent years while the tradition of ornament making has continued to spur gold demand. Of the several reasons attributed to the high demand, a few are prosaic: gold, in a standardised form as bar or coin, is available more freely than ever before, sold even through bank branches. However, it is the realisation that gold as an investment product can consistently beat almost all other normal avenues such as bank deposits and shares — both in terms of appreciation and as a hedge against inflation — that is behind the phenomenal spurt in demand. The macroeconomic implications of this development are huge and although quite apparent to policymakers for a while, are only now beginning to engage their serious attention.
An obvious consequence of the inelastic nature of imports of gold — and, of course, energy products — has been the burgeoning import bill and consequent widening of the trade imbalance. It is a big challenge to reduce the current account deficit, which was at a record 4.2 per cent of the GDP in March, to more acceptable levels. Moderating gold imports through fiscal or administrative measures is not a viable option for an economy that is integrating fast with the rest of the world. Past experience suggests that illicit channels and hawala trading will emerge in the event of a clampdown. Another deleterious consequence of the preference for physical gold has been the sharp reduction in household financial savings, which are vitally needed for the industrial economy. An interesting idea recently suggested by RBI Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn of popularising “paper gold” — financial savings instruments which are backed by gold — is worth pursuing immediately. Long available in centres like Singapore, these products in effect call upon banks to buy and sell gold at market determined prices so that their customers can enjoy all the benefits of gold investment without the hassles of storing it physically. The craze for physical gold will hopefully come down then.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Paper-glitters-more/article14641180.ece
8,12,2012,Reviving dead rivers,"The Supreme Court’s decision to get an independent technical assessment on how the Yamuna can be revived from its deathly state is a deserved rebuke to the Delhi administration and equally, the Ministry of Environment and Forests for the manner in which they have been handling the issue of pollution control. For many years now, the Ministry has been aware of the torrents of untreated sewage that choke both the Yamuna and Ganga. The Central Pollution Control Board has produced detailed reports on the problem and attributed the Yamuna’s slow death between Hathnikund and Agra to the unmitigated discharge of effluents. Regrettably, in spite of constant monitoring by the CPCB and the worsening state of the river, the MoEF has pursued little more than incremental steps. Delhi’s civic agencies have also not delivered on the sewage treatment plants that are so vital for restoration. Clearly, mitigating river pollution enjoys low priority. Parliament was informed recently that the Ganga is so polluted with faecal coliform matter that it does not meet water quality norms all the way from Kanpur to Diamond Harbour in Kolkata. It will take another eight years under the Mission Clean Ganga for the flow of untreated sewage (exceeding 1,600 million litres a day) and industrial effluents into the river to stop. All this reflects an indolent approach to urban pollution control, which stands in contrast to hectic speculation in real estate.
A clean-up programme for India’s rivers requires vigorous application of the ‘polluter pays’ principle. Since much of India is inexorably moving towards urbanisation, the focus of policy must be on planned housing, water supply and sanitation. For New Delhi, the Supreme Court had ordered even in 1999 that a specific quantum of water flow be ensured in the Yamuna for its revival. That no salvage operation has proved successful is a telling commentary on the efficacy of the expensive Yamuna Action Plan, which is now into its third phase. It would be appropriate, therefore, for the court to put in place a review mechanism for the cleansing operation to follow, with clear reporting requirements. Accountability norms for official agencies are necessary for the restoration of many more rivers that have been killed off by pollution. Although the Environment (Protection) Act and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act are intended to protect India’s waterways, the CPCB and the State Pollution Control Boards are unwilling to use them effectively. Also, a more ecologically sound approach towards environmental flows in rivers is necessary. That would mean building fewer big dams, and making more life-giving water available to rivers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Reviving-dead-rivers/article12438150.ece
8,12,2012,Give-and-take at the border,"The proposed land-swap deal with Bangladesh is meant to remove certain anomalies along the border and the protest against it by the Asom Gana Parishad, the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Trinamool Congress and others is unjustified. A protocol was signed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his counterpart, Sheikh Hasina, in Dhaka in September 2011 to enable the exchange of 111 Indian enclaves in Bangladesh with a population of 37,334 and 51 Bangladeshi enclaves on Indian territory with a population of 14,215. India is in adverse possession of 1,165.49 acres of Bangladesh land, while Bangladesh holds 1,880.81 acres on the Indian side. This win-win formula would involve redrawing boundaries to maintain the status quo in areas of adverse possession and result in a fixed demarcated boundary in all un-demarcated segments. Since the Gauhati High Court ruled in June 2012 that this could be implemented only by means of a constitutional amendment, the Union government has brought forward a bill that is before Parliament. Political parties should support the legislation whole-heartedly. The passing of the Bill will enable the government to resolve disputes at 25 points in West Bengal, Tripura, Meghalaya and Assam.
The government’s detractors want it to give priority to staunching migration along the border, ignoring the fact that the regularisation of the line is a precondition to effective monitoring of movement across the 4,156-km border. Mamata Banerjee’s reservations evidently stem from the fact that enclaves in West Bengal’s Cooch Behar area would go to Bangladesh, possibly impinging on her constituency. The AGP’s concerns match its own electoral arithmetic. The BJP, for which the bogey of “illegal immigration” is stock-in-trade, worries — without basis —about the prospect of India “parting with territories.” Short-term calculations ought not to impel political parties into taking such positions, especially on matters relating to ties with India’s neighbours. Hopefully, the voices of resistance that were being heard on the Bangladesh side over the deal would also subside. Both governments should ensure that mechanisms are put in place to give ordinary people a fair deal and minimise relocation traumas. Terrain challenges are involved, and fencing along the border — a highly inefficient way of deterring migrants — has added a further complication. Farmers whose farms have been sliced by the fence need to be helped out. For them, the inability to visit freely land that they own, or cultivate and harvest crops in time, is a disadvantage. The Border Security Force and Border Guards Bangladesh need to be sensitised to their plight.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/giveandtake-at-the-border/article4175216.ece
10,12,2012,Lose-lose deal,"Resisting the seductive pull of jingoism, India has adopted a prudent approach to the Maldives government decision rescinding GMR’s contract for operating and maintaining Male airport. In an era when diplomacy and business appear joined at the hip, some analysts have attempted to whip up nationalistic sentiments by describing the Maldivian action against the Indian company as a slap on the Indian government’s face. Nothing can be further from the truth and it is just as well that New Delhi appears not to have been misled by this logic. What is at stake is a commercial contract and as External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid noted, “If they [the Maldives] have to take a decision in the interest of their society and country and if that decision is taken properly as per laws there, what objections can anyone have?” Yes, GMR had signed a legally valid and binding contract that has now been upended because the new administration considers it to be a bad deal. But if the expropriation of the airport is being done legally and Maldives is willing to compensate GMR for its investment and loss of business, what scope is there for the Indian government to intervene? India has to keep in mind its larger interests in the region, which are more important than the commercial contract of a single company.
That said, it is rather unfortunate that the Maldives government chose to abrogate a contract which was allotted to GMR through a transparent process designed and supervised by the World Bank-affiliated International Finance Corporation. GMR appears to have become a pawn, a symbol of the apparent excesses of the earlier government headed by Mohammed Nasheed, who was overthrown by Mohammed Waheed in February. Issues such as the Airport Development Charges sought to be levied by GMR based on the contract it signed with the Maldives government could have been negotiated and resolved across the table without taking recourse to the drastic action of annulment of the contract. Though GMR stands to suffer in terms of loss of business and profits, it is the Maldives that will be paying a bigger price over the long term. Not only will it now have to pay compensation running into a few hundred millions of dollars — the precise sum will be determined by arbitration — it will also have to find another promoter to develop and run the airport. While the compensation liability could be ruinous to the small economy of the island nation with an estimated GDP of $2.1 billion, it may be next to impossible to find a private investor willing to work with Maldives in any major project given the way it abrogated the GMR deal. All in all, the entire episode has turned out to be a lose-lose proposition for all those involved.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Lose-lose-deal/article12441171.ece
10,12,2012,Rewriting the Morsy code,"In a move which will resonate far beyond West Asia and North Africa, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy has rescinded the decree he issued on November 22 giving himself sweeping powers including immunity from challenge to any decision he made thenceforth. The cancellation is clearly a response to widespread public protests, some of which turned violent; at least seven people died and 350 were injured in confrontations between supporters of Mr. Morsy’s movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, and the President’s opponents. Leaders of the National Salvation Front, a coalition favouring secular democracy, state that the President’s self-arrogated powers went beyond even those of the deposed dictator Hosni Mubarak, and that Mr. Morsy has thereby lost legitimacy. The President has convinced none of his opponents that the powers in question were needed for an orderly transition to representative democracy, and the strength of public feeling was probably a shock to him; the security forces did not stop crowds from removing barricades around the presidential palace in Heliopolis. International reaction has also shown a sharp change in tone from the Mubarak era; the United States initially supported Mr. Mubarak when the uprising against him started on January 25, 2011, but Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has now stated that “enduring cooperation” will be hard to sustain without “democratic legitimacy and public consent.”
Mr. Morsy, however, has not cancelled the referendum he has scheduled for December 15 on the draft constitution prepared by a 100-member committee agreed by the parties after the judiciary had unilaterally dissolved the constituent assembly which had been elected a few months earlier. Amid severe disagreements, 19 members withdrew, criticising the document’s Islamism — it would make the Sharia the main source of law — and weak protections of rights. Yet if the public rejects the constitution, Mr. Morsy will remain in place with no specification of powers for the various institutions of state. Powerful groups from the ancien régime will do all they can to maintain their power-bases; the former ruling body, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, has been dissolved, but Mr. Morsy has added two top Scaf generals to his own entourage and made a third defence minister. Secondly, the judiciary could in effect be taking sides against Mr. Morsy and his Islamist supporters; it has said it will not supervise the referendum. Clearly, the leaders of the major blocs are yet to learn a politics legitimised by the public, whose protests are the only thing keeping Egypt from returning to the bad old days.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Rewriting-the-Morsy-code/article12441170.ece
11,12,2012,Use visa card sensibly,"The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) took a long time to see the light, but it has finally done the right thing in removing, at least partially, the unreasonable re-entry restriction imposed since 2009 on foreigners with long-term Indian visas. After it came to light that David Headley, a Pakistani-origin U.S national, had visited Mumbai on a long-term visa several times to scout sites for the November 2008 Lashkar-e-Taiba attacks, the MHA acted in a knee-jerk fashion to ban tourists with multiple entry visas from re-entering India within two months of leaving the country. That the restriction did not apply to multiple entry business visas — the very visas Headley had used for his frequent trips — was the first absurdity about the new rule. While the restriction did nothing to deter would-be terrorists, the two month rule affected thousands of tourists who would have wanted to use India as a base to travel through South Asia. Most importantly, it affected Indian-origin foreign nationals who did not have a Person of Indian Origin or Overseas Citizen of India card. True, arrivals for 2010 were higher than for the previous year, when in-bound tourism in India was washed out under the combined effects of the global economic downturn and the 2008 Mumbai attacks. But for a country trying to get more tourists to come, the restrictive rule marked it out as one that did not follow global best practices in its visa policy.
The government has now mercifully relaxed this unwarranted and ineffective restriction, while retaining it for citizens of some countries, namely Afghanistan, China, Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, Sudan and Bangladesh. These are also countries whose nationals need individual security clearance from the MHA before they can be given visas to attend conferences, seminars or academic meetings. North Block justifies this discrimination in the name of national security, the same alibi it invokes in order to insist that all academic conferences where foreign scholars are invited must be officially vetted before visa clearances are issued. This practice, which sometimes leads to the denial of visas for scholars whose views the Indian state finds disagreeable, is at odds with the country’s image as a vibrant democracy and needs urgent review. Research visas for bona fide scholars are also hard to come by, and can be impossible to obtain if the scholar wants to study a subject that the MHA considers “sensitive.” Unreasonable visa restrictions affect friends of India — both current and potential — more than those with evil designs against India. They can never be a substitute for an efficient intelligence-gathering system, which may be harder work but which would definitely prove more fail-safe in the long run.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Use-visa-card-sensibly/article12442416.ece
11,12,2012,Setting an example,"Convinced that the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) installation is safe, the French government recently granted the fusion project the necessary permission to start construction in Cadarache. There are many firsts to the project. Maintaining transparency has been one of ITER’s most significant features and organising an enquiry to give the public an opportunity to formulate its opinion has set a new benchmark for openness. Independent experts assessed the safety of the fusion project and the public was not just taken into confidence but made an integral part of the project construction approval process. In effect, the two-and-a-half-year effort fully met the requirements set forth by France’s own 2006 Nuclear Transparency and Security legislation. If the French government took a bold decision to bring about more transparency and public engagement before nuclear projects are cleared, the clearance given to ITER tells us that it is indeed possible to meet the stringent requirements laid down by the law.
The ITER approval highlights the fact that the public is not unreasonable or obstinate. All people want is to be provided with facts, made fully aware of the benefits and risks, convinced that complete transparency is being maintained, and that their opinion is being taken into account on an important decision. Internationally, the nuclear industry is well known for maintaining opacity and for refusing to take the public into confidence. In India, the situation is compounded by the excessive secrecy surrounding all things nuclear, and by the lackadaisical and hurried manner in which environmental impact assessments are often carried out. As for the mandatory public hearings for large projects, both nuclear and non-nuclear, these frequently descend into chaos if not farce. The sustained local opposition to the Kudankulam nuclear power plant continues unabated even days before the first two units are to become operational. While many valid questions concerning the safety aspects of the plant have not been clearly answered, public apprehension to a great extent has come from imagined fear, misconceptions and an improper understanding of the technology-intensive project. It is time the Indian nuclear establishment realised that it can no longer bulldoze its way. Winning public approval is not only important but necessary for two reasons — the Chernobyl catastrophe and the 2011 Fukushima disaster are fresh in people’s mind, and the government has major plans to construct many power nuclear plants across the country.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Setting-an-example/article12442414.ece
12,12,2012,Depoliticising the Cauvery,"The biggest gain from the Union government’s welcome decision to notify the final award of the Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunal is that it may be the first and most significant step towards a permanent solution to the persistent conflict over sharing the inter-State river’s waters. A positive feature is that implementation of the final award will involve the formation of a Cauvery Management Board to regulate the supply of water and a Water Regulation Committee, which will post representatives in each of the eight reservoirs in the basin States, to ensure that the decisions are carried out. Giving finality to the award through the notification may help take the issue away from politics, and place it in the hands of a technical, expert body. Of course, depoliticising an issue that involves two principal antagonists is no easy task. The February 2007 award has been questioned by way of clarification petitions before the Tribunal itself as well as suits in the Supreme Court by both parties and sceptics may wonder how useful the gazette notification may be now. The parties are still free to pursue their clarification petitions and appeals, but in the larger interest of a long-term solution and to end seasonal acrimony, they would do well to give the award a chance.
The fact that notifying the award has been a long-pending demand of Tamil Nadu should not make one believe that the action redounds to one party’s benefit to the detriment of the other. It was the Supreme Court that made the suggestion that the final decision be notified and counsel for all the basin states have agreed that it could be done. It may be argued that gazetting the award will not resolve the present standoff over judicial and administrative directives to Karnataka to release water to save standing crops in Tamil Nadu. The Cauvery Monitoring Committee, while asking Karnataka to ensure 12 thousand million cubic feet of water to Tamil Nadu in December, has itself admitted that its decision is unlikely to satisfy either party, given that both States have less water in their reservoirs than in previous years. Yet, it has opted for a pragmatic solution under which both States will be in deficit of approximately 47 tmcft. It is in the same spirit of pragmatism that both States must now approach the larger problem of sharing water as per a judicially determined solution in both normal and distress years. The two should not let posterity say of them that long after equitable distribution has entrenched itself as the most acceptable doctrine in riverine jurisprudence, they did not allow a judicially determined system for sharing to work.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/depoliticising-the-cauvery/article4188777.ece
12,12,2012,Long march to democracy,"The opposition boycott of the December 1 parliamentary elections in Kuwait has been followed by peaceful protests in which tens of thousands have supported opposition claims that an October 19 change to the electoral law giving each voter one vote instead of the previous four is unconstitutional and that the newly elected parliament, the 50-seat Majles al-Ummah, therefore has no popular legitimacy. The protesters’ case is strengthened by the fact that election officials put the turnout at 43 per cent, which is itself much lower than the usual 60 per cent. The opposition parties also contend that the changed law gerrymanders the result in favour of pro-government candidates; the government, on the other hand, says the result enables better cooperation between the executive and the legislature — but the Emir appoints the Council of Ministers, of whom 16 also sit in the Majles. For the record, the parties which boycotted the election have been hit hard. In addition, the three largest Bedouin tribes, which had as many as 17 seats in previous assemblies, now have only one. Second, the new assembly will contain 17 members of the minority Shia community, who form 30 per cent of the 1.2 million native Kuwaiti population; three women have won seats, but four of the earlier assembly were women.
The recent developments constitute a key development in the Kuwaiti people’s campaign for democracy, which predates the Arab Spring by five years or so. The Kuwaiti public have for some time shown what they think, with demonstrations which had swelled to 50,000 people by November 2011; their suspicions deepened when, in June 2012, the constitutional court annulled the February elections, in which Islamist opposition candidates had won up to 34 seats, and reinstated the earlier parliament; subsequent protests numbered 100,000. The reinstated body tried to meet in July and August, but a majority of members stayed away. Furthermore, the leading opposition politician Mussallam al-Barak was arrested for “undermining the status of the Emir” by criticising him in public. Mr. al-Barak was given bail, but faces a potential five-year jail term. The ruling al-Sabah family appears to be avoiding the full political implications of the current unrest; the Emir’s replacement of the Prime Minister, a relative, with another relative will not convince the public. Neither will the $108-bn plan to diversify the oil-dependent economy assuage the demands for political reform. The Kuwaiti public rightly demand genuine representative democracy, and given that democracy has penetrated deeper in Kuwait than it has done in many other Gulf countries, a constitutional monarchy would be a pioneering and constructive creation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/long-march-to-democracy/article4188778.ece
19,12,2012,Time to be ashamed,"Perhaps the real tragedy we must contemplate, as we consider the story of the young woman who now lies in a Delhi hospital bed battling for her life after being brutally beaten and gang-raped Sunday night, is this: in six months or less, she will have been forgotten. There will, by then, have been the next victim, and the one after — and absolutely nothing will have changed. Ever since Sunday’s savage crime, India’s political leadership has been loudly engaged in what it appears to believe is advocacy of women’s rights — in the main, dramatic but meaningless calls for summary trials, castration and mandatory death penalties. The same leaders will, if past record proves a guide, do absolutely nothing to actually address the problem. For all the noise that each gang-rape has provoked, Parliament has made no worthwhile progress towards desperately-needed legal reforms. Even nuts-and-bolts measures, like enhanced funding for forensic investigations, upgrading training of police to deal with sexual crimes, and making expert post-trauma support available to victims, are conspicuous by their absence.
How does one account for the strange contrast between our outrage about rape — and our remarkable unwillingness, as a society, to actually do anything about it? For one, we are far more widely complicit in crimes against women than we care to acknowledge. The hideous gang-rape in Delhi is part of the continuum of violence millions of Indian women face every single day; a continuum that stretches from sexual harassment in public spaces and the workplace to physical abuse that plays itself out in the privacy of our homes far more often than on the street. Nor is it true, secondly, that Delhi is India’s “rape capital.” There are plenty of other places in India with a higher incidence of reported rape, in population adjusted terms — and Delhi’s record on convicting perpetrators is far higher than the national average. Third, this is not a problem of policing alone. As Professor Ratna Kapur argues in an op-ed article in this newspaper today, there is something profoundly wrong in the values young men are taught in our society — values which bind the parental preference for a male child to the gang of feral youth who carried out Sunday’s outrage or the hundreds of thousands of husbands who were battering their wives that same night. Finally, India’s society rails against rape, in the main, not out of concern for victims but because of the despicable notion that a woman’s body is the repository of family honour. It is this honour our society seeks to protect, not individual women. It is time for us as a people to feel the searing shame our society has until now only imposed on its female victims.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/time-to-be-ashamed/article4214334.ece
19,12,2012,Standstill policy,"A picture is gradually emerging of the economy beginning to mend itself but it is not complete enough yet to consider a cut in interest rates. That seems to be the message from the Reserve Bank of India in its mid-quarter monetary policy review. Headline inflation has been well below the central bank’s own expectations in the last couple of months, there are signs of a rebound in growth in the third quarter with capital goods production rising after 13 successive months of decline, non-food credit is picking up and the rabi season sowing is on in full swing raising hopes of a good harvest. Yet, there are enough factors to worry about too. Retail inflation continues to rage with food prices remaining on an upward spiral. Though industrial activity picked up in October, it remains to be seen how much of it was festival-related and whether the effect of lower growth in the same month last year helped to exaggerate the picture this year. Wholesale price inflation also needs careful watching to confirm whether the declining trend is sustained. And most important of all, the deficit in the current account continues to be a major worry, casting a shadow over the balance of payments situation. The falling rupee and rising consumption have neutralised the little gains from steady crude oil prices, exerting pressure on the current deficit. In short, it is not a propitious time yet for any easing.
The markets and industry might have been disappointed with the standstill policy but the RBI has held out hope that a rate cut is not too far away. Sticking to its guidance in the October policy review, the central bank has indicated “policy easing” in the fourth quarter. This, along with its observation that the focus of monetary policy should now shift to growth from inflation will be heartening news for India Inc. which has been grumbling about the bank’s hawkish policy stance. On the flip side, the RBI may have set off expectations with its guidance and if it is unable to meet them either due to a rebound in inflation or deterioration in other economic variables, sentiment could receive a setback. The stock market fell soon after the policy announcement — there were expectations of a 0.25 percentage point cut in the cash reserve ratio — but recovered quickly once it digested the positive guidance from the RBI. What the central bank has left unsaid in its policy is that it is watching the government’s efforts towards fiscal consolidation and its ability to rein in the fiscal deficit. And till such time that the RBI is convinced on this score, the government will have no option but to walk alone.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/standstill-policy/article4214337.ece
20,12,2012,Rethink the new UAPA,"Thanks to robust resistance offered by members of the Upper House, Parliament has bought itself more time to debate the wisdom of adding more draconian provisions to the already twice-amended Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The government pushed through the latest set of amendments in the Lok Sabha overriding objections and demands for greater scrutiny of the Bill, especially in the light of India’s previous experience with anti-terrorism laws. From the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act through the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) to the various incarnates of UAPA, the lesson for us has been that such laws do not necessarily deter terror crimes but do lend themselves to gross misuse. POTA was enacted in the aftermath of the December 2001 attack on Parliament despite shameful instances of human rights violations recorded during the pendency of TADA, which in fact led to its repeal. POTA’s definition of what constituted a ‘terrorist act’ was too broad, criminalising even political activism. The law permitted prolonged detentions without charge and reversed the presumption of innocence which is the bedrock of the criminal justice system. In line with the UPA’s Common Minimum Programme, which vowed to banish terror-specific laws, the Manmohan Singh government repealed POTA. But in an unexpected act of betrayal, it also reintroduced some of POTA’s stringent provisions in an altered version of UAPA, amending the law a second time in the wake of the November 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.
The government’s justification for the new amendments is that it is obliged to strengthen UAPA by its membership of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental body responsible for setting global standards against money laundering and terror financing. However, some of the provisions of the intended law run counter to the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution. The proposed amendment to Section 2 of UAPA criminalises the right to form associations by expanding the definition of person to include “an association of persons or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not”. The Standing Committee examining the Bill had opposed this clause on the grounds that “it gives leverage to the investigating officer and could lead to harassment.” The Bill criminalises the raising of funds “from legitimate or illegitimate source” and unnecessarily replicates crimes already covered under the IPC such as the “production and distribution” of “high quality counterfeit currency.” As they debate and vote on the Bill on Thursday, Rajya Sabha MPs must ask themselves if UAPA-2012 is not POTA by another name.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rethink-the-new-uapa/article4218425.ece
20,12,2012,The Japan pivot,"The December 16 election to the Diet’s lower chamber, the House of Representatives, has not only resulted in a decisive victory for Shinzo Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) but has also reopened several questions for Japan and the region. Although the LDP, with 294 seats, won an absolute majority, Mr. Abe plans to form a coalition with the smaller New Komeito Party. The outcome is a thumping defeat for the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), which had won 308 seats in August 2009, ending an LDP monopoly which had lasted all but 11 months of the previous 53 years. This time the DPJ won a mere 57 seats; struggling with an opposition majority in the upper house, the House of Councillors, it had lasted only three years of its four-year term. Mr. Abe’s immediate domestic task will be to revive an economy which has stagnated for years. Secondly, Japan’s exports have fallen in response to a strong yen, and the country has slipped to third place behind China among the world’s biggest economies. The incoming Prime Minister has proposed weakening the yen to stimulate exports. Though the money markets are nervous of direct central government action towards that end, Mr. Abe’s statements themselves may have helped cause the yen to slide by 6 per cent between early November and the election date. The LDP’s tendency towards high spending on public works will, however, be closely watched.
Internationally, Mr. Abe’s victory has had a mixed response. China, Japan’s biggest trading partner, has reacted angrily to his tough talk on the uninhabited but disputed Senkaku-Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea. Even before the election, Japan had started to abandon its post-war pacifism, holding joint naval exercises in Pacific and Asian waters and sending the Japan Self-Defense Forces to run a $2 million disaster training scheme for Cambodia and East Timor respectively. The LDP leader has also suggested constitutional amendments to give the military a bigger role, and he will probably reverse the previous government’s post-Fukushima decision to move away from nuclear power generation. For India, Mr. Abe’s election is likely to create a more favourable environment for civilian nuclear cooperation. Even as it prepares for a tighter embrace with a valued partner, New Delhi needs to guard against any renewed attempt by the Japanese side to overlay the bilateral relationship with strategic initiatives that might polarise Asia. At a time when Washington’s ‘Asia pivot’ has set the stage for accentuated power rivalry, the last thing the region needs is a revival of Mr. Abe’s earlier proposals for a ‘Quadrilateral’ linking Japan, the U.S., Australia and India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-japan-pivot/article4218426.ece
21,12,2012,King of his jungle,"There was never an iota of doubt about Narendra Modi being able to pull off a third straight Assembly election victory in Gujarat. In a State where Narendrabhai, or NaMo, as his frenzied fan following called him, was reputed to be master of all he surveyed, the verdict had necessarily to have a scripted feel to it. But the real issue at stake in these polls was not the electoral map of Gujarat but the political future of Mr. Modi. Egged on by pre-poll surveys and exit polls which gave him as many as 130 of 182 seats — more than the BJP’s best ever tally of 127, achieved in 2002 in the aftermath of the horrific anti-Muslim pogrom — the Chief Minister’s cheerleaders believed NaMo was on the cusp of national greatness. As it turned out, the party ended two short of 117 — the number of seats it won in 2007 and the magic figure that analysts believe Mr. Modi needed to cross to establish his invincibility and stake his claim to lead the BJP and consequently the National Democratic Alliance into the 2014 general election. To be sure, this statistical detail cannot detract from the larger story which is that Mr. Modi has joined the ranks of Mohanlal Sukhadia, Jyoti Basu, Sheila Dikshit and Naveen Patnaik in leading his party to victory in a State three times in a row. But by themselves raising the bar in the run up to the election, his supporters have weakened their hero’s claim to a leading role on the national stage.
By now it ought to be clear that Gujarat and Mr. Modi do not lend themselves to analyses that would hold true in other States. In 2007, the odds seemed stacked against the Chief Minister: Sonia Gandhi drew larger crowds, a sullen Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was unable to digest Mr. Modi’s transition from obedient pracharak to cult figure, and Gujarat’s officialdom was unresponsive. In the end, these proved to be no more than minor irritants for the man with a colossus-like presence on a landscape virtually bereft of opposition. As in 2007, this time too Mr. Modi stoked the fires of Gujarati asmita, treating the State’s “six crore” people — whom he had polarised in 2002 — as if they were an undifferentiated whole. However, not every Gujarati is willing to buy in to this kind of rhetoric; indeed, there are parts of rural Gujarat which do not at all relate to the development narrative that has become the stuff of folklore among Mr. Modi’s admirers. With no credible leader in its ranks, the Congress once again fared miserably. Unsurprisingly, the BJP rank-and-file is pushing Mr. Modi to take the long march to Delhi. It is a different matter that the party’s second rung — not to speak of its key allies — seems not too enthused by this project.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/king-of-his-jungle/article4222684.ece
21,12,2012,Mandate for change,"In politics, you sometimes owe your success to your opponent. The Congress returned to power in Himachal Pradesh on a strong negative vote against the Bharatiya Janata Party government of Prem Kumar Dhumal. Other than wait out the last five years, the party had done little to inspire confidence as an alternative. But the Dhumal government’s non-governance appears to have been enough for the Congress to win a comfortable majority in the Assembly election. From 1990, electors in Himachal Pradesh have voted out the incumbent in each election, replacing the BJP with the Congress and the Congress with the BJP. 2012 happens to be the turn of the Congress. Although the Congress campaign was managed by Virbhadra Singh, who is caught in a web of corruption charges, the overriding concern of the people seems to have been to vote out the Dhumal government. After a full term in power, the BJP carried out a negative campaign trying to blame the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre for all the miseries of the commoners. While attacking the Centre for the diesel price hike, and the cap on LPG cylinders for domestic use, Mr. Dhumal had little to show in terms of his own achievements. No ruling party can hope to retain power on a predominantly negative campaign. The BJP and Mr. Dhumal failed to see that the time to put the UPA government in the dock is the Lok Sabha election of 2014, and not the Assembly election of Himachal Pradesh. Not surprisingly, all the aggression of Mr. Dhumal could not hide his own weaknesses.
Given his clout within the Congress, and the fact that he led the campaign, Virbhadra Singh is the frontrunner for the post of Chief Minister. But if the Congress is keen on injecting vigour and vitality into the new government, it should look at alternatives to the septuagenarian. The success of the Congress had nothing substantial to do with the organisational abilities of Mr. Singh; the people had no real alternative in the current context. Mr. Singh, who was earlier Union Minister of Steel, resigned in June this year after a trial court in Himachal Pradesh framed charges of bribery and criminal misconduct against him and his wife Pratibha Singh. His name also figured in documents seized by Income Tax authorities in searches against the steel major, Ispat. Mr. Singh is yet to clear his name in these cases, and though he won with a huge margin in the Assembly election, he could soon turn a liability for the Congress. If Sonia Gandhi and the rest of the Congress high command do not want the party in Himachal Pradesh to go the way of the BJP, then change is the only option. After all, that is the essence of the present mandate.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mandate-for-change/article4222683.ece
22,12,2012,Caution is still the key,"The passage of the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill by both houses of Parliament has been welcomed by some, while others, including some bank trade unions, have opposed it vociferously. There is a strong case for evaluating the key provisions of the new legislation, both by themselves and perhaps more meaningfully in the context in which they have been enacted. At one level, there are a number of non-controversial features which were waiting to be given legal status for a long time. These include raising the voting rights of retail and minority investors in private sector banks to 26 per cent from 10 per cent. Prospective investors have for long asked for voting rights in proportion to their investments. The government has now met their demands at least half way. A 26 per cent shareholding is sufficient to block any special resolutions that might be detrimental to non-promoter shareholders. It is thus a blow for corporate governance. Foreign banks will now be allowed to convert their Indian operations into local subsidiaries or transfer shareholding to a separate holding company without paying stamp duty. That should facilitate their expansion in India. The new business organisation model they adopt would be easier to supervise by the Reserve Bank of India.
Even the much more widely discussed provisions that seek to give the RBI greater regulatory oversight over banks to overrule their boards under certain conditions and the ability to inspect the books of associate companies of promoter companies are not controversial. In fact, these are the powers that the RBI had sought before it could notify final guidelines for the issuance of new bank licences. Critics of the bank licensing policy, who fear that it is designed to favour a few corporates, say that with parliamentary approval, the RBI will have fewer grounds to resist government pressure. The Finance Minister’s clarification that many categories — public sector companies, leading non-banking finance companies, besides corporates — would be eligible and that the government will have very little say in the final selection is unlikely to silence critics. The track record of banks controlled by big business has been patchy and it is the cosy relationship between banks and their owners that was one of the main reasons cited for bank nationalisation in 1969. As in many countries, the regulation of financial conglomerates is becoming a big problem in India. It would be prudent for the RBI to frame the rules as tightly as it can to weed out undesirable applicants .Thereafter, it is a question of exercising its regulatory powers judiciously without fear or favour.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Caution-is-still-the-key/article12457560.ece
22,12,2012,Pollution indoors,"This public health issue goes back to Stone Age cave dwellings. Indoor pollution caused by cooking and heating with solid fuels, including biomass such as wood, dung, farm residue and coal, continues across the globe. Inefficient burning on an open fire or traditional stove creates a mix of pollutants, primarily carbon monoxide and total suspended particulates. While the World Health Organisation in 2009 estimated the number of deaths caused by this peril annually at two million, the just published Global Burden of Disease Study puts it at four million. The worst-hit are the poor — especially stay-at-home women and children. Women are three times more likely to suffer from serious ailments including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, compared to those who use other fuels. South-East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have been identified as the worst affected regions. In India, 74 per cent of the people use such fuels and these account for more than 80 per cent of household energy consumption. The consequences of some two million tonnes of biomass going up in smoke every day have implications for the environment. Owing to the inherent inefficiency of the process, the products of incomplete combustion include the potent greenhouse gas methane.
Until populations move up the ‘fuel ladder,’ effective solutions should be looked at. These include the use of cleaner fuels, stoves that are more thermal efficient, and provision of better ventilation for cooking areas. The problem cannot be addressed without looking at issues of women’s empowerment. The economic argument is as strong as the humanitarian one. The cleaner options include LPG, kerosene, and biogas. In the case of biogas, the experience so far has been a mixed one, but properly implemented, the technology has much potential. LPG is still way beyond the reach of many, and the rise in its price over the years is actually driving people back to traditional fuels. In India, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy launched the National Biomass Cookstove Initiative in December 2009, seeking to enhance the availability of clean and efficient energy. An R&D project was taken up to prepare an action plan for deployment of cookstoves. Earlier, under the National Programme of Improved Chulhas, some 15 million stoves were installed by 1994. But at the end of the day, much more remains to be done. Inefficient energy practices, which are but manifestations of energy poverty, are obstacles to development and progress. There is a need for innovative policy approaches. More resources need to be earmarked to develop appropriate technology options on this front. Such investment will save millions of lives and produce additional economic gains.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pollution-indoors/article4226643.ece
24,12,2012,The rage after the rape,"Caught as they were between the stony silence of an impassive government and the cynically simplistic demands of Opposition politicians for instant justice, it is hardly surprising that the leaderless crowds which spontaneously gathered at India Gate on Saturday and Sunday to protest the recent incident of rape in the Capital should have ended up in a violent skirmish with the police. Yes, lumpens looking for a scrap jumped in to take advantage and yes, the police did respond with mindless brutality against everyone present. But the primary responsibility for the turmoil surely lies with our national political leaders who simply lack the ability to understand and engage with a democratic upsurge from below, especially one that is not stratified by language, religion or caste. Confronted with the possibility of mass protest, the government on Saturday should have acted politically to assure the women of India that a serious national review of all legal issues surrounding rape, sexual assault and gender rights would be undertaken on a war-footing. Instead, its first and only instinct was to shut down the public transport system in Central Delhi and prepare for battle. When thousands of young women and men arrived at India Gate on Sunday having successfully evaded official attempts to restrict their movement, they found themselves face to face with a state apparatus that was not interested in a conversation.
Although arrests have been made after the gang rape incident and the government has promised a speedy trial, women in New Delhi and the rest of India do not feel any safer when stepping out of their homes. This is because they know that the official mindset has not changed. Instead of pushing the national debate in the direction of serious systemic reform, especially of law enforcement and justice delivery, a number of Opposition politicians have started an irresponsible debate on the need for the death penalty, or castration of rapists. These demands, which have had a populist echo amongst the protesters at India Gate, ignore the fact that shoddy investigation, poor forensics and misogynist attitudes among the police and even lower judiciary are the main reasons why rape victims in India do not get justice. The >editorial page article by Anup Surendranath today explains why castration is not a solution. As for the death penalty, making it mandatory for rape will make it more likely that a rapist kills his victim. A committee headed by Justice J.S. Verma has now been tasked with reviewing the legal position on aggravated sexual assault. What the government must do is to commit itself to implementing all its recommendations, including any on police and judicial reform, and not simply cherry pick those that are politically the most convenient.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-rage-after-the-rape/article4232544.ece
24,12,2012,Great hope for science,"The recent decision of the United Nations General Assembly to grant ‘Observer status’ for the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) is highly commendable. CERN is the first physical sciences research organisation to become an Observer. The development comes a year after CERN and the United Nations Office at Geneva signed a co-operation agreement. Founded in 1954 under the auspices of Unesco, the research organisation has till date lived up to the U.N. agency’s prime objective of international co-operation in the science and technology sphere. In fact, it has gone beyond its initial mission of restricting its co-operative activities to researchers from the “Allied countries and former Axis countries,” and has today taken on board other countries as members and observers, including India. It has become a benchmark for other large-scale science collaborative projects involving many countries. The fundamental difference between CERN and other international projects is that CERN’s activities go beyond the core area. Not widely known is the important digital library tools it has been sharing with several countries in Africa for empowering and changing the way people access information. The new status and global platform will help the organisation direct and set a course so science and technology will ultimately benefit people.
The U.N. decision comes at a most crucial time when proprietary science is proving to be a great stumbling block in making the fruits of basic scientific research available to all. The wall that divides basic and applied science is getting replaced with a thin line, with certain promising fields coming up at the “intersection of basic research and application.” Molecular biology is one such field. U.S. federal agencies, universities and pharmaceutical companies had to go to great lengths to free up the human genome sequence data generated by the privately-funded Craig Venter team. This is one contentious issue that CERN can probably try to tackle. It was at CERN that the World Wide Web was invented, and an early WWW was initially made available to the small community of high-energy physicists. It also played a central role in developing the Internet in Europe. Today, it has the CERN Easy Access IP through which it makes available some of its technologies “free of royalties,” provided they are developed to “benefit the economy and society.” The latest is its pioneering effort to make the entire field of high-energy physics open access through the Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics (SCOAP3) initiative.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/great-hope-for-science/article4232545.ece
25,12,2012,The man who stands alone,"Sachin Tendulkar ranks among four or five of the greatest batsmen to have played Test cricket. But in the one-day game, from which he retired on Sunday, he stands alone. Tendulkar might dispute the point himself, arguing that his idol, Sir Vivian Richards, was at least as great. Indeed the combination of Richards’s average (47) and strike-rate (90.20) is marginally superior, Tendulkar’s corresponding figures being 44.83 and 86.23. But the Indian did it for significantly longer, over a span of 463 matches, to the West Indian’s 187. Longevity is the most demanding test of greatness, for nothing escapes inquiry. And no one has succeeded at this test quite like Tendulkar. Curiously, the great man didn’t take to the one-day format as readily as he did to Test cricket: between 1989 and early 1994, when he batted in the middle-order, he averaged just over 31, his runs coming at the rate of 74 every 100 balls. It needed an accident — incumbent opener Navjot Singh Sidhu suffered a stiff neck in Auckland in March 1994 — to set a phenomenon in motion. Having convinced the team management that he should open, Tendulkar blitzed a match-winning 82 off just 49 balls. Neither he nor the one-day game was the same in India from that moment; the star and his stage were etched even deeper than before in the nation’s collective consciousness.
Tendulkar’s finest achievement was his finessing of one-day batting into a self-contained art form. Before him, there were, broadly, those who batted much like they did in Test cricket and those who had a ‘slog.’ Richards, Javed Miandad, and Dean Jones were exceptions; they introduced to their run-making, shades of pace — a quality that was seen in their Test play as well, but was employed more proactively in ODIs. Tendulkar expanded this quality and reinvented it constantly. In this way, he defied definition: during the course of an innings, he was several Tendulkars in one. He didn’t begin the trend of hitting the new ball over the top of the infield, but he adapted it in a manner that hadn’t been seen till then. He became a master at ticking it over in the middle overs, conserving energy for an onslaught in the final stages. But his genius lay in the nuance within this apparent template of ‘Attack, Consolidate, Attack’: he had great feel for an innings’ rhythm and the priceless ability to change it almost at will. Thus did he make 49 one-day centuries, one of them the game’s first double when he was very nearly 37. But runs to Tendulkar were only ever a means to winning. Little wonder that the World Cup triumph in 2011 is his most cherished one-day memory. Perhaps he should have retired from the format then; but the period since won’t tarnish a one-day career that appears impossible to surpass.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-man-who-stands-alone/article4235870.ece
25,12,2012,A ticking time bomb,"A recent large-scale study in adults aged 25 to 64 in 11 villages in Tamil Nadu has driven home a strong message — hypertension is growing at an alarming rate in rural areas. The prevalence of hypertension — one of the risk factors for a few non-communicable diseases — in the 10,500 adults studied was 21.4 per cent. Studies in other rural areas too have recorded a prevalence rate of nearly 20 per cent. A 2010 study of nearly 7,500 people in Thiruvananthapuram district found the risk factor prevalence in urban, rural and slum areas to be 34.9 per cent, 32.5 per cent and 30.6 per cent respectively. The study found the “high burden” of non-communicable disease risk factors — hypertension, cholesterol, abdominal obesity, and tobacco and alcohol use — was comparable with that of the U.S. The prevalence of hypertension has been steadily growing in the past 10 years, and the gap between urban and rural prevalence rates is narrowing sharply. For instance, a meta-analysis of studies published between 1995 and 2002 found only 15.7 per cent prevalence in the rural population. Little wonder that non-communicable diseases account for over 50 per cent of all deaths, and the disease burden continues to increase. As a paper in The Lancet indicated, India has already “passed the early stages of a chronic diseases epidemic.”
Unfortunately, the country lacks the basic comprehensive nationwide data on both behavioural and biological risk factors for non-communicable diseases. According to the World Health Organization, tobacco use and body mass index (BMI) were measured for the first time only in the 2005-2009 national survey. Though the quality of survey undertaken showed improvements over the previous period (2000-2004), there is much more to be done. If data collection is poor, implementation of cost-effective strategies to control and prevent risk factors is “low, particularly in rural areas.” Incidentally, many of the risk factors are collectively responsible for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, two of the high-burden non-communicable diseases. Controlling and preventing these risk factors will go a long way in reducing the overall non-communicable disease burden. Continuous messaging to get people tested for biological risks, which are asymptomatic, is essential — about 75 per cent of rural people studied in Tamil Nadu were unaware of their hypertension status. While it is worthy to note that Tamil Nadu has already started screening people for hypertension, the Centre must tackle the various facets of the growing epidemic with more urgency than it has shown so far.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-ticking-time-bomb/article12461703.ece
26,12,2012,Primary neglect,"The large number of unfilled vacancies in Primary Health Centres in many States is proof that any plan to provide universal health coverage in India is going to be a major challenge. Availability of human resources for health, be it doctors, nurses, or support staff, is far from optimal. In the WHO’s Global Atlas of the Health Workforce for 2010, India is 52 among 57 countries facing a critical HR crisis in health. A well-functioning health system should have at least 23 health workers per 10,000 people, while the statistic for India is 19. Even this national performance is not uniform, as the statistics on PHCs show. It is unconscionable that as per 2011 figures, some States have staggering levels of vacancies of doctors at the most basic access level. Chhattisgarh tops the list with 71 per cent; West Bengal, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Odisha and even Tamil Nadu have significant number of vacant doctor posts. These statistics strengthen the argument that many more medical and nursing colleges, and institutions for health worker training should be opened on a war footing. It is true that legislation in this regard is pending, and the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare has recently submitted its report. The Centre must now move forward through democratic consensus involving stakeholders.
The litany of human resource shortages is not peculiar to the PHCs. Vacant posts are found in the even more basic unit of Health Sub-Centres (HSCs), besides hospitals at higher levels. What this highlights is the patchy performance of the National Rural Health Mission in several States. Unfortunately, these States have failed to grasp the importance of PHCs and HSCs to reduce the country’s notorious maternal and infant mortality rates. Unless they act with determination, it will be impossible to achieve the growth in primary care so essential to cater to a much higher population just a decade from now. The Planning Commission’s High Level Expert Group on universal health coverage projects a need for 3.14 lakh HSCs (more than double the present number) and over 50,000 PHCs by 2022. To staff them with trained manpower, a robust plan to augment human resources must be pursued. Towards this end, the National Commission for Human Resources for Health Bill, 2011 provides an enabling framework. Yet, it can make progress only when all stakeholders, including the medical community and civil society, are agreed on the way forward. What is unarguable is the need for a rapid scaling up of training facilities for doctors, nurses and auxiliary workers, and filling up of vacancies in all States. Without this, universal health coverage cannot make much headway.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/primary-neglect/article4238626.ece
26,12,2012,More than one drop at a time,"In many ways, Pakistan’s battle against polio is a reflection of the nation’s struggle with itself; only its existential fight is more crippling. Pakistan had reduced the number of new polio cases to 30 in 2005 before it multiplied to 198 in 2011. The campaign suffered a severe setback after the discovery that it was a doctor in the anti-polio programme who had tracked down Osama bin Laden’s Abbottabad hideout for the CIA. Earlier this year, the Taliban sent out the cynical warning that there would be a ban on the anti-polio drive in North Waziristan until such time as the U.S. did not stop its drone attacks in the region. Even with all this, Pakistan managed to register an impressive 65 per cent drop in new cases this year. But last week’s killing of nine health workers involved in the national polio immunisation programme has delivered a body blow: it forced an early suspension of the campaign, leaving 3.5 million children dangerously uncovered. No coincidence, these killings were part of a series of attacks on the Pakistani state last week. First came the rocket attack on the airport-cum-military airbase at Peshawar, followed by the grenade attack on a Pakistan Air Force academy in Nowshera. The terrorists signed off the week by killing one of the most unrelenting voices against them, the Awami National Party’s Bashir Bilour. Each attack came with the threat of more but there is no pulling Pakistani decision-makers back from their ostrich-like behaviour. The terrorists know this and are pressing home their advantage.
The terrorists-as-strategic-assets policy remains in the ‘recycle bin’ of the security establishment, waiting to be ‘restored’. The political class has never been sure-footed in Pakistan and cannot be expected to summon the courage to take the decision to clean up the mess, especially ahead of elections and at a time when the security establishment-scripted narrative has created a warped mindscape. The liberal use of religion to ‘sanctify’ acts of terror has created a situation where even murder is easily justified. Worse, the solution is no longer as simple as targeting jihadi havens in frontier areas because, as the attacks on health workers have made clear, the Taliban are in the cities. That the conspiratorial canard against something as essential as the polio drop has spread so wide despite the government roping in clerics and ‘brotherly’ Saudi Arabia to sanctify it is instructive. The counter-offensive has to be multi-faceted because the enemy is no longer peripheral and has developed an ability to reincarnate itself in various forms and at places least expected. Tilting at the windmills is not an option.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/more-than-one-drop-at-a-time/article4238627.ece
27,12,2012,Brawling over policing,"Last weekend’s ugly attack on anti-rape protesters by the Delhi Police has sparked off an extraordinary public brawl between Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit and the city’s police commissioner, Neeraj Kumar. Delhi’s citizens might have been forgiven for hoping the heads of the two institutions would be working together to ensure the security of the city’s women. Ms Dikshit has demanded that Mr. Kumar and other senior officers be sacked; Mr. Kumar, for his part, has made clear his disdain for the Chief Minister’s complaints. The reason behind Ms Dikshit’s fury isn’t a mystery. Not for the first time, the Chief Minister has found herself carrying the can for the actions of a police force over which she has no control. Though Delhi became a State in 1993, its Commissioner of Police reports to the Lieutenant-Governor, not the Chief Minister. The LG, in turn, is the representative of the Centre, which appoints him. The police was ordered by the Union Home Ministry to clear the India Gate area of all protesters —evidently because of its desire to host Russia’s President, Vladimir Putin, at Hyderabad House. Ms Dikshit and her party, unlike the bureaucrats who took that decision, have to answer to the city’s citizens for the atrocious manner in which the police went about clearing the area.
The dispute over who ought to run the Delhi Police is an old one. The State Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party have both sought, for years, for the Delhi government to take control of the force. At least seven resolutions have been passed in the legislative assembly, with the support of all parties, seeking full statehood. The national leadership of both major parties, when in power, has however been equally dogged in its resistance to the idea. The Union Home Ministry points out, with some justification, that many state police forces are victims of political partisanship, and thus far more dysfunctional than their Delhi counterparts. The real question, though, isn’t which branch of the executive ought to have control of the police — it is how to make the force accountable to citizens. In its landmark 2006 orders in the Prakash Singh case, the Supreme Court laid down a series of seven recommendations to that end. Most States have dragged their feet on implementing the court’s plan. In Delhi, some elements of reform have been implemented but in too half-hearted a manner. And fresh legislation on the anvil will make the police less accountable than it already is. Instead of sparring over turf, the Central and Delhi governments could make a real contribution by implementing the police reforms recommended by the Supreme Court as a first step towards giving not just India’s Capital, but the country, the police it deserves.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/brawling-over-policing/article4242101.ece
27,12,2012,New battle in Sri Lanka,"What is it with South Asia’s strongmen and top judges? Only five years ago General Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan found he had bitten off more than he could chew when he tried to sack Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary. Now President Mahinda Rajapaksa wants Sri Lanka’s Chief Justice out, but like her Pakistani counterpart, Shirani Bandaranayake is determined to fight it out. The chances of her emerging victorious seem slim but the battle is sure to roil the country’s institutions, and put to test Sri Lanka’s Constitution like never before. The statute empowers the President to remove a judge after an impeachment motion is carried by a simple majority in Parliament. For Mr. Rajapaksa, whose United People’s Freedom Alliance enjoys a two-thirds majority, the numbers are not the problem. A resolution, which lists 14 charges of misconduct by the Chief Justice, and has been duly signed by one-third of the parliamentarians, will be debated in January. A parliamentary select committee has already pronounced her guilty of three charges. But instead of meekly stepping down, Ms Bandaranayake has challenged in the Court of Appeal the legal authority of a parliamentary committee to investigate the Chief Justice. Indicating that prima facie she has a case, the court has sent notices to the PSC members.
While not outright staying the impeachment process, the appeal court has advised Parliament from going ahead with it until the case is decided. In addition to the challenge to its authority, the parliamentary committee is also under fire for not following due process. The committee acted in violation of the rules of natural justice by not giving Ms Bandaranayake time to defend herself, as her petition alleges. The conduct of the committee members too was anything but parliamentary. They taunted the country’s first judge as a “mad woman” and used sexist words to address her. The stand-off has lent weight to the criticism that the Rajapaksa regime does not take well to dissent. While the truth behind the charges against the Chief Justice is to be established, what is known is that the Supreme Court had given several judgments this year that went against the government. The tipping point was the ruling against a Bill that undermined provincial authority. The Bill was challenged, among others, by the Tamil National Alliance as it went against the government’s promise of more autonomy to the Tamil region. It can only be hoped that the impeachment battle is sorted out without the weakening of institutions or of democratic and political processes — the last thing a country with an unresolved and urgent ethnic question needs.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/new-battle-in-sri-lanka/article4242131.ece
28,12,2012,Modi and friends,"Narendra Modi has his admirers. Not only among the people of Gujarat who voted him to power for a third term, but also among the high and mighty in the rest of India. While the Assembly election demonstrated his strength in Gujarat, the swearing-in ceremony showcased his influence and acceptability among top politicians in the Bharatiya Janata Party, some of the constituents of the National Democratic Alliance, and some outsiders like the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Although the Modi camp could not persuade Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and other leaders of the Janata Dal (United), a key partner in the NDA, to attend the swearing-in, the presence of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and AIADMK leader Jayalalithaa more than made up for that failure. Mr. Modi and Ms Jayalalithaa have become personal friends outside of politics too, and her attendance is by no means an indication of her willingness to ally with the BJP. But for Mr. Modi, this was part of his national brand-building, an attestation of his acceptability as prime ministerial material. Although he is the front-runner for the top job within the BJP, the party cannot afford to project anyone not acceptable to the NDA and to other prospective allies. Post-2002, parties such as the Biju Janata Dal and the JD (U) have been uncomfortable with the Modi variety of Hindutva. While the BJD is now out of the NDA, JD (U) leaders have kept their distance from the Gujarat Chief Minister. The proximity with Ms Jayalalithaa was for Mr. Modi proof that he had found acceptability beyond Gujarat and among potential allies of the BJP.
All the same, in Tamil Nadu, the truth is that the BJP needs the AIADMK more than the AIADMK needs the BJP. Without doubt, Ms Jayalalithaa sees herself as firmly in the anti-Congress camp, as was evident again at the National Development Council meeting, where she staged a walk-out accusing the Centre of stifling the voice of Chief Ministers who were in the opposition after she was not allowed to speak beyond the allotted time. However, for tactical reasons, the AIADMK might not enter into an alliance with the BJP prior to the 2014 election, and will likely keep its options open for post-poll bargaining. A friend she certainly is, but there are clear limits to the extent to which Mr. Modi can use his proximity with Ms Jayalalithaa for the advancement of his own career. Political alliances are not built on the basis of friendships. Hard-nosed electoral calculations that factor in the prevailing contingencies will eventually decide the shape and size of the NDA in 2014, and not the attendance list at Mr. Modi’s swearing-in ceremony.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/modi-and-friends/article4245955.ece
28,12,2012,Gaming the system,"The Sahara Group, or Pariwar, as it likes to be called, is no stranger to skirmishes with financial sector regulators. The most recent case involves a massive mobilisation of over Rs.24,000 crore allegedly from lakhs of investors through an unauthorised issue of optionally fully-convertible debentures (OFCD) via two group companies. When the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) held the OFCD issue illegal some 14 months back and asked the Pariwar to return the money, the latter went to court questioning the capital market regulator’s jurisdiction. Successive failures did not deter Sahara from appealing to the Supreme Court. On August 31, a two-member bench upheld the SEBI order and set stiff timelines for returning the money and supplying information on those who had bought the debentures. However, on December 5, a three-member bench of the Supreme Court headed by the Chief Justice gave unexpected relief to Sahara when the company asked for more time to pay back its depositors. Even though the new bench retained the deadline that had been set earlier for the furnishing of depositor information, it gave the Pariwar time till February 2014 to make repayments in instalments.
This apparent softening of stance at the highest levels of the judiciary is just one of those inexplicable happenings that has given Sahara an air of invincibility in relation to financial sector regulators and allowed it to retain its opaque ways. The Pariwar’s connections across the political spectrum are frequently talked about. Its head, Subroto Roy, is close to the Samajwadi Party but also turned up at Narendra Modi’s swearing-in ceremony as Chief Minister of Gujarat on Wednesday. In the latest case, neither the Finance Minister nor any political leader of stature has commented on the enormous sums raised by the company through illegal channels without so much as lip service to KYC (know your customer) norms. Not surprisingly, the Pariwar continues to defy authority. Days after the Supreme Court order, it claimed its actual liability is only a fraction of what was estimated by SEBI. Market reports speak of group representatives ‘encouraging’ debenture holders to shift their investments to other businesses promoted by Sahara. That way it can claim repayment while getting to keep the money and shifting it to a less onerous regulatory jurisdiction. Among the important lessons to be learnt by regulators from this episode is that any loophole that allows a group like Sahara to shop around for a favourable regulator needs to be plugged. Secondly, regulators like the RBI and SEBI need to exchange information with one another. With all that, it will still require a lot of political will to check the Sahara Pariwar and its imitators.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Gaming-the-system/article12465221.ece
29,12,2012,Words that wound,"His image irreparably dented, Abhijit Mukherjee has painted himself into a wretched and abject corner. The apology by the Congress MP and son of President Pranab Mukherjee, however, is hardly going to make amends for his monumental folly. What he said about the women who protested against the brutal gang rape of the 23-year-old in Delhi cannot be explained away with the usual disclaimers — that it was said in jest, that it was taken out of context, or that it was a throwaway remark open to misinterpretation. His shocking comments — describing female protesters as “painted” and “dented” women, suggesting that they hopped fashionably from discotheques to street demonstrations — were in the nature of an extended and deliberate commentary that he offered on not one but two separate occasions. His insincere apology does little to erase the sexist nature of his remarks. In July this year, when Abhijit began lobbying for the Congress ticket for Jangipur — the seat his father vacated — this newspaper counselled in an editorial against treating constituencies as an inheritance. “The Lok Sabha is not for him yet”, we wrote. (“ >Descent of the Republic, July 25, 2012). The correctness of that assessment has been proved today by Mr. Mukherjee’s own words.
Sadly, Mr. Mukherjee is not the only public figure to be caught nursing regressive and gender discriminatory views in the aftermath of the recent gang rape incident. Another West Bengal politician, Anisur Rahaman of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), put his clumsy foot into his wide open mouth by making a personal and deeply offensive remark against Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee while criticising the limitations of a policy that allegedly does little more than compensate rape victims financially. Earlier this week, Andhra Pradesh Congress president Botcha Satyanarayana dismissed the rape as a “small incident” and said women shouldn’t go out during the late hours. The irony of these backward comments is that a horrific assault which highlighted the failure of the state to ensure the physical security of a citizen is being used by politicians as an excuse to further dominate, control and regulate the lives of women. Once made, these misogynist statements are invariably withdrawn in the face of public outrage but no action is ever taken by senior party leaders against the offending legislators or party men. In a society where crimes against females are rampant, proper legislation and implementation of laws are paramount. But it is also extremely important to change social attitudes towards women. Going by the remarks made over the last few days, we need to start at the very top — with the very people who seek to govern us.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/words-that-wound/article4249634.ece
29,12,2012,Endgame in Telangana,"Statehood for Telangana is too contentious an issue to yield to random consensus-building exercises. Major political parties and large sections of the people of Andhra Pradesh are divided on geographic lines on the question of bifurcation of the State, and any solution would have to involve climbdowns and compromises. In the absence of any structured dialogue engaging the various stakeholders, all-party meetings called by the Centre have resulted only in the reiteration of known positions. After another all-party meeting on Friday, Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde did not do much more than promise to take a decision on Telangana within a month. But importantly, he indicated that there would not be another all-party meeting on this issue. The time for negotiations and consensus-building is over; the stage is set for a solution imposed from above. By now, the Centre must have realised that buying time will not work even as a short-term tactic. With patience wearing thin among pro-Telangana protesters, some forward movement would have to be made within the next month if the statehood agitation is not to escalate further. But given that the Centre’s decision-making on the Telangana issue is almost entirely based on the political calculations of the Congress, nothing more than an in-principle acceptance of the statehood demand is likely in the near future.
Left to itself, the Congress would like to let matters drift till 2014 when elections to both the Lok Sabha and the State Assembly are due. Sure, there is no solution that would please everyone, but that is no reason to delay a decision on an issue over which a large number of people in the Telangana region have been organising protests and agitations affecting normal life. The Congress knows that a decision to carve out a separate Telangana would alienate many people in Coastal Andhra and other parts of Andhra Pradesh, and also that any further delay would fuel anger among those in the thick of the statehood campaign. The tactic of holding out hope for a separate State without actually conceding it cannot yield political dividends any longer. Of course, the Congress is not the only party indulging in doublespeak over the issue. While the Telangana Rashtra Samiti, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Communist Party of India have been unequivocally pro-Telangana, and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen have been openly against the bifurcation, the Telugu Desam Party and the YSR Congress have been ambiguous on this issue. Politics is all about taking a stand and parties would do well to realise it is impossible to be all things to all people.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/endgame-in-telangana/article4249636.ece
30,12,2012,No turning back now,"The 23-year-old student whose struggle against sexual assault, rape and death shone a harsh light deep into the ugly, rotting interior of our society is no more. But like Byron’s young woman “too soon returned to earth,” her extinguished life-star shines fiercely as it shoots along the sky, and it is up to us – as a people, as women, and as men — to fix the fractures and fissures it illuminates in the process. The government and political class would like to have speedy closure by ensuring the “maximum punishment” for the men who grievously assaulted the woman inside a bus as it sped along one of Delhi’s busiest roads. Punished they must be. But even if the six are hanged, and even if our legislators, in a fit of conveniently misplaced concern, prescribe the death penalty for rape, the pathology we are dealing with will not be so easily remedied. If anything, the past week has shown how so many of the framers and implementers of the law in India are themselves complicit in the very culture of patriarchy that produces, sanctions and makes excuses for violence against women. Their complicity lies not just in the foul statements we have heard but in the silences and compromises of senior politicians and officials who have presided over the multiple organ failure of the Indian state, a failure which denies security and justice to women across the country.
Laws to deal with rape and sexual assault exist but not the police, judiciary and leaders to work them. It is this leaderless vacuum that ordinary citizens must step into in order to affirm the rights of women. The right to be born and fed, and to study; the right to work and live with dignity, the right to dress and travel and love as they please. Of course, those who rule are not ready to accept such an affirmation. That is why a police blockade of Rajpath — the road whose very name symbolises rulership — was imposed within hours of the young woman’s death. There are specific steps — administrative, pedagogic, cultural — that must be taken to prevent sexual assault and rape. But there is a wider question: Would the Indian political system and class have been so indifferent to the problem of sexual violence if half or even one-third of all legislators were women? The Congress and the Opposition should forget about playing to the gallery. If they are serious about the rights of women, they should quickly pass the Women’s Reservation Bill. Let the presence of at least 181 female MPs in the next Lok Sabha — and the political mobilisation of women this will slowly catalyse — be Parliament’s way of honouring the death of the Unknown Citizen.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-turning-back-now/article4253692.ece
31,12,2012,Public toilets for our cities,"Linfen in China offers a significant lesson to Indian cities. It convincingly shows that simple, but vital things such as public toilets are as critical as any large infrastructure project to make cities liveable. For long, Linfen was one of the worst cities in the world to live in. But, in the last four years, it has turned around dramatically, improved living conditions and recently won the UN-Habitat's international best practice award for the Asia and Pacific region. At the core of Linfen’s revival and the reason for worldwide attention is the ‘toilet revolution’ that began in 2008. Concerned by the poor quality and numbers of public toilets — only 12 of them for a population of 600,000 — the local government constructed and retrofitted 200 toilets in and around the city. Smart design has changed people’s perceptions and about 20 million use them every year. In contrast, Indian cities, which are grossly underprovided in terms of public toilets, have not shown any urgency to improve the situation. For example, Chennai, which needs about 6000 public toilets, has only 714, and Nagpur, which needs more than 3000 toilets, has 318. Even the existing ones are poorly maintained, badly located and hardly used. This persisting neglect has led to woeful sanitary conditions.
Providing toilets to the 15 million urban households that do not have them is a priority. Equally important is to provide toilets in public places. They are an integral part of the civic amenities and those who actively use the city need them. Organisations such as Sulabh International have done well to build low-cost and easy to maintain toilets, but they are constructed more to address the problem of inadequate toilet numbers at the household level. What is needed is a scaled up and concerted effort to improve the status of public toilets. Designs have to radically change and turn this everyday public amenity to an object of civic pride. Anti-vandal fittings, enhanced safety measures and aesthetically pleasing colours combined with better location, good maintenance and recycling of resources would help meet this objective. An inclusive city begins with the public toilet. There should be ‘potty parity’ — sufficient numbers of toilets for women users — and special needs for the disabled must be accommodated. Local bodies should compel all road building and civic projects to allocate space for this purpose. They could also try innovative schemes such as the one practised in the United Kingdom, where the government pays private establishments to keep their toilets open for public use. The health of a city is inextricably linked to its toilets and it is imperative to provide them in sufficient numbers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/public-toilets-for-our-cities/article4256374.ece
31,12,2012,Egypt’s strength in adversity,"The draft Egyptian constitution has been passed with a 64 per cent vote in favour in a two-round referendum, which was held on 15 and 22 December, but has resolved few of the questions the country faces. The draft was written mainly by President Mohamed Morsy’s Islamist allies in the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) and its parent body, the Muslim Brotherhood, on a 100-member panel convened after the Supreme Constitutional Court had dissolved the elected constituent assembly in April on the grounds that it contained too many Islamists; both liberals and Copts had left the panel, saying the draft document was excessively Islamist. The referendum does not confirm the public support the raw figures imply, as turnout among the 52 million registered voters was only 32.9 per cent, and voters even in Cairo complained of irregularities, such as inadequate judicial supervision and attempts by poll staff to influence voters. In 10 governorates, the first-round “yes” vote was 54 per cent, but this increased to 72 per cent in the second round; the opposition National Salvation Front (NSF) alleges fraud, which the government denies. The NSF also contends that the low turnout undermines the legitimacy of the referendum and Mr. Morsy’s credibility, even though the President now loses his power to appoint judges and has to accept nominations from the judiciary. In addition, the newly-approved constitution transfers legislative power from the President to the upper house, the 270-member Shura Council, until a new lower chamber or People’s Assembly is elected, but opposition suspicions are deepened by the President’s power to appoint up to 90 Shura members.
The country’s problems are compounded by a slumping economy. Furthermore, the millions in deep poverty have been bitterly disappointed by the lack of economic improvement since the dictator Hosni Mubarak was deposed in February 2011. While some liberal fears may be exaggerated — the Islamist vote in the referendum is only 15 per cent of the electorate — old attitudes may only worsen things. There has been no reform of a notoriously corrupt and brutal police; ominously, the military warn that they will not let Egypt be dragged into a “dark tunnel”, and the judiciary see themselves not as public servants but as guardians of the public interest who are above accountability. Therefore, without a constitution which has widespread public assent, none of the major political actors can know their way about. Yet all these travails amount to what the Arab political scientist Larbi Sadiki calls reconstitution through public engagement. That is Egypt’s great strength.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/egypts-strength-in-adversity/article4256376.ece
1,1,2013,On shaky foundation,"The draft of the 12th Five Year Plan covering the period 2012-13 to 2016-17, approved by the National Development Council last week, aims to achieve an annual average growth rate of 8 per cent, scaled down from 8.2 per cent. The Prime Minister has called the target “aspirational,” while a few Chief Ministers, notably Narendra Modi, found it lacking in ambition. Political statements apart, it is clear that the focus on growth rates has tended to distract attention from the rest of the planning exercise. In retrospect, most official projections have been over-optimistic. The approach paper of the 12th Plan talked of an annual average growth rate of between 9 and 9.5 per cent. The Prime Minister had gone even further, hoping for double-digit growth rates during the latter part of the Plan. What made those projections totally unrealistic was the fact that the economic slowdown was already getting reflected in successive quarterly GDP data. The Union Budget (2012) projected an ambitious growth rate of 7.6 per cent, way above what most other forecasters had estimated at that time. The government has been slow in lowering the forecasts even when conclusive evidence of deceleration has been coming in. True to form, the government expects the economy to grow by between 5.7 and 5.9 per cent this year — the first year of the 12th Plan — when the growth during the first half has been at just 5.4 per cent. Considering that a revival in manufacturing where the slowdown is most pronounced cannot happen that quickly, an annual average rate of 8 per cent over the plan period can be achieved only if the growth rate in each of the last three years is well above 9 per cent.
The Planning Commission is banking on reinvigorating a few existing policies while expecting vastly improved performance in certain key areas: gross fixed capital formation rate to go up to 35 per cent from the present 32 per cent, with the private sector playing a major role in catalysing such investment; a new look industrial policy that focuses on better coordination between the government and the private sector to vastly improve business sentiment; stressing the importance of national industrial manufacturing zones in a scheme of reviving industrial output. More controversial are suggestions to “streamline” labour laws by increasing the threshold employment for labour legislation to 300. The case for increasing agricultural growth to 4 per cent largely through technology absorption is unexceptionable. Yet all these and more may not be sufficient to achieve an annual growth rate of 8 per cent. Since any likely shortfall will reflect adversely on the planning process itself, the question then is: is the obsessive focus on growth rates counterproductive?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/on-shaky-foundation/article4259666.ece
1,1,2013,France leads the tax debate,"The December 28 decision by the French constitutional court, the Conseil Constitutionnel, that President François Hollande’s showpiece 75 per cent income tax for high earners is unfair and therefore unconstitutional may look like a severe political setback, but when examined more closely turns out not to be quite that. The court rejected the tax, which would have affected all with an annual income above €one million, because French income tax is levied on households and not individuals, so it would not apply, for example, to a couple each of whom earns €900,000 but would apply to any individual earning a million euros or more. Only about 1,500 people would have had to pay the new rate, which was due to take effect today and was expected to raise €500 million in a crucial contribution to Mr. Hollande’s plans to reduce the budget deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by 2014. One high-profile opponent is actor Gérard Depardieu, who says he now plans to move to Belgium, apparently for tax reasons, and has responded to Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault’s criticism of his move as “shabby” with an angry open letter claiming that the Socialist government is punishing success and talent.
Mr. Depardieu’s position has, however, been criticised by, for example, the award-winning actor Philippe Torreton, who says that the move amounts to leaving the French boat in the middle of a storm. Unemployment, at 3 million, is at a 15-year high and has crossed 10 per cent after rising for 16 months in succession; the French central bank estimates an economic shrinkage of 0.1 per cent in the third quarter of 2012. Much of the public argument among artists and other celebrities is focused on the division between those who see paying the higher rate as a patriotic duty and those who consider it an unfair imposition, but the court decision itself has been made by a largely conservative-appointed court, which also includes three former presidents ex officio, all of whom are also conservatives. That fact will add fuel to the political flames, not least because in August 2011, 16 of France’s wealthiest people, including the L’Oréal heiress Liliane Bettencourt and several major chief executives, published an open letter in the magazine Le Nouvel Observateur calling for higher taxes on the rich as a matter of national solidarity in a time of economic crisis. Mr. Hollande and his government plan to revise the tax proposal and reintroduce it, but whatever the outcome, France is leading the way by showing that tax rates are about the nature of society and not just about technical issues.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/france-leads-the-tax-debate/article4259667.ece
2,1,2013,From bad times to worse,"Except perhaps Kingfisher itself, nobody expected the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to renew its Air Operator Permit (AOP), which lapsed on December 31. DGCA was evidently not impressed by the Rs. 650 crore revival package that the defunct airline submitted to revive its operating licence and restart flights in a limited way. Kingfisher also failed to furnish the No Objection certificates from the service providers, including the Airports Authority of India (AAI), to which the airline owes money. The service providers had told the DGCA not to renew the permit unless their dues were settled. The airline has not settled staff salaries either; it was the strike by the employees last October that grounded Kingfisher and led to the suspension of its licence. The loss of the permit need not necessarily mean the end of the road. The airline can get its licence renewed within two years, but it must meet all the conditions and come up with a viable turnaround plan. Kingfisher has run up a loss of over Rs. 8,000 crore, and in order to renew the licence, the DGCA has to first be convinced that the airline has a sustainable future.
For its Rs. 650 crore capital infusion plan, Kingfisher had suggested induction of funds from the UB group. This because banks already have an exposure of about Rs. 7,500 crore and are certain not to consider extending any more credit to the airline, which also owes the AAI some Rs. 250 crore. The aircraft leasing companies are also waiting to collect their dues, outstanding for a while. That leaves hardly a handful of aircraft with the airline to resume operations, and these too have to be readied for operations and certified to be airworthy. Where is Kingfisher going to find the funds to pay the salaries of employees, the dues of the service providers, the cost of repairing and overhauling its aircraft, and then generate working capital to operate its flights to a given, limited schedule? Aside from Vijay Mallya himself, the only other option is an overseas investor. Last fortnight, there was talk of an imminent deal with a foreign airline but it appears that it was all just that — talk. The prospective partner has failed to materialise. Kingfisher has also to contend with the loss of credibility among passengers. Over the years, the airline had consciously built up a brand value — ‘fly the good times’ — but to restore that feel good sentiment in the travelling public might take quite a while, if at all it is even possible. Given the present political climate, the growing emphasis on safety, and the tough positions taken by both the Union Civil Aviation Ministry and the DGCA, it does seem unlikely that Kingfisher will be able to revive its operations anytime soon.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/from-bad-times-to-worse/article4262646.ece
2,1,2013,Revving up on ethanol,"In the National Policy on Biofuels announced in 2008, the Government of India mandated phased implementation of a programme of ethanol blending with petrol. Lack of resolve on the part of the government to enforce the decision that it has since announced over and over again is the only reason that can be cited for the inertia on this front. Last heard, the government had postponed the deadline for the nationwide roll-out from December 1, 2012 to June 1, 2013. The government having cleared the import of the commodity, the public sector oil marketing companies were reported to be moving jointly to float a Rs. 3,500-crore global tender to source ethanol. The annual requirement is estimated to be about 1,000 million litres for a pan-India roll-out of 5 per cent blended petrol, which is already available in some States. While getting started at 5 per cent has been such a slog for India, countries like the United States now have established ‘doping’ programmes that involve up to 20 per cent ethanol.
India stands to save a huge amount of foreign exchange through the blending programme, provided it gets ethanol at a viable price. There is also an environment dividend. Unlike in the case of ethanol derived from food crops such as corn, which could have an adverse impact on prices, as it happens in the U.S., India’s ethanol source is sugarcane. It ought to follow the example of Brazil, 51 per cent of whose fuel market is made up by sugar-based ethanol, making it the leading biofuel exporter and the second biggest producer after the U.S. Ethanol production in India was expected to rise by 29 per cent to 2.1 billion litres in 2012 in a year of high sugar production, therefore higher production of molasses, from which ethanol is made. Domestic ethanol consumption rose by 4.5 per cent to 2.08 billion litres. However, only an estimated 400 million litres were available to be blended with petrol. The liquor industry’s insatiable appetite for ethanol is responsible, and powerful interests that push for better price yields are having a field day. Even as ethanol imports at reasonable prices are allowed to balance demand and supply and stabilise prices, the OMCs and ethanol producers should reach a consensus on a pricing formula that is mutually beneficial in the long term. If this does not happen, the government ought to consider an intervention to mandatorily channel a certain percentage of indigenously produced ethanol for a requirement that is clearly in the national interest. States should also cooperate by easing regulations. Meanwhile, sufficient lead time should be given to the auto industry to carry out engine and other modifications to make vehicles compatible with still higher levels of blended fuel.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/revving-up-on-ethanol/article4262648.ece
3,1,2013,"Sex, violence and punishment","By coming out with a heady combination of concrete proposals and tough actions, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa has put herself in the forefront of the national debate on dealing with rape, and the issues of prevention and punishment. Harsher punishment and speedier conviction as modes of deterrence constitute the key features of her 13-point plan for ending sexual violence and securing justice for rape victims. Among the most noteworthy of her points is the decision to set up fast-track Mahila courts in each district to deal with sexual crimes against women. This, coupled with day-to-day trials, could guard against rape cases dragging on indefinitely, sapping the energy of victims, and destroying their will to fight for justice. Too often, the ordeal they undergo as they help in the investigation and participate in the trial prompts victims to give up their fight midway. Enlisting women investigators and prosecutors, as envisaged in the Chief Minister’s plan, could ease some of the psychological trauma of the victims. Ms Jayalalithaa also announced a set of procedures that would enable monitoring of rape cases by senior police officers. For seeing the cases through right until the ends of justice are met, it is important to fix responsibility at the highest levels of officialdom. Likewise, installation of CCTV cameras in public buildings, launch of a helpline for women in distress, and additional security in malls and women’s colleges are all good initiatives.
While coming up with these thoughtful measures, it is unfortunate that Ms Jayalalithaa could not resist yielding to the calls for the death penalty and chemical castration of offenders. Rape is sexual violence of the most brutal kind, and those who advocate chemical castration are obviously seeing it as an act of sex rather than as an act of violence. If a criminal is deemed so potentially violent that chemical castration is needed to prevent repeat offences, what is the guarantee that he would not resort to other forms of physical violence against women? As a deterrent too, there is no reason why it should work any better than death penalty, and there is enough evidence that death penalty hardly works as a deterrent. As for amendments to Central laws such as raising the one-time remand period from 15 days to 30 days, these need to be debated thoroughly in the context of their possible misuse by law-enforcing authorities. Also, it remains to be seen whether the inclusion of rape in the Goondas Act, which would result in preventive one-year detention without bail, survives a legal challenge since this too is fraught with the potential for misuse.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sex-violence-and-punishment/article4266035.ece
3,1,2013,The stress is showing,"The challenges policymakers face in managing the external economy have been increasing recently in the face of a marked deterioration in several leading sectoral indicators. Two sets of data released by the Reserve Bank of India and the Finance Ministry at the end of last year show the extent of deterioration. The RBI’s report on India’s balance of payments during the second quarter (July-September 2012) pegs the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP at an unprecedented 5.4 per cent, up from 4.2 per cent a year ago. The widening merchandise trade deficit — the fall in exports being greater than the fall in imports — compared to the previous year is one obvious reason. India’s exports have been declining month after month, as the prospects of a revival in the principal markets of the developed world have not improved. Imports of two commodities, gold and petroleum, have remained sticky and account for a substantial portion of the imbalance. Various measures adopted by the government and the RBI to curb the demand for gold have had limited success. Past experience suggests that measures such as physical controls will be counterproductive and encourage illegal trade. One promising route, though relevant only for the long term, is to popularise gold-based financial products to wean away consumers from their old preference for gold.
The widening trade deficit is obviously not the only problem. Growth in private transfers, notably remittances, has been weak, increasing by just 2.9 per cent in the second quarter of 2012-13 compared to over 20 per cent in the corresponding period last year. In the past, these and earnings from software exports have cushioned the trade deficit. Their marginal growth has once again exposed the external sector to a dangerous dependence on short-term inflows from foreign institutional investors and portfolio managers who can exit just as easily as they have been coming in recently. Mistaken government policies are partly responsible for the big jump in India’s external debt to $365.20 billion as at end-September, up by nearly $20 billion from a quarter earlier. The Finance Ministry report attributes the increase to higher non-resident Indian (NRI) deposits, short-term debt and external commercial borrowings. In the past, the authorities have actually discouraged these forms of financing, in fact providing disincentives. More recently however, won over by expediency, a short-sighted government has veered to the other extreme, for instance assuring NRIs of high returns and reducing the withholding tax on external borrowings. The sharp rise in short-term foreign currency debt is an ominous development. Bunched up repayments will pose a serious threat to macroeconomic stability in the future.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-stress-is-showing/article4266040.ece
4,1,2013,An antidote for pure poison,"Rival religious extremists survive by feeding off each other. In India, Hindutva and Islamist leaders and activists have often mobilised men and materials through inflammatory hate speeches. But by any yardstick, the recent rabble-rousing speech of Akbaruddin Owaisi, leader of the Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen in the Andhra Pradesh Assembly, plumbs new depths. In substance, his speech was a clear attempt to promote enmity between Hindus and Muslims, and disrupt the fragile peace in tension-filled Hyderabad to the political benefit of himself and his party. Now that the courts have directed the police to register a criminal case, the judiciary will have the final word on the legality of his vicious remarks. One thing is certain, however. Civil society needs to make it clear that those who incite hatred and violence against people on the basis of their religion or any other identity ought to be punished one way or another. If the police or courts won’t prosecute, convict and send them to jail, such would-be ‘leaders’ must be boycotted socially and politically.
In his rant, Mr. Owaisi used a clever trick: he first attacked the Hindutva outfits and leaders for their actions, and then proceeded to equate all Hindus with these extremist elements. This was akin to the Hindutva extremist line of holding the whole Muslim community responsible for Islamist terror. The threat of physical violence implicit in his speech attracts Section 153-A of the Indian Penal Code. To the discredit of the MIM, other leaders, most notably the party’s Member of Parliament Asaduddin Owaisi, Akbaruddin’s elder brother, have not uttered a word of reproach against this hate speech. However, Mr. Owaisi is not the first person to thumb his nose at the laws of the land through hate-filled, incendiary utterances. VHP leader Praveen Togadia, the late Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray, and BJP leader Varun Gandhi are prominent among the many in the Hindutva parivar to have made hate speeches. Of these, the case against Mr. Gandhi is proceeding slowly; otherwise, as in Hyderabad, where the police acted only after the courts received private complaints, the law enforcing authorities prefer not to touch these extremists citing, as an excuse, the threat that their organisations will unleash violence in the event of an arrest. In effect, the law in India is often reduced to a political tool that is applied selectively. Police inaction in previous cases is, however, no reason to be lenient in the present instance. Mr. Owaisi has crossed the line with the pure poison he served up. India, Andhra Pradesh and Hyderabad cannot afford a spiral of incitements to violence. He must be made an example of.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-antidote-for-pure-poison/article4269934.ece
4,1,2013,Between a rock & the Republicans,"Voting on New Year’s Day for the first time in 62 years, the United States House of Representatives has passed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the so-called fiscal cliff bill) by 257 votes to 167, accepting the version which the Senate had earlier approved by 89 votes to eight. In the House, 172 Democrats voted for the bill and 16 against, with 85 Republicans for and 151 against. The legislation now goes to President Barack Obama, for signing into law. The Act will end the temporary tax breaks granted by President George W. Bush in 2001, but the hikes, from 35 per cent to 39.6 per cent, will affect only those on over $400,000 a year; the President conceded his initial $250,000 threshold. The middle classes, however, will pay more in payroll taxes, the U.S. equivalent of national insurance, which had been frozen earlier in a tax holiday, and the White House had to accept reduced increases in estate taxes, which affect only rich Americans. Other administration concessions, totalling $205 billion, lie in tax breaks for corporate research and development, and continuing corporate tax exemption on foreign subsidiaries’ profits. The President, for his part, can claim some gains, such as extension periods for unemployment benefits, and tax credits on earned income, childcare, and college tuition fees — all of which help poorer and middle earners. In addition, the spending cuts due to start on January 1 have been deferred for two months.
The new Act, nevertheless, is only a stage in a bitter political war between the President, those Congressional Democrats who support him, and the House Republicans in particular. It means the scheduled end of the Bush tax cuts did not coincide with spending cuts, with the attendant risk of a recession — the fiscal cliff — but battles await over the deferred cuts and the debt ceiling, the amount the federal government is allowed to borrow. Yet the House Republicans’ concern is clearly not with the budget deficit, which shrank from 10.1 per cent of GDP in 2009 to 7 per cent in 2012, but with taxation itself and even the idea of government, defence apart. Especially since January 2011, when the Republicans won the House with a large number of Tea Party-style extremists, the GOP has, solely on ideological grounds, persistently obstructed all of Mr. Obama’s efforts. The President, too, has often appeared disdainful of Congressional liaison and even of the complex legislative process, but there is no sign that the GOP will respond to a different approach. This apparently endless and bitter confrontation shows U.S. politics at its ugliest and most dysfunctional, as well as the constitution’s vulnerability to the very factionalism it was meant to prevent.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/between-a-rock-the-republicans/article4269929.ece
5,1,2013,Making campuses safer,"The University Grants Commission advisory to institutions of higher education to make campuses safe for women students in the aftermath of the Delhi rape case addresses a neglected issue. Sexual harassment and even attacks on campus often go unreported because educational institutions do not have proper systems in place to monitor behaviour, counsel students, record complaints and initiate proceedings. It is important for universities and colleges, therefore, to view security not solely as the prevention of high-profile attacks, but as a continuum that protects against various forms of sexual harassment. Fear interferes with a female student’s ability to pursue the full spectrum of educational, cultural and social activities on campus and must be eliminated. The university system in India does not provide an explicit understanding of what constitutes statutory sexual misconduct and harassment. This is particularly true of undergraduate campuses where the youngest students arrive each year and are in need of both counselling and careful supervision. The Supreme Court guidelines in the Vishaka case define sexual harassment and provide a good base on which to build protective systems, but the Centre has been slow to incorporate these into law; it is only now that the Protection of Women Against Sexual Harassment at Work Place Bill 2010 is going through the parliamentary process.
In the West, enlightened university administration has gone a step further by taking the specificity of campus life while defining harassment, sexual misconduct and assault. In most places, victims of sexual assault are specifically encouraged to file complaints even if they had themselves consumed alcohol or drugs at the time. This is important, given the tendency in India to blame the victim for making herself vulnerable. Equally important is the ability to seek help at any hour. Systems need to be in place for students to report an attack at any time of day. In a typical university in the United States, for instance, there is a Rape Victim Advocacy Centre, an Emergency Treatment Centre, and regular law enforcement to record a complaint and offer help. Such supportive structures should be made mandatory in Indian educational institutions. It is worth pointing out that using a position of authority against a student or employee in an educational institution to force her into any form of sexual behaviour is a serious offence in most countries. Indian universities and colleges must also make it easier for students to report all such instances without fear of retaliation. Vice-Chancellors should use the UGC advice to review their statutes and incorporate strong safeguards.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/making-campuses-safer/article4273665.ece
5,1,2013,Excess killed the radio stars,"From the very dawn of broadcast journalism, much of cricket’s celebrated romanticism has had to do with the labours of invisible men in the commentary box, men with the rare gift of describing the great game, draped in all its finery, to listeners who had neither a front row seat at the stadium nor a television set in their drawing room. The advent of TV may have brought about revolutionary changes and helped popularise the game like never before, but no technological miracle can ever match the narrative genius and appeal of a great radio commentator. In the death of Christopher Martin-Jenkins, who passed away this week after a battle with cancer, cricket has lost one of its last great ‘voices.’ CMJ, or “The Major,” to address him by his popular nickname, brought to the commentary booth all the qualities that turned a genuine cricket lover into one of its greatest broadcasters — in the timeless tradition of the incomparable John Arlott, Brian Johnston and a host of others in England and elsewhere. If many believe there is a real existential threat to such a passionate form of sports journalism — not least in India — they may not be far off the mark. Today, much of the commentary in India is unabashedly breathless and what one hears is often unalloyed hype that has nothing in common with the craft that men such as ‘Bobby’ Talyarkhan, Pearson Surita and V.M. Chakrapani carried out to perfection.
This decline may be the result of hyper-commercialisation in the game and the broadcast media’s need to sell it to a wider audience instead of concentrating on elegantly bringing out its nuances. If Arlott’s riveting, poetic descriptions captured the feverish atmosphere on the field, Johnston’s irrepressible enthusiasm and humour were a constant reminder that cricket was just a game. The vivacity of Henry Blofeld and the clarity and precision of CMJ made sure that listeners were urgently alive to the fluctuating fortunes of rivals. For their part, Indian commentators brought a desi flavour to the box. Unfortunately, radio and television cricket broadcasts today have lost their charm and appeal of old in India. For one, there are too many inarticulate ex-cricketers on air. This apart, One Day Internationals and Twenty20 cricket are played at such a feverish pace that commentators may have come to believe they must match their almost crazy onward rush. Amidst the constant bombardment of maximum hits, peppered with advertisements from sponsors, there is little time for commentators to reflect on the game and weave magic out of words for fans listening to the radio. Wallowing in nostalgia is surely a wasteful exercise but if cricket is indeed India’s national passion, the listener deserves a better narration of the game.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/excess-killed-the-radio-stars/article4273662.ece
7,1,2013,The chosen one,"Sometimes, long-standing family disputes are best resolved only when the sticking points are thrashed out in public. In announcing that he would nominate his son >M.K. Stalin as his political heir if given an opportunity to name the next leader of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the party president M. Karunanidhi was merely stating publicly an opinion he was known to hold in private. The surprise was not that Mr. Stalin was the chosen one, but that the DMK patriarch had decided to go public about his personal choice. For several years now, the greatest challenge to Mr. Stalin within the DMK has been from his own elder brother, M.K. Alagiri. Most of the others who might have resented and resisted Mr. Stalin’s rise in the DMK are either dead or gone. From Mr. Karunanidhi’s own generation, only party general secretary K. Anbazhagan is still politically active. Of the younger lot, leaders like Mr. Vaiko were expelled under some pretext or the other when they were seen as a threat to Mr. Stalin. So, when the DMK president revealed his mind on the succession issue he was not trying to quell possible challenges to Mr. Stalin within the wider party, but merely attempting to settle a family dispute. A relative new-comer to politics, Mr. Alagiri rapidly built a support-base using his position as his father’s son in Madurai and surrounding districts. But within the party hierarchy he could not go past Mr. Stalin, an active member and organiser of the DMK from the mid-1970s. Mr. Karunanidhi, in his own way, was thus forcing his elder son to yield, and to let Mr. Stalin assume the leadership of the DMK without the two having to get into an ugly confrontation.
Of course, this is not the first time Mr. Karunanidhi has indicated whom he prefers as his successor. Indeed, he left no one in any doubt on this issue when he nominated Mr. Stalin as the Deputy Chief Minister in May 2009. If anything, the interest over his latest remarks on the succession issue was over how Mr. Alagiri would respond. Mr. Alagiri stood his ground: he quoted Mr. Karunanidhi and Mr. Stalin to the effect that the DMK was not a religious order to announce succession in this manner. There is thus no doubt that Mr. Alagiri will contest for the top slot in the DMK in the post-Karunanidhi phase of the DMK. By reinforcing the perception among partymen that Mr. Stalin will be his political heir, Mr. Karunanidhi was hoping to bring pressure on his elder son. That he did not succeed is no surprise. The best solution is actually the easiest too: to let the party choose its leader. But, as Mr. Karunanidhi knows only too well, that would not settle the dispute in his family.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-chosen-one/article4280252.ece
7,1,2013,An election deal is the only way,"Nepal does not have a legislature. The executive’s legitimacy is contested, with a caretaker >government commanding limited authority and a ceremonial President flirting dangerously with constitutional limits. Its judiciary is operating at less than half strength since there is no Parliament to confirm new appointments. The five-member Election Commission (EC) has only two commissioners left, who are also retiring in a week. The interim constitution did not envisage the current situation where the Constituent Assembly (CA) would fail to draft a statute. >Elections for a new CA could not be held in November and prospects for holding them in April-May are diminishing. There is no agreement in sight over the nature and composition of the government, the electoral system, voter roll disputes, EC appointments, and a mechanism to clear the constitutional hurdles for elections. With President Ram Baran Yadav saying he will not pass election-related ordinances till there is a ‘political consensus,’ each major party has a veto. As the ruling party, the Maoists will have to bear their share of the blame. Chairman Prachanda has constantly shifted positions. He and Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai are engaged in an intra-party battle which has hardened their respective positions in inter-party talks. But the attitude of the opposition — particularly the Nepali Congress (NC) — has been destructive and undemocratic. It first rejected the Maoist idea of reviving the old CA to promulgate the constitution. The Maoists then invited the NC to join the current government, take key ministries, and appoint its nominee as the Chief Election Commissioner to ensure free and fair polls; but this was also turned down.
The NC’s sole demand is that the PM must go and it should be given government leadership. In any democracy, the government last elected on the floor of the house remains in-charge till polls are held and then transfers power, but Nepal’s opposition wants power before polls. The Maoists and Madhesi parties in government said they were open to NC leadership, if the party owned the work done in the last CA and joined the current government temporarily to end the ‘politics of untouchability.’ The NC, however, wanted power unconditionally. The PM’s latest proposal is to hand over power to a neutral civil society figure, with the limited mandate of holding polls. This could serve as a compromise formula if such an arrangement has the sincere support of all parties. If they want to redeem themselves, Nepal’s parties must arrive at a deal in the next fortnight and hold elections by May to restore constitutional order and political legitimacy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/An-election-deal-is-the-only-way/article12292821.ece
8,1,2013,Retrograde torrent,"Asaram Bapu’s >statement that the 23-year old woman who died after being gang-raped in Delhi last month was as much at fault as her offenders is shameful coming from a spiritual guru who is seen as a role model by his huge fan following, both in India and abroad. Indeed, the epidemic of sexist outbursts that has followed the gang-rape is all the worse for originating from men and women in leadership roles who are self-avowedly committed to public service and the betterment of society. Tragically, their notions of what constitutes an ideal society appear rooted in the very prejudices that have engendered a culture of violence against women, the Delhi incident being its most recent and horrific manifestation. This illiberal pack — made up of politicians, social leaders and now godmen — has expressed itself with gusto, with no regard for the young life that was so cruelly and so needlessly extinguished. Not surprisingly, these “leaders” are also impervious to the anger and revulsion their views have generated.
Up until now, it was the political class speaking as if there was no tomorrow: from the President’s son >Abhijit Mukherjee and Andhra Pradesh Congress chief Botsa Satyanarayana to Bharatiya Janata Party minister from Madhya Pradesh Kailash Vijayvargiya and chairperson of the Chhattisgarh State Women’s Commission >Vibha Rao, each has spoken in an idiom more in sync with patriarchal definitions of the woman’s place than reflective of their own supposed status as enlightened leaders. For his part, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s Mohan Bhagwat gave a predictable spin to the gang-rape, setting it as an urban phenomenon that conflicted with the pristine ethos of Bharat. The divide between India and Bharat is a piece of fiction because violence against women is endemic to rural India with its worst victims drawn from the lowest rungs of the economic and caste ladder. And yet, incredible as it might seem, the explosion of regressive thoughts has paled in comparison to the atrocious suggestion made by Asaram Bapu that the Delhi woman virtually invited the rape. “A mistake is not committed by just one side,” he said, adding that she should have sought refuge in prayer and begged her offenders to stop. For anyone to speak so disparagingly of women is unacceptable, and it is a disgrace when a man of religion stoops so low. Asaram deserves to be condemned in the strongest words by the community of religious leaders and it is heartening to note that a number of godmen have indeed spoken out. Sadly, we have yet to hear the high command of the Congress and the BJP publicly condemn those from within their flock who have made the most offensive anti-women statements over the past three weeks.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/retrograde-torrent/article4283861.ece
8,1,2013,Return of the marines,"Now that the two Italian marines accused of killing two fishermen off Kerala in February 2012 while on duty aboard a merchant vessel are >back in India after having gone home for Christmas, the need is to ensure a fair but quick trial. The swiftest possible conclusion should enable all concerned to put an end to the matter. The Kerala High Court’s decision to grant them leave for a Christmas-season visit, and their return well ahead of the January 10 deadline set, have generated mutual goodwill. A complex legal process now lies ahead, as Rome insists the marines should be prosecuted in their home country because the events involve an Italian-flagged vessel in international waters; India, however, says the incident took place in its waters. Indeed, the dispute is no more over the facts of the case, but over who has trial jurisdiction. Both sides should now ensure that jingoism of any kind does not come in the way of a fair legal trial and outcome.
Important in the long term are steps to change its delineation of the “high risk area” (involving perceptions of attacks from Somalian pirates further afield in the Arabian Sea), away from India’s fishing zones. This situation has been forcing a growing number of foreign vessels to transit close to India’s western coast. In some instances this has led to transgression into fishing zones, and at least two previous encounters bear testimony to this fact. India ought to raise this issue actively and persistently with the United Nations and other agencies. While pirate attacks, especially those involving Somali outlaws, remain a major threat to the maritime industry, the International Maritime Bureau needs to clarify and update their advisories to vessels passing through benign areas with regard to “risks” posed by small fishing boats. The Indian Coast Guard and Navy ought to step up naval patrolling and air surveillance to ensure coastal security while also launching programmes for fishing communities to make them aware of the risks and stay out of harm’s way. It has been pointed out that some 300,000 fishing boats operate along the Indian coast. When the helpless fishers find a mighty vessel approaching, they typically raise an alarm and often sail towards it to draw the crew’s attention and prevent damage to their gear. Ensuring the safety and security of fishermen who take to the seas to earn a living but who seem forever under threat, is an imperative. Given its long coastal zone, India should take this opportunity to strengthen its expertise in international legal processes on the maritime front. By no means should the Enrica Lexie incident lead to diffidence when it comes to deterrence from attacks on the seas.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/return-of-the-marines/article4283863.ece
9,1,2013,"On the brink, again","Given Jharkhand’s predilection for turning out Chief Ministers faster than an assembly line on speed, the life of the >Arjun Munda government was always going to be something of a teaser-trailer. The question was when rather than if the regime would go, and the inevitable happened after the Shibu Soren-led >Jharkhand Mukti Morcha broke its arrangement with the Bharatiya Janata Party citing breach of trust by its partner. Just how the Munda government came about is itself a riveting story full of jarring twists and turns that have now become the State’s leitmotif. Indeed, for a tiny State with a short history — it was born to enormous expectations in 2000 — Jharkhand has shown a rather robust appetite for dubious records. Consider the achievements: eight governments in 12 years including one that lasted all of 11 days; an Independent MLA wheeling and dealing his way to the chief ministership only to end up in jail for amassing unbelievable wealth; one Chief Minister exiting for not being able to win his own Assembly seat; and two spells of President’s Rule. The BJP-JMM pact was doomed from the start, not least because of the ideological divergence between the two parties, one wedded to Hindutva and the other a product of a long-fought tribal movement implacably opposed to the cultural constructs of Hindutva. There was also the running rivalry between Mr. Munda, who left the JMM for the BJP in 2000, and Mr. Soren. Both men have done three stints as Chief Minister.
When the BJP and the JMM entered into an alliance following the fractured election verdict of 2009, the partners apparently agreed that they would take turns at running the State government. Accordingly, Mr. Soren became Chief Minister towards the close of 2009. However, the JMM was never comfortable in the alliance, and six months into its relationship with the BJP, it voted with the UPA government in the Lok Sabha on a series of cut motions. An offended BJP pulled the plug on Mr. Soren, who, in a placatory gesture, offered the Chief Minister’s seat to Mr. Munda. The new point of conflict is around the presumed agreement to share governance responsibilities. Mr. Munda, who was shortly to complete his half of the term, denies there was any such agreement while a miffed Mr. Soren insists this is a betrayal. With one more discredited regime gone, the field is wide open for the Congress to try and cobble up an arrangement with its erstwhile partner. Whether or not a new government gets formed, one thing is for sure: the script never fails in Jharkhand whose tragedy has been that though it was carved out of Bihar to end its endemic deprivation, it has become hostage to unending political brinkmanship.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/on-the-brink-again/article4287748.ece
9,1,2013,Getting serious about science,"India has a new science policy. Releasing the “Science, Technology and Innovation Policy 2013” at the centenary session of the Indian Science Congress in Kolkata last week, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh declared that it was intended to “position India among the top five global scientific powers by the year 2020.” It bears recalling that in 1958 both Houses of Parliament adopted a “Scientific Policy Resolution” which, in elegant prose, underscored the importance of science and technology for a developing nation. The government would, the resolution said, “foster, promote, and sustain, by all appropriate means, the cultivation of science and scientific research in all its aspects — pure, applied, and educational.” Subsequent science policies announced by later governments have essentially tweaked the 1958 resolution. Indira Gandhi’s 1983 policy emphasised self-reliance while the 2003 policy announced by Atal Bihari Vajpayee sought to meet the challenges posed by globalisation.
There has been a growing sense of India falling behind in the race to use its scientific capabilities and of China powering ahead. “We produce more science than before, but several more ambitious countries like China and South Korea have outpaced us,” lamented the Science Advisory Council to the Prime Minister in a 2010 report titled “India as a global leader in science.” China’s investment in research and development has been shooting up at 20 per cent annually over the past 10 years. As a result, that country is currently spending about 1.7 per cent of its GDP on R&D and, in absolute terms, is being outspent only by the U.S. India’s R&D spending, on the other hand, has yet to rise above one per cent of its GDP. As in the 2003 policy, the new science policy too wants to boost the country’s research spending to two per cent of GDP with greater private sector R&D investment. With greater R&D inputs, the country’s share of global trade in high technology products is to be doubled from the current level of around eight per cent. Having a new policy makes sense only if it spurs change; otherwise it is just an exercise in mouthing platitudes. Well-focused government initiatives are needed in a number of areas, rather than just some piecemeal measures, to flesh out the laudable objectives laid out in the science policy. The domestic market must, for instance, be leveraged, such as through appropriate government procurement policies, to allow indigenous technology to flourish and compete internationally. That’s something China has done with remarkable success. Will the Indian government be able to match its words with action?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/getting-serious-about-science/article4287747.ece
10,1,2013,Playing with fire,"If there is one achievement of the India-Pakistan peace process that has stood out over everything else, it is the ceasefire along the Line of Control that the two countries agreed to nearly a decade ago. Since 2003, when the ceasefire began, it has brought real improvement to the lives of people living along both sides of the LoC. It liberated them from the daily fear of getting caught in the frequent exchange of artillery and joining the tragic ranks of those >killed in “cross-LoC firing”. It is alarming, then, that this confidence-building measure, on the good health of which hang many others, has also been repeatedly violated and jeopardised. In the latest incident, India has alleged that Pakistani troops brazenly crossed the LoC and killed two Indian soldiers, charges that Pakistan denies. Two days earlier, on January 6, there was another incident in which Pakistan alleged that India had crossed into its side of the border and that one of its soldiers was killed in the attack; India claims its troops undertook “controlled retaliation” to unprovoked firing from the Pakistan side. It would seem that with all its troubles on its western border, the Pakistan Army would have little appetite for trouble on its eastern front. Indeed, this is the conventional wisdom on why the Pakistan military did not stand in the way of improving trade relations with India. But the unfortunate reality is that despite better ties on several fronts, relations between the two countries remain vulnerable to the slightest provocation.
The facts of each violation have never been easy to ascertain but are usually linked to local-level tensions. As with any ceasefire, the two armies have in place an elaborate system to deal with violations. The field commanders of both sides hold regular meetings and a hotline connects the Directors-General of Military Operations. While this has helped shepherd the truce through all these years, the question that remains unanswered is why despite such high-level contacts, violations continue to take place with such dangerous frequency — there have been 72 incidents just in the last 13 months, the highest in recent years, a large number of them in sectors south of Pir Panjal. This, the 10th year of the ceasefire, marred as it is by the latest incident, may be the right time for the two militaries to explore ways of strengthening the agreement, and perhaps, to consider ramping up their level of interaction. Given the apparent seriousness of the latest incident, India has been right to make a strong diplomatic protest, but it should ensure that the bad blood over this does not affect the progress, however meagre, in other areas of bilateral relations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/playing-with-fire/article4291246.ece
10,1,2013,A new Syrian deadlock,"Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad, addressing the country on national TV on January 6, has denounced his opponents as “enemies of God and puppets of the West,” but has for the first time put forward his version of a political approach to the Syrian civil war, which has already lasted 21 months and claimed some 60,000 lives. Mr. Assad, in his first public statement since he spoke to >Russian television in November 2012, and his first in Syria since June, said the army would halt military operations (but would retain the right to defend state interests), provided other countries ceased to arm what he called terrorist groups. A conference of national dialogue would follow, in which the government, individuals, and political parties would try to reach agreement on a national charter to be put to a referendum; there would then be parliamentary elections leading to the formation of a new government. The main opposition group, the Syrian National Coalition (SNC), has rejected the Assad proposals, saying the President wanted only solutions that would keep him in control and that the SNC would accept nothing less than Mr. Assad’s departure. Another group, the National Coordination Body for Democratic Change in Syria (NCB) — which is tolerated by the regime — says it will not enter into talks unless the violence ceases. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, for his part, has expressed disappointment that the Assad plan in effect rejects the U.N. proposal for a transitional governing body.
That Mr. Assad has raised a political proposal itself indicates his recognition that only a political solution will suffice. His more vituperative comments about the opposition, which include calling them a Western-fabricated movement, will, however, not help, and will probably harden dissident and Western attitudes. Yet Mr. Assad has a point. Saudi Arabia and Qatar have channelled weaponry to the insurgents, who now control parts of northern Syria, and neither Riyadh nor Doha is likely to welcome representative democracy in Syria. Indeed, those two regional powers may well favour extreme Sunni factions among the SNC over the others. Secondly, the United States holds that the Syrian people’s goal is a political transition, and the European Union insists that that cannot be achieved unless Mr. Assad steps aside. Such stands reiterate the Western commitment to regime change above all else, and make it harder even for Mr. Assad’s strongest ally, Russia, which recognises the need for a political solution, to encourage Mr. Assad to negotiate. They do nothing to bring about the only tenable solution, which will be one devised by the Syrian people themselves.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-new-syrian-deadlock/article4291245.ece
11,1,2013,Ill-timed but inevitable,"Except for a marginal increase in fares last year for AC First Class and AC 2-tier, there has been no rise in basic passenger fares in the Indian Railways for a decade now. By any yardstick, this is an unreasonable and economically unviable situation. Content at playing to the gallery, the previous occupants of Rail Bhavan — Lalu Prasad, Mamata Banerjee and her Trinamool Congress proxy — chose not to raise fares all these years. At least Mr. Prasad was helped by an economy on a roll, which enabled the Railways to mop up substantial funds from freight traffic. Unfortunately for ‘Didi,’ the economic downturn began around the same time as her tenure, and competition from road transport was also formidable. Consequently, freight movement targets could not be reached. Despite the growing deficit, she was adamant in not wanting to increase fares even marginally to cope with inflation and the rise in input costs, especially diesel. Consequently, the Railways had to take the entire burden on itself. Last year, when the Trinamool’s Railway Minister, Dinesh Trivedi, presented his budget, he did propose a fare increase. But an angry Ms Banerjee forced him to resign. She nominated Mukul Roy to take his place and rolled back most of the budget proposals. Only a marginal increase in First AC and AC 2-tier was allowed to be retained.
When the Trinamool walked out of the UPA government, the Congress made sure it retained the Railway portfolio. When P.K. Bansal took over the ministry last October, he made it clear that a fare increase was imminent. Since then, the huge shortfall in the movement of coal gas further hit the Railways’ bottom line. In Wednesday’s across-the-board increase in passenger fares, the two premium classes have got away with a lower hike because they were hit last year. But Second Class ordinary and AC 3-tier fares will rise substantially — from 12 to 30 per cent on an average, with those travelling longer distances forced to pay more. Even suburban passengers have been taxed, leaving only Ms Banerjee’s Kolkata Metro out of the net. The Opposition lost no time in slamming what it described as “another anti-people decision,” and called for a rollback. That may not happen this time. Given that the loss on account of passenger fares was set to reach Rs. 25,000 crore this fiscal, this steep increase — which will yield Rs. 6,600 crore in a full year — may be inevitable. Nevertheless it is worth asking whether the Minister should have come up with his announcement now when the annual Railway budget is hardly six weeks away. It is nothing new for governments to raise administered prices on budget eve. But it is still a wrong approach.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/illtimed-but-inevitable/article4295237.ece
11,1,2013,Figuring out Afghanistan,"The big question about the scheduled 2014 departure of American troops from Afghanistan is whether the country is going to descend again, as it did after the Soviet departure, into ferocious fighting between warlords until the Taliban emerged supreme, or if the semblance of government that exists now can stave off such a scenario. This is the question that Afghan President Hamid Karzai and United States President Barack Obama will seek to answer at their meeting on Friday. The realisation, two years ago, that defeating the Taliban was impossible triggered cautious efforts at exploring ways to deal with them politically. As 2014 approaches, those efforts have picked up speed, with the Obama administration keen to leave behind an arrangement that can help it claim a semblance of political achievement from the military intervention. Through the facilitation of a French think-tank, representatives of the Karzai government’s High Peace Council met Taliban representatives in France last month. The position that the Taliban representatives took at the meeting contained no surprises. They denounced the Constitution, do not want the 2014 elections to be held, and believe their Islamic Emirate, ousted by U.S. forces after 9/11, was the best thing that happened to Afghanistan. There was no renouncing of ties with al-Qaeda. With the underlying tone one of contempt towards the Karzai government, it is hard to escape the impression that the Taliban are not so much interested in negotiation with Kabul as a deal with the U.S. for a return to power.
Given this, the High Council’s “Peace Process Roadmap to 2015” sounds unrealistic. It visualises a deal based on respect for the Constitution — a ceasefire with the Taliban and other armed groups by the end of 2013, their transformation into political parties and participation in the following year’s elections. In reality, it makes a huge pragmatic concession to the Taliban by envisaging “non-elected” positions in the “power structure.” This has already raised concern within and outside Afghanistan, not least because it is no secret that Pakistan has been working both sides of the table. Pakistan’s stakes are understandable: post-2014, any instability in Afghanistan is most likely to first wash across the Durand Line, adding to its existing woes. But it is not clear if it realises that any attempt to use its influence with the Taliban to create instability in the neighbourhood after 2014 would rebound on it. Locked out of the process after all the talk of a ‘regional’ solution, India’s primary worry would be Pakistan’s intentions. New Delhi, which has not yet articulated an official response to the Chantilly talks, must flag its concerns.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/figuring-out-afghanistan/article4295391.ece
12,1,2013,"Our songs, their movies","Chennai’s longstanding tryst with music and the arts is well-known, and its Music Season attracts aficionados from the world over. But of late, the capital of Carnatic music seems to have made an impression on Hollywood as well. When Danny Boyle was looking for a music director for his Mumbai-based Slumdog Millionaire, his eyes fell on A.R. Rahman, the ‘Mozart of Madras,’ who eventually picked up Academy Awards for Best Original Song and Best Original Score. Now, the Carnatic musician Bombay Jayashri has been nominated for Best Original Song (Music by Mychael Danna; Lyric by Bombay Jayashri) — for ‘Pi’s Lullaby’, in Ang Lee’s Life of Pi. The song faces tough competition in the form of ‘Suddenly’, from the hit musical Les Misérables, and, especially, the blockbuster title track from Skyfall, which came right in time for James Bond’s golden anniversary on screen, something the Academy’s voting members will certainly have in mind given the film’s lack of nominations in the major categories. Then again, Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain was denied Best Picture in a widely criticised 2005 decision (Paul Haggis’s Crash won that year), and the Academy, still red in the face, may be looking to make amends. Sometimes, as was the case with Slumdog Millionaire, a film can end up showered with Oscar love, sweeping everything in sight. Ang Lee will certainly be hoping that’s the case.
Oscar politicking apart, the nomination of ‘Pi’s Lullaby’ raises an intriguing question: does popular music from India travel better around the world than its popular movies? ‘Jai Ho’, after all, is very much in the beat-heavy Bollywood mould, and ‘Pi’s Lullaby’ is only the latest version of a long line of bedtime songs Indian screen mothers have sung for their screen children. Meanwhile, Barfi!, a big hit in the country and India’s (highly questionable) official nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, did not even make it to the shortlist. But it’s not that simple. ‘Jai Ho’ and ‘Pi’s Lullaby’ found recognition because they happened to be part of movies that were embraced by a worldwide audience. The soul may have been Indian, but the packaging was still international. One may wonder, then, why the songs of, say, Gurinder Chadha’s Bride and Prejudice failed to find any takers. After all, Chadha is a well-known name, and her film was based on the work of someone even more well-known: Jane Austen. The film even starred a Miss World. Yet, the score made not a ripple, a fate that was shared by the song ‘Gori Re’, in Mira Nair’s adaptation of Vanity Fair. Both these films got little critical recognition, and did not play very well to audiences either. It may bode well for ‘Pi’s Lullaby’ that critics and audiences around the world have loved Life of Pi.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/our-songs-their-movies/article4299028.ece
12,1,2013,Keep violence out of play,"Governors tend to be both stooges and agents of the party ruling at the Centre. For this reason what they say and do sometimes appear politically motivated, especially when they are in charge of a State ruled by a party in the opposite camp. But, in West Bengal, Governor M.K. Narayanan was well within his constitutional limits when he described the ongoing >violence indulged in by the ruling Trinamool Congress as goondaism. The comment was made in the context of the attacks on leaders and workers of the Left parties and the Congress by Trinamool cadres, and was cautionary and advisory in nature. However, Trinamool Minister Subrata Mukherjee, in an apparent effort to find favour with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, took it upon himself to warn the Governor against making “provocative” remarks that could be “misunderstood” by the people. He went so far as to say that he was showing a “yellow card” to the Governor now, and that a “red card” could follow. If anyone is guilty of impropriety, it is the Minister, and not the Governor. Not surprisingly, the Left parties, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party, all defended the Governor against the Minister.
Of course, State governments have reason to be sensitive to critical remarks by the Governor or Central ministers about the law and order situation. This is because of the history of misuse of Article 356 of the Constitution. Breakdown of the constitutional machinery is organically linked to the breakdown of law and order. Although safeguards against the misuse of Article 356 have been in place since the Bommai judgment of the Supreme Court, State governments continue to view all words and deeds from representatives of the Central government with deep suspicion. But while Governors will have to be careful in their choice of words in criticising ‘their’ State government publicly, they cannot be expected to remain silent in a situation of rising political violence. What is happening on the ground in West Bengal is indeed highly disturbing. Instead of pointing a finger at the Governor, the Trinamool government will do well to look inwards and allow the police to act independently in cases of violence triggered by ruling party workers. Otherwise, Chief Minister Banerjee will soon discover that her party men have squandered the goodwill with which she came to power. That ideologically disparate parties are speaking in the same voice should itself set the alarm bells ringing in the government. Although there is no threat of the Left, the Congress and the BJP coming together, the Trinamool might soon find that it cannot win electoral battles on its own steam.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/keep-violence-out-of-play/article4299029.ece
14,1,2013,Drug testing on trial,"In a typical case of putting the cart before the horse, the Health Ministry is now in the process of amending the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 to regulate human clinical trials taking place in the country. More than the death of over 2,000 people during 2008-2011 in clinical trials, it was the recent rap by the Supreme Court that has shaken the government from its “deep slumber” and prompted it to make some semblance of initiating steps to regulate the clinical trial “racket” that has been creating “havoc” in the country. These baby steps to regulate the clinical trial industry come eight years after the government amended the 1945 Rules to permit “concurrent phase” trials of drugs developed outside India to be conducted in the country. Prior to this, trials of such drugs could only be conducted with a “phase lag,” thus safeguarding participants’ safety. The amendment was specifically aimed at promoting India as a preferred destination for conducting clinical trials. But opening the clinical-trial floodgates has come at the cost of human life and scant regard to those affected by the investigations. For instance, there is currently no provision under the Rules requiring payment of financial compensation in case of trial-related injury or death of subjects, nor is there any method for assessing the amount of compensation. Though the regulatory body is poorly staffed, the Ministry is just about “planning to increase the strength … to monitor deficient areas including clinical trials.”
Conducting trials on humans is absolutely necessary for ascertaining the safety and efficacy of experimental molecules before they are commercialised. However, abundant caution should be exercised to enrol only healthy subjects who have fully understood the implications of participating in the trial and have provided truly informed consent. Close monitoring and immediate investigation of any serious adverse events/death related to a trial and suspending/calling off the trial instantly when the molecule tested is not found safe, and providing medical attention/compensation to subjects are basic requirements. But many unscrupulous parties — from sponsors to principal investigators — have cared little to follow them in letter and spirit. So much so that animals used in preclinical testing are better monitored and protected than humans during trials. The government’s lackadaisical approach to clinical trials during the last eight years is proof that commercial interests override ethics and subjects’ safety concerns. Will the priorities change by just notifying the rules under duress? The only way out to ensure safer clinical trials is to revoke the 2005 amendment that allows concurrent trials.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/drug-testing-on-trial/article4304894.ece
14,1,2013,Searching for Earth’s twin,"The recent announcement at the American Astronomical Society meeting in California dramatically increases the possibility of finding Earth-sized extra-solar planets, or exoplanets, and in particular, those that are in a habitable ‘Goldilocks’ zone — neither too close nor too far from a star, so liquid water might be present on the surface. One study looked at the number of habitable Earth-sized exoplanets (those one-half to twice the size of the Earth) orbiting the smaller and cooler M dwarf stars. By studying about 3,600 of the 5,000 M dwarf stars present in Kepler’s field of view, researchers calculated that each of these stars had an 87 per cent possibility of having Earth-sized exoplanets, and nearly six per cent of the M dwarfs studied could be in the habitable zone. M dwarfs account for about 75 per cent of the stars in the Milky Way. “The chance of discovering a habitable-zone super Earth transiting [passing] a low-mass star in the immediate future is tremendously high,” notes a 2010 paper. Another preliminary study estimated that one in six stars in our galaxy has an Earth-sized exoplanet, increasing the abundance to an astronomical 17 billion. But not all are in the habitable zone. With the addition of 461 new candidate exoplanets identified by Kepler during the last 22 months, the total number of candidates has shot up to 2,740. Of these, 105 have been confirmed as planets.
Advanced and sophisticated methods have helped in not only discovering exoplanets orbiting sun-like stars and M dwarfs but also in studying their atmospheric composition, accurately calculating their size and mass, and also the temperature at different altitudes (gradient). The launch in 2018 of the James Webb Space Telescope increases the possibility of studying the atmospheres of a few M dwarf stars. Having succeeded in studying the atmospheres of exoplanets, scientists have moved on to get a deeper understanding of their atmospheric biosignatures to ascertain the possibility of life. But the search for alien life has traditionally been based on our knowledge of living forms on Earth, which are carbon based. But can silicon-based life be completely ruled out? Similarly, should oxygen be present for life to exist? After all, the earliest life forms on Earth existed well before oxygen became dominant. Extremophiles on Earth have been found in hostile environments — extremely hot, cold, acidic, alkaline, dry and desiccating conditions, deriving energy from hydrothermal vent chemicals and certain elements found in rocks. Hence there is a possibility of alien life on exoplanets. The only limitation in identifying them, if they exist, is our technological capability. And sense of imagination.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Searching-for-Earth%E2%80%99s-twin/article12302628.ece
15,1,2013,Britain’s EU dilemma,"Britain’s Conservative-led government wants to renegotiate its four decades-long membership of the European Union and repatriate powers from Brussels. Should he be reelected in 2015, says Prime Minister David Cameron, he would even put the new package to a popular referendum, no matter if that means a potential exit from the bloc. Its European allies, once angry over London’s intransigence on the common budget and the fiscal pact, are increasingly viewing the country’s future in Europe with near resignation. The United States has gone public with its opinion that its special relationship would be best served with Britain inside the EU. The current mood reflects greater unease in an always reluctant member state, especially with the imperatives of ever-deepening economic and political integration of the EU in response to the sovereign debt crisis. After all, Britain’s fundamental interest in EU membership has always been purely economic, unlike founder members Germany and France who see the EU as a political project created from the ruins of the Second World War. But the country would be denying itself the voice and influence to formulate policies to promote its national interests were London to relinquish full membership. Switzerland, Norway and Iceland, for instance, are members of the European free trade association but have to play by the EU script.
British business, a core constituency of the Conservative party, is at a loss to understand the government’s position. While endorsing support for reform of the bloc’s budget and the single market, leading figures in industry have warned that an exit from the EU would hamper inward investment and growth. Britain’s crowning achievement since joining the EU has been its role in the establishment of the single European market. Its contribution to reinvent this process now would be vital given the setback suffered during the debt crisis. There are allies within and outside of the single currency zone who share similar concerns based on the liberal free-market model traditionally associated with Britain. Defying this economic logic of greater cooperation is the brand of eurosceptic politics of the conservatives. The party has been held hostage by backbenchers whose anti-European stance makes it almost indistinguishable from the anti-immigrant and xenophobic far-right U.K. Independence Party. Prevarication by the Liberal Democrats, the junior partner in the ruling coalition, and the predominantly Europhobic press have kept the debate on EU membership banal. While the current generation of the Labour party may not be anti-European, fading memories of the war and the Holocaust means that commitment and enthusiasm are wanting.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Britain%E2%80%99s-EU-dilemma/article12303755.ece
15,1,2013,"Stable, but for how long?","The latest Financial Stability Report (FSR) of the Reserve Bank of India, the sixth in the series, is a half yearly assessment by an expert committee of the outlook for the stability and resilience of the financial sector. The report also suggests policy actions that are needed to contain the risks to stability. Compared to the previous report, the threats to financial sector stability have increased. While the environment of global and domestic macroeconomic instability remains unchanged, there is a realisation that the highly unconventional tools relied upon by governments and central banks across the world at the beginning of the crisis are losing some of their edge and effectiveness. The space for fiscal and monetary action is getting squeezed. Besides, some of the unintended consequences of the policy tools employed, such as the ultra soft monetary policies of the U.S., have started manifesting themselves in countries like India. For instance, the accretion to global liquidity has pushed up commodity prices, and with it the threat of imported inflation in India. Global uncertainties, notably the delay in resolving the euro-debt crisis and domestic policy uncertainties, have caused a deceleration of economic growth in recent quarters. There has been a noticeable fall in the level of domestic savings, inflation has remained persistently high and these along with regulatory and environmental issues have caused a fall in investment demand and moderation in consumption spending.
Despite all of this, financial markets in India have remained largely stable. But the corporate sector’s ability to service its debt has been falling since 2009-10. Some infrastructure companies have substantially increased their leverage. These and a few other factors are responsible for the increased stress on the asset quality of the banking system. A large number of loans have been restructured recently. The banking sector on the whole has remained resilient to credit, market and liquidity risks and is capable of withstanding macroeconomic shocks given their comfortable capital adequacy. However, new provisioning norms require banks to tie up a larger amount of capital to take care of distressed assets. In the context of the imminent shift to Basel III norms, some banks may face challenges in mopping up additional capital. Financial inclusion, financial literacy and consumer protection are interconnected threads in the pursuit of financial stability. Given the strong linkage between stability and inclusion, it is only right that the FSR should highlight, for the first time, the several regulatory initiatives taken and the progress achieved so far.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/stable-but-for-how-long/article4307675.ece
16,1,2013,Stop baying for blood,"“After this dastardly act,” Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Tuesday, “there can’t be business as usual with Pakistan.” Dr. Singh’s tired words — and his government's dreadful decision to postpone the start of visa-free travel to India by senior citizens from Pakistan — suggest the relentless political attacks on his Pakistan policy are taking a toll. This is not good news. It is entirely true that the beheading of Indian soldiers on the Line of Control was a despicable act that must be condemned. It must also be candidly admitted, though, that Pakistan has not had a monopoly of wrong-doing in this case. It was only in March that Defence Minister A.K. Antony informed Parliament of Indian protests against Pakistani construction along the Line of Control. Now, no less than India’s Chief of Army Staff Bikram Singh has confirmed reports in The Hindu that India, too, was doing exactly the same thing. It is pointless to ask who cast the first stone. The need now is to strengthen the restraint regime on the LoC. Few spectacles have been as unedifying as the contemptible baying of warmongers these past days — most of it, it bears mention, emanating from TV studios located at a safe distance from the nearest bullet. It is hard not to contrast Bharatiya Janata Party leader Sushma Swaraj’s ugly calls for 10 Pakistani soldiers to be beheaded in retaliation with the studied restraint of General Singh. No one who has seen war casually calls for the blood of soldiers to be shed — or believes they can predict, with any certainty, what the consequences of war will be.
Four propositions must be clearly understood. First, ever since General Parvez Ashfaq Kayani took office as Pakistan’s army chief in November 2007, his covert services and armed forces have engaged in a carefully calibrated escalation of hostilities — hoping to roll back the détente initiated in 2003, but also seeking not to invite international condemnation. Second, India has few military options to address this situation. The potential costs of war, and the risk of nuclear confrontation, far outweigh those of the low-grade conflict India now faces. India has covert and conventional means at its disposal which have been exercised — and could be exercised to greater effect. However, precipitating a crisis serves the interests of Pakistan’s generals — not Indians. Third, denying visas to elderly Pakistanis or stopping hockey players from participating in Indian tournaments will not make our borders or our civilians safer. This is the behaviour of a spoilt child, not a strategic actor. Fourth, real gains have been made since 2003, not the least a ceasefire and de-intensification of cross-border terrorism which has saved the lives of thousands of Indian soldiers. Nothing ought to be done to jeopardise this. Not every malaise has a cure; some can only be managed better or worse, and certainly not through indiscriminate blood-letting. India’s relationship with Pakistan is one of them.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/stop-baying-for-blood/article4310116.ece
16,1,2013,A damaging impeachment,"Sri Lanka’s democratic institutions are in ferment once again. The impeachment of Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake and her quick replacement with former Attorney General Mohan Peiris come as an unsavoury climax to an unedifying standoff between the judiciary on the one hand and the legislature and executive on the other. The episode is one more instance of President Mahinda Rajapaksa placing his own and his regime’s interest over that of the country and its institutions. It is certain to contribute to institutional decay, attract international opprobrium and underscore the impression that Sri Lanka is ruled not by law but by the will of individuals. And the worrying fact about the country’s travails is that its chief executive, who ought to be the one most concerned about it and do more to strengthen them, is actively contributing to the undermining of its institutions. The country’s Parliament ignored judicial decisions against the validity of a parliamentary inquiry against Chief Justice Bandaranayake and went ahead with her impeachment. Mr. Rajapaksa lost little time in accepting the impeachment motion and appointing the Cabinet’s legal adviser to replace her. To external observers, the merit, or lack of it, in the charges said to have been proved against Ms Bandaranayake is of little consequence. Rather, the timing of the impeachment — coming close on the heels of a Supreme Court determination that a new law on development needed ratification by all provincial councils — is worthy of notice. The process, too, was of doubtful legitimacy, and the parliamentary vote, largely on party lines.
The legal fraternity in Sri Lanka is already up in arms against the appointment of a new Chief Justice, as large sections of it seem to believe that the impeachment is a nullity as the parliamentary report based on which it was pursued has already been quashed by the Court of Appeals. Even if Mr. Peiris settles down in his post, it is doubtful if his rulings will command credibility. President Rajapaksa may be unable to undo this irreversible action, but the latest institutional crisis might help remind him that cleansing the judiciary is not a perfunctory task; rather, it requires a well-thought-out process involving appropriate legislation that safeguards the institution’s independence while ensuring a truly independent inquiry into charges of misconduct against judges.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-damaging-impeachment/article4310118.ece
17,1,2013,Training the teacher,"The failure of the vast majority of candidates in the Central Teacher Eligibility Test is convincing proof that the system of teacher education is in urgent need of repair. In this case, trainees with a B. Ed degree could not pass the examination designed to test their fitness for appointment as teachers in Central government schools, and some Central Board of Secondary Education institutions. The overall system of teacher training in the country has been found wanting for decades and many recommendations have been made by expert panels for improvements. A good critique of what ails the various B. Ed programmes, as well as diplomas in education is to be found in the National Curriculum Framework for Teacher Education. Demand for greater numbers of teachers has led to massive quantitative expansion of the number of institutions and courses at various levels in recent years, but without the necessary emphasis on infrastructure, faculty qualification and learning resources. A key point the Framework makes is that state provisioning of elementary education is marked by an attitude of resignation towards the existing system of pre-service and in-service training, which leaves little inspiration for the practitioners to improve.
The gamut of issues surrounding teacher education needs a fresh look. The imperative to raise the entry-level qualification for training of teachers from Plus Two, and make it a well-rounded degree programme has been underscored by the NCFTE. It would be worthwhile to invest in a four-year degree programme after senior secondary, or a two-year programme after acquiring a Bachelor’s degree. The J.S. Verma Commission appointed by the Supreme Court has also highlighted the importance of making teacher education a part of the higher education system to introduce the necessary rigour and exposure to various integral disciplines. It is the poor preparation in both the disciplinary and pedagogical domains that produces trainees who are found wanting. Making it compulsory to have a dedicated school attached to a pre-service teacher education institution, as the Verma panel suggests, could be one way to ensure that graduates acquire the necessary competence and skills. Such a system would naturally be far superior to distance learning courses. The poor performance of teacher-trainees in recruitment examinations is a clear indicator of the failed assembly-line system of training that exists today. It is also important to note that 90 per cent of the pre-service teacher education courses are in the non-government sector and the state needs to play a more active role in improving institutional capacity especially in the East and Northeast.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/training-the-teacher/article4313459.ece
17,1,2013,Archaeology needs support,"The recently inaugurated exhibition — Rediscovering India: 1961-2011 — in Delhi was a fitting finale to the year-long celebrations of the 150th anniversary of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). This exhibition displayed the achievements of ASI in the past five decades. The list is long and impressive: discoveries of existence of Harappan culture in places such as Kalibangan in Rajasthan and Dholavira in Gujarat; excavations at Buddhist sites in Kanaganhali in Karnataka and Boxanagar in Tripura; salvage operations at Nagarjunakonda, Andhra Pradesh, and conservation efforts in Hampi, Karnataka, are some of its remarkable projects. The ASI protects 3,677 monuments and has copied more than 74,000 inscriptions. It has shaped the discipline of archaeology, history and heritage conservation in the country through these significant contributions. Despite all this, the fact remains that the ASI has not institutionally innovated to meet emerging challenges. State apathy and poor financial support have added to its woes. The question is how to continue the good work and secure the past better for the future.
Art and culture received only a meagre 0.16 per cent of the total Central Plan of the government in the Eleventh Five-Year plan allocation. As a result, the Ministry of Culture, which the ASI is a part of, received only a fraction of what it needed. This poor funding pattern is unlikely to improve. For the year 2012-13, the government has sanctioned only one-third of the requested Rs. 2,916 crore. Of the scant funds that the ASI receives in turn, less than one per cent is spent on excavations (2011-12). This would neither help expand the investigation of the unexplored historical landscape nor lead to greater investment in archaeological science. The casual approach to publication of reports also reflects the declining importance of excavation. Despite the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture reminding the ASI to speed up the publication of 56 pending excavation reports five years ago, progress has been tardy. In 2007, the Working Group on Art and Culture for the Eleventh Five-Year plan recommended that more historical structures should be protected and the ASI should notify every year about 70 unprotected structures as monuments for better care. But not much has happened on this front too. The government should enhance funding and confer the status of a scientific institution on the ASI to meet its special needs. For its part, the ASI should decentralise and make its five regional directorates autonomous. They in turn, with active participation of local governments, should unravel more of the hidden past and protect them better.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Archaeology-needs-support/article12305689.ece
18,1,2013,The politics of a messiah,"The Pakistan People’s Party government may yet make history as the first elected government to complete its term in Pakistan. President Asif Ali Zardari appears to have won a battle of wits with Tahir-Ul Qadri, the Canadian-Pakistani who wanted Parliament dissolved and a caretaker government set up. The Constitution provides for a caretaker government to be appointed by the outgoing government in consultation with all political parties. Mr. Qadri, however, wanted it to be set up through consultations with the Army and the judiciary. Moreover, he wanted elections put off until such time as laws were reformed to ensure that the next government would not be corrupt, thus making a case for a long-term interim set-up, most likely with himself at its head. The Barelvi cleric could have been dismissed as a lunatic but for the tens of thousands of people who joined his dharna in the capital, showing that his demands had found popular resonance. That the siege coincided with an arrest order by the Supreme Court against Prime Minister Raja Parvez Ashraff in a corruption case led to speculation that Pakistan was is in the midst of a well orchestrated “soft coup.” The sudden emergence of Mr. Qadri on Pakistan’s political scene three months before elections are due, and his deep pockets, reinforced suspicion that he had powerful backers. Though the Pakistani Army strenuously distanced itself from him, it has made no secret of its contempt for the PPP government. It is seen to have held its hand so far only because ruling Pakistan directly is fraught with danger to itself. Still, as relations with India plunge into uncertainty, and with the Afghanistan “endgame” on the horizon, the military may not be averse to a malleable proxy.
If Mr. Qadri is indeed that proxy, what seems to have thwarted these designs was the determined and unified decision of opposition political parties against joining hands with him. Leaders such as Nawaz Sharif and Imran Khan are waiting in the wings for the next election. Their unequivocal stand strengthened the government’s hands. More than that, it showed that Pakistan’s politicians have come a long way since the 1990s, when they were only too eager to fall in line with anti-democratic plots. As of Thursday evening, government representatives were negotiating with Mr. Qadri for a peaceful dispersal of the sit-in. His rally may have fizzled out but he has succeeded in delivering the strong message that a dysfunctional government creates danger for itself, particularly in Pakistan where there is no shortage of political adventurers waiting to step in.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-politics-of-a-messiah/article4316801.ece
18,1,2013,Salvaging the dream,"It was only after the U.S. aviation regulator ordered the grounding of all Boeing 787 Dreamliners that India reacted to the spate of safety issues that has arisen about the aircraft in recent weeks. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has now grounded Air India’s six 787s till further orders, depending on Boeing’s probe and its report. Two Japanese airlines — ANA and JAL — which own the largest fleet of about 50 Dreamliners now in operation worldwide, were the first to ground their entire fleet of 787s in the wake of a series of incidents involving the plane. Such safety issues are not new to either Boeing or any other manufacturer, especially during a new aircraft’s initial phase of operation. The 777 also went through many teething problems before establishing itself as a reliable long-range option. Boeing began work on the 787 in 2003 and the first commercial deliveries took place in 2011. Even in the early tests and trials, a range of problems was noticed and tackled. Some of them have now recurred and a few other issues have cropped up too. All these need to be addressed and the airlines as well as passengers assured of the airplane’s complete safety in the air.
The nature or problems encountered in recent days and weeks relate to the first time use of lithium-ion batteries, fuel and oil leaks, engine trouble, electronics, and in one incident, cracks in the cabin windscreen, as also a crack on a wing. Boeing used carbon-fiber composites in the making of the aircraft, as they were lighter and stronger than aluminum. Though they may make the aircraft fuel efficient, structural questions have to be handled. Fuel leaks and the batteries perhaps cause the most concern for the manufacturer, airlines and the passengers. The rechargeable lithium-ion batteries are touted as major power and fuel savers, but the problem is the liquid inside them is flammable. Taken together with the problem of fuel leaks, this makes the batteries a major safety issue. There is so much at stake for Boeing because it has orders for another 800 of these signature planes, built to carry between 210 and 296 passengers. The company may also have to compensate its customers for the grounding of these planes till they are certified fully fit by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. The airlines which ordered the long-haul, wide-bodied aircraft did so because of the promised fuel efficiency, and the package that the manufacturer offered as an incentive. Though the listed price of a 787 is about $206 million, early buyers got it at perhaps half that price. But safety and security factors outweigh all other considerations and these must be guaranteed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Salvaging-the-dream/article12307052.ece
19,1,2013,Just another dope cheat,"Even if he had to look up the meaning of the word and found nothing of him to fit the description, Lance Armstrong is a cheat. The doping admissions made by the cycling legend in an exclusive interview with Oprah Winfrey on Thursday might not be shocking to those who had all along doubted his credibility, but to those, including thousands of cancer survivors, who believed in his myth, this must be a shattering revelation. In what is surely one of the most sensational admissions the world of sport has ever witnessed, the American confessed that he had doped for his record seven Tour de France titles from 1999 through to 2005. In all but justifying doping in the ‘win-at-all-costs’ culture that he followed, Armstrong has raised further doubts about the integrity of not just cycling but all sports where the doping menace has been in focus since Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was packed off from the Seoul Olympic Games in 1988 after testing positive for a steroid. Armstrong’s admissions should also raise misgivings over the efforts of anti-doping authorities in tackling the menace at the highest level, even if no complicity of officials is established in any possible cover-up during his ‘fabled’ career, as had often been alleged.
As we applaud the meticulous case that the U.S. Anti Doping Agency (USADA) pieced together against the American icon that led to his life-ban and loss of titles last October, we should not lose sight of the investigative zeal of a handful of journalists who pursued the truth against threats and defamation suits for well over a decade. David Walsh of the Sunday Times heads that list. The role of fellow cyclists — led by the discredited Tour de France winner of 2006, Floyd Landis, and disqualified Athens Olympic gold medal winner Tyler Hamilton — in exposing Armstrong after years of denials, should also not be discounted, though both belong to the list of ‘dopers’ that the sport has produced through the past decade. Armstrong’s assertion that doping was a “level playing field” only strengthens the belief that the sport needs cleansing through a programme monitored by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Both WADA and USADA have demanded that Armstrong confess on oath to bring this shameful chapter to a close. They are right, since many still believe Armstrong might not have told the whole truth for fear of far-reaching legal and financial implications. A Federal investigation into allegations against him was closed without explanation last February and there could be justification in re-opening it. As Armstrong joins a long list of dope cheats who went out in disgrace, we can only lament the erosion of values that has brought sport to such a pass.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/just-another-dope-cheat/article4320281.ece
19,1,2013,No protection from prosecution,"Politicians who mastermind corruption usually manage to stay out of the reach of the long arm of the law. That they can get officials and underlings to do the dirty job is often sufficient protection from prosecution for those elected to public office. When a special court of the Central Bureau of Investigation convicted 55 persons in a teacher recruitment scam on Wednesday, the most striking aspect was not the scale or size of the crime, but the nailing of former Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala. Both Mr. Chautala and his son Ajay were found guilty of conspiring to replace the original selection lists with fake ones to fill over 3,000 teacher vacancies. Special CBI Judge Vinod Kumar took into account file notings and a “chain of circumstances” that implicated the former Chief Minister as the “main conspirator” in the scam. Mr. Chautala thus joins the few politicians who have been convicted of corruption. Other than Sukh Ram, R. Balakrishna Pillai, and Bangaru Laxman, not many top politicians have had to see the inside of a jail on being convicted of corruption. Of these Mr. Laxman, who as president of the Bharatiya Janata Party was caught on camera accepting a bribe from an undercover reporter, held no public office. Most cases against politicians in high office come to naught, as they meander to a tame acquittal after years of investigation and prosecution. Those that end in conviction usually do not involve the conspirator-politician, but only lowly officials.
Interestingly, the CBI court threw out the objection that the CBI was biased in the case and was working at the instance of the Congress, a rival of Mr. Chautala’s Indian National Lok Dal. That the CBI has often served as the handmaiden of the party ruling at the Centre is undeniable, but this is no argument against the verdict in a case that was taken to its logical conclusion on the basis of available evidence. The recent increase in the rate of conviction of politicians for corruption could be on account of the activism of sections of civil society for a strong Lok Pal. Indeed, the scam is another reminder about the importance of having strong institutional mechanisms to prevent and punish corruption among persons holding public office. The importance of a free and empowered Lok Pal is evident now more than ever before. In a scenario where political motives are attributed to investigators and prosecutors, the independence and credibility of the investigating agencies and the judiciary will have to be protected at all costs. Instead of using parliamentary procedures and select committees as delaying tactics, the government must push through a Lok Pal Bill with teeth.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/No-protection-from-prosecution/article12308650.ece
21,1,2013,Rahul is willing,"Rahul Gandhi has finally assumed the number two slot in the Congress — a role that has been his for the asking. Yet in the time-honoured tradition of the First Family, he resisted the inevitable. For years, Rahul displayed an aloofness and disinterest that drove Congresspersons to the edge of despair. Not surprisingly, there was unbound joy when the expected happened at the party’s conclave in Jaipur on Saturday. Although there is no official word on this yet, it is a fair bet that Rahul will lead the Congress into the 2014 general election. For the rank and file, a Nehru-Gandhi in line for the prime ministership is a cherished wish that has gone unfulfilled ever since Rajiv Gandhi lost the 1989 general election. The Congress has till date not come to terms with the fact that in 2004, Sonia Gandhi passed up the opportunity to become Prime Minister, choosing instead to nominate Manmohan Singh in her place.
In his time, Rajiv was as much the reluctant heir-apparent: he came into politics against his will and found himself made Prime Minister by circumstances not of his making. In the case of Rahul, the die was cast the moment he stepped into politics. Indeed, the Nehru-Gandhis could be royalty and the Congress a monarchy judging from the way a clan member is automatically assumed to have first rights over leadership. For Rahul this is the easier part of his job, which he has inherited at the worst possible juncture with challenges to the Congress coming at full speed from multiple directions. From corruption to social unrest to diminishing electoral returns in the States, not to mention the dire state of the economy, the Congress is up against impossible odds. The Congress chief was candid enough to admit to the problems at Jaipur. Ms Gandhi correctly diagnosed the disconnect between her party’s old-school outlook and the larger aspirations of today’s angry and assertive youth force (the sentiment was echoed by Rahul in his own speech). Yet some of her solutions were simplistic, including the suggestion to partypersons to avoid ostentation as a way of fighting corruption. The corruption that has reached the highest echelons in the Congress surely belongs in a bigger league. The refusal of party and government to acknowledge this fact has been made worse by their arrogance towards the common citizenry. If all this were not enough, Rahul also faces a potential adversary in Narendra Modi, should the Bharatiya Janata Party project him as its prime ministerial candidate. Nonetheless, Rahul must be complimented on choosing to walk the difficult path at a difficult time — and understanding that defeat and victory are as much part of life as they are of politics.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rahul-is-willing/article4326503.ece
21,1,2013,Lessons from Algeria,"The Algerian government’s determined use of force, including helicopter gunships, at the gas plant at Tigantourine near In Amenas in the eastern part of the country has achieved the recapture of the plant from a group calling itself Those Who Sign in Blood, a splinter group of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), at the cost of 23 hostages’ lives. The group attacked a bus taking foreign workers of several nationalities from Tigantourine to In Amenas airport early on the morning of January 16; when repulsed by a police escort, the attackers turned on the plant itself, which is part-run by British Petroleum, the Norwegian firm Statoil and Algeria’s Sonatrach, and serviced by JGC Corp of Japan; hundreds were taken hostage. Local reports state that the attackers freed some 600 Algerian and 41 foreign staff unharmed within a day. At the time of writing, 32 of the 40 terrorists who had taken them hostage had also been killed. The group leader, Abdel Rahman al-Nigeri, was among them, but the fear is that AQIM may escalate its activities in the region.
The motivation for the attack is far from clear. Mokhtar Belmokhtar, an Algerian who belongs to al-Qaeda and is said to fund his group through cigarette smuggling and ransoms for the release of kidnapped foreigners, may have been behind the attack, which his aides claim was a reaction to the French military intervention in Mali against combined Tuareg and extreme Islamist forces. Tigantourine, however, is on the other side of Algeria, 1,100 km from the Algeria-Mali border. Significantly, released hostages say the attackers knew their way around the plant; that they started by targeting the bus carrying foreign workers also suggests inside knowledge and advance planning. Whatever Belmokhtar’s motivations, the episode has thrown several countries into confusion. The attack, the first on an Algerian hydrocarbon plant, has clear implications for Europe, which seeks access to Sahelian fossil fuels in view of uncertainties over supplies from elsewhere in the world. More importantly, it confirms the theory that the threat from al-Qaeda has become more complex and “de-territorialised” than ever before. While the Algerians cannot be faulted for taking on the hostage-takers, the threat posed by terror networks that are at once global, local and highly mobile requires careful handling. At the domestic level, governments must ensure that terrorists do not succeed in provoking the curtailment of civil liberties and freedoms. And at the international level, the highest degree of cooperation at the intelligence and tactical level is essential between law enforcement agencies in the West, the Maghreb region, West Asia and South Asia.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lessons-from-algeria/article4326499.ece
22,1,2013,Diluting GAAR,"In postponing the General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR) of taxation to April 2016 and reducing its rigour, the United Progressive Alliance government has accepted most of the Parthasarathi Shome Committee’s recommendations. Since GAAR has been incorporated in the Finance Act 2012, its deferment can be formalised only during the forthcoming budget. To justify the postponement, the Committee had cited, among other reasons, the need to train tax officials in the finer aspects of international taxation. Days after the government’s announcement, the stock markets that have, of late, been driven by foreign institutional investors (FII) reached new highs. The GAAR decision, coming just weeks before the Union budget, ought to be seen as one of the many signals the government has been sending to revive the ‘animal spirits’ of foreign investors, domestic entrepreneurs and rentiers, in this case specifically to assure them of the continuance of a less onerous tax regime. Some of its other decisions, such as the hike in railway fares before the railway budget and the permission to public sector oil marketing companies to hike diesel prices in a graded manner, are meant to reinforce the perception of a government not loath to take tough, unpopular decisions. Yet the important takeaway from the modified GAAR is that it is meant to please the FIIs and portfolio managers even if, in the process, sound principles of public finance are diluted.
A significant change is to have a multi-member panel comprising just one senior tax official to determine the applicability of GAAR to specific transactions. The expectation is that the inclusion of a judicial and an academic member will ease concerns over possible high-handed behaviour by the tax authorities in their desire to maximise tax revenue. However, only the tax official in the GAAR panel will be accountable to the income tax department and the government. In another important clarification, it has been decided that GAAR will cover only those transactions whose main purpose — as opposed to one of the main purposes — is to get a tax benefit. As a result of this change, the onus of proof on the tax authorities rises exponentially. The status of double taxation avoidance agreements in a post-GAAR regime is still a matter of conjecture. Perhaps the most controversial decision is to exclude offshore derivative instruments, the so-called participatory notes or PN, from GAAR. This is a retreat from the government’s stated position of wanting to know the identity of PN holders, and is a serious setback to anti-money laundering efforts. Once again, as so often in recent times, the government has opted for short-term expediency to support the external sector.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/diluting-gaar/article4329570.ece
22,1,2013,Not by military means alone,"The French military intervention in Mali, which started on January 11, has predictably caused international shockwaves. President François Hollande has increased his forces from 1,700 to 2,000, and French warplanes based near the capital, Bamako, have attacked the central towns of Konna and Diabaly, retaking the latter according to latest reports. Several European countries have offered logistical support, and the EU plans to help an African force under United Nations auspices. The French operation was triggered by the fall of Konna to rebel forces, who combine long-standing Tuareg secessionists with members of the homegrown extreme Islamist group Ansar Dine, as well as regional extremist outfits such as al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa. Ansar Dine holds Timbuktu, a United Nations World Heritage site, and has destroyed ancient Islamic monuments because they don’t conform to the group’s Salafist beliefs. In addition, it has imposed a rigid form of the Sharia and banned all music from areas it controls.
Mr. Hollande’s action is lawful. It does not need French parliamentary approval, and the President only has to inform that body. In addition, Mali itself requested French intervention, which the U.N. Security Council unanimously backed on January 14, and on the ground, southern Malians and the French public have praised Paris’s move. Problems are, however, intensifying. The U.N. says 412,000 people have fled the north, and the conflict has affected five million in all. Al-Qaeda supporters could launch attacks in France, and the Malian army cannot win on its own. After the 2012 coup, the army immediately lost Timbuktu and Gao, and now some of its troops are reportedly refusing to follow orders. Moreover, the 3,300-strong force agreed to by the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) has not yet been assembled nor is it clear if it will have the equipment and approach needed to do the job. Ansar Dine also has sophisticated weapons left over from the French and western-inspired overthrow of Muammar Qadhafi in Libya. Mr. Hollande says France has no mission to stay long in Mali, but his defence minister says the aim is “total reconquest,” which could imply a prolonged campaign. Moreover, the Malian government has made no apparent attempt to engage politically with the north. Yet the Tuaregs, who are only one northern group, have now offered to cooperate with Ecowas troops against Ansar Dine. Therefore, France would do far better to combine military support for the Malian government with pressure on the authorities in Bamako to negotiate with the Tuaregs and other northern groups.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/not-by-military-means-alone/article4329569.ece
23,1,2013,Think before you talk,"The chintan shivir was a party session, and Sushilkumar Shinde seemed to have been in some confusion over his roles as senior Congress leader and as Union Home Minister when he attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh for “ >inciting Hindu terrorism” through “training camps.” While he had every right to criticise the BJP and the RSS for their policies and programmes at a party forum, Mr. Shinde should have realised his responsibility as Union Home Minister and not triggered a fusillade of allegations that were short on substance and long on rhetoric. There is a larger irony in Mr. Shinde’s over-the-top rhetoric. For the longest time, the intelligence agencies and police across India refused to take the threat posed by Hindutva extremists seriously and framed innocent Muslim youth for the blasts in Hyderabad and Malegaon. When evidence first emerged of a Hindutva terror network, the authorities took forever to connect the dots. Instead of punishing those in the police who tortured innocent men in Hyderabad and elsewhere, and quietly but doggedly going after the real perpetrators, the minister has reduced the problem to one of politics. Not only did Mr. Shinde fail to provide evidence for his allegations, he has no explanation for his government not having acted on these serious charges. If he really has proof that the opposition party is inciting terrorism, why has he not prosecuted its leaders? There is no doubt that some BJP leaders interceded on behalf of those accused of the terrorist bombing in Malegaon. But surely the worst they are guilty of in that case is bad judgment, not abetment or incitement.
Mr. Shinde’s use of the phrase ‘Hindu terrorism’ to describe terror acts committed by fanatics in the name of their religion is as objectionable, and inaccurate, as the use of the term ‘Muslim terrorism,’ but the BJP should not be in denial about the fact that such acts do indeed take place. Independent India’s first terrorist crime was the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi by Nathuram Godse, a man driven by the ideology of Hindutva. As for the present, the police have said the bomb blasts aboard the Pakistan-bound Samjhauta Express, and at mosques in Hyderabad and Malegaon, were carried out by extremists with “links” to the RSS and other Hindutva-oriented factions. It is possible, even likely, that those arrested are just the tip of a bigger iceberg. Nevertheless, Mr. Shinde had no business blithely connecting these incidents to the BJP without proof. India has enough trouble facing up to the terrorist threat without it being made a political tool by the Congress to fling reckless charges. Empty rhetoric can only aid, not hurt, terrorism.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/think-before-you-talk/article4333215.ece
23,1,2013,A perverse move,"The government was dragging its feet for long on the subject of freeing diesel pricing and eliminating subsidies but when it did act last week, it got its policy all wrong. Oil companies have been given the freedom to charge market price for diesel supplied to bulk consumers such as the railways and state transport corporations while prices at the pump level will move up marginally. Retail prices will eventually catch up with the market, assuming that the oil companies raise prices at regular intervals. Market pricing for bulk consumers may prune the subsidy bill of the government significantly but it is a perverse policy because those who deserve the subsidy — the poor and lower classes who use public transport — will now be forced to part with more money for their daily commute or travel. State transport corporations will have no option but to pass on the higher fuel costs to their passengers given their already fragile financial state and the inability of fiscally-strapped State governments to reduce excise; the Railways have already increased fares and train tickets will anyway cost more from today. The perversity of the government’s decision will be evident if one considers that those who drive passenger cars — including high-end SUVs — that run on diesel engines will continue to enjoy the subsidy and pay at least Rs 10 a litre less than the bulk consumers. At the best of times, this is not a segment that deserves to be subsidised by the government. But for rich motorists to benefit when poor commuters are penalised upends all notions of equity.
The government seems to have gone for a politically expedient and administratively simple solution as opposed to other, more contentious but equitable options to reduce its subsidy burden and keep its own finances in shape. A cess or higher excise duty on diesel cars and SUVs that guzzle up subsidised fuel would have addressed the twin issues of reducing the fiscal burden of subsiding diesel while also eliminating the economic rent derived by passenger car manufacturers who price diesel vehicles at a high premium to petrol ones. This rent is a direct product of the higher demand for diesel cars compared to petrol due to the large price difference between the two fuels. Alternatively, the government could have seriously examined the feasibility of introducing dual pricing whereby trucks and cars can be charged differently with the former alone enjoying the subsidised price. The final option, of course, would have been to free prices across the board with only the Railways and state transport corporations allowed supplies at a subsidised price. Such a move would have ensured equity by ensuring that those who use public transport are protected while private, individual transport is made to pay the market price.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-perverse-move/article4333214.ece

Mr. Gadkari was hoping to make history as the >first BJP chief to have earned a second consecutive three-year term via an amendment to the party’s constitution. Instead he has made history as the first party chief to have been ousted minutes away from winning a second term. Party and pundits alike had assumed that the contest was over, bar the shouting. Indeed, the outgoing chief led a charmed life, surviving not just serious charges of financial wrongdoing but multiple internal mutinies targeted at securing his exit ahead of the election for the top party post. But all the malcontents put together could not budge the chief from his place for the simple reason that he existed at the pleasure of the BJP’s command centre at Delhi’s Jhandewalan. A baffling bond held together Mr. Gadkari and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The outgoing BJP chief was hardly the quintessential sangh ideologue. He did not flaunt his nationalist credentials or declaim with passion on Hindutva. Nor did he fit the other sangh ideals of personal austerity and probity.
On the contrary, Mr. Gadkari seemed to subscribe to an entrepreneurial model that was liberal in its interpretation of business ethics. As much was proved when the full extent of the Purti Group’s dealings, complete with dubious crossholdings and funding patterns, was revealed. The end was precipitated by income tax raids on Mr. Gadkari’s network of companies hours before his re-election. The moment was naturally seized by Mr. Gadkari’s opponents, some of whom had tried to force the issue by threatening to contest against him. The months ahead will be as much a test for Mr. Rajnath Singh as it will be for the RSS, which in a desperate attempt to show its authority, vetoed Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley for the party post. Obviously Mr. Singh, with his proven loyalty to the sangh, was preferable to those with bigger reputations. In an earlier presidential stint, Mr. Singh had replaced Lal Krishna Advani who was shown the door as punishment for praising Mohammad Ali Jinnah. For all that the Gadkari chapter has ended, the story is only half complete. The BJP’s real challenge will come later when it decides its Prime Ministerial candidate conscious of the fact that the line of aspirants will be led by the divisive figure of Narendra Modi. The Gujarat Chief Minister has a frenzied following among the parivar’s rank and file but he is also ambitious and authoritarian and comes with baggage that cannot augur well for the expansion of the National Democratic Alliance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unceremonious-exit/article4336864.ece
24,1,2013,Taking on gold imports,"The >hike in Customs duty on gold imports by 2 percentage points to 6 per cent was entirely expected, although a similar hike in the case of platinum imports was not. In the government’s view, higher gold prices might drive some traditional gold users to its likely substitute. Indeed, the Finance Minister had more than once hinted at a hike in tariffs for the yellow metal; the only question was the timing. Along with the imports of petroleum and edible oils, the purchase of gold from abroad has contributed to a widening trade imbalance and, consequently, to a clearly unsustainable current account deficit (CAD). During the second quarter of this year (July-September 2012-13), the CAD had widened to a record 5.4 per cent of GDP, well above official projections. The insatiable appetite for gold has cost the country dear: in value terms, gold imports nearly doubled from $29.9 billion in 2008-09 to $56.5 billion in 2011-12. Most of such imports have been inelastic and the government is only too aware that higher tariff might drive the gold trade underground. Besides, there is the genuine concern about India’s booming jewellery industry, which relies heavily on gold imports. Yet the macroeconomic dimensions are such that the government has been forced to take the tariff route to check demand. Simultaneously, it has done well to initiate a few steps to increase the domestic supply of gold for productive purposes.
The gold deposit scheme is being given a face-lift so that it can lure more investors. Introduced in 1999, the scheme has not exactly been a roaring success. Operated by a few banks, it allows investors to trade in a minimum of 200 grams of gold for a gold certificate which will be redeemable after 3 to 5 years either as gold or cash. Banks pay a nominal interest that is tax free in the hands of the investor. Such concessions notwithstanding, the scheme has been a failure: very few investors want to surrender their gold stock, especially when it is in the form of inherited jewellery, which has a sentimental value to them. Even with the new incentives announced — a lower lock in period for instance — it is very doubtful that this trend will be reversed. This is where the second policy announcement permitting gold exchange traded funds to deposit a portion of their gold holdings with banks assumes significance. These measures are small steps towards harnessing idle gold holdings for productive purposes. Many more innovative schemes such as gold-backed deposit schemes will be necessary. Over the medium term, however, unless inflation is checked, it will be unrealistic to expect a significant fall in gold demand.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/taking-on-gold-imports/article4336865.ece
31,1,2013,Elementary failure,"The Ministry of Human Resource Development recently informed Parliament, that 12 States in the country could not meet the demand for professionally qualified teachers. Moreover, there are more than 8.7 lakh teachers in the country who do not have the necessary training to perform their role. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that the independent annual study by the >ASER Centre into schooling outcomes in rural India has found a steady decline in student performance in key areas such as reading, comprehension and arithmetic, although enrolment rates remain high. Failure to upgrade the capabilities of school teachers in rural areas has contributed to a situation where more than 53 per cent of the students in class five could not read a text intended for those in class two, up from 46 per cent two years ago. If government schools were segregated for analysis, the figure was even higher, at over 58 per cent. The number of students who were unable to do simple arithmetic problems involving subtraction and division commensurate with their level of education also rose during 2012 compared with the previous year. In the case of division problems, three-fourths of the students were not in a position to do their sums.
If students in rural India are doing badly, there are other worrying trends too. The ASER findings underscore rising enrolment in private schools since 2006, touching over 28 per cent nationally; in the case of some States, even 60 per cent. This is a clear pointer to the Centre’s failure to assume responsibility for good schooling and deploy the massive funds collected through the education cess to achieve encouraging outcomes. It must now lose no time in ensuring that the norms laid down under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, particularly on teacher-student ratios are implemented, and enhance the quality of in-service training for teachers. Physical infrastructure is also a determinant of the overall schooling experience. Here too, the ASER data point to neglect: 80 per cent of the schools inspected had separate toilets for girls, but only half of the facilities were in a usable condition. Again, 13 per cent of the schools were found not providing a mid-day meal, removing a key incentive for students. It is also pertinent to point out that rural students are not spared the need to attend private tuitions to improve their prospects. This is further confirmation of the disconnect between government’s efforts at improving educational quality, and student expectations. A focus on higher education to create a skilled workforce is certainly necessary, but the edifice cannot rest on a school system rendered hollow by policy myopia.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/elementary-failure/article4361818.ece
31,1,2013,Beyond Tipu’s name,"It is by any measure a curious higher education initiative: five new ‘minority’ universities to be set up under the aegis of the Union Ministry of Minority Affairs, run as ‘public-private’ partnerships, and located in five States of the country that have sizeable minority populations. The scheme, mooted by Union Minister for Minority Affairs K. Rahman Khan, and currently under deliberation by a team of education experts led by Indian Council of Social Science Research chairperson Sukhadeo Thorat, is still very much at the drawing-board stage. However, the announcement by Mr. Khan that one of the universities would be set up in Srirangapatna and named after Tipu Sultan, the iconic 18th century ruler of Mysore who made the river-island his capital, drew the predictable roar of protest from those quarters in Karnataka that have been consistently hostile to the secular and progressive legacy of Tipu Sultan. The Higher Education minister in the Bharatiya Janata Party government, C.T. Ravi’s stated opposition to a “Muslim” university named after a “foreigner” is not only avowedly communal but misleading too. The university, if and when it comes into existence, will be a ‘minority’ institution and not be just for Muslims. Secondly, though the present government has in the past tried hard to exorcise Tipu from school textbooks, his contributions to the fight against colonialism is an inalienable part of our history. It is therefore entirely fitting that a centre of higher education to be set up in Srirangapatna be named after him.
More problematic, however, is the legal and jurisdictional ambiguity in the very scheme of setting up a string of minority universities. A seven-member expert committee under Professor Thorat, which is to submit its report on February 15, is to consider whether these institutions will be set up under an Act of Parliament or as autonomous institutions of national importance. As these universities will come directly under the overarching jurisdiction of the Ministry for Human Resource Development, they are clearly incompatible as enterprises based on ‘public-private’ partnership. Indeed the chequered track record of this model in other spheres is a serious cause for concern. The Sachar Committee Report noted that only four per cent of Muslims in India are graduates, and that the gap between Muslims and other socio-religious categories increases as the level of education increases. While this imposes greater urgency upon the government to address the under-representation of minorities in higher education, a hasty and ill-thought out mechanism runs the risk of becoming yet another exercise in tokenism.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/beyond-tipus-name/article4361815.ece
1,2,2013,Cat among the pigeons,"The Bharatiya Janata Party can neither live with Narendra Modi nor live without him. The Gujarat Chief Minister is such a deeply polarising figure that the mere suggestion of him running for Prime Minister in 2014 is enough to start a mini war in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. And for the same reason that he puts off the BJP’s allies, Mr. Modi has electrified sections of his party. Indeed, if the BJP’s till now comatose rank and file are suddenly showing signs of life, it is because they see the party returning to its old, robustly militant character under the divisive, muscular leadership of Mr. Modi. Ironically, the Gujarat CM also appears to have activated a clutch of yesteryear party leaders for whom he is a means to their own rehabilitation. That Mr. Modi would loom large over the BJP was a given in the backdrop of his expected third consecutive victory in the Gujarat Assembly election. Of course, the Chief Minister was deceptively modest on the stump, his unwavering focus on Gujarat and its “six crore Gujaratis.” But as soon as the election was won, Delhi zoomed into sight and the man who promised to “live and die” for Gujarat addressed his local audience in Hindi. The message set off an internecine internal battle which ended in the purge of BJP helmsman Nitin Gadkari — the erstwhile party president’s business practices were undoubtedly questionable but he appears to have paid the price more for having taken on Mr. Modi at one time.
It is far too much of a coincidence that the men who engineered Mr. Gadkari’s ouster are also in the forefront of demanding Mr. Modi’s immediate elevation to Prime Minister-in-waiting. The father-son pair of Ram and Mahesh Jethmalani, ably assisted by Yashwant Sinha, had long campaigned for Mr. Gadkari to be replaced by Mr. Modi as party chief. But the RSS would not hear of this; instead the BJP’s spiritual mentor had the Jethmalanis axed from the party even while backing Mr. Gadkari to the hilt. With Mr. Gadkari finally and irrevocably gone, Project Modi has expectedly gained swift momentum, with who else but the Jethmalanis and Mr. Sinha leading the charge. It is a point to note that not one member of the BJP’s top rung has endorsed Mr. Modi’s candidature, maintaining instead that the party has many capable leaders. The reason for this is two-fold. The larger parivar’s discomfiture with Mr. Modi’s authoritarian style. And secondly, the knowledge that he could be a roadblock in the expansion of the NDA. The Janata Dal (United) has already expressed itself against Mr. Modi, and surprisingly, even the Shiv Sena has not come around, preferring Sushma Swaraj to the Gujarat Chief Minister.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/cat-among-the-pigeons/article4365917.ece
1,2,2013,Nothing for the Palestinians,"The Israeli Central Election Committee’s announcement of the final results for the January 22 general election shows a sharp fall in support for the Likud-led coalition under Binyamin Netanyahu. Mr. Netanyahu will remain Prime Minister, but his right-wing Likud Yisrael Beiteinu alliance has lost over a quarter of its members in the 120-member Knesset, plummeting from 42 to 31 seats. Under the fully proportional electoral system, which has a 2 per cent threshold, Shelly Yachimovich’s Labor Party made an unexpected recovery to win 15 seats, a gain of seven, and the ultra-nationalist Jewish Home Party under Naftali Bennett gained six to finish with 11, tying with Eli Yishai’s Shas, also on the Right. The biggest surprise, however, was the performance of the newest party, Yesh Atid (There is a Future) under former political journalist Yair Lapid, which despite being formed only in April 2012, won 19 seats to move the composition of the Knesset firmly towards the centre of Israeli politics.
The centre-left and right parliamentary blocs will be divided exactly in two if Arab parties such as the Arab List-Taal are included with the former. Mr. Netanyahu must anyway try to form a coalition with Mr. Lapid, who campaigned on socio-economic issues and an end to the exemption of orthodox Jews from military service; he now demands the finance ministership and the chair of the Knesset Finance Committee for his party. According to a national report, almost a quarter of all Israelis live in poverty, and in 2011 the Netanyahu government was rocked by unprecedented public protests against rising prices and other such problems. Yet while those issues are significant, the apparent shift in voters’ concerns from national security to economic matters means that the vestigial peace process will be neglected even further. None of the main parties dare admit that the settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are illegal, that even Israel’s closest and least critical ally, the United States, thinks that too, and that continued expansion of the settlements only compounds the illegality. Even the 700-km long separation barrier which Israel is putting between itself and the West Bank Palestinians is leading Israelis to think less and not more about a just and lasting peace with the Palestinians. It is also likely that far-right parties will shift Mr. Netanyahu rightwards by putting pressure on any government he can cobble together. Even as the politicians campaigned, Israeli troops shot dead five unarmed young Palestinians, including a woman, in the first few weeks of 2013; the rights group B’Tselem says none posed a threat. For the Palestinians, the tragic truth is that this election will change nothing.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/nothing-for-the-palestinians/article4365918.ece
2,2,2013,Governance at its nadir,"“In permanent strife” perhaps best describes the five-year record of the Bharatiya Janata Party government in Karnataka. With no more than three and a half months for the term of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly to end, the government has run into yet another stretch of political rapids. Fourteen legislators, including two ministers, resigned from the House and the BJP to join the Karnataka Janata Party headed by the former Chief Minister, B.S. Yeddyurappa. The ‘party with a difference’ — which is how the BJP liked to present itself in less fractious times — is today a ‘party with many differences.’ Over the last five years there have been 10 occasions when serious factional infighting broke out in the BJP, bringing the government to the brink. The latest round of discord brings the ruling party uncomfortably close to losing its majority in the Assembly. In a House whose strength has come down from 225 to 210, the BJP now has only 106 members (including an Independent). Facing the slog overs in a limited overs game, Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar hopes to use the budget on February 8 as his final sixer.
In hindsight, it is clear that the BJP’s inherent instability stemmed from the artificial majority it enjoyed in the House (through the support of five Independents), and, more importantly, the tactics it employed to retain and expand its slender majority. Crafted by Mr. Yeddyurappa in the good old days when he was helmsman of the BJP in the State, the plan, code-named “Operation Lotus,” involved persuading willing Opposition MLAs to quit, win the by-elections on a BJP ticket, and then join the ministry. Party old-timers allied to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh never reconciled themselves to the brash new entrants who quickly established their dominance. This group remains Mr. Yeddyurappa’s support base in the KJP. As and when Assembly elections are held, the BJP will go to the electorate carrying a sorry report card. Its government presided over monumental scandals that included a vast illegal iron-ore mining operation in Bellary and several land-grab cases involving prominent BJP leaders. Law and order has also been a problem, especially in regions where sangh parivar activists have sought to flex their muscles. So focussed was the party on its own survival strategies that several of its poll promises, most notably that of re-working the poverty line and ensuring rice at Rs. 2 per kg to the poor, were forgotten. Having done little to counter the effects of an unprecedented drought last year, the BJP is likely to make cynical use of the forthcoming budget as a tool of economic populism. Whether this will enable it to retrieve lost ground is another matter.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/governance-at-its-nadir/article4369664.ece
2,2,2013,Clinton’s legacy for Kerry,"Following a unanimous recommendation by the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a full Senate vote of 94 to three, President Barack Obama’s nominee, John Kerry, has become the U.S. Secretary of State, succeeding Hillary Rodham Clinton in the post. Mr. Kerry now ceases to be the senior senator for Massachusetts, a State he has served for 28 years and nearly five terms, and also vacates the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee. His predecessor at the Department of State will be a hard act to follow for the energy she brought to her duties, in the course of which she visited 112 countries during a time of global turbulence and a decline in direct U.S. influence. Ms Clinton and Mr. Obama also succeeded in devising a working relationship so as not to exacerbate the differences which had emerged between them in the acrimonious and even bitter Democratic 2008 primary campaign. Ms Clinton’s record as Secretary of State is, however, mixed. On the positive side, in 2011 she warned Pakistan about the consequences of failing to shut down safe havens from which Afghan extremists attacked Americans and Afghans; in January of the same year, she criticised West Asian leaders over the risks their countries would face if they did not democratise their political systems and reduce corruption.
Ms Clinton’s less successful ventures will nevertheless leave lasting problems. She took responsibility over the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador and some of his staff in Benghazi, but failed to assuage the anger of Congressional Republicans. Secondly, in March 2011, she insisted Washington intervene to prevent civilian casualties in Libya; the results include the Malian civil war, the spread of al-Qaeda in North Africa, and a flood of leftover weapons across the region. Ms Clinton’s legacy on Syria and Iran are not inspiring; her strident rejection of diplomatic initiatives on both of these fronts has pushed the region closer towards confrontation. Israel, for its part, still does as it likes, and ignores repeated Obama administration requests to stop building illegal settlements in the Occupied Territories in full confidence that the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives and the powerful American pro-Zionist lobby will paralyse the White House on this. In addition, the U.S. drone warfare policy, which is outside State Department control, will fuel more anti-Americanism in many areas of the world. Therefore, Mr. Kerry’s own strong preference for diplomacy over war will not win universal agreement, but it could turn out to be his strongest asset and may never have been needed more.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/clintons-legacy-for-kerry/article4369667.ece
4,2,2013,Wanted: A Verma ordinance,"The ordinance on sexual assault cleared by the Union Cabinet and signed into law on Sunday by the President is problematic, not in what it seeks to achieve, but in what it does not attempt to redress. If this is all that the government intends to do on the basis of the Justice Verma Committee report, then, quite worryingly, the nationwide protests and expressions of outrage at rape and other sexual crimes against women have had little effect on policymakers. The committee’s recommendations relating to marital rape, police reform, and prosecution of security personnel charged with sexual assault under ordinary criminal law, have all been blanked out. On some issues, like the imposition of the death penalty, the ordinance does exactly the opposite of what the report recommended. This, despite the overwhelming majority of women’s organisations concurring with the committee’s reasoned stand. If the government adopts the report’s recommendations in toto or very substantially — as it ought to were it to be serious about fighting the menace of sexual violence — the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act cannot survive in its present form. And, policing and police administration will have to change drastically. In cherry picking from the report, the government appears to have dumped the hard parts and held up a diluted version as its core. The cabinet seems to have taken up the least controversial recommendations, and packed them into an ordinance to avoid any extended debate on the wider issues and sidestep criticism that it was slow to act.
The other recommendations in the report might need further study, debate and fine-tuning before implementation, but they must remain on the reform agenda for prompt implementation, and not be brushed aside in silence. Whether there was an urgent need to bring in an ordinance when Parliament is to meet in three weeks for the budget session is questionable, especially when the provisions cannot be applied retrospectively to the Delhi rape-and-murder case. However, sexual crimes against women have not come down since the sensational Delhi case, and the government must have felt the ordinance could be of some deterrent and punitive value. So long as the bill to replace the present ordinance is well-drafted and comprehensive, there will be little room for complaint. The real problem, then, is not what the government has done, but what it appears unwilling to do. By all accounts, it does not have the political will to push ahead with the most substantive points in the Justice Verma Committee report. And this is unlikely to change without sustained pressure from civil society and people’s movements.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/wanted-a-verma-ordinance/article4375579.ece
4,2,2013,Watery Mars,"Mars might have been cold and dry with a transient presence of water at the surface some four billion years ago — the early Noachian period. But it is becoming increasingly clear that the environment below the surface was surely warmer and wetter, with liquid water present at varying depths during the Noachian period. The presence of clay minerals on the floor of many craters clearly indicates that they had formed as a result of long-term interaction of liquid water with the parent rock. Even the presence of massive ridges was noticed earlier, but the likely cause that led to their formation was not known. A paper published recently in Geophysical Research Letters, which studied the over 4,000 ridges in the Nili Fossae and Nilosyrtis highlands, postulates a likely cause: The ridges could be mineral deposits that filled the subsurface fractures and faults caused by massive impacts on the surface. The ridges are found in association with clay-containing bedrock. Hence it is postulated that the hydrous clay present in the rock could have played an important role in supplying fluids to cement the fractures. Another study in Nature Geoscience not only supports the idea of subsurface water but suggests an alkaline nature for the water. This is based on the presence of magnesium-iron bearing clay and carbonates found in the McLaughlin Crater.
The Martian surface faces hostile conditions that are quite inimical to life. However, there is a greater possibility of finding some signs of life on Mars if we remain focussed on exploring the subsurface sedimentary rocks that today lie exposed in many craters. Carbonates in particular are a perfect medium not only to provide an ideal habitat for life, but also to preserve fossil traces indicative of life. Moreover, carbonate minerals can reveal the temperature and chemistry of the depositional environment. NASA’s Mars rover Curiosity, which is all set to drill at four locations in the coming days, may soon provide the answer to the most sought after question — did Mars ever harbour life? For now, the rover has unequivocally proved that Mars had a wet depositional environment in the past. It found the amount of water molecules bound to sand grains in the soil sample was much “higher than anticipated.” If the discovery of gypsum at several places in the past meant water on Mars, the latest find of veins and sedimentary rocks — layered rocks and sandstone — by Curiosity vastly strengthens the possibility of wet depositional environments in the past. After all, Mars’s reduced gravity translates to “more subsurface porosity to a greater depth.” This allows water to accumulate to a greater thickness than seen in Earth.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/watery-mars/article4375580.ece
10,2,2013,Vengeance isn’t justice,"Eight years ago, the Supreme Court condemned Muhammad Afzal Guru to be hanged for his role in the 2001 attack on Parliament House, saying, astonishingly, that “the collective conscience of the society will only be satisfied if the capital punishment is awarded to the offender.” Guru was walked to the gallows Saturday morning at the end of the macabre rite governments enact from time to time to propitiate that most angry of gods, a vengeful public. Through this grim, secret ceremony, however, India has been gravely diminished. The reasons for this are not just the obvious ones — among them, that Guru was a bit-actor in the attack on Parliament, and his trial marred by procedural and substantive errors. These arguments were examined by the highest court in the country and found wanting. There is one argument, though, that wasn't ever examined — which is precisely why Guru, like scores of other Indians, ended up on death row in the first place. The answer has a great deal to do with expedience, and nothing to do with justice.
The hideous truth is this: judicial executions in India have all the rationality of the roulette table. Last month, Justices P Sathasivam and Fakkir Kalifullah commuted the death penalty given to Mohinder Singh for killing both his daughter and wife -- this while out of prison on parole where he was serving time for earlier raping the girl. The judges argued that the death penalty ought only be considered when a perpetrator posed “a menace and threat to the harmonious and peaceful coexistence of the society.” One week later, Justices Sathasivam and Jagdish Khehar upheld death for Sundararajan, who kidnapped and then killed a seven year old boy. The judges noted, among other things the “agony for parents for the loss of their male child, who would have carried further the family lineage.” Besides the obvious imprint of gender values on judicial reasoning, it is the arbitrariness of outcome in cases that are similar which tells us something is seriously wrong. In a signal article published recently in this newspaper. V. Venkatesan noted how the Supreme Court has itself admitted that many of those on death row are there because of“erroneous legal precedents set by itself.” ( >December 10, 2012) Yet, both the judiciary and the government have been reluctant to announce a moratorium on executions until a thoroughgoing review is carried out. This ought not to surprise us: in case after case, the course of criminal justice has been shaped by public anger and special-interest lobbying. Indians must remember the foundational principle of our Republic, the guardian of all our rights and freedoms, isn't popular sentiment: it is justice, which in turn is based on the consistent application of principles. For one overriding reason, Guru’s hanging ought to concern even those unmoved by his particular case, or the growing ethics-based global consensus against the death penalty. There is no principle underpinning the death penalty in India today except vengeance. And vengeance is no principle at all.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/vengeance-isnt-justice/article4397711.ece
11,2,2013,Confronting cyberthieves,"The refusal of the Maharashtra State Banking Ombudsman to intervene in a case of net banking fraud that left a customer poorer by nearly ten lakh rupees is bound to add to the anxiety of consumers who are afraid of falling victim to cybercrime. Much as plastic money and online commerce are convenient, they bring with them the baggage of security concerns. The banking and payment card industries, and enforcement agencies must respond to such incidents with alacrity. Reserve Bank of India statistics record a downward trend in the number of cases of credit card fraud: from 20,806 cases in 2009 involving over Rs.61 crore, to 7,305 cases in 2011, with an exposure of Rs.21.7 crore. Yet, that is cold comfort for many because the theatre of crime is often a foreign country. That point is amply borne out by the many cases of Indians preyed upon by identity thieves and financial fraudsters who skim off information from cards used abroad. While the offices of the Banking Ombudsman may not have all the resources to address the problem, the onus of security should lie with the system, and not the consumer. At the moment, the procedure for redress — especially filing a complaint of cyber fraud — is difficult, and the level of liability for misuse of the card after reporting the crime does not favour the customer.
Some of India’s online gateways do incorporate additional security components such as codes and keys, but the consumer faces an unfriendly system when he falls victim to identity theft. Although the Information Technology Act was amended to incorporate a specific section, 66C, relating to punishment for identity theft, the police are often not receptive to complaints. As a confidence-building measure, banks and the payment card industry must come up with an advisory in plain language on good practice, rights of account holders, their liabilities including insurance against theft, and the system of seeking help. The law on limited consumer liability is clear in the United States, whereas insurance compensation for fraud is often capped in India. On the technological side, the banking system, the payment card operators and the retail sector must explore ways of incorporating new technologies that can make transactions highly personalised. Generating individual digital tokens for buyers’ pre-registered mobile phones for each sale — as some online retailers do to verify the customer — may be one way to confirm identity. With smartphones and m-commerce growing in popularity, the need to strengthen systems against online fraud is even higher. Weak consumer confidence and unhelpful enforcement agencies can only deter growth.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/confronting-cyberthieves/article4400726.ece
11,2,2013,Erdogan should talk Turkey,"The suicide bombing inside a security booth at the United States embassy in Ankara on February 1 that killed a Turkish security guard and severely injured a television journalist who was on her way to meet the ambassador, has revealed once again the complexity and even fragility of Turkey’s political position in the region. Widespread initial speculation about the attacker’s identity and motivation was quickly dispelled when the banned radical Turkish Marxist-Leninist group, the Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) claimed responsibility; the bomber himself was Ecevit S¸anli, a long-standing member of the group who had been imprisoned from 1997 to 2001 for a rocket attack on a military club in Istanbul but had been released when he contracted a crippling brain condition during a long hunger strike. The DHKP-C has a long record of such attacks going back to a turbulent period in the 1970s, and was deemed a terrorist organisation after a suicide attack in central Istanbul in 2001. It was also held responsible for murdering a former Prime Minister in 1980 and for a suicide attack in Istanbul in September 2012.
The facts about the bombing may seem unproblematic, but Turkey’s domestic and international policies cause bitter resentment among several sections of its 74 million population, and any one of several groups could have carried out the recent attack, for a variety of reasons. Hardline leftist groups have long opposed Turkey’s collaboration with NATO — the country is a member of the Atlantic alliance — and have gained fresh resolve from Ankara’s help for Washington in the Syrian crisis; Turkey, which favours foreign intervention in Syria, hosts NATO troops and a Patriot missile system near the Turkish-Syrian border. Most of Turkey’s Alawite community, however, are strong supporters of Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad, who belongs to the ruling Alawite minority there. Yet another sect, Turkish Alevis, are disproportionately represented among the country’s Marxist factions. In addition, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), led by Abdullah Öcalan, who is imprisoned on an island off Istanbul since 1999, has been involved in a 40-year war for independence that has cost 40,000 lives so far. Istanbul’s security services have been talking with Mr. Öcalan since December 2012, but a political settlement looks as remote as ever. The sooner Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdog˘an responds to the justifiable disquiet that Turkey’s domestic policies and international realpolitik generates among substantial sections of its people, the better the prospects of lasting peace in the country and region.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/erdogan-should-talk-turkey/article4400728.ece
12,2,2013,The indecency of a secret execution,"Between Afzal Guru’s hanging at Tihar and the executions of Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh at the same jail lies a gap of 24 years. In this time, India has risen tremendously in economic and strategic terms but the decline in our collective morality is evident in the indecorous secrecy which has attended the latest execution. When Indira Gandhi’s assassins were hanged on January 6, 1989, the country had still not emerged from a crippling insurgency in Punjab that had raged through the State for most of that decade and taken the lives of thousands of people. Yet, India appeared a far more confident democracy then. The government of Rajiv Gandhi did not hide the President’s rejection of the mercy petitions of Satwant and Kehar; both men were allowed an eleventh hour opportunity to contest that rejection in the Supreme Court. When the court dismissed their petitions, the date of their execution was made public. Their families were allowed inside the jail for a final goodbye. As many as 20 members of Kehar Singh’s family and 13 of Satwant Singh’s family, including his father, were given permission to meet the condemned men. Though not all of them managed to get access, at least they were spared the shock of being informed after the hangings, not to speak of the shabby indecency of a notification sent through the postal system that reaches two days later.
By trotting out claims about the threat to law and order in order to justify keeping Guru’s execution under wraps, the government has shown itself in even poorer light, as if its law-enforcing machinery is helpless before such threats. Of course that is not true, and it was used as an excuse. Both in Guru’s case and in Ajmal Kasab’s, what the government clearly wanted was a smooth road to the gallows, one that would be free of legal challenges or a last minute reprieve, such as the one granted by the Madras High Court to the three death row convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. But in doing so, the government has gone against not just all democratic norms but fundamental human decency. It has also insulted the country’s judicial system, for the secrecy that attended Kasab’s hanging succeeded in taking away from what was otherwise considered a fair trial. The least the government can do now to make amends for its atrocious behaviour towards Guru’s family is to give them access to his grave in Tihar. Something can still be salvaged from this shameful episode if the government is goaded into adopting proper rules for informing the family members of a condemned man about his impending execution. All this, of course, pending that day when political India is able to work up the humanity to abolish the death penalty itself.

12,2,2013,Lawlessness and disorder,"In the name of preserving law and order in the hours following the hanging of Afzal Guru, the Delhi police detained a senior and well-respected Delhi journalist, Iftikhar Gilani, for no reason other than that he was the son-in-law of the Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani. While Mr. Gilani was illegally confined for five hours, his children were locked up in a room in his house. When he was finally freed, he was not offered any explanation either for his detention or for his being let off without charge. The actions of the police officers involved in this fiasco need to be seriously probed, and those found guilty should be, as Press Council of India chairman Markandey Katju has suggested in a letter to Union Home Secretary R.K. Singh, placed under suspension and criminal proceedings instituted against them in quick time. Enforcing security measures is serious business, and should not be left in the hands of officers who see no contradiction in abusing their authority. What makes the confinement of Mr. Gilani even worse is that the Delhi Police appears not to have learnt any lesson from the time it threw him in jail on trumped up charges. The unfortunate journalist spent nine months in Tihar Jail charged with violating the Indian Official Secrets Act for possessing an article published by a Pakistani think-tank on its website!
None of the errant officers involved in the foisting of this bogus case were taken to task then, nor was he compensated for the malicious prosecution he was subjected to. If those involved in harassing him this time around are allowed to get away with their illegal behaviour, what is the guarantee that Mr. Gilani — or any other innocent Kashmiri — is not subjected to the ‘midnight knock’ again? While curfew and preventive arrests are not uncommon in situations where the police anticipate a law and order problem, the ham-handed harassment of Mr. Gilani and the manner in which Kashmir has been virtually shut down since Saturday suggests the Union Home Ministry went through a seizure of panic right after the Afzal Guru hanging. Cable television services were suspended and restrictions placed on the dissemination of news. Mobile internet services were deactivated, and newspapers forcibly kept off the stands, according to some reports. All of these are symptoms of an undeclared state of Emergency. Political and executive mismanagement of situations like these could have very harmful long-term consequences. The government will urgently need to restore the people’s confidence, not in its ability to maintain law and order, but in its ability to uphold the principle of equality before the law, in the equal treatment under the law for all citizens.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lawlessness-and-disorder/article4404786.ece
13,2,2013,Awaiting the white smoke,"Those cardinals who were in Vatican City on February 11 thought they were assembling in the Hall of the Consistory to hear about impending canonisations; instead, they were left stunned by Pope Benedict XVI’s announcement that he was resigning from the papacy with effect from 8 p.m. on February 28. The former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger became head of the Holy See on April 19, 2005, and is the first Pope to resign since Gregory XII stepped down in 1415 so as to bring an end to the Great Western Schism, which had seen three rivals claiming to be Pope. Another noteworthy resignation had occurred in 1294, when Celestine V, in response to his own unsuitability for the political and financial burdens of the papacy, issued a decree permitting the Pope to resign, and then resigned. The current pontiff’s reasons are that he no longer has the “strength of mind and body” necessary for the “adequate exercise of the Petrine ministry.” The Pope’s resignation leaves the ministry vacant, but as the pontiff has not died in office the College of Cardinals, who choose the successor, will not have to hold their electing conclave in the usual interval between 15 and 28 days; the conclave could in theory take place very soon after February 28, but in any case the senior cardinal will take over the papal duties until the election.
After Benedict XVI leaves office, he will play no further role in the Church and will probably devote himself to study. His legacy, nevertheless, will be controversial. An outsider for the papacy, he was elected after a very conservative speech to the electing conclave in 2005; as Pope he has moved against liberal elements in the Church, and has also put the brakes on ecumenism. Most controversially, however, as head of the body that maintains discipline among priests, he has, on the evidence of letters presented in U.S. courts, a long record of covering up widespread sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests, though there is no suggestion that he condoned the abuse. On other issues, he has opposed contraception, including condom use to prevent HIV transmission in a marriage, abortion in all circumstances, and in vitro fertilisation. As for a successor, the suggestion is gaining ground that the next Pope should be African or Latin American, but the vote could well be influenced by the fact that half the College of Cardinals is European, even though the bulk of the world’s one billion Catholics live in the developing world. In any case, many of the College were appointed by Benedict XVI himself, so the Church of Rome is unlikely to see any rapid doctrinal changes. That said, the next Pope, in the eyes of most Catholics, should be younger, a better communicator and someone capable of responding to the moral and ecumenical challenges posed by globalisation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/awaiting-the-white-smoke/article4408203.ece
13,2,2013,Sharing the blame,"It was extremely unfortunate that 36 precious lives were lost at the Kumbh in Allahabad on the most holy day of the ‘Mouni Amavasya snan.’ That the deaths occurred not at the site of the Kumbh, but at the Railway station clearly indicates the tragedy was wholly preventable. Predictably, a shabby blame game has begun between the Uttar Pradesh government and the Railways. The truth is both sides must share the blame for this shocking mismanagement. Planning for proper crowd management cannot be confined to the Sangam, where some three crore people took the holy dip without any major catastrophe; careful thought should have gone into ensuring their orderly departure from the city by train or bus. With not enough trains to take away the lakhs of pilgrims converging at the station late in the evening, the crowds swelled around that area. Reports speak of two stampedes, one at 6.30 p.m. and another at 8.40 p.m. Eyewitnesses and the injured have said there was no place to stand and pilgrims were falling over each other. Finally, the pedestrian overbridge collapsed under the sheer weight of thousands of people fighting their way to the platforms to catch the next train. The delayed arrival and announcement of a train caused a feverish rush in opposite directions, leading to the stampede, collapse, and the deaths.
Uttar Pradesh’s Urban Development Minister and the Kumbh Mela committee chairman Mohammad Azam Khan might have put in his papers owning “moral responsibility” for the tragedy but that does not solve the problem or fix the blame. Of course, an inquiry will come up with some findings. The real question now is how to prevent a recurrence of such preventable tragedies. Law and order — of which crowd management is a major part — falls entirely within the jurisdiction of the State government. Why were so many people allowed to congregate at and within the Railway station without a proper crowd management system in place? But the railways also cannot evade responsibility. It was known that lakhs of pilgrims would have to leave Allahabad in public transport, especially trains. Did the Northern and North Central Railways operate enough trains to clear the projected traffic on the Amavasya day? Apparently, special trains ran empty after the stampede. Another distressing report pertained to the lack of adequate medical help. For hours, the dead and injured lay there without attention. Why was there no disaster response system in place? Surely, any inquiry must go into all these aspects, fix responsibility and lay down norms to manage such huge congregations of people.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sharing-the-blame/article4408382.ece
14,2,2013,North Korea’s new reality,"Tuesday’s nuclear test by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea may have been widely anticipated but that has not made the tremors from its showmanship any less alarming. The test poses a difficult strategic dilemma for both the United States — Enemy No.1 for North Korea — and China, Pyongyang’s strongest ally. Within the region, the fact that the “miniaturised and lighter nuclear device” just tested can easily be fitted on to a missile has South Korea and Japan extremely nervous. If the nuclear test was the DPRK’s way of forcing a dialogue with the U.S. on its terms, the Obama Administration’s main worry would be about setting a precedent for other countries. Retaliation through sanctions, though, seems to have run its course without any effect on North Korea’s will or ability to pursue its nuclear weapons programme. The test has also put China in a quandary. Always protective of the North Korean regime, it has faced increasing world pressure to wean Pyongyang from the nuclear path, but has been unable to do so. After all its efforts to put a lid on the damaging A.Q. Khan proliferation scandal, Pakistan too finds itself in the spotlight again with experts wondering if the latest North Korean device used enriched uranium rather than plutonium.
What the North Korean nomenklatura, especially its military elite, hopes to achieve from the latest test is not clear but one conclusion is inescapable: the regime sees nuclear weapons as the key to its political survival and has firmly and irrevocably turned its back on the chimera of a denuclearised peninsula. This means that a key assumption of the Six Party Talks process needs re-evaluation. Dialogue and diplomacy are still essential but the goal must now focus, realistically, on managing Pyongyang’s nuclear status and ensuring that the Kim Jong-un regime abides by global non-proliferation norms rather than on seeking ways for it to give up its weapons. Of course, the immediate fallout of the latest test is that both Japan and South Korea will now be looking for the protection of an enhanced American ‘nuclear umbrella’ including missile defence. Call it a more active ‘pivot to Asia’, this would be, as an Obama Administration official told the New York Times after the Unha-3 test, “indistinguishable from the kind of things that China views as a containment strategy”. The little nuclear genies in North Korea and Pakistan that China helped conjure up over the years will both end up as major strategic liabilities for Beijing. There is little the Chinese can do now to prevent an even more robust American military presence in the East Asian region.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/north-koreas-new-reality/article4411965.ece
14,2,2013,Setback in TB war,"The efforts to win the war against tuberculosis using an efficacious vaccine candidate (MVA85A) in infants aged 4-6 months have returned a disappointing verdict despite showing great promise in pre-clinical trials. Though it fulfilled the primary objective of safety and despite inducing modest immune responses, the efficacy of the vaccine was just 17.3 per cent, and hence considered insufficient to protect the infants against TB, notes a paper published recently in The Lancet. This is the first vaccine trial to be conducted after the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine was introduced in 1921. The vaccine was given to infants in South Africa who had already received the BCG vaccine. The rationale was to prime the immune system with BCG and then boost it with the candidate vaccine to enhance the protective efficacy of BCG. It will take a while to know the reasons behind its failure. Meanwhile, there is still some hope that the vaccine, which is being tested in HIV positive adults, will be successful. An efficacious and safer vaccine that would replace BCG is urgently required for HIV positive individuals; BCG being a live-attenuated vaccine is “not recommended” for immune-compromised people. While only 5-10 per cent people who are infected with TB develop active disease over their lifetime, the conversion rate dramatically shoots up to 5-10 per cent per year in the case of HIV positive people, notes a 2012 paper in PLoS Pathogens.
There is still optimism as a dozen vaccines are being tested in clinical trials. But these are not designed to prevent infection or rid the body of the bacteria; they are aimed at boosting protection against the disease. There are several other challenges too. Unlike in the case of other pathogens, protection against TB does not lie in neutralising antibodies; it is the cell-mediated immunity that is important. We still do not know the protective antigens that will stimulate protective immune responses. For instance, we know that antigen 85A complex elicits strong immune response, but whether it will translate to protective effect in humans is not known. The AVA85A vaccine is the best example of this — it induced modest immune responses but the protective effect was low. Hence, it will take a while to produce vaccines that are effective. But meanwhile, across the world, every year, nearly 9 million people will develop active TB and about 1.5 million will die. Worse, fighting the killer disease is getting more complicated with the rapid emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. It took WHO’s declaration of TB as a global emergency for the world to shed its indifference and complacency. Now, it is a race against time.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/setback-in-tb-war/article4411966.ece
15,2,2013,Facing the acid test,"The last thing the country wanted was another victim of gender-based violence in India succumbing to injuries long after the crime had been committed. The death of J. Vinodhini, a 23-year-old B. Tech graduate, due to complications caused by a heinous acid attack in Puducherry on November 14 last year, is not just another addition to the large and, regrettably, increasing database of offences against women; rather, it is an example of the inexplicable masculine tendency to inflict grave injury on women in such manner that someone merely going about her life is converted overnight into a symbol of victimhood, forced into a battle for survival and then transformed by death into a brave-heart she did not aspire to be. On the surface, such attacks may be the perverse product of unrequited love but they bear the ugly imprint of a violent, patriarchal culture that valorises the right of a man to stalk, possess — and eventually even disfigure — the woman he desires. All will empathise with the trauma and agony undergone by Vinodhini and her family due to the senseless act of a spurned suitor. It is only appropriate that the law recognises their pain and the need for meet justice. The Justice Verma Committee recommendations on this find expression in two new sections in the Indian Penal Code (Sections 326A and 326B) introduced by the February 3, 2013, ordinance. These envisage a maximum of 10 years in jail for those causing disability or disfigurement through the use of acid, and a five-year term for throwing or trying to throw acid on another.
Since the fear of arrest under stringent laws is unlikely to deter a crime of passion, experts feel the primary effort to curb acid attacks must lie in reducing easy access to the means to commit the crime. The Supreme Court has directed State governments and the Centre to meet and discuss provisions to regulate the sale of acid, to ensure treatment, care and rehabilitation of victims, and for payment of compensation. Scaling up facilities for psychotherapy for those feeling depressed or rejected is another possible intervention. Be it the physiotherapy student in Delhi who is now an iconic figure in the copious annals of sexual violence in our country, or Laxmi, an acid attack victim who approached the Supreme Court in 2006 seeking a special law to deal with the use of acid to maim women physically and destroy them psychologically, it is not enough to remember their courageous fight for staying alive or their desire to bring their assailants to justice for their symbolic value. Rather, their death and suffering should occasion a determined revisiting of our laws and practices, attitudes and prejudices.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/facing-the-acid-test/article4415592.ece
15,2,2013,Wrestling with a shocker,"The Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has come up with a shocker by voting to recommend that wrestling be pushed off the Olympic mat in 2020. It is an unexpected, cruel blow to a sport that was part of the ancient Olympics and figured in the inaugural modern Games in 1896 and every subsequent edition except 1900. If it finally goes out of the 2020 programme, it will be the biggest sport yet to be axed from the Games. The IOC Board has expectedly drawn flak from around the globe for its decision but a final picture will only emerge at its General Assembly meeting in September when the venue for the 2020 Games will also be chosen. Wrestling will get another chance in May when it will be clubbed with seven other previously-approved disciplines for consideration of the IOC Board which may recommend more than one sport to its Session, although just one will make it eventually. The IOC goes through an elaborate assessment before deleting or including a sport in the Olympic programme. That is precisely the reason why its latest decision is looking downright absurd if not biased. In a majority of the 39 criteria that the IOC programme commission applies to formulate its evaluation report after every Olympics, wrestling should score over at least modern pentathlon, which was widely tipped to get the axe.
Several critics, besides the International Wrestling Federation, have pointed out that a “clash of interests” among the IOC board members voting to pick the 25 ‘core sports’ for the 2020 Games could have contributed to the outcome. The question of excluding modern pentathlon, a sport that combines fencing, swimming, horseback riding, shooting and running, invented by Baron Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the modern Olympic Games, might have touched an emotional chord among the members. But there is no denying the more popular appeal of wrestling, a sport that is easy to follow, and, alongside running, is an elemental discipline that embodies the spirit of the Olympics. The fact that wrestling had medal winners from 29 countries, more than the number of participating nations (26) in modern pentathlon at the last Olympics, should clinch the argument about ‘universality,’ something the IOC seriously advocates. The IOC Board does not have a member from any of the dominant ‘wrestling powers’ including the U.S. and Russia. India, which won two of its six medals in the London Olympics in wrestling — and has four in all from the sport — is justifiably upset at a time when its National Olympic Committee stands suspended. Subtle diplomacy, rather than strident criticism against the IOC, may yet help the Sports Ministry contribute to the rescue of the sport.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/wrestling-with-a-shocker/article4415593.ece
16,2,2013,Follow the money,"Defence deals, done under the thick, dark cover of national security, are notorious for their lack of transparency. As a result, decision-makers in the defence and political establishments often manage to hide the role of middlemen in swinging deals worth hundreds of crores of rupees. Bofors is India’s most famous defence scandal, with deep political and diplomatic ramifications, but it was neither the first nor the last in a long line of defence purchases that have become keywords associated with the stink of corruption in the public mind. Reports of bribery by the Italian defence firm Finmeccanica in the supply of 12 AgustaWestland helicopters for VVIP transport have thus come as no surprise. Finmeccanica and its top executives have been under investigation in Italy for months, but the Indian government chose to do nothing citing absence of specific, actionable information. With the arrest of Finmeccanica head Giuseppe Orsi, Defence Minister A.K. Antony was left with no choice but to order a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the deal. The charges against the top executives of Finmeccanica and its subsidiary AgustaWestland are specific, with the amount of bribe put at about 10 per cent of the Rs.3,600 crore deal. But the CBI, while following the money trail in India, will need to work in close coordination with the Italian investigators.
When the United Progressive Alliance government chose Mr. Antony as Defence Minister, the rationale was not that the man with a strong reputation for probity would be able to prevent corruption in defence purchases, but that he would act as a shining shield for the political establishment to deflect charges of wrong-doing. But a clean image is no guarantee for efficiency in governance. The fact that the Italians were investigating the payoffs made in the Indian deal was known last year itself but Mr. Antony was slow to act, apparently keener to avoid trouble than to find out the truth. The Bofors case was a classic instance of messed-up investigation and sloppy prosecution. The Italian chopper deal case must not be allowed to go the same way. The issue is not about the choice of specifications or helicopter, but about the kickbacks that have clearly been paid. Evidently, all manufacturers feel compelled to pay bribes disguised as commissions on a percentage basis to middlemen and lobbyists for obtaining supply orders from the Indian government. The Defence Minister needs to show some spine in going after the wrong-doers; otherwise the charges would recoil on him and his party. The efforts must not be directed at escaping blame, but in fixing accountability. A clean image is not protected by skirting around uncomfortable issues.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/follow-the-money/article4419543.ece
16,2,2013,The plate is full,"The Fourteenth Finance Commission has recently been constituted under Article 280 of the Constitution, with a former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Y.V. Reddy, as its chairman. The primary task of the FFC is the same as that of its predecessors: to make recommendations regarding the sharing of Union taxes, the principles governing grants-in-aid to States and transfer of resources to the States. Its period of reference is five years commencing April 1, 2015 and it is expected to submit its report by October 31, 2014. Over the recent past, successive Finance Commissions have been saddled with a large, onerous agenda that has gone well beyond their main tasks of correcting fiscal imbalances between the Centre and the States on the one hand, and among States on the other. The Thirteenth Finance Commission was given the important, but still out of the way, job of preparing a fiscal consolidation road map. The FFC will look into the deficit of the States keeping in view its predecessor’s report. It has also been asked to suggest measures to raise the tax to GDP ratios of both the Centre and the States, tackle challenges in ecology, environment and climate change.
The FFC’s other terms of reference include such omnibus items as the need for making public sector enterprises competitive, divestment, and listing and relinquishing ownership of non-priority enterprises. A few other tasks such as calculating the level of subsidies needed and figuring out how to insulate the pricing of public utilities from policy fluctuations can be contentious. Most of these issues do impact public finance but the FFC need not be burdened with some of these lest its primary function is diluted. Recently, after much delay and protracted discussions among State finance ministers at Bhubaneswar, a breakthrough in terms of compensating States for possible revenue losses post the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax appears to have been made. The FFC might still have a say in the final GST format, which however is not expected to roll out until April 2014 at the earliest. Two other core issues need to be addressed by the FFC. The widening inequality in growth and consequently, in per capita income across States have increased inequalities in fiscal capacity. Second, the uniform fiscal deficit targets that States have opted for under their fiscal responsibility legislations have most probably resulted in — and the FFC will confirm this — compressed development expenditure. It is hoped that the FFC will recommend steps to safeguard the autonomy of States in fiscal matters and specifically suggest ways to overcome the restrictions imposed by stiff fiscal targets without, of course, sacrificing fiscal prudence.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-plate-is-full/article4419544.ece
18,2,2013,Moving beyond defence,"Freshly confident from an effective intervention in Mali, President Francois Hollande arrived in India liberated from the shadow of his predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy, a favourite in New Delhi and with India’s business leaders, but ready to build on his legacy. The two countries have established strong diplomatic, political and strategic ties over the years, and the Hollande visit reaffirmed that both are eager to take this engagement to a new level. That keenness was already evident in India’s backing to the French decision in January to send troops to oust Islamist rebels who had taken over parts of Mali, which New Delhi viewed as an effort against a terrorist takeover of that country. As part of the Support and Follow-Up Group for Mali, New Delhi has made a $1million pledge for building the country’s army, with the promise of $100 million more later. These steps complement both India’s burgeoning interest in Africa, particularly in the uranium and oil-rich Francophone countries of West Africa, as well as France’s plans to secure the region from Islamist militancy and splinter groups of the al Qaeda as it safeguards its own interests in those countries.
It is no coincidence, then, that India and France have been moving towards greater naval co-operation, an important aspect of that being combating sea piracy. In general, defence ties have gained momentum in recent years, with France assiduously trying to combat the impression that it sees India just as a market for its hardware. The Scorpene project, under which the manufacture of the submarine has been sub-contracted to India, and Dassault’s Rafale fighters for the Indian Air Force, include significant transfers of technology. The $11 billion aircraft deal is still being negotiated and the French are eager to see it concluded soon, as expressed in the joint statement during the visit. The traditional good relations between the two countries have been driven by the need to build a robust multilateralism. France supports India’s candidature for a permanent seat in an expanded Security Council. It was the first country to sign a civilian nuclear deal with India, and supports New Delhi’s pursuit of membership in the four WMD-related multilateral export groups. Next week will see the launch of SARAL, a satellite to study oceans and seas, a product of long-standing scientific collaboration between the two countries. With so much going for bilateral ties, it seems odd that economic ties lag below potential. Two-way trade and investment are yet to touch the €12 bn target set in 2008. An annual dialogue on economic and financial issues that the two sides agreed to during President Hollande’s visit will hopefully help.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/moving-beyond-defence/article4425365.ece
18,2,2013,The health of nations,"The United Nations has been drawing attention in recent years to the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, which have been adding to morbidity and premature deaths in most countries. In a declaration issued at a high-level meeting in 2011, the U.N. argued that low and middle income countries should actively pursue public health policies that will reduce the incidence of NCDs arising from diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, and a high body mass index. One of the countries that is at the epicentre of these health concerns is India, due mainly to weak public health policies and changing lifestyles. As The Lancet points out in recent commentary, much of the burden of non-communicable diseases is linked to the consumption of tobacco, alcohol, and ultra-processed food and drink (which are energy dense but nutrient poor). The public health community now unanimously accepts the link between these and a higher burden of NCDs. Neglect of chronic diseases by India has, according to the World Health Organisation, cost the country $9 billion in 2005 due to premature deaths caused by heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Over a 10-year period, the losses are projected to rise to a colossal aggregate of $237 billion.
While tobacco and alcohol are receiving close scrutiny as key factors influencing disease burdens, including cancer, the role of ultra-processed packaged food is not getting the attention it deserves. The makers of all forms of packaged food see India as a gigantic emerging market — and source of profit growth. Moreover, advanced markets are saturated. It is here that regulation of unhealthy food holds the key. The primary goal should be to use taxation, labelling and awareness creation to make high-energy, low nutrition foods unattractive to the consumer. There is a deplorable trend among food manufacturers to push less harmful packaged food as being actually ‘healthy’. This travesty must be reversed through determined policy intervention, and consumption of wholesome, fresh meals high in vegetable and fruit content must be encouraged. It is relevant to point out here that the biscuit industry has been lobbying in India to displace fresh-cooked food in the school noon meal programme, with its own packaged products, drawing sharp criticism from nutritionists and development experts. Packaged meals high in calories, sugar and salt are no substitute for fresh food and actually cause harm. They can only add to the risk of death by cardiovascular disease, estimated to be about five million by 2020. By contrast, a dramatic decline in death due to infectious diseases is projected. The agenda for social and political action is clear.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-health-of-nations/article4425366.ece
19,2,2013,Think beyond censorship,"Governments and official agencies try very hard to control the Internet, but the design of this global network with no physical centre makes it difficult to achieve. What is blocked in one territory is accessible in the rest of the world. More importantly, scrubbing is counterproductive. That bruising lesson must have been learnt by all actors involved in the blocking of over 70 web pages containing content critical of the Indian Institute of Planning and Management, an agency that widely advertises a variety of study courses and degrees. The online community has responded with a counter-offensive against the institution on a devastating scale, and called attention worldwide to precisely what the institute wanted purged. Moreover, the episode proves once again that the Information Technology Act is a handy censorship tool. Although the order to the Department of Telecommunications to block the web pages was issued by a Gwalior court, it is flawed, because no opportunity was provided to the websites to enter a defence. It is shocking that the court saw merit in the plaintiff’s plea to block a page of the University Grants Commission, the highest body regulating the general university system, simply because it declared that within the meaning of the UGC Act, IIPM is not a university, and does not have the right to confer or grant degrees.
The assault on freedom of expression on the Internet has taken on crude forms in India, with a regime of arbitrary arrests and censorship orders demolishing a cherished fundamental right. In an extraordinary extension of this outrageous trend, a cyber cell unit in Kerala has issued a notice to a website, Bodhicommons.org asking it to take down a report on a protest held by newspaper employees outside the Mathrubhumi office in Kozhikode. The police, who cited the Criminal Procedure Code, have taken it upon themselves to rule on what is ‘defamatory, misleading and false’. Their demand to disclose the registration details of the website, with the stated objective of penalising the owners is wholly unwarranted, if not illegal. This trend of arbitrary restraints imposed on small, independent online media stands in contrast to the general approach of courts to questions concerning mainstream media — which is to protect the right to free speech. The decision of the Madras High Court not to restrain Dinamalar from publishing facts, particularly publicly documented information including court records, about Sun Group chairman Kalanithi Maran and his family is a case in point. The IIPM issue highlights the dangers inherent in the IT Act, with its omnibus provisions that lend themselves so easily to the stifling of free speech and expression.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/think-beyond-censorship/article4428782.ece
19,2,2013,Striving for dialogue in Syria,"The February 12 capture of an airfield near Aleppo by a Syrian rebel group is the first in which the insurgents have seized usable warplanes; it also marks a change in the rebels’ approach, from battles in cities — including Damascus — to attacks on military bases. A month earlier, rebels had taken the Taftanaz airfield in northern Syria. In response, government forces have launched air attacks on al-Jarrah, as they have done after previous rebel captures of airfields. Captured warplanes will strengthen the Syrian National Coalition (SNC) forces, because President Bashar al-Assad’s troops have so far been able to repulse ground-based rebel attacks by using their vast air power; it is not clear, however, if those pilots who have defected can fly the rebel-held machines. Meanwhile the civil war rages on, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navanethem Pillay has given the U.N. Security Council a sharply increased estimate of the death toll, putting it at 70,000 since the civil war started in March 2011.
Political efforts continue, and on February 8, U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi’s deputy Mokhtar Lamani met the rebel Revolutionary Military Council near Damascus, and also talked with other civilian leaders. In addition, the SNC’s Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib has offered to meet government officials if the regime releases some 16,000 political prisoners and renews passports held by Syrians abroad. The odds against a settlement, however, are lengthening on both sides. Mr. Khatib’s move has angered other SNC members, not least because SNC president George Sabra himself narrowly escaped an assassination attempt near the Turkish border on February 11. The Coalition remains severely divided, and U.S. President Barack Obama has vetoed arming rebel forces. Furthermore, the minister for national reconciliation Ali Haidar first responded to Mr. Khatib by offering talks in another country, but then insisted that the opposition participate in a government dialogue initiative which has already started in Damascus; yet the former Syrian foreign ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi, who defected ten weeks ago, says the violence and polarisation have left no place for “moderation and diplomacy.” At one level, the all-round intransigence now means the prospects for a peaceful settlement seem more difficult than ever. But the pursuit of military means by Damascus and its opponents — the latter backed by powerful regional powers — is hardly the answer. The Geneva plan, which builds on the earlier efforts of Kofi Annan, must be pursued seriously. The Russians back it and the U.S. too is on board. But somebody has to push the Syrian opposition to come on board.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/striving-for-dialogue-in-syria/article4428783.ece
20,2,2013,A model for the rest of India,"It comes as no surprise that Tamil Nadu has once again been applauded for its “excellent” maternal and child-care services by the Common Review Mission of the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). Suffice it to say that at a time when 99 per cent of global maternal mortality occurs in developing regions of the world, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra have become pockets that have bucked the trend. Even as India has been reducing its maternal mortality ratio — defined as the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births — the rate of reduction, from 380 in 1993 to 97 during 2007-2009, has been rapid in the case of Tamil Nadu. So much so that Tamil Nadu, along with Kerala (81) and Maharashtra (104), has already achieved the Millennium Development Goal of 109 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2015. Compare this with the national average — an MMR of 212 for 2007-2009, which is more than double the MDG target. The State has been able to accomplish this by taking up a multi-pronged approach. First, it has equipped all health-care settings, starting with the 1,612 primary health-care centres, with trained staff nurses available round the clock and all essentials required for safe deliveries. Second, it has through innovative and women-friendly initiatives ensured that most deliveries take place in health-care settings. According to a recent survey by the University of Delhi, institutional deliveries are as high as 99 per cent in Tamil Nadu. The national average is about 73 per cent.
More than the very high percentage of institutional deliveries, what is more significant is the percentage of deliveries taking place in government-run institutions. Nearly 67 per cent of deliveries take place in government institutions, compared to 33 per cent in the private sector. The PHCs alone account for 27 per cent; it was about seven per cent in 2005. In fact, today, PHCs face a demand-side pressure. Compare this with Kerala — where the private sector accounts for roughly 60 per cent of deliveries. The primary reason why women in Tamil Nadu are flocking to government facilities is the changed nature of health-care services being provided. As many as 105 PHCs in the State have the facilities to conduct C-sections and store blood, and their main focus is maternal and child heath care. Women-friendly services like screening and appropriate intervention for gestational diabetes, hypertension and anaemia have had a magnetic effect. But the most critical contributor has been the strong and continued importance accorded to health-care services by whichever political party is in power.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-model-for-the-rest-of-india/article4432355.ece
20,2,2013,Mobility and metro rail,"Increasing fuel consumption, the resultant pollution and inefficient urban sprawl caused by incessantly expanding private motorised transport are all compelling reasons for prioritising public transport. Investing in public transport is now imperative. In this context, the recently announced Metro Railway Policy by the Ministry of Urban Development encouraging cities with more than two million population to plan and implement high-capacity and high-speed metro rail systems is a welcome directive. Since these large cities would accommodate the bulk of the burgeoning urbanising population in future, planning for their growth and mobility is necessary. The metro rail, which takes on an average about 10 years to plan and fully implement, could play a significant role in shaping their future. The successful Delhi experience has also strengthened the case of metro rail as an important urban transportation option and places such as Kochi and Jaipur have already commenced implementation. However, planners should not make the mistake of treating the metro rail as a panacea for all their urban ills. There are a few caveats and notes of caution they need to consider before taking the plunge.
The usefulness of a metro rail project would depend on how well it is integrated with the spatial and functional planning of the city. Cities often tend to crowd development around metro rail corridors to take advantage of the high-capacity system, but this, in the absence of a comprehensive development plan, could result in lopsided urban growth. For instance, Chennai has pushed for intense building activity along the already crowded rail corridors to enhance ridership — at least 20,000 people travelling during peak hours in the peak direction — to make the metro rail network economically sustainable. This move may increase the number of rail users, but the question is whether it is desirable. Second, many cities with a population of two million have a large number of medium-demand transport corridors, which can be well served only by a bus system with affordable travel fares. Hence, a city cannot limit itself to developing only metro rail, and other transportation modes are equally critical. Even for the metro rail to function well, it needs a good feeder bus network, connecting pedestrian paths and seamless modal transfer. Unfortunately, the Working Group on Urban Transport for the Twelfth Five Year Plan, which has recommended Rs. 1, 30,726 crore for metro rail projects in 19 cities, has only provided Rs. 22,519 crore for bus transport for the entire country. It is important to expand transport options, but without comprehensive development, mobility within cities would not be efficient and convenient.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mobility-and-metro-rail/article4432354.ece
21,2,2013,Suffering and sharing,"The notification of the final award of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal is the most important step in providing the legal and technical framework for sharing of the waters among the river basin States, particularly Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. That it took six long, distressful years after the announcement of the award cannot be easily forgotten, but the effort now must be to look ahead. The immediate order of business has to be to set up the Cauvery Management Board, an inter-State forum as envisaged by the Tribunal for securing compliance and implementation of its final orders, and a Cauvery Water Regulation Committee to act in accordance with the directions of the Board. Were it not for the direction of the Supreme Court, the notification might not have been done even now, and Karnataka and Tamil Nadu would have continued to engage in litigation year after year. But along with the two States and the Centre, the apex court too should take some of the responsibility for the inexcusable delay in the >notification. By admitting Special Leave Petitions by the States against the final award overlooking the bar on the jurisdiction of the courts included in the Inter-States Water Disputes Act, the Supreme Court paved the way for a seemingly never-ending cycle of pleas.
Of course, the notification will not automatically end all disputes. In distress years, farmers on both sides will suffer, but at least now there is a readily available mechanism to ensure equitable sharing of the waters. The tribunal had noted that distress caused by diminution of water flows will be shared by the States “after the distress conditions and their extent is determined by the [Cauvery Management] Board” keeping in view the allotted water shares. Fixing of the monthly flows to Tamil Nadu on a pro rata basis is an oft-discussed, but never-implemented, equitable solution. The final award — 192 tmc ft of water to reach Tamil Nadu at the inter-State border point of Biligundlu — is kinder to Karnataka than the interim award of 1991, which required the State to ensure 205 tmc ft at Mettur dam, well within Tamil Nadu. All the States party to this long-standing dispute should realise that there is no escape from distress-sharing during bad monsoon years, and that the carefully thought-out award of the tribunal is the closest to a scientifically-determined apportioning of the waters of the Cauvery. As is evident from the statements of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, Tamil Nadu is happy with the final award and the notification. Karnataka too should realise its responsibilities as an upper riparian and not seek to start another round of litigation over the much-delayed >notification.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/suffering-and-sharing/article4435621.ece
21,2,2013,Understanding the disconnect,"The belief that financial markets, especially the stock markets, mirror the real economy has very rarely been supported by empirical evidence in India. Even so, influential sections, including policymakers, tend to view the markets as a barometer for testing or gauging the efficacy of specific policies. The issue is highly topical, with the Union budget due for presentation next week. Budgets have become the most important economic statements of the government, with recent ones evolving far beyond their traditional roles of being mere reports on government finances. Over the years, finance ministers have used the budget process to make important economic announcements, including reform measures, often even those that have tenuous connection with government finances of the day. In the run up to the Union budget, the behaviour of the stock markets is closely watched for what investors expect from the government. It is much less certain as to whether those expectations are realistic, given the political and economic constraints that the Finance Minister has. At the present juncture there is a significant disconnect between the stock markets and economic fundamentals. Major equity indices have risen by 11.5 per cent since August, taking the benchmark stock indices to near record levels. At the same time, most economic indicators are down. Food production for the year is expected to be lower. Consumer price inflation remains in double digits. Economic growth during the year is projected to be at around 5 per cent. Not for the first time, the Indian economy is beset by the phenomenon of economic fundamentals and sentiment moving in different directions.
That should, in the normal course, be a good enough reason to pay less attention to stock market concerns. After all, even if the disconnect were to be less pronounced than now, the fact that equity investors are but a small part of those who invest in financial savings instruments should point to the fallacy of exaggerating the markets’ role in influencing policies. Yet, given the worsening current account deficit and the large dependence on short-term flows from foreign institutional investors, the government is forced to take note of market sentiment. In 2012, foreign inflows amounted to $25 billion and continue to be the principal factor behind the high stock indices. The economy’s long-term interests are better served by encouraging sustainable and more stable flows, such as from foreign direct investors and higher exports. It is unfortunate that in the recent past, the government has chosen expediency over considered economic policy making in attracting these short-term flows even at the risk of weakening macroeconomic stability.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/understanding-the-disconnect/article4435622.ece
22,2,2013,The truth must be told,"New photographs of a 12-year-old >Balachandran Prabakaran in the apparent custody of Sri Lankan security personnel in the final days of the war against the Tamil Tigers have caused widespread anguish and outrage, and understandably so. Last year, when another photograph showing the body of the LTTE chief Prabakaran’s son with visible bullet wounds on his chest surfaced, Sri Lanka’s explanation that the boy died in crossfire seemed plausible. But the photographs obtained by > Channel 4 Television, in which Balachandran is seen sitting inside a sandbagged military enclosure, suggest an entirely different story of how the boy’s life ended, one that underscores other allegations of war crimes against Sri Lanka. Colombo has >dismissed the photographs as “concocted lies, half-truths and speculations” intended to embarrass the country at the forthcoming Human Rights Council session in Geneva. If that is so, it is in Sri Lanka’s own interest to begin immediately an honest and credible investigation to find out how Balachandran died, and make the findings public. If the young boy was indeed in an army bunker, as the photographs indicate, the chain of custody can easily be established and those responsible for his eventual killing in cold blood must be identified and handed down exemplary punishment. For its part, Channel 4 says that experts consulted by it have established the three photographs were taken with the same camera. It has also openly said that its reason for releasing the new evidence at this time, and a documentary next month, is precisely to bring maximum international pressure on Sri Lanka to make it accountable for civilian deaths in the final weeks of the war in 2009.
It took three years for the Rajapaksa government, which first spoke of “zero civilian casualties” to accept that some civilians died, though how many and in what circumstances are still contentious issues. It undertook to implement the recommendations, as advised by the 2012 HRC resolution, of its own >Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, but a “national action plan” towards this end displayed on the government website gives no sign of progress. New Delhi, which worked to tone down the language of last year’s resolution before casting its vote for it, will need to chalk out a more well thought out response to the new photographs than its initial reaction that their “authenticity” needs to be established. Reactions from political parties in Tamil Nadu, and the State government’s decision to cancel the >July Asian athletics meet to avoid hosting Sri Lankan participants indicate that the issue is set to take a toll on the traditionally good ties between people of both countries. Quickly and confidently, before the situation deteriorates, India needs to chart a course that can convince its own people and the international community that it is on the side of what is right and just in this matter, while impressing on Colombo that the issue will not fade away just by stout denial, as it seems to hope.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-truth-must-be-told/article4439670.ece
22,2,2013,Fare weather for flying,"For some four months, which was also the peak travel season in the country, our domestic airlines made the best of the heavy air traffic. The grounding of >Kingfisher, one of the leading private airlines, reduced competition and enabled the others to put up their fares. Now that the tourism season is coming to an end and the airlines have to look at sagging load factors, they have opted for another round of seemingly aggressive fare cuts. >Jet Airways set the process in motion by offering highly discounted tickets for bookings till the end of 2013. The other airlines were soon forced to follow suit and came up with almost matching offers. But the basic question remains: is there enough transparency in this apparent competition for the passengers to benefit? Yes, and no. Of course, when thousands of tickets are offered at very low fares, there is a rush and people begin to plan trips or holidays in advance to cash in on such offers. Conditions do apply, but they are not always as clearly spelt out and recognised as they ought to be. Prospective passengers would like to know clearly which are the flights on which these offers are valid, and how many tickets will be available on a particular flight if they have to travel with family or friends. Invariably, while booking tickets, they find not all of them can get the cheaper fares.
And yet, this sort of fare war may still be good for the aviation industry, and especially for passengers. Getting tickets on the Railways, especially at short notice, remains a major problem as most trains, especially on trunk routes, are invariably running full. With the introduction of cheap ticket, or apex fares as they were called, a new generation of middle class fliers took to the skies. The latest fare war will ensure that the rush continues. Add to this, the move by >AirAsia to enter the domestic airline sector in alliance with the Tata group and Telestra as an established low-cost airline, and it would seem as if the sky wars are bound to intensify. AirAsia is an established brand name and the association with the Tatas adds further value. This move is likely to strengthen Kingfisher promoter >Vijay Mallya’s determination to revive the licence for his grounded airline before more international competition flies in. The country could well be headed for another renaissance in its aviation sector. For that to happen, however, it is essential that airlines protect their bottom line through prudential financial and management practices, something they haven’t done in the past.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fare-weather-for-flying/article4439671.ece
23,2,2013,"Policing needed, not politics","There is something distasteful about the manner in which each terrorist attack that takes place in India has begun swiftly to be followed by a bout of political recrimination and bloodletting. So it was that the >bombing of a crowded marketplace in Hyderabad on Thursday prompted Bharatiya Janata Party leaders to accuse the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre — and Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde, in particular — of indifference to national security, incompetence and worse. No doubt it is the duty of the Opposition to take the government to task for its lapses and failures but statesmanship and propriety demand that the tragedy not be politicised. There is a time and place for a debate to take place on the UPA’s handling of terrorism and law and order. But given that the terrorists who planted the bombs in Hyderabad probably set out to cause or sharpen social and political divisions in the first place, it makes no sense at all for politicians to play into their hands like this. It is axiomatic that every terrorist attack is, in one way or another, an intelligence failure but that doesn’t mean it is easy, or even possible, for a government to devise intelligence capabilities that can ensure an attack will never take place. Considerable headway has been made since the 26/11 terror strike in Mumbai at the institutional level and there is much better coordination and sharing of intelligence today than there has ever been in the past. But the “last mile connectivity” — policing on the ground — remains an area of critical weakness throughout the country.
The fact that the >Delhi Police had learnt last October that the Dilsukhnagar locality had been surveyed by the Indian Mujahideen terrorist outfit — and that the Hyderabad police were aware of this — prompts the obvious question of why the potential target area was not subjected to more intensive policing and surveillance. It is possible that the intelligence agencies collectively thought the alert was too general in nature but even so, the city police ought to have stepped up patrolling, strengthened its network of informants and contacts, and increased the number of CCTV cameras. Hyderabad is, in many ways, a logical target for terrorist groups. An important economic hub, its population is heterogeneous and there is no shortage of irresponsible politicians and hotheads constantly stirring up a toxic cauldron of hate. Islamist and Hindutva terrorists have struck the city in the past in the hope of triggering wider clashes but the people of Hyderabad have time and again resisted these provocations. No doubt they will do so again. But it will take more than peaceful citizens to keep the city safe. Its policing must be of a standard commensurate with the threats it faces.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/policing-needed-not-politics/article4443522.ece
23,2,2013,It pays to redistribute,"Rafael Correa’s third successive election is proof of the stability the Ecuadorean President has brought to a country which had seen seven heads of state in the decade before his first win in 2007, not to speak of several violent revolutions and military coups in earlier periods. Mr. Correa, who leads the Proud and Sovereign Fatherland Alliance (PAIS), won the >February 17 poll by a landslide; with the count just over 70 per cent complete he had a 57 per cent vote-share, which is even greater than the 52 per cent share he took in 2009. His nearest rival, Guillermo Lasso of the Creating Opportunities Party, had 23 per cent, and a former President, Lucio Gutiérrez of the January 21 Patriotic Society Party, was third with 6.5. Re-elected in 2009 and now starting the concluding term which he will be allowed by the constitution he himself drafted, Mr. Correa is also the first Ecuadorean to complete a full presidential term for 20 years.
Like his friend and political ally President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Mr. Correa is unlikely to alter his strategy of using oil revenues to bring about vast improvements in the lives of his 14.7 million fellow citizens. This strategy depends crucially on high oil prices, but tough new contracts with international oil corporations, and better implementation of tax laws on domestic corporates and the rich have also trebled tax revenues in six years. The central bank is now in public hands, and public investment is 15 per cent of national income, with public debt and interest on foreign debt respectively only 25 per cent and one per cent of GDP. In 2012, unemployment fell to a 25-year low of 4.1 per cent, and poverty has fallen by 27 per cent since 2006. Education spending has doubled in that time and health-care spending has increased. Publicly subsidised housing credit has also helped, and a notable feature of all policy is a commitment to disability rights, which the outgoing Vice-President Lenín Moreno, himself a paraplegic after a shooting and — during the election period — the world’s first and only paraplegic head of state, has put on the political agenda. Internationally, Ecuador will continue to keep the United States at arm’s length, having earlier infuriated financiers by declaring Ecuador’s $3.9 billion foreign debt null and void, as it had been incurred by a predecessor state, and the former U.S. base at Manta will not reopen. In sum, Mr. Correa’s resounding victory confirms the success of the openly redistributive policies which have seen democratic socialist governments elected and re-elected throughout Latin America for nearly 15 years now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/it-pays-to-redistribute/article4443524.ece
25,2,2013,Don’t lower your guard,"The Reserve Bank of India’s guidelines for setting up new private sector banks come three years after the then Finance Minister, Pranab Mukherjee, in his 2010-11 budget speech, expressed the government’s intention to award a few new bank licences to private players, including industrial houses. The RBI proceeded step by step, circulating a discussion paper, and inviting stakeholders to share their views. Last August, it issued a set of draft guidelines. Even at that late stage, it was common knowledge that the government’s enthusiasm to induct private players was not shared by the RBI, which has had especially serious reservations over the possible entry of industrial conglomerates. Though the central bank sought for and subsequently obtained legislative powers to more effectively supervise banks and supersede their boards of directors if need be, the controversy over the possible entry of conglomerates remained. Viewed from many standpoints, this apprehension is justified. One of the reasons major private banks were taken over in 1969 was because their managements were found cosying up to their industrialist-owners. More recently, in the 1990s, the experiment of inducting a few “new generation” private banks was only partially successful. Although all the new banks met the regulatory criteria relating to capital and technology among others, only a few have flourished, almost certainly due to their excellent pedigree. The weaker ones have merged with the stronger banks and one high flier, the Global Trust Bank, had to be rescued by the public sector Oriental Bank of Commerce.
The point is that no matter how stiff the entry barriers appear to be, it is impossible to weed out undesirable applicants. For all the precautions that are to be taken before awarding the licences — the RBI has proposed a scrutiny of short-listed applicants by outside experts — the subjective element cannot be eliminated altogether. At the present juncture, the scope for applicants to use political connections to influence the process is real. Curiously, in a departure from the earlier draft, the final guidelines do not prevent real estate companies and brokerages from applying. In all likelihood, some of those queuing up to open their own banks will indeed be from these speculative sectors. The wisdom of lowering one’s guard is not at all clear. It is not wise to ignore the numerous warnings on opening up the banking sector to conglomerates. The IMF has, in a recent report, pointed out that the risks of inviting conglomerates outweigh the possible benefits from the new banks. Finally, the question needs to be asked as to why the policy goal of greater financial inclusion cannot be pursued without inducting industrial houses.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dont-lower-your-guard/article4449574.ece
25,2,2013,Taking freedom of mobility seriously,"There are potentially huge benefits even for the able-bodied population in the Tamil Nadu government’s notification of rules to create special facilities for the disabled in urban local bodies. That makes the case stronger to embrace universal design across all construction activity. All multi-storeyed buildings with more than two floors that the public access on a regular basis are mandated to be equipped with ramps, lifts and other appropriate provisions under the new rules. Lest they should lead to arbitrary interpretation, the rules explicitly mention all educational institutions, health care and banking services, leisure and recreation facilities, shopping malls, industries and much else as falling within their purview. The measure will make a material difference in the lives of large numbers of people with locomotor impairments, for whom the constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of mobility has all but remained notional. The commitments made in the relevant 1995 law for persons with disabilities have likewise by and large eluded them. But India’s demographic transition has brought into sharp focus a convergence between the needs of the population aged 60 years and above and those of the disabled. The elderly constitute 10.3 per cent of Tamil Nadu’s population, above the national average of close to 7.5 per cent, according to the 2010 Sample Registration System. The prevalence of age-induced ailments such as arthritis among this segment means the elderly, too, will benefit from the convenience of ramps and not just wheel-chair users.
Clearly, there is a large constituency out there — beyond legal definitions of disabilities — for which freedom of mobility is a real issue. That should once and for all rest the case against claims that the costs of special provisions for the disabled far outweigh the gains. Such an argument is at best a convenient cloak for inaction. It is also obvious that improvements in physical accessibility are only part of the long journey to ensure equality of opportunities for the disabled. Commensurate measures ought to be initiated in the arenas of education and employment. Training skilled personnel for sign-language interpretation for the hearing impaired, developing technologies for people with low-vision and the introduction of reasonable accommodation in the workplace are important among them. In their absence, the right to free and compulsory education would remain a mirage for children with impairments and the wider objective of an inclusive society. Ambitious as they seem, the Tamil Nadu rules stipulate a 180-day deadline for implementation. Other States in the country should follow this lead.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/taking-freedom-of-mobility-seriously/article4449472.ece
26,2,2013,Hollywood salutes the world,"When the nominations for the >85th Annual Academy Awards were announced, there was a sense of American triumphalism, of the United States reminding itself that it was indeed the most powerful nation on the planet. Steven Spielberg’s Lincoln, about one of the country’s architects, led the race with 12 nominations. Argo, a dramatic ode to American ingenuity and gung-ho filibustering against Iran, received seven nominations. And Zero Dark Thirty, an account of the CIA-led operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden, ended up with five nominations. These were the three films routinely discussed by Oscar pundits everywhere, and Life of Pi, with its impressive tally of 11 nominations, was largely considered a shoo-in for consolation prizes in the technical categories — for Best Visual Effects, or Best Cinematography. In the end, Ang Lee’s film won the most awards of the evening — four, including one in a major category, for Best Director. The closing words of Lee’s acceptance speech said it all: “Thank you Academy. Xie xie. Namaste.” For the night’s biggest winner was a film sourced from a Canadian novel, shot in India, Taiwan and Canada, and completed on computers across the world. The American entertainment industry’s biggest night, ironically but not unsurprisingly, turned out to be a celebration of the rest of the world. It was a far cry from the years when Hollywood’s sole acknowledgment of the world outside came through the token Best Foreign Film category.
The evening offered two other surprises. One was Quentin Tarantino’s win for Best Original Screenplay for Django Unchained, which received censure from certain quarters for its incorrect depiction of antebellum American history. Its win over the more “historically accurate” Zero Dark Thirty — barring the controversy over the utility of torture — offered its own kind of commentary. The other upset was Jennifer Lawrence’s win (Best Actress, for Silver Linings Playbook) over Jessica Chastain, who was considered the front-runner for her performance in Zero Dark Thirty. Put differently, the neurotic heroine of a romantic comedy was deemed worthier than the woman who dedicated years of her life to bringing down Osama. Otherwise, things went according to plan. Argo won Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay. The acting awards went to Daniel Day-Lewis, Anne Hathaway and Christoph Waltz. One of the problems with the >Academy Awards ceremony is that it comes at the end of a long line of other awards, and there is rarely any change in who wins in a particular category. To keep things alive, the emcee Seth MacFarlane, injected steady doses of rude humour. He even made a joke about the Lincoln assassination. Truly, nothing about America is sacred anymore.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/hollywood-salutes-the-world/article4452722.ece
26,2,2013,Building inclusive cities,"Rapid urbanisation led by expanding cities might have done well in terms of economic growth, but it has significantly fallen short in terms of addressing the needs of the poor. It is disquieting to note that informal settlements occupy one-third of the area in large urban centres such as Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai and the population living in urban slums is set to climb steeply to reach about 105 million in another five years — a 40 per cent increase over the 2001 level. Against this background, the recent ‘Delhi Declaration,’ a resolution drafted at the end of the international conference on Inclusive Urban Planning, organised by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation in partnership with the World Bank and UNDP, offers hope but also raises doubts. Hope is in the form of the expert group’s affirmation that the urban poor would be recognised as important stakeholders and included in the process of urban planning. This decision gives reason to believe the spatial marginalisation caused by the current form of urban planning, and the suffering it inflicts on vulnerable groups, would end. However, doubts arise because promises made in the past, such as making Indian cities slum free by 2014, have been way off mark.
Slums proliferate because cities are either too slow to respond to the needs of the poor or ignore the inequalities the housing deficit creates. Unfortunately, these informal settlements neither get government recognition nor figure in development schemes. As a result, city Master Plans focus on ‘legitimate areas’, leaving slums to languish as spatial black holes without adequate urban services. Their vulnerability multiplies as their potential property value increases due to location. As a first step, taking a cue from countries like Brazil which have experience in slum upgradation, municipal governments should recognise informal settlements as special zones of social interest. This would provide much-needed legal protection, prevent forced eviction and stop deterioration of living conditions. Development plans can follow and integrate these informal areas with the mainstream planning process. When critical slum upgradation programmes such as the Dharavi redevelopment project, announced more than two decades ago, remain non-starters, they erode the credibility of the government. The inexplicable delays also raise the question of whether slum redevelopment is a means to exploit the real estate value. Only a participatory and transparent process — and the timely completion of such projects — will reassure the poor that the government is committed to developing inclusive cities.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/building-inclusive-cities/article4452723.ece
27,2,2013,Standard gauge,"Except for the fact that it was after 17 long years that a Congress minister got to present the Railway budget, there was nothing particularly unique about >Pawan Kumar Bansal’s maiden essay. Having raised fares a little over a month ago, he was able to spare passengers this time, but he has put in place a dynamic tariff mechanism for freight to take care of future increases in the price of fuel. This is likely to result in a 5 per cent rise in freight rates from April 1, with the promise of a half-yearly fuel price adjustment system to provide for the regular hike in diesel prices announced earlier by the government. The January 22 passenger fare revision was meant to fetch the Indian Railways Rs. 6,600 crore in additional revenue in a full year; but the recent increase in diesel prices could cost the Railways Rs. 3,300 crore in its fuel bill. The logic of dynamic tariffs, even if only for freight, can therefore hardly be faulted. On the passenger fare front, though the basic fare has not increased, the minister has raised the reservation, tatkal, supplementary, cancellation and super fast train charges marginally. With the focus on making the Railways “financially sustainable,” Mr. Bansal is hoping to end 2013-14 with a balance of Rs. 12,506 crore in Railway funds.
A major achievement of the Railways in what has otherwise been a lacklustre year is the significant improvement in its Operating Ratio, i.e. total expenses as a percentage of revenue. Currently at 88.8 per cent, it has now been projected to reach 87.8 per cent in the coming year. Because of the slowdown in the economy last year, the Railways’ annual plan as well as freight loading target had to be scaled down. Against an estimated Rs. 60,100 crore plan for the current year, the Railways pruned it to just over Rs. 52,000 crore. This has been raised to Rs. 63,363 crore for the coming year and the challenge lies in achieving that. The focus of the plan seems to be on doubling of tracks, raising capacity, improving safety and significantly enhancing passenger amenities on trains and at stations. Internet ticket booking hours have been extended to allow customers to make reservations 23 hours a day. Like his predecessors, Mr. Bansal could not resist the temptation of announcing a string of new manufacturing units, 67 new express and 27 new passenger trains, in addition to a host of new lines and surveys. Of course, many if not most of these have gone to select constituencies important to the Congress party, and to electorally important States such as Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. With general elections due in 2014, Mr. Bansal has used the budgetary means at his disposal to signal the onset of campaign season.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/standard-gauge/article4456132.ece
27,2,2013,Old Faithful does it again,"It is almost nineteen years since India’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) made its first successful flight. On Monday, this trusty rocket, with a distinctive configuration involving solid and liquid propulsion in its core stages, maintained its richly deserved reputation for rugged reliability. In the course of an unbroken chain of 22 successful launches, it has carried 27 Indian spacecraft as well as 35 foreign ones to space. It has taken earth-viewing satellites, which typically orbit the earth from pole to pole, as well as those like the meteorological satellite, Kalpana-1, and the communication satellite, GSAT-12, that need to linger thousands of kilometres above the equator. It lofted India’s Chandrayaan-1 on the first leg of its journey to the Moon. In its latest flight, the rocket's fourth stage twisted and turned very precisely to eject seven satellites, one after another, into just the right orbits. The primary payload on this occasion was the Indo-French ‘Satellite with ARgos and ALtika’ (SARAL). It is equipped with an altimeter that allows sea surface height to be measured from space with greater precision than before. With sea levels rising as a result of a steadily warming climate, this satellite will join other altimeter-bearing spacecraft in ensuring continuity of observation over the oceans. A large number of Indian scientists are part of an international team that will be carrying out projects utilising the satellite’s data. With SARAL, the Indian Space Research Organisation has been able to demonstrate the basic structure, known in technical parlance as a ‘bus,’ for a 400-kg-class satellite. The same ‘Indian Mini Satellite (IMS) Bus series-2’ will go into ADITYA-1, the Indian space agency’s scientific mission to observe the Sun’s corona, scheduled for launch in three to four years’ time.
There are some important missions coming up for ISRO this year. The next launch is likely to be that of the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) equipped with an indigenous cryogenic stage. The first flight with that indigenous stage three years ago had ended in failure and ISRO needs to show that it has mastered this difficult technology. The first of seven satellites for the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) is scheduled to go up later this year, as also the country’s first mission to Mars. A test of the more powerful GSLV Mark-III, with a dummy cryogenic stage, too is on the cards. Many challenges lie ahead and the Indian space agency must, in the words of President Pranab Mukherjee, who witnessed the latest launch, “raise the bar of its performance, scale greater heights and explore newer frontiers.”

28,2,2013,A realistic assessment,"The Economic Survey is integral to the budget process, bringing out the economic trends in the country on the eve of the budget presentation. This facilitates a better appreciation of resource mobilisation and allocation in the budget. If the Survey is a dissertation on the economy from a purely economic perspective, the budget is largely a political response to the economic issues it outlines. The difference is crucial and explains why so often in the recent past there has been such a wide disconnect between the two. On a few occasions, the Surveys have been more akin to visionary statements, outlining desirable but impractical goals. The latest Survey, fortunately, neither exaggerates nor downplays the causes and consequences of the current economic problems. The slowdown, characterised by low growth and high inflation, is rooted in domestic as well as external causes. During the two years 2009-10 and 2010-11, the post-crisis stimulus led to strong growth and boosted consumption. That, along with supply side constraints, led to higher inflation which, in turn, produced monetary tightening and sharply lower growth. The two obvious policy measures to regain a higher growth trajectory are, therefore, a softening of monetary policy and the easing of supply bottlenecks, especially relating to infrastructure.
Positing a “bottoming out” of the economy, the Survey optimistically predicts a growth rate of between 6.1 and 6.7 per cent during 2013-14, sharply higher than the 5 per cent during this year. It says headline inflation will fall to between 6.2 and 6.6 per cent by the end of next month. There are, however, good reasons why we may not meet those targets. Since growth is strongly correlated with investment, it is necessary to bridge the savings-investment gap which rose to minus 4.2 per cent of GDP at the end of last year. With savings by the government and private sector shrinking, the current account deficit — i.e. the investment that cannot be financed by domestic savings and has to be financed from abroad — widened. Together, the CAD and fiscal deficit threaten macroeconomic stability and are sure to figure high up in the budget’s list of prime concerns. The Survey’s suggestions for reining in subsidies are not new. It has emphasised the need for better targeting and reduced leakages in their delivery. These are areas which the Finance Minister will most likely address. Also certain are allocations to support the National Food Security legislation, a major socio-economic — and indeed political — initiative of the government in the run up to the next general election. Although the subsidy outgo might go up, the Survey is absolutely right when it calls for this important scheme to be supported.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-realistic-assessment/article4459564.ece
28,2,2013,Outrage in Bhandara,"A fortnight after the bodies of three daughters of an impoverished Dalit widow were found in a well in a village in Maharashtra’s Bhandara district, the investigation languishes. The victims, aged 11, 8 and 6, went to school and never came back. After villagers gave up a nightly search, the police took their time to even accept a complaint. Two days later, the bodies were spotted. According to the police, the girls were raped before being murdered. The only arrest so far has been of a teacher of the school, who was found not to have realised that the children had missed their noon-meal, although she had earlier in the day forbidden two of them from leaving during school hours. It would appear from accounts of the sequence of events that had the police acted on time, the girls could have been found. Fifteen police teams were assigned to the case after the inspector who failed to act quickly on the matter was suspended. The insensitivity and class bias among sections of the law enforcement agencies are once again in evidence here. The sense of insecurity that poor policing and entrenched lawlessness could together engender varies only in scale between rural areas and urban regions. With the trauma of the gang-rape and murder of a young woman in New Delhi last December still raw, the Bhandara case once again highlights the distance this country has to travel.
Incredibly, Maharashtra’s Home Minister, who claimed a little too prematurely last week that the case was “80 per cent solved,” has since blamed the residents of the village for not cooperating with the police. Many VIPs have been visiting the victims’ family. But such visits seem to have only added to the agony of the family and the problems of the police force which, while facing the heat for slow investigation, needs to deploy personnel for the visits and to manage simmering popular protests in the area. Amid all this, the tragic loser is none other than the mother of the victims. Civil society has been showing a growing sense of outrage over such horrific incidents, but the structures of governance ought to respond to it on a matching scale. The enforcement of a benchmark of zero tolerance for violence against women, especially children, cannot wait any more. As the Parliamentary Standing Committee examining the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2012 that seeks to enhance punishment for crimes against women places its report before the House, with the recommendations of the Justice Verma Committee forming the backdrop, the case for the enactment of the most stringent provisions for such atrocities stands further buttressed. The certainty and the severity of punishment should act as true deterrents.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/outrage-in-bhandara/article4459567.ece
29,2,2013,Right by birth: On daughters and Hindu succession act,"The latest decision of the Supreme Court on the right of Hindu daughters to ancestral property corrects an obvious anomaly in the interpretation of a crucial 2005 amendment to the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. The verdict settles the question whether the coparcenary right of daughters comes into effect only if the father through whom they claim that right was alive on the day the amendment came into force. The apex court has now categorically ruled that the daughters’ right flows from their birth and not by any other factor such as the existence of their fathers. In other words, it has rejected the common misinterpretation that only daughters of coparceners who were alive on that day could get an equal share in property. The court has rightly recognised that the amendment conferred equal status as a coparcener on daughters in Hindu families governed by Mitakshara law, and this right accrued by birth. The change came into effect from September 9, 2005, but with a provision that partitions or testamentary disposition that had taken place prior to December 20, 2004 — the date on which the amendment Bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha — will remain valid and unaffected by the change. This led to the interpretation that the daughters’ coparcenary rights, being prospective, would not come into effect unless both the coparcener father and his daughter were alive on September 9, 2005. This position was crystallised in a 2015 judgment of the Supreme Court in Prakash and Others vs. Phulavati. This judgment now stands overruled.
The court’s reasoning is unexceptionable. First, it locates the origin of the coparcenary right in one’s birth. Second, it finds that there is no necessity for a predecessor coparcener to be alive for one to acquire that status, as what is relevant is birth within the degrees of succession to which it extends. In that sense, the legislation, even though it comes into effect on a prescribed date, is retroactive in its application as it is linked to birth, an antecedent event. It also underscores that the legislation makes it clear that the daughter’s rights are the same “as that of a son,” and “as if she had been a son at the time of birth”. The coparcenary status given to daughters has been a subject of reform in many States, particularly in south India, long before the UPA regime brought in the amendment for the whole country. Kerala had introduced legislation in 1975, Andhra Pradesh in 1986, Tamil Nadu in 1989 and Maharashtra and Karnataka in 1994. The legislative aim was that a flagrant discrimination between sons and daughters in entitlement to an equal share in coparcenary property, that is property inherited from one’s father, grandfather or great-grandfather, should be done away with. It is indeed welcome that the apex court has sought to give full effect to this intent by setting at rest doubts arising from varying interpretations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/right-by-birth-the-hindu-editorial-on-daughters-and-hindu-succession-act/article32347299.ece
29,2,2013,Historic ratification: On universal ratification of a labour standard,"The welcome decision by the Kingdom of Tonga to outlaw the worst forms of child labour is the first time in the International Labour Organization (ILO)’s 101-year history that a labour standard has been universally ratified. Convention 182, which was adopted in the 1999 annual international labour conference, prohibits the sexual exploitation of children, trafficking, deployment in armed conflict and other conditions that compromise their overall well-being. The Convention complements the ILO’s efforts under the 1973 Minimum Age Convention to prevent the employment of children below a lower age threshold. Under the influence of both these ILO standards, millions of young boys and girls have been rescued from hazardous conditions of work. Concomitantly, these have resulted in significant increases in enrolments in primary education. The landmark ratification, however, does not detract from the enormity of the challenge that remains. An estimated 152 million are trapped in child labour and 72 million of them are engaged in hazardous work. If anything, current efforts would have to be stepped up significantly to achieve the ambitious goal of total abolition of the scourge of child labour by 2025. But the COVID-19 pandemic is threatening a reversal of recent gains, with widespread job losses, deterioration in conditions of work, decline in household incomes and temporary school closures.
The historic first universal ratification of a global labour standard may be an occasion for celebration; it is nonetheless a moment for sober reflection. The two instruments on child labour are among the eight core ILO Conventions regarded as embodying the spirit of the 1998 declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work. Instruments relating to the freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining and the elimination of discrimination in employment and occupation are among the others. These conventions provide the necessary framework to counteract the predominance of informality in the conditions of work and ought to be a priority for governments. Though belated, India has signalled its legal commitment to the elimination of child labour with its 2017 ratification of Convention 182 and the instrument prescribing the minimum age of work for children. As the world prepares to designate 2021 as the year to abolish child labour, governments must seize the moment to instil hope in the future generations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/historic-ratification-the-hindu-editorial-on-universal-ratification-of-a-labour-standard/article32347515.ece
1,3,2013,The sum of small bangs,"Buffeted by strong headwinds blowing from several directions, Finance Minister P. Chidambaram has had very little room for major new initiatives or ideas while fashioning the Union budget for 2013-14. The exaggerated expectations of many investors — especially those from abroad — could probably never have been met, certainly not at a time when the economy is threatened with macroeconomic instability. And though this budget will be the last full budget of the UPA government, the fact that the general elections are still more than a year away means the Finance Minister has had to squarely balance the competing claims of economics and politics. In the context of the fiscal deficit, the former suggested austerity while the dictates of the latter indicated a loosening of purse strings. The ensuing balancing act explains why there are no headline grabbing revenue or expenditure measures in the budget.
In the event, the budget’s estimate of Plan expenditure for 2013-14 at Rs.5,55,322 crore out of a total expenditure of Rs.16,65,297 crore is 29.4 per cent more than the revised estimate for the current year. Apart from providing sufficient funds for all flagship programmes, his budget lays emphasis on welfare programmes targeted at the youth, Scheduled Castes and Tribes, minorities as well as women and children. The allocation to the Agriculture ministry has been stepped up by nearly 22 per cent of the revised estimate of the current year. The target for agricultural credit has been set at Rs.700,000 crore, sharply higher than the target of Rs.575,000 crore for the current year. The Rs.10,000 crore set aside for implementing the provisions of the proposed National Food Security Bill seems inadequate but this is said to be over and above the normal provision of food subsidy and may also indicate a rollout towards the end of the fiscal year.
With supply-side bottlenecks contributing to the economic slowdown, the budget wisely gives centre stage billing to infrastructure development. A number of institutions will be permitted to raise tax free bonds, up to a total sum of Rs.50,000 crore. Welcome as these and other initiatives are, infrastructure development requires concerted government action and a review of the implementation models, especially public-private partnerships, on which so much faith is reposed. A company investing Rs.100 crore or more in plant and machinery during the next two years will be entitled to deduct an investment allowance of 15 per cent of investment in addition to the current rates of depreciation. This is the only important tax measure in the budget aimed at reviving manufacturing which has been in the doldrums. Specific steps in the budget to incentivise household savings include a re-launch of the failed Rajiv Gandhi Equity Savings Scheme for first-time investors and inflation-indexed instruments. In the past, variable interest savings instruments have not taken off partly due to lack of clarity on the benchmarks. The move to provide home loan borrowers with an additional one lakh rupees deduction from interest subject to certain conditions is promising but greater clarity about its applicability are needed. The financial sector has received a fair share of attention. Public sector banks will be provided sufficient funds to meet the evolving regulatory capital requirements. Comprehensive changes in the rules relating to registration of foreign portfolio investors and other classes of overseas investors are proposed. The ambiguity that exists in defining foreign institutional investment and foreign direct investment is being removed. Foreign institutional investors are being allowed entry in the exchange traded currency derivative segments. These moves underline the importance of foreign capital in the current economic scenario.
Personal taxation has been left largely untouched, though taxpayers in the first bracket of Rs.2 lakhs to Rs.5 lakhs will get a tax credit of Rs.2000. There is disappointment that the limit for eligible deductions under section 80 C of the Income Tax Act has not been raised. The proposed surcharge on “super-rich” taxpayers — defined as those having a taxable income of one crore rupees or more — is a symbolic rather than a revenue gathering measure. With only 42,800 individuals falling in this category, the fiscal impact will be minimal. In the end, this budget will be evaluated on how far it meets the criteria set by the Finance Minister himself. These include (a) containing the fiscal deficit to within 5.3 per cent of the GDP, (b) dealing with the burgeoning current account deficit, and (c) reviving the growth process. The fiscal deficit has been brought down to 5.2 and is slated to go down to 4.8 per cent next year. But the government’s primary deficit — the amount by which total expenditure, excluding interest repayments, exceeds total revenue — will still be high at 1.5 per cent. On tackling the CAD the budget offers little direct help. Even the expected measures to rein in gold imports are absent. Of course export promotion and a revival in manufacturing will aid the balance of payments. But will the budget spur growth? The danger is that growth prospects may get squeezed at both the supply and demand ends. Mr. Chidambaram has compressed demand, preferring to propitiate animal spirits rather than human ones, but not enough to enthuse the corporate sector. The investors whose appetites were whetted by Mr. Chidambaram’s early actions as Finance Minister last year are visibly upset at the absence of a big ‘reform’ bang. If indeed the economy has “bottomed out,” the budget still has enough small bangs to bring some buoyancy. If not, the much anticipated revival may well prove elusive.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-sum-of-small-bangs/article4463015.ece
2,3,2013,Eastern promises,"In politics, it is not change that often comes as a surprise, but continuity. Tripura delivered a fifth straight win for the Left Front led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), with voters clearly reposing their faith in the course of peace and development set by Chief Minister Manik Sarkar. In an era when the term anti-incumbency is used to explain away any and all electoral defeats, the winning sequence of the Left Front might seem an exception. But then, people do not throw out a government on account of fatigue or boredom, but because of dissatisfaction with the governance. Mr. Sarkar, and before him Dasarath Deb, gave the people of Tripura clean, corruption-free governance with a twin-focus on conciliation and progress. The massive victory, with five-sixths of the seats in the 60-member Assembly, underscores the positive mandate for the Left. The Congress and its ally among the tribal population, the Indigenous Nationalist Party of Twipra, put up a united fight, but the people evidently were not looking for an alternative. United or divided, the opposition did not matter. A government’s performance always trumps the opposition’s promise. In sharp contrast to the situation in Tripura, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) seems to have squandered much of the goodwill with which it came to power in West Bengal less than two years ago. In the three Assembly by-elections, the TMC won only one, but more importantly, it came third in the two seats it lost. The Congress, which had won all the three seats in the 2011 general election in alliance with the TMC, won one seat, and the Left Front the third. Clearly the signs are ominous: without the Congress as an ally, and at the head of a lacklustre administration, the Trinamool will not fare well.
Like Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya also voted for the incumbents. The Naga People’s Front won a third successive term, this time with a huge majority. The Congress, which won 22 seats in 2008, managed only eight now. Starved of power, the Congress appears to have weakened considerably. The secretive approach of the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre to the Naga talks might also have had a negative impact on the fortunes of the Congress; quite evidently, the State unit of the Congress could not politically leverage the situation. In Meghalaya, the Congress outperformed itself while still falling short of a simple majority. Unlike five years ago, when its Big Brother attitude united the entire opposition against it, the Congress will be hoping to provide a stable government. The abode of the clouds is the only silver lining for the Congress, but it is no more than a lining.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/eastern-promises/article4466264.ece
2,3,2013,Celestial fireball,"The 2012 DA14 asteroid tracked in advance did not harm us; it skimmed past nearly 27,600 km from the Earth on February 15. But the same day, a meteor, unconnected with 2012 DA14, came out of the blue and exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia at 9.25 am local time injuring more than a thousand people. It has many firsts to its credit. The 55-foot meteor weighed about 10,000 tonnes before it entered Earth’s atmosphere. It is the largest known celestial object to strike Earth more than a century after the one that came crashing down over the Tunguska River in Siberia in 1908. The >Chelyabinsk meteor had a speed of only 18 km per second, far less than the April 22, 2012 Sutter’s Mill record speed of 28.6 km per second. Once the Russian meteor entered the atmosphere, a combination of pressure and heat caused it to break apart 19-24 kilometres above the earth producing a fireball that blazed across the sky. According to the Russian Geographic Society, the bright flare was more than 2,500 degree C. The disintegration took place 32.5 seconds after it entered the atmosphere, and released an estimated energy of nearly 500 kilotons, NASA notes. The shockwaves caused by the explosion shattered glass and damaged many buildings. The infrasound produced by the meteor was the strongest ever detected by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBT) sensors.
Based on video footage, researchers have already reconstructed the meteor’s orbit and class. According to the February 22 results posted on arXiv, only “a relatively small number” of meteors’ orbits have ever been reconstructed. Results suggest the meteor belongs to the common Apollo family of near-earth asteroids from the belt between Mars and Jupiter. Meteors come crashing into the atmosphere very often, but only a few strike our planet. Yet, the compulsion to spot dangerous ones hurtling towards Earth cannot be overemphasised. However, even under the best of conditions, the faint Russian meteor coming in the morning from the east would have been visible at best just two hours before it struck, notes NASA. Aside from their damage potential, it must be remembered that meteorites have great scientific value; they provide invaluable information about the Solar System’s early history. The three meteorite pieces of Sutter’s Mill carbonaceous chondrites recovered within two days of its disintegration provided “a rare glimpse ... of reactive and organic compounds that may be present at the surface of asteroids,” a December 2012 paper in Science notes. Though the meteorite’s pieces are ordinary chondrites with a stony composition, their immediate recovery before possible contamination can spring a surprise or two about the heavenly fireball’s properties.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/celestial-fireball/article4466263.ece
4,3,2013,The Modi project,"The primary objective of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s two-day National Council meeting held in Delhi was to confirm the appointment of Rajnath Singh as the new helmsman. But as expected, the event turned into a showcase for Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi who, in turn, received the blizzard of praise as if he already knew his destiny. It was to have been the incoming president’s special moment. And yet if Mr. Singh felt discomfited by having to defer to a Chief Minister, he betrayed nothing. Far from it, he smothered Mr. Modi with praise and insisted that he get a standing ovation for his hat-trick of Assembly election victories. The cheering delegates only too happily obliged, imparting a Congress-like feel to the enactment on stage. Indeed, no one watching the proceedings could have missed the disconnect between the BJP’s claimed abhorrence of the personality cult and the conscious brand-building of Mr. Modi. The Gujarat Chief Minister expectedly played to the gallery with one-liners aimed at the Congress and its First Family, such as that Sitaram Kesri was a “night watchman” for Sonia Gandhi and now Manmohan Singh was performing the same role for Rahul.
Mr. Modi’s running theme was that India needed positivity and self-confidence which only the BJP could provide. But, the celebration was not unmarred by hitches. Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan made it clear that the Gujarat Chief Minister was not the only ‘vikas purush’ around by providing an account of his own superlative performance in a State left “impoverished” by years of Congress “misrule.” Under his stewardship, MP had posted an average GDP growth of 10.20 per cent and a growth in agriculture of 18.91 per cent: “No other State in the country has achieved this,” he said to the obvious embarrassment of Mr. Modi and the BJP president. The meet closed with veteran Lal Krishna Advani asking for a reality check, especially on corruption: “We forgot that the people judge the commitment of any political party to fight corruption not by its pronouncements but by its practice and, when the need arises, by its punitive actions.” Clearly, while attacking the Congress on corruption, the BJP had forgotten why Nitin Gadkari had to resign and why its Karnataka government is teetering on the brink. The all-out projection of Mr. Modi suggests the BJP is preparing for an eventuality where some of its partners might desert it. But while that will undoubtedly electrify the rank and file, the party would do well to remember that parliamentary elections are settled by the sum of smaller contests rather than by a single gladiatorial joust, no matter how strong its chosen hero may be.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-modi-project/article4472247.ece
4,3,2013,Look beyond foreign investors,"The mystique that stock markets seem to hold for lay people and policymakers alike gets magnified several times over in budget season. There is, most certainly, no rational basis for this. Though devoid of real significance, the share markets’ verdict on the budget in the minutes and hours after the Finance Minister’s speech continues to be extremely important to policymakers. This has been amply demonstrated again by the urgency shown by P. Chidambaram and his team in allaying concerns over a provision in the Finance Bill that seems to cast doubts on the validity of residency certificates that benefit investors routing their investments through tax treaty centres such as Mauritius. On budget day, the sharp decline in share indices was attributed to just this single provision. The fact that the concerns are confined to foreign investors and tax havens used by them says it all. The broader market and the government are explicitly acknowledging the importance of these investors. It is, therefore, not surprising that in his budget speech, the Finance Minister gave his proposals relating to the broad category of foreign investors pride of place among financial sector announcements. None of them — and virtually none of the financial sector announcements — made reference to financial outlays but are nevertheless important for the policy direction they reveal.
In moving towards internationally accepted definitions of foreign institutional investment (FII) and foreign direct investment (FDI), the government is facilitating larger foreign inflows especially in sectors that have an FDI cap. Foreign investors may not have got their entire wish list. The much-anticipated announcement to expand the role of FIIs in the debt market did not materialise. But the package for them looks very impressive when contrasted with what is available for domestic investors, especially the retail ones. There has been once again a proposal to simplify the procedures for small and medium enterprises to access their dedicated exchange. More significant, in the context of infrastructure funding, is the proposal to start a dedicated debt segment in the stock exchanges. The facilities being accorded to foreign capital can be justified in the current macroeconomic context of the widening current account deficit. Yet the economy needs domestic investors too, not just the large ones but retail investors, who should ideally be the backbone of any well developed capital market. The ambitious disinvestment target next year, of Rs.40,000 crore, brooks no delay in enhancing the retail participation in the markets.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/look-beyond-foreign-investors/article4472248.ece
5,3,2013,Rebirth of a nation,"The violence unleashed by the Jamaat-i-Islami across Bangladesh in response to the death sentence against its leader Delwar Hossain Sayedee has shown the group up in exactly the colours it wants the nation and the world to forget. Sayedee, and before him two others from the Jamaat, were convicted for their involvement in horrific crimes aimed at sabotaging the country’s march towards liberation from Pakistan, or as acts of reprisal when independence became inevitable. The Jamaat believes that the war crimes trials are politically motivated, and that Sayedee was given the death sentence because of pressure mounted by protesters on the streets demanding that all those convicted by the tribunal be hanged. For the Awami League government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the trials are a fulfilment of a long cherished mission. Not surprisingly, there are real concerns about the political overtones the trials acquired, and if due process was followed in the rush to judgment. But nor has Bangladesh witnessed the kind of popular movement that began spontaneously since the first verdicts were announced, demanding the maximum penalty for those who participated in the systematic murder, rape, and mayhem of 1971. Since early February, the thousands of students gathering peacefully at Shahbag Square in Dhaka seem to be of the view that if anything, the government has been too cautious and too slow in its efforts to heal the still raw wounds of four decades.
Call it unfortunate, or a poor reading of the turning national mood that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party led by Khaleda Zia has chosen in this matter to side with the Jamaat, its old political ally. The BNP gave its support to the 48-hour hartal called and violently enforced by the Jamaat against Sayedee’s sentencing, thus firmly casting the issue of the 1971 crimes in political, rather than national terms. If the Jamaat, or the BNP have doubts about the neutrality of the verdict, there must surely be other peaceful ways to express them. Also unbecoming of a national leader was Ms Zia’s refusal to meet President Pranab Mukherjee, who is on an official visit to Bangladesh. Despite being painted as pro-Hasina, New Delhi has made efforts to reach out to the BNP, the main opposition party, and Ms Zia’s last visit to the Indian capital was a bridge-building exercise by both sides. But the former Prime Minister has evidently chosen to see President Mukherjee’s visit at this charged moment in Bangladesh’s 40-year history as a show of support for the Awami League government. It would have been so much better for Bangladesh had she seen it as a show of solidarity with the people of her country.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rebirth-of-a-nation/article4475874.ece
5,3,2013,From freeze to thaw,"Last week’s talks between Iran and the P5+1 group of world powers in Almaty are the first to indicate the emergence of a possible way out of the stalemate over the Islamic Republic’s nuclear programme. The meeting in the Kazakh city saw the Iranian side emerge upbeat. And though P5+1 diplomats have been more circumspect, the fact that technical experts from both sides will meet in Turkey on March 17 and 18 to be followed by another round involving the political negotiators suggests an opportunity has arisen for genuine progress to be made. In the talks, the P5+1 dropped three earlier demands: that Iran stop enriching uranium to a 20 per cent concentration of the U-235 isotope, that it close down its heavily fortified Fordow enrichment plant, and that it send its stockpile of enriched fuel abroad. Instead, the U.S. and its partners now want Iran only to cease enrichment at Fordow and dismantle some of the equipment there, and sharply reduce its production of 20 per cent enriched uranium. In return, Washington and the Europeans are willing to relax some existing secondary sanctions that restrict Iran’s ability to export oil and also desist from seeking new sanctions.
At one level, Western sanctions have not been entirely effective and there was already evidence, before Almaty, of their plateauing. The United States now issues blanket waivers for countries which buy Iranian oil. Secondly, the EU General Court has ruled EU sanctions on two major Iranian banks unlawful. And yet, sanctions have hit Iran’s economy and its people hard: the rial has fallen 40 per cent in the past year, and unemployment is rising. American and European bans have also intimidated many countries and private companies into suspending Iranian links. So anything which helps reverse the sanctions tide ought to be welcomed by Tehran. The latest P5+1 offer is proof that the hard-line positions the U.S. has taken on the Iranian nuclear issue in the past have been counterproductive. Two years ago, the Obama administration scuttled a Turkish-Brazilian proposal that would have involved Iran shipping a major chunk of its 3.5 per cent enriched uranium stockpile to Turkey in exchange for enough 20 per cent uranium to produce medical isotopes at the Tehran Research Reactor. By killing that deal, the U.S. merely ensured that the Iranians went ahead and produced the 20 per cent uranium themselves. It was to sidestep this sort of outcome that the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed el-Baradei, had first floated the idea of a freeze in sanctions on Iran in exchange for a freeze in enrichment. The Almaty offer suggests the U.S. has finally understood that this is the only way to move forward.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/from-freeze-to-thaw/article4476048.ece
6,3,2013,Nepal deal is within grasp,"Nepalese parties are inching towards resolving a 10-month long political deadlock that will enable the holding of fresh elections for a new Constituent Assembly (CA). Despite Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai being the last legitimately elected leader from the floor of the house, the opposition had refused to accept polls under him. For its part, the ruling Maoist-Madhesi alliance saw no reason to hand over power to political rivals. A way out emerged last month when the Maoists proposed that an election government be formed under Chief Justice Khila Raj Regmi. The idea had prior sanction from President Ram Baran Yadav. Despite dissent from the middle-ranking leaders, the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified-Marxist-Leninist) have agreed to this proposal. However, the agreement has drawn criticism on the ground that it violates the principle of separation of powers. The Nepalese Supreme Court will also hear a case on Thursday regarding the constitutionality of the move. A chief justice leading the executive is not ideal in any democracy but Nepal’s extraordinary crisis calls for extraordinary measures. The interim constitution did not envisage the CA’s failure and has no provision for a second CA election. Given the intensity of political polarisation and mistrust, here at last is a reasonable via media.
As long as Mr. Regmi leads the transitional government, he will have nothing to do with the court and the next in line in the Supreme Court would be acting chief justice. But parties also need to agree on other key issues. The current voter rolls have almost six million fewer voters than in the 2008 polls, and four million less than the census figure of eligible voters. This disenfranchisement, deliberate or otherwise, must be addressed. Second, opposition parties have stepped back from a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ to award a colonel-level rank to the seniormost Maoist combatants integrated into the Nepal Army, leaving the peace process incomplete. Third, key constitutional vacancies, including of election commissioners, have to be filled. Fourth, the Maoists want to formalise a Truth and Reconciliation (TRC) Commission while the opposition wants to delink this from an election deal. The TRC should be a part of the deal only if the commission gives voice to victims and does not seek to brush away crimes against humanity committed during the civil war. Nepal’s parties must seize the moment, show their democratic credentials, sign a comprehensive deal, entrust the government to the chief justice, and aim for elections in June. If this timeline is not met for technical reasons, elections must be held after the monsoon and festivals in November. Nepal’s citizens are waiting to be heard.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/nepal-deal-is-within-grasp/article4479480.ece
6,3,2013,Protocol without frills,"Throughout history and across cultures, strict rules have governed the precise forms in which ordinary mortals can address those in positions of political or even ecclesiastical authority. Depending on the status and tolerance level of the addressee, getting the exact salutation wrong could even have lethal consequences. While according hyperbolic deference to royalty and religious figures poses no particular problem in a monarchical or feudal set-up, reconciling the nomenclatural requirements of authority and hierarchy with the principles of democratic citizenship is not always easy. Some forms of address are steeped in cultural, political and diplomatic traditions, but excessive protocol can also undermine the egalitarian foundations of republicanism by increasing the distance between the citizenry and those in authority. It is in this context that the initiative President Pranab Mukherjee took a few months into his presidency — to drop ceremonial honorifics such as ‘His Excellency’ being used against his name in domestic dealings and references — is so refreshing. Mr. Mukherjee’s decision sent out a progressive and contemporary message, one that others in the upper echelons of the Indian establishment have slowly begun to embrace: On Monday, Maharashtra Governor K. Sankaranarayanan decreed that he should no longer be addressed as ‘Mahamahim’ or ‘His Excellency.’ Of course in the context of international diplomacy, such terms will still have their place.
Meanwhile in India’s superior courts, lawyers continue to address judges as ‘My Lord’ and ‘Your Lordship,’ although the Bar Council of India passed a resolution in April 2006 to give up such forms of salutation. In similar fashion, the silver mace-bearer still heralds the judge as he or she walks to the courtroom. Herbert Spencer wrote in 1878 of how “words of eulogy may, like other propitiations, be traced back to the behaviour of the conquered to the conqueror.” But the world has come a long way since, and our terminology and associated practices need to reflect the change. The toning down of lofty and exalted titles by Rashtrapati Bhavan is a good step forward but its true significance lies in forcing us to question the relevance of the other appurtenances of power in modern India: the red lights on motor cars, the queue jumping, the excessive security, the free housing and perquisites, the virtual immunity from investigation and prosecution that those in authority enjoy for criminal acts. These are only some of the more unhealthy products of our ‘VIP culture.’ They set ruler apart from ruled and are far more corrosive to the spirit of the Indian Republic.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/protocol-without-frills/article4479485.ece
7,3,2013,The passing of a giant,"President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, who died of cancer in Caracas on Tuesday, was not just a visionary committed to improving the lives of the great majority of his people but a masterly politician who knew how to achieve that end. First elected in 1998 and then surviving a right-wing putsch in 2002 which collapsed in the face of huge public support for him, Mr. Chávez turned his nation of 29 million into a pivot for the political and economic renewal of an entire continent. With a clear commitment to his country’s and to Latin America’s sovereignty, the ‘Bolivarian Revolution’ that Mr. Chávez set in motion sought to reassert the independence of a region that the Libertador Simón Bolivar had set out to unify in the 19th century. Mr. Chávez started by nationalising the biggest domestic oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and negotiating vastly improved terms with the foreign oil companies which had been making colossal sums out of the world’s greatest known hydrocarbon reserves while paying a pittance in royalties. Mr. Chávez put the revenues to good use, raising social spending by over 60 per cent to $772 billion in a decade and reducing extreme poverty from 40 per cent to 7.3, in addition to expanding healthcare services; furthermore, one in three Venezuelans now gets free education up to and including university level. As for the rest of the region, soon after assuming office, Mr. Chávez accepted the services of Cuban doctors in exchange for oil supplies to a country victimised by U.S. sanctions for over 40 years. Other countries too benefited from his acts of solidarity.
Chávismo, as this approach came to be called, infuriated the United States, which had long dominated Latin America through brutal dictatorships and oligarchical democracies. Washington all but publicly welcomed the 2002 coup against President Chávez and spent the better part of the decade which followed seeking to undermine his government in one way or the other. Will his death now produce the outcome that his enemies in Venezuela and North America sought all these years? One of the weaknesses of the Chávez model was the central role that the President himself played in the system. But its strength lay in the active involvement of dozens of social movements, some of which coalesced with the socialist party he built while others remained supportive from the outside. His choice of Nicolás Maduro as Vice President was also one calculated to energise the rank and file of this extraordinary coalition. However, it is the better life which millions of Venezuelans enjoy today that will serve as the first line of defence for Chávismo as the U.S. and its allies try to turn the clock back.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-passing-of-a-giant/article4482382.ece
7,3,2013,Rahul and his cup of poison,"Rahul Gandhi’s assertion that his priority is to strengthen the organisation and not run for Prime Minister is per se unexceptionable. No leader of any standing would publicly place his own ambitions above the party. Nor can Rahul of his own accord admit to being in the prime ministerial race. Yet by holding up Mahatma Gandhi as his role model and extolling the virtues of detachment, the Congress vice-president has signalled a reluctance to wield power should he be faced with the eventuality. The ambiguity in this cannot but unsettle the Congress rank and file, which has since Independence looked to the family to provide leadership, and assumed by force of habit that the fifth-generation Nehru-Gandhi would take his rightful place when the time came. The confusion and disillusionment will be the greater for coinciding with the penultimate phase of the United Progressive Alliance’s crisis-ridden second term. With just a year to go for the general election, the ruling coalition needs more than ever to appear coherent and united. Any dithering at this time can only be to the advantage of the principal Opposition, where there is already a buzz around Narendra Modi. Congresspersons are bound to be grappling with some hard questions. If Rahul is in no mood to embrace power politics, then why did he agree to be number two in a party where the number one has ruled herself out of the prime ministerial stakes?
There was logic in the presumption that Rahul’s elevation was a precursor to his projection as the Congress’s prime ministerial candidate. Rahul surely would not have waited eight long years to accept a party post of such obvious significance if he meant to throw in the towel when the bigger opportunity came. All indications were to the effect that reluctant as he was, Rahul would eventually bite the bullet, if only out of a sense of duty towards his ‘inheritance’ — India’s largest political party. Indeed, Rahul’s emotional speech at the Congress’s Jaipur plenary was all about fulfilling a moral obligation: “My mother came to my room and cried because she understands power is poison,” he had said. An outsider watching all this might want to ask why the clan cannot once and for all sever the umbilical cord that links it to the Congress. For, as long as the family is in active politics it will find itself inescapably under pressure to lead the party. Rahul’s problem is that he wants to democratise a Congress brought up on dynasty. But his mere presence is enough to foster sycophancy. The Congress and its First Family should resolve this dilemma soon or find themselves left behind in the coming big battle.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rahul-and-his-cup-of-poison/article4482385.ece
8,3,2013,Women in the police,"Data just tabled in Parliament show that of the 16.6 lakh police personnel in India in 2011 at the constabulary level, only 93,887 are women. Progress on this count has been halting in the 80 years since India’s first policewoman donned her uniform in Travancore in 1933, but the pace has picked up of late. Nevertheless, representation is uneven across States. Mizoram had no woman in its force in 2011, while Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu had the most, almost doubling their numbers in the two years since 2009. Uttar Pradesh saw a drop, with just 2,354 women personnel in 2011 of a total of 1.87 lakh. Numbers are important. The very presence of women could create an environment for women and those from weaker sections of society to access police stations with less diffidence and difficulty than would otherwise have been the case. A critical mass should be achieved by ensuring that women comprise at least 33 per cent of the constabulary.
Yet, numbers alone will not do. Women in the constabulary must get the training, support and confidence needed to put them on a par in every sense with their male counterparts. A common gender-neutral cadre needs to be created for all ranks so that promotional opportunities are evenly available. Women should be routinely and readily considered for front-line postings at cutting edge levels based on their competence and experience. Resource centres for mentoring, creating awareness about opportunities and prospects, and helping with career planning and training and coping with workplace challenges are essential. Women have a role in making up for the lack of training and sensitisation of the force in general in dealing with crimes against women. At the same time, women constables and officers should not be ghettoised into dealing only with such crimes. As the experience in many countries of the world shows — New York City had its first policewoman as early as in 1845 — there is no policing function that women cannot perform. Given the prevalence of sexist attitudes within the bureaucracy and police, an organisational response from the force is needed to enable women to realise their full potential. The Ministry of Home Affairs should set targets for individual police forces and create a mechanism to monitor female advancement. Grants should be linked to progress achieved. Integrating women in the force should become an essential component of the process of police reform in India, enabling them to become real change agents. Having more women in the force should not be seen as just an expression of the formal fulfilment of sexual equality, important though that goal is. Rather, the contemporary needs of policing also demand it.

8,3,2013,Patently just,"The Intellectual Property Appellate Board order upholding the compulsory licence granted to Natco Pharma to produce a generic version of Nexavar, or Sorafenib, a cancer drug patented by Bayer Corporation, is a strong endorsement of lawful action taken in public interest. Access to essential medicines is fundamental to the human right to good health. India’s amended Patent law and the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights clarified by the Doha declaration are unambiguous when it comes to invoking compulsory licensing provisions to benefit people who cannot otherwise afford treatment. The pharmaceutical industry has done itself a disservice by pricing essential drugs beyond the reach of the average citizen. The phenomenon is graphically illustrated by the Nexavar case: the patented and generic equivalent are priced at Rs. 2.8 lakh and Rs. 8,800 respectively for one month’s dosage, a staggering differential. Although the licence given in the Natco case resulted in voluntary price cuts on other cancer drugs by some companies, several key branded drugs remain unaffordable in India. This is partly due to the failure of States to centrally procure and distribute them. Where such procurement exists, manufacturers are ready to sell to official agencies, such as the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation, for a fraction of the retail price.
The Twelfth Plan points out that availability of essential medicines in public sector health facilities free of cost is critical today. Equally, the list of essential medicines should be expanded, and States must set up special stores to make the drugs prescribed in the private sector available at low cost. What stands in the way of people benefiting from availability of new medicines in cancer treatment, among other areas, is the post-2005 product patent dispensation which has created manufacturer monopolies. This can be mitigated through compulsory licensing and that too by facilitating large scale manufacture in the public sector. India’s pharmaceutical market based on private sector care is worth about Rs. 56,000 crore annually, the major part being spent on non-essential medicines. The High Level Expert Group on Universal Health Coverage points out that the industry spent over a quarter of its annual turnover on sales promotion and a mere seven per cent on research and development. It is disingenuous, therefore, to argue that compulsory licensing will affect innovation. The Centre must persist with compulsory licensing and aggressive drug price controls. Favourable patent provisions must be protected and used without hesitation to advance universal health coverage.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/patently-just/article4485343.ece
9,3,2013,Raja on the run,"In the badlands of eastern Uttar Pradesh, where caste, politics and gang wars combine to make a lethal cocktail, anything is possible: A minister can cool his heels in jail and a prisoner can head to cabinet. Raghuraj Pratap Singh, or Raja Bhaiyya, straddles both zones, and with some ease, going by the legion of awe-struck accounts of the power he wields — as much in his own fief in Kunda in Pratapgarh as in the forbidding world of politics. At age 44, he has done three ministerial stints, one each in the governments of Kalyan Singh, Mulayam Singh and Akhilesh Yadav. Last week, the law once again caught up with the ‘Raja,’ forcing him to resign over accusations of involvement in the murder of Kunda Deputy Superintendent of Police Zia-ul-Haq. The policeman was himself investigating the murders in the Kunda region of a village headman and his brother. The DSP’s wife is emphatic that Raghuraj Pratap was behind his murder, and on Thursday, the Central Bureau of Investigation, which has twice before investigated complaints relating to the Kunda overlord, formally named him in one of the four FIRs registered in connection with the three murders. It is a measure of the former minister’s extraordinary clout that he has prospered politically in almost direct proportion to the many serious charges against him. Not surprisingly he has still not been arrested in the current case.
Whether or not Mr. Singh, an upper caste Thakur, is directly involved in the DSP’s murder — he says he was in Lucknow at the time — what is clear is the endemic nature of caste violence in the Pratapgarh area. Yet this has not stopped successive governments from inducting him as minister. Just how bizarre things can get at the intersection of crime and politics can be seen from the fact that Akhilesh Yadav gave Raghuraj Pratap dual charge of Prisons and Food and Civil supplies. The choices could not have been more ironic: the prison connection aside, the ‘Raja’ was Food and Civil Supplies minister in an earlier regime when a food scam brought his ministry under the CBI scanner. Akhilesh Yadav’s one refrain through the 2012 State election campaign was that he would purge the Samajwadi Party of goonda elements. Yet once in power, he surrendered abjectly to the compulsions of caste and muscle politics, admitting into his cabinet precisely those elements he had vowed to keep out. The Thakur factor is said to be the reason why the Bharatiya Janata Party and the SP equally kowtow to Raghuraj Pratap Singh. However, for that very reason he has been anathema to Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayawati — who alone has had the guts to arrest him.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/raja-on-the-run/article4488889.ece
9,3,2013,Land lessons from Australia,"Australia’s recent decision to give up uranium mining on aboriginal land in Koongarra stands in sharp contrast to the Manmohan Singh government’s dithering and double-speak on the forceful acquisition of tribal lands. This also highlights Indian officialdom’s shallow and insensitive understanding of the land and life of tribal communities. The 12.5 sq km patch of land in Koongarra is one of three uranium-rich pockets within the Kakadu National Park in northern Australia. Though the park was legally protected and even inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1981 for its archaeological and ethnological qualities, Koongarra remained excluded to facilitate commercial exploitation of uranium. The aboriginal communities opposed this and resisted moves to grant a mining lease to private companies. They knew that the operations would destroy their life, which is inextricably linked to the land, and the cultural landscape that nourishes them. Deferring to their wishes and foregoing a lucrative commercial deal, the Labour government in Australia recently passed legislation to protect the Koongarra land and include it in the national park. The UPA government too may claim that its decision to prevent bauxite mining in the Niyamgiri hills of Orissa reflects similar sensitivity. But nothing could be further from the truth.
In the Vedanta mining case, the government, through its recently filed affidavit, told the Supreme Court that it has prohibited mining in Niyamgiri hills since it would affect the Dongria Khondh tribal’s right to worship. Behind this apparently benign reasoning lurks the crushing truth. The government has reduced the complex relationship between tribal communities and their land to that of religious beliefs, ignoring important livelihood and other cultural connections. This clever dilution will slowly pave the way for easy acquisition of other tribal lands. The government also betrayed its true intentions when it stated in the same affidavit that barring exceptional cases, it would go ahead with the forceful acquisition of forest land without the consent of gram sabhas as mandated by the rules of the Forest Rights Act. The tribal communities have been among the most vulnerable and exploited groups in India. More than 40 per cent of total land acquired so far for mining and development projects belongs to them. When the adivasis and landless poor took out a mammoth procession last year demanding an end to forcible acquisition, the government promised to implement a people-friendly policy. However, its recent actions are far from reassuring. It is time to show genuine concern for the embattled tribal communities and strengthen legal measures to protect their habitat.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/land-lessons-from-australia/article4488891.ece
11,3,2013,Take Tamil Nadu out of Lanka policy,"Domestic politics will tell on external affairs as much as fine principles and strategic interests. In the context of the draft resolution on human rights violations in Sri Lanka now before the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, India will have to factor in domestic political exigencies alongside long-held principles and long-term interests while firming up its stand. Last year, India voted for a resolution asking Sri Lanka to investigate abuses by its military during the final phase of the war with the separatist LTTE. But it did so after making efforts to water down the resolution. Though appearing to have been taken under pressure from the DMK, India’s decision to vote against Sri Lanka last year was intended to tell President Mahinda Rajapaksa that his failure to move towards a settlement of the Tamil question could no longer be glossed over. If New Delhi went beyond its own norm of not voting for country-specific resolutions, it also hoped this would be no more than a one-time exception. However, with Sri Lanka having done precious little since last year’s vote to address the rights abuses and push for reconciliation, India cannot be expected to dilute its stand now.
Ever since the war ended and allegations of large-scale atrocities began to surface, it has been obvious to friends of Sri Lanka that the only way Colombo can ride the tide of rights charges is by delivering the political package it had itself once promised. Speaking on the matter in the Rajya Sabha on Friday, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh steered clear of recent allegations that the Sri Lankan army killed LTTE supremo Prabakaran’s 12-year-old son in cold blood and instead emphasised the need for Sri Lankan “national reconciliation.” This was his way of showing the Rajapaksa government how it must deal with the upcoming resolution. Dr. Singh’s dilemma is unenviable. His diplomats have told him India’s 2012 vote did not push Colombo to do the right thing as some had hoped. On the other hand, Congress ally DMK wants a further toughening of stand. The party unwisely raised the stakes last year by reviving the Tamil Eelam Supporters Organisation. TESO meetings have so far stopped short of advocating a separate state for Sri Lankan Tamils but the outfit’s revival has itself allowed hardliners in Sri Lanka to argue that the grant of rights to the Tamils is a slippery slope to their secession. Difficult though this may sound, New Delhi must craft a Lanka policy that includes a case for the island’s Tamils free of the opportunistic imprint of Tamil Nadu’s competitive politics. The more its policies towards Colombo are seen as the product of political pressure from the State, the less effective those policies will be.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/take-tamil-nadu-out-of-lanka-policy/article4494700.ece
11,3,2013,Indentured to investors,"And so, the flip-flop over taxation of foreign institutional investment through Mauritius in the Indian stock market continues. The latest episode was played out on Budget day when the stock market crashed following a provision in the Finance Bill that sought to explain that a certificate from Mauritius proving the residency of the investor was not sufficient to avoid paying capital gains tax in India. The pressure on the government was such that Finance Minister P. Chidambaram was forced to clarify the very next day that FIIs (foreign institutional investors) were safe and that their scheme of taxation would remain unchanged. And the Central Board of Direct Taxes issued a clarification on the new provision the same day as a measure of reassurance. Ever since FIIs started using the Mauritius route in the early 1990s, there have been at least three occasions — the first one as early as in 1994 — when the government sought to tax their capital gains only to beat a hasty retreat after the markets reacted adversely. It was after one such episode in April 2000 that the government issued the infamous Circular 789, which said that a tax residency certificate from Mauritius was sufficient for investors to claim benefit under the India-Mauritius Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA).
The government’s nervousness is understandable but it has only itself to blame for the embarrassment now. With a $75 billion deficit in the current account, there is little scope to antagonise FIIs, whose money the government hopes to tap to fill a part of that gaping hole. The last thing it wants is for foreign investors to pull out their money and set off a balance of payments crisis. Yet, the episode only proves the tactless way in which this sensitive issue has been addressed over the years. That FIIs should pay capital gains tax is unexceptionable but the way to go about it is not through clarifications and provisions in the Finance Bill. The proper way is to re-negotiate the DTAA and insert clauses that limit benefits based on certain parameters, just as in the India-Singapore tax treaty. That tiny Mauritius is the biggest foreign investor in India speaks volumes about how it has been misused as a conduit by investors who reside elsewhere in the world. There are also concerns of “round tripping,” where black money from India finds its way back into the market through Mauritius. The two countries set up a working group in 2006 to address issues in the DTAA but it has made little progress. The government should use this forum to re-negotiate the agreement and importantly, phase out the benefit gradually. For some policy moves, timing is all-important. This is one such.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/indentured-to-investors/article4494703.ece
12,3,2013,Death of a prisoner,"Whether it is suicide or homicide, the death of Ram Singh — the main accused in the Delhi rape case of December 2012 — inside Tihar Jail is a damning indictment of the functioning of the prison authorities. There were warning signals, early on. Ram Singh and the other accused were put on special watch, or suicide watch, after they stopped interacting with other inmates. But despite the checks and watches, Ram Singh was found dead hanging on the grille of his cell on Monday. The guard posted outside his cell, which he shared with several other inmates, did not seem to have a clue about the death. The inescapable conclusion is that there was little or no monitoring of the cell. Ram Singh’s family and his lawyers have raised the possibility of murder. There had been complaints of ill-treatment at the hands of other inmates. Sexual offenders are easy targets for fellow prisoners, who often gang up against them with the connivance of jail staff. Because of the social stigma involved with sex crimes, prison authorities sometimes turn a blind eye to complaints from those accused of sexual offences. A prisoner with suicidal tendencies is usually not kept in solitary confinement for fear it could result in a downward spiral of depression. But great care has to be taken in screening the fellow inmates, and in preventing access to instruments that could aid suicide. In the case of Ram Singh, who was found hanging with his own clothes, it is not immediately clear whether all possible precautions were taken. Clearly, a full-fledged inquiry into the circumstances of his death is necessary to fix responsibility on jail staff and senior officials.
The life of an undertrial or convict is the responsibility of the prison authorities. In the absence of ownership of such responsibility, the whole criminal justice system becomes vulnerable. As the report of the All India Committee on Jail Reforms has pointed out, prisoners have the right to human dignity, the right to integrity of the body, and immunity from repression and abuse whether by custodial staff or fellow-prisoners. Only a comprehensive inquiry can reveal whether Ram Singh was treated with dignity in the prison both by jail staff and by other inmates. As investigations are complete, the Delhi rape case does seem an open-and-shut case with the identification and arrest of the accused. Ram Singh’s death, therefore, may not have implications for the conduct of the case and the trial of the other accused. However, this death should provoke changes in some of the processes and procedures in jail administration and bring amendments to the jail manuals to guarantee and ensure the rights of prisoners as human beings.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/death-of-a-prisoner/article4497992.ece
12,3,2013,The infrastructure challenge,"The crucial role infrastructure development plays in easing supply side constraints to economic growth has been well recognised. In common with all its predecessors, the recent budget accords priority to infrastructure finance for very valid reasons. The requirements are huge: according to the 12th Plan, as much as Rs. 55,00,000 crore is required for investment in infrastructure, with nearly 47 per cent coming from the private sector. Not just the scale but certain special features of infrastructure finance make the task especially daunting. Commercial banks, which seldom accept deposits for longer than three years, run the risk of a balance-sheet mismatch in lending to infrastructure projects, which are of a long duration. In his budget speech, the Finance Minister outlined a few steps that will enhance the quantum of funds available through dedicated institutional arrangements. For instance, a few more infrastructure debt funds, in addition to the four existing ones will be set up. These will provide long-term, low-cost debt through innovative means for infrastructure projects. The India Infrastructure Finance Corporation, in league with the Asian Development Bank, will facilitate access to the bond market for long-term funds. The limit for tax free infrastructure bonds has been increased to Rs.50,000 crore during fiscal 2013-14.Trading in debt instruments through the stock markets has been made easier. A regulatory authority for the road sector to take care of special challenges such as enhanced construction risk has been announced.
In the broader area of reviving investment, the only fiscal measure of note in the budget has been the introduction of an investment allowance of 15 per cent for a period of two years for new, high value investment of a minimum of Rs.100 crore. Welcome as this is, it is doubtful whether one measure alone is sufficient given the nature of the slowdown. According to the Economic Survey, new investments have been drying up across sectors, partly as a consequence of rising stalled projects that reduce the ability of firms to start new ones. Almost 80 per cent of the stalled projects are in key infrastructure areas such as electricity, roads and telecommunications. From a macroeconomic perspective, it is important to step up the investment rate, which had declined to 35 per cent in 2011-12 from 36.8 per cent the previous year. Gross domestic savings have also fallen sharply to just over 30 per cent in 2011-12. The household sector, which contributes the most to domestic savings, must be incentivised further. The budget’s specific proposals, including reviving the Rajiv Gandhi Equity Savings Scheme, and the promise of inflation-linked bonds are hardly inspiring.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-infrastructure-challenge/article4497994.ece
18,3,2013,Language of merit,"Widespread criticism of the changes notified recently by the Union Public Service Commission involving the language component in the Civil Services examination has forced the Union government to put those plans on hold pending review. The “language bias” allegation that has been made by almost all the detractors is centred on the perception that English has been given a more prominent place in the scheme of things compared to regional languages, including Hindi. Some of them point out that a paper that carries 100 marks in English comprehension and précis will now affect the merit ranking of candidates where earlier her or his facility in English was tested only at the qualifying stage. This, it is argued, favours urban, English-medium educated candidates, at the cost of those from rural and disadvantaged backgrounds. Other controversial changes, though predictably less of a red rag for our usual English-baiters, involve the subtle downgrading of India’s regional languages in the UPSC exam. For example, students who study in any language other than English or Hindi will no longer be able to write a crucial paper in that language unless their undergraduate degree also happened to be in that medium of instruction.
The thrust since Independence has been on giving the Indian Administrative Service and allied cadres the stamp of an inclusive and representative stream, effacing the elitism that was the predominant feature of the Indian Civil Service that preceded it. It is this rationale that led to a selection process where candidates belonging to poorer and deprived classes or from hitherto under-represented regions are also able to make their mark. This approach is crucial to ensuring that officers who lead the bureaucracy have the right orientation to give primacy to the principles of equity in decision-making. Any debate that posits the “language bias” argument to downplay the need for verbal and written fluency in English is fraught with danger. In today’s India, administrators have to be able to communicate effectively in English. To that extent, the UPSC exam must ensure that a successful candidate has a minimum level of proficiency in the language. That said, using English as a merit-ranking device may not produce an optimum outcome. While candidates who study in English-medium schools are likely to know the language better than others, there is no reason to assume their overall knowledge base or skill set is better than those who have studied in other languages. Allowing candidates to answer a common set of questions in the language they are most comfortable in is the best way to assess their suitability. Of course, the post-entrance training process can and must be used to improve standards of English.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/language-of-merit/article4519267.ece
18,3,2013,India’s continuing shame,"There could not have been a more naked admission of the government’s all-round failure. A new law is already in the making to replace the 1993 Act to prohibit the employment of manual scavengers and the construction of dry latrines. The current law was conceived erroneously and solely as a corrective to a public health and sanitation problem, rather than as a guarantee of justice, equality and a life of dignity for persons employed as manual scavengers. Ironically, there is little evidence on the ground of any improvement in public hygiene and sanitation standards. Almost the entire two decades since the 1993 law has been spent in fulfilling a procedural prerequisite. As the legislation was enacted under the Constitution’s State List, the same had to be separately adopted and enforced by various State governments. Then, the 2011 decennial population census findings that there are as many as 2.6 million insanitary latrines in the country met with stout official denials. Some governments even filed affidavits in the Supreme Court to the effect that there were neither manual scavengers nor dry latrines in their States, without disclosing details about any survey they had carried out to back their claim.
The relevant Standing Committee has just laid its report on the bill before both Houses of Parliament. The new bill addresses manual scavenging under Entry 24 (welfare of labour and working conditions) of the Concurrent List. While this may be an improvement over the current law, the real point is to recognise this debasingly inhuman and iniquitous practice as such. The Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment must incorporate this all-important modification to show genuine commitment to restore basic dignity to persons employed as manual scavengers. Significantly, the bill stipulates a prohibition on the hazardous manual cleaning of sewers and septic tanks. The Indian Railways, the largest single employer of this country, has helped perpetuate this caste-ordained practice for decades. They should also bear the bulk of the blame for contributing to the insanitary state of stations and tracks. Handling some 8.4 billion trips per annum and adding about 3000 coaches, it should not be beyond its capacity to equip trains with systems to manage faecal waste. A sustained campaign by grassroots movements, including public interest litigation, has sought to combat this grotesque form of violation of basic human rights but it has been an uphill battle because of official apathy. The time to end this callousness is now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/India%E2%80%99s-continuing-shame/article12388776.ece
19,3,2013,Mindless solidarity,"A fanatic fringe seems intent on hijacking the protest movement in Tamil Nadu against Sri Lanka’s treatment of its Tamil citizens. With the terrorist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam no longer in the picture, large sections of the people in Tamil Nadu have begun to openly sympathise with the plight of Tamils in Sri Lanka. But, even as the protest movement gathers momentum, extremist outfits without any popular base have started carrying out violent attacks on Sri Lankan students and offices. After the ransacking of the Madurai office of Mihin Lanka, which offers cheap flights to Sri Lanka from different cities in Tamil Nadu, activists belonging to some of these outfits assaulted a Sri Lankan Buddhist monk who was part of a student team. Even Sri Lankan Tamils on pilgrimage to India have been at the receiving end of violence by people claiming to represent these outfits. Also, the very same people claiming to champion the rights of Sri Lankan Tamils have sought to paint the troubles of Indian fishermen venturing into Sri Lankan waters in the colours of a Sinhalese-Tamil conflict, though the conflict is essentially between Indian Tamil and Sri Lankan Tamil fishermen over fishing rights and livelihood concerns. Clearly, the efforts of these outfits seem directed at gaining publicity and winning new followers rather than at furthering the cause of Sri Lankan Tamils. Obfuscation of the real issues appears to be part of the overall strategy.
That the protests and attacks have peaked at a time when a resolution on human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan military toward the end of the war with the LTTE in 2009 is before the United Nations Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva is certainly no coincidence. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and the principal opposition party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, have been asking the Centre to put pressure on Sri Lanka to punish those responsible for human rights abuses and to honour its responsibilities and commitments to Sri Lankan Tamils. However, the mindless violence of some of the fringe Tamil outfits is putting at risk India’s own moral authority to urge Sri Lanka to move towards a political settlement of the ethnic conflict. India’s approach toward Sri Lanka cannot hinge entirely or even primarily on domestic politics in Tamil Nadu. Those in Tamil Nadu talking of a separate Tamil Eelam as a solution seem to have no clue about the human costs that would be involved in partitioning a country and a people. India must look beyond Tamil Nadu while bringing to bear diplomatic pressure on Sri Lanka and working in coordination with other countries to ensure full and equal rights for Tamils as citizens of a united Sri Lanka.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mindless-solidarity/article4522740.ece
19,3,2013,Moment of reckoning,"Nitish Kumar has spoken and what he had to say is unlikely to have warmed the cockles of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s heart. The Bihar Chief Minister did not name names but the message was as loud as it could get: he would look elsewhere if the BJP was insistent on projecting Narendra Modi as the National Democratic Alliance’s prime ministerial choice. Of course, in politics nothing is final till it is final. Even so, it was evident that Mr. Kumar had crossed a critical threshold in his relationship with his long-term ally. Not only did the Janata Dal (United) chief exude style, there was enough and more symbolism in how and where he made his speech. Mr. Kumar flexed his muscles at a well-attended rally, not in Patna where mustering the crowds would have been easy enough, but in the Capital where the BJP and other national parties are headquartered. He flagged the ‘inclusive’ character of Bihar’s development, thereby thumbing his nose at the BJP’s much-celebrated ‘development’ man. And if doubts persisted, he dispelled them by asserting that he had better credentials to rule at the Centre: “This is only a trailer and it shows that Biharis are ready to rule Delhi in 2014.”
Admittedly this is not the first time the Bihar Chief Minister has sparred and warred with the BJP on the issue of Mr. Modi. He has snubbed the Gujarat Chief Minister publicly on many occasions and warned the BJP against sending him to Bihar to conduct election campaigns. Yet for all that he was at daggers drawn with Mr. Modi, Mr. Kumar, unlike Naveen Patnaik in Orissa, has always stopped short of breaking off with the BJP. The explanation for this lies in the fact that the BJP and the JD(U) are structurally inter-dependent in Bihar, with the former thought to contribute upper caste votes to the latter’s core constituency of OBCs and most backwards. Electorally, the BJP has been a strong performer in the State, making it difficult for the JD(U) to find a ready replacement. But clearly, the moment of reckoning has arrived with Mr. Modi making no secret of his larger national ambitions. Any further ambivalence on Mr. Kumar’s part would have surely emboldened the BJP into assuming that he was ready to bark but not bite. Perhaps the Bihar Chief Minister has learnt a thing or two from Mr. Patnaik, who broke with the BJP over the Kandhamal violence. He did this knowing fully well that the rupture could benefit the Congress, which held the largest share of votes in Orissa. But Mr. Patnaik deduced, and rightly too, that going for broke can fetch blockbuster dividends, provided the decision is seen to be arising from conviction. That’s why Mr. Kumar seems to have decided it pays to stand up and be counted.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/moment-of-reckoning/article4522739.ece
20,3,2013,From defensive to offensive,"The less there is to lose, the more there is to gain. In quitting the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre with only a year to go before the general election, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam is not exactly taking a huge political gamble. The possible political gains far outweigh the inherent risks in leaving a ruling coalition and being out of power at the Centre as well as in the State. As the protest movement on the Sri Lankan Tamils issue gathers steam in Tamil Nadu, the DMK realised it could be under attack for being part of the government at the Centre. The party, therefore, thought it wiser to hunt with the hounds rather than run with the hare. Instead of having to defend the Centre’s action or inaction on Sri Lanka, the DMK will now have the freedom to question and criticise the UPA’s foreign policy. Of course, the party is now without a strong ally in the State. But, then, the DMK knows that the alliance with which it won the 2004 and 2009 Lok Sabha elections and the 2006 Tamil Nadu Assembly election had failed to deliver in the 2011 Assembly election. Circumstances are propitious for a political churning as the ruling party in the State, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, too has alienated all its allies of 2011. Ideally, the DMK would have liked to time the break-up closer to the general election, but with the spontaneous overflow on to the streets of powerful feelings of Tamil identity, party patriarch M. Karunanidhi decided to seize the opportunity. With several of his earlier threats to leave the UPA on the Lankan issue having achieved nothing tangible, the DMK president was also under pressure to show that he meant what he said. No matter what happens with the resolution at the United Nations Human Rights Council, Mr. Karunanidhi will be hard to please from now on.
Although the UPA government is not in imminent danger of collapse, it no longer has the comfort of numbers. Any one of the parties supporting the government from the outside, especially the Samajwadi Party or the Bahujan Samaj Party, can now trigger a general election before schedule. What this means is that in the most crucial period before elections, the Congress will not have the ability to push ahead with its economic reforms and political agenda overriding opposition from other UPA constituents and supporting parties. The DMK too might not be looking at an early general election. Memories of the drubbing it took two years ago after the 2G spectrum scam are still fresh, and Mr. Karunanidhi might like to give the AIADMK some more time to slide down in the popularity graph. However, the party must be hoping to make better use of its time in opposition than it made of its time in power.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/from-defensive-to-offensive/article4526506.ece
20,3,2013,Back to the Dark Age,"Over the years Indian politics has come to be defined by a peculiar characteristic: it has become more inclusive and representative in terms of caste and class but regressed on issues relating to women. This uncomfortable truth was brought home in the aftermath of the widely condemned Delhi gang rape. Politicians claimed to be revulsed by the violence which extinguished a young life. Yet in their speeches, they borrowed freely from patriarchal notions of the woman’s place, viewing rape as defilement and equating it with death. The larger political view on the age of consent is similarly obscurantist in the way it understands sex and marriage. The age for consensual sex is 16 under the Indian Penal Code but under pressure from the Opposition, the United Progressive Alliance government has been forced to raise this to 18 in the proposed Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2013, which aims to strengthen the legal architecture relating to sexual crimes against women. The deeply conservative Bharatiya Janata Party has expectedly placed itself in the vanguard of the battle against lowering the age of consent.
The BJP’s opposition is on the grounds that a lowered age of consent would result in a wave of sexual permissiveness resulting in the disruption of family values. Surprisingly, the view seems to have found acceptance among the so-called Lohiaite parties such as the Samajwadi Party, the Janata Dal (United) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal. Ironically, their mentor Ram Manohar Lohia was a happy libertarian in these matters. As far back as 1953, he wrote: “If a girl knocks around and elopes and mischances into illegitimacy, that is all part of the bargain to achieve normal relationships between man and woman and no stain at all.” The progressive argument for separating sex and marriage and setting the age of consensual sex at 16 is that in urban India as much in the villages pre-marital sex is today a social reality. The benchmark of 18 is not just unrealistic, it will criminalise sexual activity below that age, giving a handle to violent outfits such as khap panchyats which habitually penalise young people by misrepresenting consensual sex as rape. A higher age of consent will adversely affect relationships outside the traditional caste and community boundaries, promoting societal intolerance towards perceived transgressions. As lawyer Vrinda Grover has persuasively argued, law should strengthen our rights and freedoms and not become an instrument of social control and moral policing. But political parties that tear up the women’s reservation bill, and field men accused of rape in elections are hardly likely to understand the importance of gender sensitivity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/back-to-the-dark-age/article4526511.ece
21,3,2013,Dangerous for democracy,"The ‘counter-affidavit’ submitted by the Union government to the Supreme Court in the Ashok Chavan case is a scandal. Simply put, it argues that the Election Commission of India has no power to disqualify a candidate on the basis of his or her poll expenditure accounts, even if those have been falsified. It holds that the ECI’s power to disqualify a candidate “arises only in the event of failure to lodge an account of expenses and not for any other reason…” The government is, in the process, calling for a radical and dangerous change in the way polls are conducted in India. If there is one issue on which there is a consensus in the country, it is on the damage inflicted on free and fair elections by the unbridled rise of money power. Now the government argues that the “correctness or otherwise” of the accounts is no concern of the body that conducts and regulates elections. The United Progressive Alliance government is behaving with the ECI the way it has with the Comptroller & Auditor General. It is trying to bat its way out of ugly scams and scandals by seeking to curb the independence of these constitutional bodies. This is dangerous for accountability and for democracy, given the signal role assigned to the Election Commission in our political system.
The fact that this affidavit has been filed in the Ashok Chavan case — notoriously known as the ‘paid news’ case — makes things worse. Mr. Chavan was facing a rough time in the Election Commission’s inquiry into his poll expenses in the 2009 election campaign — especially the money he allegedly spent for ‘paid news’ in his favour in several newspapers. He has challenged the jurisdiction of the ECI on this matter in the Supreme Court. Though the Supreme Court is still seized of the matter and has made no ruling in the matter yet, the Centre’s affidavit raises troubling questions about the government’s motives. Why is it challenging the jurisdiction of the Election Commission over elections? Why is it taking such a blatantly unscrupulous stand, and to help whom? Yet, the damage this would do goes far beyond even the pernicious realm of paid news. If the government has its way, it would mean there is no institution or body that is empowered to regulate poll expenditures in the country. It would also mean the serious erosion of the powers of constitutional bodies like the ECI and the CAG that have performed their duties with diligence and integrity. Over a decade ago, a full bench of the Supreme Court held that the Election Commission had the power to disqualify a candidate whose accounts were not filed in a true and correct manner. That is the way to go. The government should withdraw its ill-advised affidavit at once and not stand in the way of the ECI doing what it is constitutionally mandated to do.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Dangerous-for-democracy/article12392439.ece
21,3,2013,Limited headroom,"Entirely in line with expectations, the Reserve Bank of India in its mid-quarter policy review announced on Tuesday reduced the policy repo rate by 0.25 percentage points to 7.5 per cent. On strict monetary grounds the case for a rate cut might not have been so obvious. However, in its first policy statement after the budget, the RBI would have found it difficult to resist pressures and not so subtle hints including from the Finance Minister himself. The budget had stressed fiscal consolidation, which the RBI has been asking for, as an essential complement to the anti-inflation stance of its monetary policy. So irrespective of whether the revised fiscal road map — which among other signposts calls for the ratio of gross fiscal deficit to GDP to decline to 4.8 per cent in 2013-14 — can in fact be reached, the RBI was forced to act. However, even without the government’s prompts, the RBI has not ignored growth concerns. Recent policy statements have, in fact, shifted the RBI’s focus away from inflation towards growth. As so often in the past, the mid-quarter review explains why monetary policy has to balance the conflicting claims of growth and inflation.
Growth has decelerated significantly. In the third quarter of the current year, GDP growth at 4.5 per cent was the weakest in 15 quarters. Particularly worrying has been the decade-low growth in the services sector. Industrial output has turned positive in January but significant weaknesses in capital goods production and mining activity remain. Initial estimates of the kharif crop indicate a lower level of foodgrains production compared to last year. If these suggest an easier monetary policy, the messages from the inflation front are not so clear-cut. While WPI inflation has edged up to 6.8 per cent in February from 6.6 in January, the other widely relied upon inflation index relating to core inflation — non-food manufactured inflation — has been coming down. Food inflation has remained worryingly high. Persistently high food prices have a negative impact on inflation expectations. They also explain the growing wedge between wholesale and retail inflation. Inflation is expected to remain at around the current levels during 2013-14. A competitive interest rate is necessary for reviving investment, but it needs to be backed by other measures such as easing supply constraints, staying the course on fiscal consolidation and emphasising quality governance. For these reasons, while the monetary policy stance underscores the need to address growth risks, the headroom for further monetary easing remains quite limited.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/limited-headroom/article4530361.ece
22,3,2013,Perfect ill-timing,"When the motives are suspect, the actions lose legitimacy. In conducting raids at the residences of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leaders M.K. Stalin and M.K. Alagiri within days of the DMK leaving the UPA government, the Central Bureau of Investigation showed what ill-timing could do to even honest investigations. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Finance Minister P. Chidambaram and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath were all quick to distance the government from the search operation, but the damage had already been done. With the heat turned on him, the Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office, V. Narayanasamy, who is in charge of the Ministry of Personnel that handles the CBI, insisted that the agency was an independent body and that politics had no role in the raids. The issue relates to evasion of customs duty on imported cars, including those being used by the sons of Mr. Stalin and Mr. Alagiri, and is a couple of years old, but it seems to have gotten a second wind in the last couple of days with the registration of a case against an official of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence. Whether or not the Congress leadership or senior ministers in the government were directly involved in the decision to search the houses of Mr. Karunanidhi’s sons, the CBI did its own investigations no favour by timing it so soon after the withdrawal of support by the DMK to the government at the Centre. If the CBI did not act thus to please its political masters, then it must have done so to embarrass them. Indeed, the most charitable explanation for this tactless operation would have to be that the agency’s top bosses were either too naïve or thoroughly inefficient. The duty evasion case will now be politically coloured, and difficult to pursue with the necessary rigour and righteousness.
For the Congress, the political damage is at various levels. The general impression that the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party were threatened with CBI cases to ensure that they extended outside support to the government will now gather strength. Worse, the SP and the BSP will now be under greater pressure to prove to the world that they do not back the UPA in their selfish interest, but as part of their larger stated strategy to keep “communal forces at bay.” Already weakened by the exit of the DMK, the UPA will now have to deal with the doubly emboldened SP and BSP. Over the long term, the Congress risks aiding the perception that it is using the CBI to further petty political ends. When it needs allies the most, when it needs to be seen by them as accommodative, the party appears to have given them enough reasons to run away. If ill-timing could be perfect, then this is it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/perfect-illtiming/article4534878.ece
22,3,2013,"Sense of ending, not closure","The Supreme Court verdict on the appeals of those convicted in the Bombay serial blasts of March 12, 1993 has set the seal on a long drawn out saga. It was only in 2006-07 that the designated Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) court sentenced nearly 100 people for their role in the horrific serial bomb blasts that killed 257 people and injured 713. While 10 death sentences have been commuted, that of Yakub Memon has been upheld. A continuing matter of shame is that the main conspirators of the blasts, Dawood Ibrahim and Tiger Memon, are still free and believed to be in Pakistan though that has been strenuously denied. While the foot soldiers face incarceration, successive governments at the Centre have displayed utter inertia in bringing to book Dawood and Tiger Memon whose house, a sneeze away from Mahim police station, was the hub of the terror plot. In an unrivalled act of brazenness, the Memon family left the country on the morning of the bomb blasts under the nose of the authorities. Victims of the blasts are struggling with life-long injuries, and a deep sense of betrayal. Despite a designated court handling the case, the final order took 13 years and the apex court order comes 20 years after the actual event.
The conscience of the nation must be haunted by the inexorable delay in trial and conviction, the fact that the main culprits are not anywhere near facing a trial and that little has been learnt from the country’s first ever serial blast case. Though the police pride themselves on their investigation, allegations of torture have been rampant by the families of the accused and others. This was never investigated properly. The survivors of the bomb blasts feel let down by the delayed justice and by the fact that the apex court has commuted most of the death sentences. But there is some consolation in the fact that punishment was meted out to a large number of those believed to be guilty in the blasts and that while the investigation and trial did meander, they were systematic in some ways. Before the blasts, the equally horrific communal carnage in Bombay after the Babri Masjid demolition was swept under the carpet by the then Congress government. The blasts had a link to the preceding riots for which there was no special court. Cases to implement the Srikrishna Commission report which indicted 31 policemen in the riots, are pending in this same Supreme Court. Justice comes in parts for survivors in Mumbai and sometimes never at all. The “arrows,” as the Supreme Court dubbed the foot soldiers of the March 12 terror plot, may have been punished but in both the riots and the blasts, the “archers” or the masterminds who hold the arrows, have got away with murder.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sense-of-ending-not-closure/article4534880.ece
23,3,2013,Italy redeems itself,"In the end, the Italian government did what was right and sensible by sending back the marines accused of killing two fishermen off the Kerala coast to face trial here in India. Not doing so would have only led to an upward spiral of political and diplomatic tensions between the two countries, with repercussions that neither side wants. Undoubtedly it was the firm stand taken by India that influenced the Italian decision. The Supreme Court restrained Ambassador Daniele Mancini from leaving the country for violating the undertaking he had given that the two marines would come back after voting in their country’s elections. New Delhi held back its newly appointed Ambassador to Italy. Most importantly, the political leadership was unequivocal in its condemnation of Italy’s conduct. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was emphatic that Rome’s refusal last week to send back the two was ‘unacceptable’. Congress leader Sonia Gandhi described it as a ‘betrayal’. National outrage, and quick, decisive diplomacy when the Italians sought some basic assurances in the eleventh hour helped Rome to make a controversial U-turn.
For Italy, the decision must have been difficult given the high national sentiment there on the issue. From the time of the incident, the Italian government had been under fire for not doing enough to get the two marines out of India. Both times when they went home with court permission, first for Christmas, and then to vote, they were received like national heroes. External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid told Parliament that Rome had sought the assurance that the marines would not be arrested on their return to India, and that they would not be given the death sentence if found guilty; India has given those assurances. Anyway, it was always highly unlikely that the court would hand out the maximum sentence for the crime with which the two marines are charged. What New Delhi has done is to help the Italian government make its latest decision more palatable to the families of the marines and to its people. The families of the dead fishermen will now expect an expeditious trial. So too the international community, for how the Indian judicial system deals with the case will have ramifications for the U.N. Convention on the Law of Seas. That is why it is puzzling — and more than a little disconcerting — that for all the sound and fury emanating from the Centre last week, it has yet to act on the Supreme Court’s January order that a special court be set up for the trial of the marines. There must be no more delay in setting up the court, and proceeding with the trial.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/italy-redeems-itself/article4538848.ece
23,3,2013,A new Canterbury tale,"The 105th Archbishop of Canterbury, >Justin Welby, commenced his public ministry in a ceremony in Canterbury Cathedral on March 21; the ceremony included African dancing and a Punjabi chant. For the first time in the Anglican Church’s history, a woman, the Venerable Sheila Watson, Archdeacon of Canterbury, enthroned the former Bishop of Durham as Bishop of Canterbury; he was then enthroned a second time, as Archbishop. The new Archbishop, a former oil executive, had held the Durham mission for under a year and a half. He has known personal tragedy and pain. He and his wife lost a baby daughter aged seven weeks in a car crash in 1983, and his father was an alcoholic. He has also been Co-Director of the Coventry Cathedral-based International Centre for Reconciliation, which is active in many conflict areas. As a member of the Privy Council, he has already made his presence felt by supporting an open letter from 43 bishops criticising the British government’s plan to limit increases in state benefits to well below the inflation rate; the clergy argue that 200,000 children could be forced into poverty thereby, and hold that a civilised society has a duty to support the vulnerable.
The Archbishop’s commitments on this kind of issue may stem in part from his experience of the contrast between a well-paid job in oil and a modest living as a newly-ordained curate, and will resonate with millions of Britons as the economic slump continues; he has said that Jesus did not live in a palace, and while on the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards he made several strong interventions. He has also written a booklet on company accountability. Various other issues, however, will be much thornier. For example, the bishops’ open letter does not make the point that good jobs paying good wages are the best way to end poverty and dependence on benefits. Secondly, His Grace is in favour of women bishops, a matter over which the Church of England is bitterly divided. Furthermore, he has strongly opposed homophobia but supports the church’s opposition to same-sex marriage, though he recognises that many same-sex relationships express lasting love and commitment. It also remains to be seen how much influence the Archbishop’s earlier involvement with an evangelical branch of the church — which has had some success in reviving flagging church attendance — will have on him. Whatever else, as spiritual leader of the United Kingdom’s established church and a worldwide communion of over 80 million, the new Archbishop will be very much in the moral and political spotlight over almost any significant public issue that arises.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-new-Canterbury-tale/article12395484.ece
25,3,2013,Crime and punishment,"The appeal from some quarters for clemency for Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt, who has been sentenced to a five-year prison term by the Supreme Court for possessing an AK-56 assault rifle two decades ago, lacks moral force. It singles out an individual for favourable treatment solely on the basis of his popularity. If accepted, the demand would entrench the belief that the country has two parallel systems of justice — one for the privileged and another for the rest. The irony is that the Court itself chose wisely to avoid any hint of softness by refusing to countenance supervised probation as an alternative to imprisonment. The appeal indicates a selective realisation that punishment involves deprivation of liberty and agonising court appearances — something that tens of thousands of suspects go through. The case did go on for 20 long years but surely this is not unique, as many cases take as long or even longer. And instances of the apex court enhancing jail terms years after the trial is over or setting aside old acquittals are legion. It is unfortunate that the appeal should have found immediate resonance in both the Union and the Maharashtra governments, which have spoken about considering it.
A question has also been raised about the proportionality of a five-year jail term for merely possessing a weapon that was not used, and was unrelated to terrorism. There is sound jurisprudential basis for treating possession of an assault weapon as an offence serious enough to warrant a minimum prison term of five years. The Kalashnikov came through underworld gangs and was linked to the consignment of explosives used to perpetrate the Mumbai serial blasts, though Dutt may not have known that. The very fact that a deadly assault weapon lies unaccounted for in private hands puts society at risk because the chances of criminal elements accessing it later are high. That is why punishing mere possession is necessary to curb the use of such weapons. The appeals being made on behalf of Dutt unmask an innate tendency among the Indian upper classes to identify a worthy cause only in the plight of the privileged. That he has already suffered imprisonment for 18 months and that he is married and has children are conditions common to a large section of Indian convicts. Invoking his respectable parentage or his screen depiction of a kitschy version of Gandhian protest as reasons for pardon is amusing. While these are circumstances that the Governor, or the President, may consider when a mercy petition comes up, it is passing strange that public figures should be quicker in pointing them out than the one convicted. As Shakespeare says in Measure for Measure, “Lawful mercy is nothing kin to foul redemption.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/crime-and-punishment/article4544584.ece
25,3,2013,Transition time in Pakistan,"Defying every prediction, the Pakistan People’s Party, which came to power in February 2008, has managed to complete a full term in office. That this is history-making says much about a country that for half its existence has been ruled by the military, which dominates national affairs even in times of civilian rule, to the point that no previous elected government survived five years. Indeed, this is now seen as the PPP government’s biggest achievement. To give it credit, the government took many steps to institutionalise democracy. Notably, it brought in amendments to cleanse military interventions in the Constitution, reducing the powers of the President, and restoring the executive supremacy of the Prime Minister; provinces got more powers. But as the country prepares for the next elections on May 11, the PPP, which spent most of its term looking over its shoulder at shadows, both real and imagined, has little else to show on governance.
President Asif Ali Zardari’s early reluctance to reinstate judges sacked by his military predecessor Pervez Musharraf ensured that when Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary was eventually restored, the government was locked in a debilitating battle with the Supreme Court, giving rise to damaging rumours that the judiciary was a proxy for the Army. The government’s attempts to reclaim foreign policy from the military sent its relations with the United States on a roller coaster ride, while ties with India plunged after the 2008 Mumbai attacks, and are still to recover fully. Pakistan’s economy is in a shambles, in large part due to faulty policies over the years, but also owing to the terrible security climate and the political uncertainty in the country. The government was unable to shake off its reputation for corruption. And it was simply beyond its capacity to rein in militant groups — born out of the military’s pact with Islamist extremists — that have ferociously turned inward on Pakistan’s own citizens. A Bonapartist looking for willing instruments could have made use of political adventurers such as Tahir ul Qadri. The Army is still to live down the U.S. killing of Osama bin Laden inside Pakistan but if there was no coup, it could well have been because the country is so messy that the military would rather let politicians take the rap for it. The PPP could blame the previous military regime for its failures. After the country’s first democratic transition — to participate in which even the disgraced Musharraf has made bold to return from self-exile — the weight of people’s expectations will fall squarely on the next government. The political party or group that comes to power has to deliver, or risk damaging Pakistan’s tiny shoots of democracy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/transition-time-in-pakistan/article4544795.ece
26,3,2013,Wake-up call for the Army,"The recommendation made by an Army court of inquiry to impose wholesale disciplinary action against 168 personnel involved in violent clashes at a training camp should serve as an eye-opener for the Indian armed forces. What happened in May 2012 was a virtual free-for-all by personnel of the Ladakh-based 226 Field Regiment. In fact, there have been at least four such alarming breaches of discipline in the Army in recent times. Such a failure of the command and control structure warrants a review of training and operational aspects. While the Army can be justifiably proud of its apolitical, secular and disciplined ethos, better rapport and cohesion among different levels seem to be a crying need. This will require a training regime that factors in changing values and rising career aspirations and expectations of the members of a modern army. Measures to inculcate a new level of sensitisation will need to go hand in hand with this to remove any trust deficit among the different “classes” in the force. There should be a premium on morale in the forces. Significantly, a study on the high suicide rate in the Army by the Defence Institute of Psychological Research held last year that “perceived humiliation and harassment” at the hands of superiors often served as the final “trigger” for jawans to take their own lives. The demands and pressures faced by the officers should also be taken into account.
In the specific context of the Ladakh incidents, the continuance of the colonial-era institution of the sahayak, or valet, has a particular resonance. It was one of these sahayaks, Sepoy Suman Ghosh, who was thrashed by some officers for complaining about the behaviour of the wife of a Major at the camp. Although the Army announced last year that it was considering doing away with the system, thousands of enlisted men continue to serve as sahayaks, ensuring that the creases on the officers’ uniforms are sharp enough and their epaulets shine through. They take children to school and help with Army wives’ domestic and shopping chores. The system was long abandoned in the British Army. Understandably, this remains a cause of unhappiness for men enlisted to serve the country. The degree of professionalism that is required of a modern army to meet heightened challenges needs to be recognised across the ranks. The officer should lead from the front, and the soldier should be able to hold his or her head high. “My priority would be to … strengthen [the] Army's work culture and core values,” Lt Gen Bikram Singh said ahead of assuming office as the Chief of the Army Staff just a few weeks after the Ladakh incidents. It seems he has his task cut out for him.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/wakeup-call-for-the-army/article4548120.ece
26,3,2013,Pains of a bailout,"The bailout package for Cyprus, concluded on Monday after hectic parleys among 17 eurozone members, may not address the underlying malaise but aims to provide a reprieve to the beleaguered country and enable its continued participation in the monetary union. The deal scraps an earlier, highly controversial proposal to tax domestic deposits indiscriminately. The Cypriot parliament had rejected that proposal, which sparked off universal outrage. However, large depositors — with accounts having balances of €100,000 or more — will be taxed, and, along with bondholders, must bear losses whose quantum is yet to be determined. Banks in Cyprus which have remained shut during the crisis will be restructured with a few reckless ones weeded out. The most significant outcome hoped for would be the restoration of the ordinary citizen’s faith in the country’s financial system. Most Cypriots have retreated into a pre-modern economy dominated by cash. Cyprus is expected to receive the first instalment of the bailout, amounting to €10 billion or $13 billion by early May. Only the finer details of the package will support or reject the official claim that it is more equitable than any previous proposal, with the heaviest losses accruing to the largest banks. Cyprus will still undergo pain, but it will be of a different magnitude from the hurt that would have been caused by an indiscriminate tax on deposits, or for that matter, the pain flowing from the forced austerity packages in Greece and Spain.
Cyprus may have a pint-sized economy but the problems afflicting its oversized financial sector are grave enough to threaten not only the eurozone but, by some measures, the global financial system as well. This is because the rapidly failing Cypriot financial sector can easily set off a wider contagion, for example by way of bank runs, even in the more prosperous parts of Europe. Globalisation has raised the level of interconnectedness among banks to such a level that it has become extremely challenging for even countries such as India to shield themselves from an infection, no matter where it originates. Cyprus is not alone in letting its financial sector grow ahead of its needs: its banking system is some five to six times larger than what its economy would require. Cyprus’s problems are more complex also because it has been a tax haven, attracting large funds from Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union. Even if Cyprus gets back on its feet, the world should learn its lesson from this globalised version of Gresham’s law: Bad money from a handful of wealthy tax scofflaws can and will drive out the good money of everyone else.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pains-of-a-bailout/article4548125.ece
27,3,2013,Chauvinism at its worst,"Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa did more than give her stamp of approval to calls for protests against the participation of Sri Lankan players in the Indian Premier League. By declaring that the State government will permit the matches to be held in Chennai only if the organisers provided an undertaking that no Sri Lankan players, umpires, officials or support staff would participate in these matches, she effectively endorsed chauvinism and discrimination in sport and politics. But the IPL governing council did more harm than Ms Jayalalithaa. Its decision to keep the Sri Lankan players out of the matches in Chennai after talking to the team owners will have larger, long-term repercussions for not only cricket, but also India’s international relations. Protesting against atrocities by the Sri Lankan military is one thing, preventing cricket matches involving Sri Lankan players is entirely another. For a person entrusted with the task of ensuring law and order, Ms Jayalalithaa, in her letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, appeared too eager to surrender her responsibilities. Far from extending assurances on the law and order front, she voiced her apprehension that the participation of Sri Lankan players “will aggravate an already surcharged atmosphere and further offend the sentiments of the people” of Tamil Nadu. To drop the Sri Lankan players on this ground is to blatantly discriminate on the basis of nationality and ethnic identity.
If the IPL is to be open to foreign players, it must be open to all foreign players. For a government to decide who should or should not be in the playing XI, and withhold permission to host the matches on this count, is plain wrong. The IPL organisers evidently took the easy way out. Taking the matches out of Chennai would have involved greater costs than keeping the Sri Lankan players out of the city. Not too long ago, when India’s relations with Pakistan were at an all-time low, the cricketing authorities worked behind the scenes and prevailed upon team owners not to bid for any Pakistani player. But now, the IPL governing council does not have even this fig-leaf. The arm-twisting is in the open. It is not just cricketing logic that is at stake here. That dropping some players and selecting some others will distort the game is the least of the problems. True, teams had bid for and taken players at huge costs, and those who put their money on Sri Lankan stars are at a huge disadvantage. But worse, sport, which brings peoples together, has now been turned into a vehicle of jingoism and ethnic affinities. The effects of such divisive politics will surely be felt beyond the realms of cricket, and for far longer than will be obvious immediately.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/chauvinism-at-its-worst/article4551656.ece
27,3,2013,Obama’s back-seat drivers,"President Barack Obama’s first official visit to Israel-Palestine, made from March 20 to 22, has only confirmed the inability of the United States government to make any significant contribution to the achievement of a fair and just peace in the region. Indeed, the very tone of Mr. Obama’s respective talks with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas shows the stark difference in Washington’s public attitude towards the two sides. Mr. Obama called Mr. Netanyahu by his nickname, “Bibi”, 10 times in half an hour, and in all his speeches to Jewish Israelis he used Hebrew phrases, but in Ramallah he used only one Arabic word, the greeting “marhaba”, and referred to his host only as “President Abbas.” He told Israelis that Jewish settler violence against Palestinians goes unpunished, but he made only mild criticisms of Israel’s illegal and expanding settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, saying the settlements are “counterproductive to the cause of peace.” Yet he told Mr. Abbas, whom he met under near-curfew conditions, that the Palestinians must drop their objection to the settlers’ encroachments; he also called the settlements a “mere irritant.” A marginally more optimistic note lies in the speech Mr. Obama made to a vetted audience of young Jewish Israelis, in which he said the only way Israel can endure is “through the realisation of an independent and viable Palestine”.
Above all, the President offered no practical detail for ways ahead, and he made yet more concessions to hardline Israelis. For example, if the Palestinians drop their demand for a freeze on settlements — even Washington accepts that the settlements are illegal — the very possibility of a two-state solution based on Israel’s1967 borders vanishes. Secondly, in addressing young people Mr. Obama may have been trying to get round the utterly intransigent Mr. Netanyahu, but he still said Israel will be “a Jewish state” with the “unshakeable support of the most powerful country in the world.” Going further, he also demanded that the Palestinian authorities, who have already recognised Israel as a state, must now also recognise it as a Jewish state, something they will not do because Israel is home to a large number of non-Jewish citizens. Mr. Obama’s problem is that he was in effect talking not to Jewish Israelis or to Palestinians, but to Republican and other pro-Zionist factions in the U.S., who have been consistently abusive towards him on almost every issue, especially Israel-Palestine. It suits Israeli hardliners perfectly that one of the most tormented regions in the world is no more than a pawn in U.S. domestic politics.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/obamas-backseat-drivers/article4551658.ece
28,3,2013,Mission accomplished,"In what counts for one more extraordinary achievement in space science, the Mars Curiosity rover launched by NASA scientists has found strong evidence of habitable conditions that once existed at the Yellowknife Bay area in Gale crater. These reconfirm that certain regions on Mars have had favourable conditions that could have supported life some three billion to four billion years ago. This is a step closer to discovering the Holy Grail — a planet capable of supporting life. A week ago, the rover’s mast camera found evidence of water-bearing minerals in veins that cut across the Knorr rock at several places. The finding comes close on the heels of the March 12 major discovery of smectite clay mineral by chemical analysis of a John Klein rock specimen drilled by the rover. The presence of smectite clay, which constitutes nearly 20 per cent of the sample analysed, is a definite indicator of the presence of liquid water on Mars long ago. The chemical analysis revealed many other details of the paleo-environment. For instance, the absence of abundant salt suggests “a fresh-water environment,” and the presence of calcium sulphate reinforces the non-acidic depositional conditions. The John Klein rock did reveal certain clues even prior to drilling. The rock was grey and the powdered sample had the same colour. Together, they indicate the absence of iron compounds, and hence the non-acidic depositional environment. The discovery of other elements — sulphur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon — through chemical analysis reinforces the possibility that the planet could have harboured life. After all, these elements are considered the “key chemical ingredients for life.” Chemical analysis of another rock sample that will be soon drilled will confirm these findings.
Mars is today a cold and dry place and has conditions that are decidedly hostile to life. Even if slim, the possibility that Mars once harboured life cannot be ruled out, particularly after the latest discoveries. Behind this achievement are a series of firsts and remarkable technological milestones. The safe landing of the rover, a self-contained science laboratory on six wheels, using an “outlandish” design was the first. But by drilling into Martian rock to collect a sample, Curiosity became the first rover ever to fructify the ideas that were once in the realm of science fiction. Together with its ability to grind and sieve the sample before chemically analysing it using a suite of advanced instruments, the discoveries it has made so far underline how far we have come in using technology for studying the wider universe of which we are but a small part.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mission-accomplished/article4555069.ece
28,3,2013,Back from the brink,"From the populist point of view, Indian cricket is either in robust good health or in its death throes. There is seldom anything in between. This is precisely why the historic sweep over Australia on familiar terrain — while being a significant achievement — is not something that should give rise to triumphalism. Stiffer challenges await Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men on foreign soil when they journey to South Africa, New Zealand, England and Australia over the next two years. But a 4-0 score-line — this is the first time India has won all four matches of a four-Test series — was crucial for a team that was gasping for breath after the 2-1 defeat at the hands of England at home earlier this season. The series also provided a lifeline to skipper Dhoni, who is now India’s most successful Test captain with 24 victories. The skipper’s destructive 224 when the first Test was in the balance at Chepauk was a huge turning point in the series; psychologically, the aggressive innings adversely impacted the Australian team. Gradually the Indian team gained in confidence and won the key moments of the duel by finding the right men for different situations. The selectors were rewarded for their boldness in dropping Gautam Gambhir ahead of the series and then axing Virender Sehwag after the first two Tests. Opener Murali Vijay was a gain with 430 runs at 61.42 including two hundreds; he displayed composure and the right technique. And the left-handed Shikhar Dhawan’s explosive 187 at Mohali — the quickest century by a debutant — saw Indian fans applauding the arrival of a new top-order batsman. The consistent Cheteshwar Pujara’s 419 runs at 83.80 were just rewards for his equanimity and solid strokes.
But then, these batsmen will face bigger tests away from the subcontinent on bouncy tracks — as, of course, will the spinners. The last few weeks, they called the shots on surfaces that assisted them. And the one in New Delhi was certainly not fit for Test cricket. However, credit must go to Ravichandran Ashwin for rightly depending on his off-spinner. His 29 wickets in four Tests at 20.10 confirmed his position as spin spearhead. Left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja’s accuracy and subtle variations in trajectory — he prised out 24 batsmen in four Tests at 17.45 — combined splendidly with Ashwin’s methods. If Jadeja can turn himself into a genuine Test class all-rounder in all conditions, it will be a big gain for Indian cricket. In the event, even as they celebrate, the Indian players would do well to remember that they will land in South Africa in November without having played any Test cricket for seven full months — hardly a tribute to the foresight of the Board of Control for Cricket in India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/back-from-the-brink/article4555066.ece
29,3,2013,Motion and emotion,"Is it right for Indian legislators to advocate a referendum for the break-up of a neighbouring country? Politicians in Tamil Nadu spearheading the campaign against Sri Lanka for human rights abuses by its military in the final stages of the war with the Tamil Tigers seem to think so. India is deeply involved in the efforts for the resettlement and rehabilitation of Sri Lankan Tamils displaced by the war. But, going by the resolution adopted by the Tamil Nadu Assembly demanding a referendum on Eelam and calling for economic sanctions against Sri Lanka, regional political parties in Tamil Nadu are keener to score points off each other than aid India’s purposive, if somewhat limited, attempts at bettering the lot of the Sri Lankan Tamils, many of whom are still without homes and means of livelihood. The legislators want India to move the U.N. Security Council seeking a referendum among Tamils living in Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora on creation of a separate nation of Tamil Eelam. Apart from the sheer bad taste and bad judgment involved — India would violate every principle it has stood for were it to approach the Security Council with such a demand — the motion can only do more harm than good to the Tamils of Sri Lanka. A partition will doubtless create more displacement and inflict more pain on a battered people already suffering from the effects of a decades-long ethnic conflict that ended only in a war that appears to have killed more civilians than armed combatants. Indeed, any position that makes the assumption of irreconcilable differences between the Sinhalese and the Tamils is doomed to failure.
The Assembly resolution further wants India to stop calling Sri Lanka a “friendly nation.” What good that would do is unclear. In effect, what Tamil Nadu’s politicians seem to want is for India to surrender its leverage, cut off economic and cultural links with Sri Lanka and leave for itself no means of influence other than that of armed might. But if its Sri Lanka policy is not to merely tail or turn away from the agenda-setters of Tamil Nadu, India must push Colombo to honour its past commitments and do more for devolution of powers, including financial and police, to the Tamil areas in the north and east on the basis of the 13th amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution. India has a responsibility to ensure that Sri Lanka delivers on this commitment quickly and sincerely. Elections to the Tamil-majority Northern Province, which are supposed to be held this September, present an opportunity for Sri Lanka to expand on the 13th amendment and end the inequalities and injustices that formed the original basis for the ethnic conflict.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/motion-and-emotion/article4558996.ece
29,3,2013,Establish the truth,"Once a terrorist, always a terrorist? Surely not because then there can be no redemption for the individual who feels remorse for embracing destruction, who realises the futility of avenging perceived injustice by injustice. That governments faced with the challenge of terrorism also have programmes for the surrender and rehabilitation of those wishing to give up the path of violence attests to the strong human impulse to reform. Yet for countless reasons, former militants rarely manage to fully shrug off their past and continue to battle questions and suspicions long after their presumed return to legitimacy. When a militant surrenders, his acknowledged association with one or another form of terrorism makes him at once an invaluable source of information for investigators and an automatic suspect in anticipated or accomplished acts of terror. In the case of Liaquat Ali Shah, a Pakistan-occupied Kashmir-based former militant who was arrested by the Special Cell of the Delhi Police, the truth has become harder to establish because there are two official versions of why and how he came to be found crossing the Nepal border into India. The Special Cell’s case is that far from reforming, Liaquat Ali continued to be active as a member of the Hizbul Mujahideen and had actually planned to stage a fidayeen attack on the Capital to avenge the execution of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru when he was arrested.
On the other hand, the Jammu and Kashmir police are emphatic that Liaquat Ali, an Indian Kashmiri who had taken up residence in PoK, was on his way back to the Indian side of the valley as part of the State government’s surrender and rehabilitation policy for former militants. The J&K Police have cited previous instances of militants crossing over from Nepal into Kashmir to avail amnesty. There is also some curiosity over why Liaquat Ali chose to travel with his family when he was clearly on a suicide mission. The two police forces have clashed before, and significantly, the disagreements have been over the deployment of former militants in terror investigations. The Delhi Police have also previously come under judicial scrutiny for acts of commission and omission relating to the prosecution of former J&K militants. While this by itself cannot become grounds for negating their claims, the National Investigation Agency will now have to get to the bottom of the story and establish the truth. The outcome is crucial not just for the life and liberty of Liaquat Ali but for hundreds of Kashmiri militants who have applied for permission to return home and surrender. Their takeaway from this unfortunate episode ought not to be that it does not pay to renounce your past.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/establish-the-truth/article4558997.ece
30,3,2013,UPA’s nine lives,"If the United Progressive Alliance has survived close to nine years in office despite multiple crises and challenges, it is no thanks to any intrinsic strength. Indeed, the Manmohan Singh government has made every conceivable mistake, faced potentially ruinous scandals and scams, alienated just about every partner in the ruling alliance, and emerged none the worse for it. So perhaps the Prime Minister was not being arrogant when he spoke of his government enduring over the next year and his own determination to push through key economic reforms regardless of whether or not there was political support for it. But as ought to be obvious to anyone watching the interplay of political interests on the national stage, the secret of the UPA’s longevity lies almost entirely in the contradictions inherent to coalitional politics. Partners have walked out and issued threats without being able to significantly alter the basic arithmetic required to keep the government in power. When Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) pulled out of the alliance citing differences over allowing Foreign Direct Investment in multi-brand retail, the government was readily propped up by the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party.
The TMC’s exit made no impact whatsoever. Far from it, the party ended up isolating itself. Mamatadi could not even muster the support of 50 MPs required to move a no-confidence motion. Today, in the aftermath of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s departure on the Sri Lankan Tamils issue, there are fresh questions around the government’s ability to ensure its safety by continuing to play one party against another. The TMC and the DMK together account for 37 seats. Their absence has reduced the government to a minority but crucially no party has made this point where it matters: on the floor of the Lok Sabha. From the Bharatiya Janata Party through the DMK, the TMC and the SP, there has been a cacophony of sounds about Team Manmohan Singh having forfeited the moral right to continue in office. But governments are not obliged to relinquish power on moral grounds. They go only when the Opposition is actually able to topple them in Parliament, something the BJP is unwilling to attempt despite the UPA’s obvious lack of numbers in the House and its apparent unpopularity outside. The government hangs by a thread, which no party seems able or willing to cut. Like a bad joke, Mulayam Singh’s warnings have begun to fray at the edges. A mere two days ago, he threatened to withdraw support in the Budget session. On Friday, he typically went back on it even as didi in Kolkata issued a fresh ultimatum. This cat and mouse game is likely to continue till the natural end of the life of the current Parliament.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/upas-nine-lives/article4562364.ece
30,3,2013,Reinventing libraries,"More than the spread of e-books, poor infrastructure and pathetic services are endangering the future of libraries in India. The role of public libraries in particular is fast shrinking and they hardly meet their community objectives. In a recent written reply in the Lok Sabha, the government tried to provide some hope by pointing to the creation of the National Mission on Libraries and the enhanced allocation of Rs 400 crore in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan to strengthen the library movement. The National Mission, which was set up a year ago, is a welcome initiative and its ambitious objectives could help rediscover the importance of libraries. But the question is how the new mission would succeed where earlier initiatives and committees failed. For the last four decades, the government had tried various projects to modernise libraries, introduce information technology to improve services and interlink libraries. It even established the Raja Rammohun Roy Library Foundation, a central autonomous institution to build a national system and provide assistance to libraries across the country. Though these initiatives ushered in some progress, there is still a lot left to be done.
The state of the National Library in Kolkata is a case in point. The Comptroller and Auditor General's report (2010) severely admonished this premier and Centrally funded institution for its lack of professionalism and poor service. Inordinate delays in the processing of procured books denied users the benefit of reading three lakh books and in 40 per cent of the cases, the library did not issue books to readers despite these being available on the shelves. In the past 10 years, the library has digitised only about 9000 books and, worse, damaged many of them in the process. Funding is not a major impediment to improving libraries as is usually made out. Most local bodies levy a library cess as part of property tax and collect large sums of money. Unfortunately, they do not transfer the amount towards library improvement. There are instances in States such as Andhra Pradesh where concerned citizens have often moved the courts to ensure local libraries get their due share. The shortcoming is in providing service and demonstrating commitment. Hence, the priority has to be on finding ways to improve our libraries rather than on creating new rules and hierarchies. Equally important is the need to reinvent libraries as public spaces that host multiple functions such as art exhibitions and small assembly areas. As a community node, they could offer free and easy access to more digital content and help bridge the knowledge divide. This would enhance their importance and social role, and keep them relevant for decades to come.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/reinventing-libraries/article4562367.ece
1,4,2013,BRIC by brick,"Long reviled as an artificial grouping of countries with little in common other than a sense of exclusion from the command structures of the international system, the BRICS forum has finally come up with a decision that has the potential to be a global game changer: the establishment of a “New Development Bank.” The absence of specific details in the eThekwini Declaration issued at the end of the fifth summit meeting of the forum in Durban has led western sceptics to conclude that the bank idea is a non-starter. They are mistaken. Even though Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa differ with one another on many aspects of the project, they do agree that a new bank is needed to take care of the special aspirations of the group and perhaps of all developing countries as well. The BRICS five account for roughly a fourth of the global GDP and 40 per cent of the world’s population. The proposed bank is optimistically projected to be an alternative to the seven-decade-old financial system dominated by the Bretton Woods twins, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. A shift away from the trans-Atlantic focus that the two global institutions are rightly criticised for ought to be welcomed. The global economy and the financial system are not exactly in the pink of health. Much of the drag on recent economic growth is due to the unsatisfactory performance of the advanced economies, which is itself a result of western financial mismanagement. And with the Doha round of trade talks still stuck, the BRICS forum’s call for the new head of the World Trade Organisation to be from the developing world, and for the revitalisation of UNCTAD, assume great significance.
Apart from doing the best on the growth rate front, China is the only BRICS country with a huge current account surplus and has accumulated a massive amount of foreign exchange reserves. In the prelude to the creation of the new bank, this divergence matters and should not be glossed over. The key determinants for success will be the design and leadership of the new bank, as well as its lending policy. In terms of sheer clout, China is likely to dominate, especially if a system of quotas reflecting the economic size and contribution of each country is adopted. These and other cautionary words should not, however, detract from the merits of the BRICS bank, especially its development orientation and stress on infrastructure financing. Channelling regional savings for infrastructure through a dedicated bank is a great idea. There is also great merit in growing step by step, as another related decision to set up a contingency reserve fund of $100 billion shows.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bric-by-brick/article4567359.ece
1,4,2013,The clock is ticking,"On March 25, the United States commander in Afghanistan handed over what had been the notorious >Bagram prison — now renamed the Afghan National Detention Facility at Parwan — to the government of President Hamid Karzai. About 4,000 prisoners there have been transferred to Afghan control since September 2012; about 1350 of those have already been released, but a further transfer of control was delayed because Washington rejected Kabul’s plans to release prisoners the U.S. considers a security threat. Although Afghans see the handover as a key reassertion of national sovereignty, the agreement is not legally binding. Besides, U.S. forces will leave behind a bitter legacy of torture; at least two prisoners died at Bagram, where the U.S. also ran a secret prison. In addition, about 50 prisoners still held will remain in U.S. hands with no prospect of trial, and American soldiers will be able to hold any others they capture for 96 hours before handing them over to the Afghan authorities.
Parwan, however, is only one issue among many which shows the complexity involved in the process of foreign troops leaving Afghanistan as planned in 2014. For example, disputes continue over immunity for U.S. personnel and over control of special operations that the Americans will continue to run. Secondly, 102,000 troops from 50 countries are still present, including 66,000 American personnel. The intended withdrawals are only partly the result of what the troop-contributing governments say is their contribution in training the Afghan military and police. Unfortunately, the U.S. and its allies have been far less generous and forthcoming on the training front, despite the fact that the Afghan National Security Forces will serve as the first and, in many ways, only line of defence against the Taliban after 2014. The insurgents, who number about 20,000, have killed over 3,000 foreign troops since 2001, and it is unclear how the 185,000-strong Afghan National Army will fare against them. Thirdly, civilian casualties have risen every year for the last five years, and civilian deaths caused by Nato raids have only intensified the anger of ordinary Afghans. Even after 12 years, however, Nato seems to have learnt little, and its troops sparked days of rioting when they burnt copies of the Koran in 2012. Even worse rancour was caused by a video apparently showing U.S. soldiers urinating on dead Taliban fighters. The number of foreign troops who will remain after 2014 is, moreover, not clear, and the obvious conclusion is that the Parwan “handover” is only a smokescreen for the continuation of a muddled strategy that combines a desire to walk away from the problem with apathy and indifference towards Afghan sovereign capabilities.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-clock-is-ticking/article4567360.ece
2,4,2013,A just order,"The Supreme Court order rejecting a plea to grant patent protection for Glivec, a cancer-fighting drug from Novartis, is a landmark. It will greatly strengthen the quest for access to affordable medicines in India. The decision affirms the idea that a patent regime loses its social relevance when a drug is priced beyond the reach of the vast majority of a country’s people. That pharmaceutical companies employ high pricing to limit the number of beneficiaries of “blockbuster” patented molecules and even older “evergreened” medicines is an irony, because making additional copies of a drug is not expensive. On the other hand, cost control and dispensing of essential medications in government-run health facilities is affected, because many States have no centralised procurement system. It is unsurprising, therefore, that less than 10 per cent of medicines sold in India are under patent, while the vast majority are branded generics. The court order should prompt producers of patented drugs to move towards liberal licensing and low cost manufacture in India, the pharmacy of the South that produces Rs.100,000 crore worth of medicines annually and sells nearly two thirds within the country. It is a matter of concern that at least a dozen pharmaceutical innovations used in the treatment of cancer, HIV/AIDS, and Hepatitis B and C are not affordable to even the upper middle classes, and impossible to access for the poor.
It would be a gross distortion to paint the Glivec order, which follows the compulsory licensing of Bayer’s drug Nexavar, as an innovation killer. There is evidence to show that major pharma companies recover more than the cost of innovation of a drug in a single year from the United States market alone. Moreover, the costing done by industry has come in for criticism from scientists and policymakers on the grounds that the bloated, irrelevant investments of recent decades are used as the baseline to make calculations. It should not, as the industry claims, cost a billion dollars (and take a dozen years) to produce a new drug; the informed estimate is a third of that figure. The contested field of drug discovery now calls for greater scrutiny of costs and therapeutic value, and control of prices through various legal avenues available under the Indian Patents Act and the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights as confirmed by the Doha Declaration. It would naturally strengthen the case for grant of patents and consensus pricing, if the industry opens its books for verification. Until the golden mean is reached, governments with vast populations that are denied access to medicines due to economic reasons can justifiably use unilateral price control mechanisms.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-just-order/article4570090.ece
2,4,2013,Mixed message,"It was an open secret that Narendra Modi would leapfrog into the big league if and when the Bharatiya Janata Party revamped its decision-making structures. In the event, it was a double whammy for the Gujarat Chief Minister who found himself admitted to two of the BJP’s apex bodies — the parliamentary board and the central election committee. Mr. Modi had as good as walked into his new role with his third straight Assembly election victory in Gujarat. But clearly what lubricated the process was the growing clamour from the rank and file. Ironically, it fell to helmsman Rajnath Singh, who had evicted Mr. Modi from the parliamentary board six years earlier, to invite him to rejoin the club. Mr. Singh had swallowed his pride and accorded Mr. Modi a hero’s welcome at the party’s recent national council meeting. So is Mr. Modi the BJP’s Prime Ministerial nominee? There is no word on this yet and for obvious reasons. To start with there is internal discomfiture over allotting this coveted position to a person who by instinct and action has proved to be authoritarian and demanding. Mr. Modi runs Gujarat as a one-man show and the fear is that he would replicate the model in Delhi.
But more critically, any formal announcement with regard to Mr. Modi would mean closing the leadership issue to the disadvantage of the prime ministerial hopefuls within the BJP and by implication within the larger National Democratic Alliance. Lal Krishna Advani, who was the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate in 2009, harbours dreams of an encore. As leaders of the two Houses of Parliament, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley have shown immense potential, not to speak of the many punishing years they have put in to reach where they have. State leaders such as Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Raman Singh are equally ambitious and each has performance to back his claim that he is second to none. With Mr. Modi in the lead, the BJP would also have to reckon with the possibility of desertions by valued NDA partners. Nitish Kumar has minced no words on the unacceptability of Mr. Modi. For the BJP the confusion evidently does not end here. If the party rejig was meant to send out the signal that the BJP is a better and cleaner alternative to the Congress, it has done the opposite. In particular, the induction of Amit Shah and Varun Gandhi as general secretaries is surprising. Mr. Shah faces charges of criminal conspiracy in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case while Mr. Gandhi, though acquitted for spewing anti-Muslim vitriol on the election trail in 2009, will find it hard to live down the rabble-rousing image he has created for himself. By promoting leaders like these, the BJP has scored a self-goal.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mixed-message/article4570577.ece
3,4,2013,Food as a right,"In its latest form, the National Food Security Bill, 2013 promises to address the extreme irony of an ambitious nation holding mountains of food in storage, while masses of its people are undernourished or even starving. The right to food is finally on the threshold of being legislated. Every step taken to widen the coverage of food security schemes is an advance. Yet, the empirical truth is that incremental measures at targeting the needy are a poor substitute for a cohesive, rights-based universal system of food entitlements. There are, no doubt, many positives to the new legislation, such as coverage of up to 75 per cent of eligible priority households in rural areas, the importance given to women as the head of the household for issue of ration cards, inclusion of pregnant and lactating women for free meals (some in government wanted to take away this entitlement from women who bear more than two children but the idea was sensibly dropped), and setting up of State Food Commissions to investigate violations of entitlements. Under the proposed law, it will be up to the States to frame criteria and choose the priority households for food entitlements, an exercise that will inevitably be accompanied by the well-documented troubles associated with targeting any welfare scheme. Exclusion of any deserving household is unfair and divisive. It poses a challenge to States that wish to provide universal access, an issue that is bound to be felt acutely in urban areas attracting tens of thousands of migrant labourers.
The Centre is unwilling to countenance a Universal Public Distribution System on the ground that too much money is involved. Even under the latest Bill, it is argued, the exchequer would have to bear a heavy expenditure of Rs.1.24 lakh crore. Yet, the government has not hesitated to build up expensive food stocks over the years, some of which is left to rot, mainly to pay the high support prices demanded by influential sections of the farm lobby. Moreover, the policy orientation is disproportionately favourable towards some sectors such as infrastructure, compared to food and health care. Evidently, the Food Bill can and should do a lot more, to become near-universal and win over sceptics such as Tamil Nadu, which has opposed it on the ground that it is inferior to the universal PDS in the State. Also noteworthy is the fact that the Chhattisgarh Food Security Act has done better than the Centre’s proposed law in some respects — by supplying subsidised pulses and covering 90 per cent of households, for example. The cause of equity would be better served if the Centre expands the ambit of its law to cover all classes of vulnerable people, including senior citizens and the disabled, for supply of essentials under the PDS. It must then embark on the road to universality in providing access to food as an entitlement.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/food-as-a-right/article4573883.ece
3,4,2013,Expatriate worries,"Saudi Arabia’s decision to enforce the provisions of its Nitaqat labour law has raised concerns not only in India, but also in the rest of the subcontinent. The law specifies that one out of 10 employees in every business establishment should be a Saudi national. The fallout in terms of displacement could affect many among an estimated three lakh low- and semi-skilled workers from India. More specifically, almost a fourth of all Keralites who work in the Gulf countries are in Saudi Arabia. The kingdom’s drive to expand job avenues for its own nationals by means of the localisation initiative — that had actually come into effect in November 2012 — is unexceptionable in itself. It is also clear that those expatriate workers who are in Saudi Arabia through legally compliant processes have nothing much to fear from the latest crackdown. The issue then boils down to the need to curb the activities of unscrupulous recruiting agents who prey on the anxieties of unskilled or semi-skilled emigrants who somehow want to get to the Gulf region in search of work. In spite of awareness drives initiated by the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs, illegal and irregular migration continues. This has to end. Kerala has now sought diplomatic intervention to obtain assurances from Saudi Arabia of a six-month amnesty for the affected expatriates. It has also requested that those who are returned are not sent through the deportation route, that would result in an entry ban being imposed on them by other Gulf countries. These appear to be reasonable suggestions. The State government claims to have extracted a promise from the Central government to bear the cost of travel of migrants returning from Saudi Arabia.
Any impression that the Saudi Arabian move is meant to target Indian workers specifically may be off the mark and unfair. Among the countries of the region, Saudi Arabia is the biggest employer of foreign workers in terms of absolute numbers. These numbers are accounted for by the big three labour exporters of South Asia: India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. For the latter two, Saudi Arabia is the biggest market. Sri Lanka is also a player. Reports that the enforcement of Nitaqat is part of a larger Saudi strategy of tightening the screws on the Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh for its secular policies are certainly far-fetched. If Saudi Arabia has set its mind to cleaning up the emigration scene and achieving a better balance in the profile of its labour force, that is not a bad thing for the expatriate labour market in the Gulf region as a whole. But Riyadh should soften the blow now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/expatriate-worries/article4573881.ece
4,4,2013,Reforms that never come,"“Animal behaviour,” was the unusual language the Supreme Court deployed recently. The context for the cryptic remarks was the gruesome lathi-charge on protesting teachers, predominantly women, engaged on contract by the Bihar government, and the attacks on a woman who sought police intervention in a case of assault. The police carry a long and ignominious record of resort to indiscriminate force to quell peaceful protesters, which peaked in the public outrage over the Delhi gang-rape and the death of a journalist in Manipur in 2012. Often, the aims of the political masters the police serve are diametrically opposed to the public interest they are duty-bound to protect in a democracy. The judges were perfectly justified in ventilating their impatience, having issued notice after notice in the past to Chief Secretaries and Directors General of Police for greater accountability. In a landmark 2006 verdict, the Supreme Court came out with its now famous seven steps to police reforms. Insulation of the force from illegitimate political interference, transparency in the appointment of the DGP, separation of the law and order and investigative functions and the establishment of a complaints authority are the more important among them. They still remain on paper. Most of these recommendations have been the sum and substance of the eight reports of the National Police Commissions constituted by successive governments over the years. They were further reiterated by two committees set up in the 1990s on police reforms and embodied in the Model Police Act proposed to replace the colonial law of 1861.
Court hearings on compliance with the seven steps were met with requests and more requests for extension of deadlines, ultimately leading to contempt proceedings against some State governments. It is noteworthy that regional parties which have been repeatedly elected to office over the past few decades have demonstrably failed to live up to their avowedly federal and democratic credentials. Since police and law and order are subjects under the Constitution’s State List, the responsibility devolves upon the States. Thus, the prospects for the enactment of a modern police law nearly seven decades after independence hang in the balance. Genuine lessons from the dark record of Emergency rule, encapsulated in the Shah Commission findings and the reports produced by the National Police Commissions of the late 1970s, have not been drawn. This is the bitter truth, one that no political party is willing to admit nearly four decades since the so-called restoration of democracy in India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/reforms-that-never-come/article4577662.ece
4,4,2013,"Houston, we have a litter problem","The change in the orientation and orbit of the 17-cm glass-sphere Russian nano-satellite BLITS that was noticed in early February was caused by a January 22 collision with a piece of China’s Feng Yun 1C weather satellite; Feng Yun 1C was intentionally blown up in the 2007 anti-satellite weapon test by China. That irresponsible act led to an overnight increase in the amount of space debris: pieces larger than one centimetre went up by 40,000, and the number of fragments larger than one millimetre by about two million. The number of trackable objects shot up by 25 per cent. Worse, the break-up happened at an altitude of about 860 km, which is heavily populated by satellites. Due to the “low density” of the atmosphere at this altitude, the junk generated will pose a threat to satellites for a long time. The 2008 American experiment when the USA-193 satellite was destroyed by a missile did not create much long-lasting debris. Due to the low altitude (250 km) of break-up, most of the fragments were subjected to air drag and eventually burnt up when they re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere. Aside from these two adventures, the majority of man-made litter larger than 10 cm is from in-orbit explosions. Objects of this size can generate catastrophic events — even a centimetre-long fragment can disable a spacecraft. There are about 600,000 objects in space larger than one centimetre and about 300 million larger than one millimetre.
Nearly 5,000 launches have taken place till date, and nearly half of the catalogued fragments in space are from man-made objects. According to the European Space Agency, doubling the number of objects in space will result in a four-fold increase in collision risk. As the number of launches keeps rising, the possibility of collisions — between two satellites, and between satellites and fragments — producing more debris is increasing. In 2009, the collision of Cosmos 2251, a defunct Russian military satellite, and the American satellite Iridium resulted in 1,700 pieces. As the Kessler syndrome postulates, crashes would first be seen between fragments and larger objects like satellites and would eventually be between two fragments. Crashes will continue till the debris becomes very small. This does not augur well for space science. Expensive manoeuvring of satellites is currently the only way to avoid crashes. But this is possible only in the case of catalogued pieces. Hence it is imperative for space-faring nations to undertake debris-mitigation measures. One of them is to reduce the orbital altitude of dying spacecraft and allow the Earth’s atmospheric drag to pull them into the atmosphere. Objects that re-enter the atmosphere break up at 84-72 km altitude and most of them get burnt up.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/houston-we-have-a-litter-problem/article4577669.ece
5,4,2013,The next contagion,"The influenza A(H7N9) virus, a novel bird flu strain that emerged in China, has infected nine people and already killed three. Unlike the H5N1 virus that is widely endemic in poultry in Asia, this strain is unique in several ways. The most important among them is that it has turned out to be lethal; the virus is capable of killing people within a very short span of time after infection. In the case of the first two victims, the time from infection to death was less than two weeks. The third person who died on March 27 lived the longest — 18 days. It also appears to have the same lethal effect on elderly and young people. While the first person to die was an 87-year-old man in Shanghai, the other two were young adults, aged 27 and 35 respectively. Human-to-human transmission has not been found so far but that’s of cold comfort: Unlike the H5N1 strain, H7N9 infection in animals will go unnoticed as the virus does not cause serious disease in birds. This is quite troubling, as researchers and health workers will be unaware of when infection sets in and silently spreads among birds. Culling poultry to halt the spread, which is one of the methods used when ‘traditional’ bird flu strikes, is therefore completely ruled out. This may have long-term implications — the birds will become viral reservoirs and there is a greater possibility of the virus getting established in birds. Genome sequencing of the virus has revealed that it is a product of reassortment — when gene swapping occurs between two or more viruses present at the same time in a host — of three avian influenza virus strains that “infect only birds.”
The sudden emergence of a deadly virus turns the spotlight on the major controversy that surrounded the laboratory research conducted by two teams to create lethal strains of H5N1. In December 2011, the American government “recommended” that Nature and Science journals publish only a redacted version of their research papers. The work dealt with adaptations to the avian flu virus to increase its transmissibility and lethality. The “recommendation” was borne out of misplaced concern that the information contained in the papers may be used by people to engage in bioterrorism. The importance of informing the public and allowing stakeholders to be prepared for such a strain was completely ignored. Scientists ended their moratorium this January on any work related to engineering virulent strains of H5N1 after the authorities were convinced that the risk exists of a transmissible strain emerging. In the end, crucial time was wasted. Much would have been learnt if such essential research was allowed to continue last year.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-next-contagion/article4581514.ece
5,4,2013,"Not this road, Burma","Myanmar’s transition from military rule to democracy was never going to be easy, and the violent events of March show why it will be more complicated than previously thought. Contrary to the notion that democracy and pluralism go together, the new Burma is becoming a hot spot of sectarian violence. For sure, the problem is not with democracy, but with the use of ethnicity and sectarianism to assert political identity. Myanmar is a patchwork of ethnic groups, aside from the majority, mainly Buddhist, Burmans. The political and economic inequalities between them grew during military rule as the generals, themselves from the majority community, fostered Burman nationalism. But they kept a lid on ethnic and sectarian differences with an iron grip. With that gone, and political and economic changes sweeping through Myanmar, some among the Burmans want to position their community as the country’s foremost group. It was this impulse which turned a simple argument into communal attacks on the minority Muslims in Meiktila and took the lives of more than 40 people. As the tensions spread, President Thein Sein imposed an Emergency in some cities. However, the confrontation was foretold when Buddhists in the Rakhine province, who are ethnically different from the Burmans, went on a rampage against the Rohingyas, a Muslim community that Myanmar refuses to accept as its citizens. The fears expressed then — that those attacks would not remain restricted to the Rohingyas, but would affect other Muslims who are full citizens of the country and are an integral part of the country’s fabric — have tragically come true.
In country after country in South and South East Asia, political and ruling elites have found it easier to mobilise supporters along ethnic and communal lines than doing the hard slog of governance. They use long-nursed grievances against smaller ‘other’ groups to hide their own shortcomings in building just societies. Myanmar was supposed to start off on a better path, because its democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi is seen as different. Parallels are often drawn between her and Nelson Mandela, the greatest contemporary symbol of political reconciliation. Disappointingly, Ms Suu Kyi, an opposition member in the Myanmar parliament, was quiet on the Rohingya issue; and she has made no significant public statement about the latest wave of rioting. The incidents have cast a pall on the political reforms under way. If her personal sacrifices for democracy are not to go in vain, Ms Suu Kyi must use the extraordinary popularity and moral authority she enjoys in her country to assert that Myanmar, with its pluralist history, is ill served by Buddhist majoritarianism.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/not-this-road-burma/article4581515.ece
11,4,2013,Descent that never ends,"Violence begets violence, and it is pointless to ask who started the descending spiral. The important thing is for activists of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Trinamool Congress, who are now engaged in attacks and counter-attacks, to immediately put an end to the senseless acts of political violence. Whatever the truth behind the death in police custody of their comrade, Sudipta Gupta, in Kolkata last week, Students Federation of India activists should have confined themselves to peaceful forms of protest. Instead, in New Delhi, SFI members went well beyond the avenues for democratic demonstration by manhandling West Bengal Finance Minister Amit Mitra, who along with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had come to the Capital to attend the annual State Plan meeting. The SFI protesters, along with other sympathisers of the CPI(M), far from highlighting police high-handedness in West Bengal, turned public attention to their own unruly ways and undemocratic means. And, in a predictable tit-for-tat, Trinamool Congress workers attacked offices of the CPI(M) in Kolkata and other parts of West Bengal, injuring several persons and damaging property. Neither party would have endeared itself to its wider support base, showing as it did scant regard for law and forms of democratic agitation.
Other than as a means of survival, and in self-defence, violence can have no moral or legal justification. Indeed, it is often the weapon of the rich and the powerful against the poor and the meek. If the police under the Mamata Banerjee government pose a threat to freedom and other democratic values, as the CPI(M) and many in West Bengal believe, the proper course would have been to mobilise public opinion against the government through all available modes. People quickly tire of the politics of provocation and violence, whether on the part of the ruling party or the opposition. The confrontation must be on policies and issues, on the streets as well as in the legislature. Demonstrations are as important as debates, but there can be no place for violence. True, the Sudipta Gupta case was only a trigger for the show of outrage against the Trinamool government in West Bengal; public resentment against what was seen as an authoritarian streak in Ms. Banerjee had been building up for some time. The question is not who started the current spell of violence, but what can be done to restore peace and sanity in West Bengal. The sooner the CPI(M) and the Trinamool lock horns over more substantive issues the better it would be for the people of West Bengal.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/descent-that-never-ends/article4603262.ece
11,4,2013,Upholding the right to life,"In northeastern India, Manipur remains the State worst affected by insurgency. The Assam Rifles, the Army and other security forces have a tough job on their hands. But admittedly, nothing can justify the scale and extent of the fallout of that fight — what the Supreme Court has described, possibly in an understatement imbued with a touch of irony, as “a pattern of carelessness.” It was referring to the findings of the Santosh Hegde Committee appointed by the court, on a public interest petition that sought to highlight mass killings in the State over the last decade. The committee found that seven killings in six instances were the consequence of fake encounters. The petitioners had claimed over 1,500 such deaths. The findings now add force to widespread complaints of human rights violations, reinforced over time by some striking incidents including the assault and killing of Manorama Devi in 2004. The Central government has told the court the Hegde report would be considered at the highest level. But given past experience, it is unlikely that the Centre would act on its own to make a meaningful difference on the ground. The court, which expressed a sense of sorrow and helplessness, must ensure the most precious of all rights — the right to life. The committee having recommended the withdrawal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act with respect to Manipur, the court may need to take a call on that contentious question as well — including, crucially, whether the Act is meant to aid civil powers or substitute for them.
The National Human Rights Commission’s plea, in response to the report, to ensure that all encounter incidents be thoroughly investigated under the terms of its guidelines, is a sensible one. That will involve reporting incidents promptly to the NHRC and holding detailed and systematic magisterial inquiries within three months. But all this will add up to nothing if the Centre is unwilling to ensure that security personnel, be they from the Army or the paramiltaries, are held to account for any illegal use of force on their part. Soon after Manorama’s killing at the hands of the Assam Rifles in 2004, the Justice Upendra Commission was set up to probe the incident. Nearly nine years later, its report has yet to see the light of day, let alone be acted upon. It is this culture of pervasive impunity that allows innocent persons to be killed in staged encounters. Coming out with a list of “dos and don’ts for the security forces,” as the government has promised it would do, will hardly suffice. A similar list ensued the last time the apex court heard a major case on the role of the armed forces in the northeast. That was in 1997. This time, it must do more.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/upholding-the-right-to-life/article4603265.ece
12,4,2013,No more clean chits,"The dark cloud of 1984 still hangs low over senior Congress leader Jagdish Tytler, but despite a judicial inquiry’s findings against him in 2005, no credible prosecution of the former minister has been launched to date for his alleged role in instigating the anti-Sikh massacres that took the lives of nearly 3,000 innocent persons in the aftermath of the assassination of Indira Gandhi. The Central Bureau of Investigation has made two attempts to give him a clean chit, but judicial persistence has kept the probe alive. The latest order, one by an additional sessions judge in Delhi, setting aside a magistrate’s acceptance of a closure report in 2010, means that the agency would have to make yet another attempt to gather evidence against Mr. Tytler by examining witnesses whose statement it had so far declined to record. The investigation process has been tortuous, and has made little progress against political leaders who had allegedly instigated, if not actively participated in, the Delhi pogrom nearly three decades ago. It was only when the Nanavati Commission said in its 2004 report that there was “credible evidence” against Mr. Tytler and he “very probably” had a hand in organising the attacks that the first effort was made to look for testimony against him. That eight long years later the case is yet to go beyond the lower judiciary, in an investigation that began 21 years late, is a shocking commentary on the CBI’s credibility.
Before one describes this order as a setback to Mr. Tytler or as a boost to the campaign to bring all those involved to book, one must take note of the disturbing fact that the investigation and prosecution are still bogged down in the lower courts, and there is not even a charge sheet. Mr. Tytler has stuck to his defence that there is no evidence that he was present on the scene when the riots took place at Pul Bangash on November 1, 1984. The CBI has accepted that he was at Teen Murti Bhavan at the relevant time. The additional sessions court now wants the agency to record the testimony of those willing to say that he was present at the riots scene. The CBI would do well at least now to file a credible charge sheet in the trial court and leave it to the judicial process to determine Mr. Tytler’s guilt or innocence by due process. To aid Mr. Tytler with more clean chits will ill-serve the agency’s image. But there is a wider issue at stake too. The failure to punish the Congress politicians and police officers who allowed the Delhi massacres to happen emboldened leaders from Meerut and Bhagalpur to Mumbai and Gujarat to use large-scale communal violence for their own ends. The technology of ‘modern’ riots started in November 1984. Only justice can help rid ourselves of that original sin.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-more-clean-chits/article4606990.ece
12,4,2013,Save that accord,"The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha’s decision to put on hold its agitation in the Darjeeling hills demanding a Gorkhaland State spells prudence. The separate shows of strength staged by the GJM and the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) this past week are proof that games of political one-upmanship are not about to wane in the region. The GNLF’s bid to get back into the arena could give room for renewed jockeying for political space by the old rivals. The Gorkhaland Territorial Administration Agreement of July 2011 was running the risk of being caught in the crossfire. While the pluck Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee showed in trying to come to grips with the problem early in her tenure was remarkable, her recent remarks terming the Gorkhaland movement ‘separatist’ have been poorly judged and have roiled public sentiment in Darjeeling. It was clear all along that she had shown haste in claiming a breakthrough on an issue that had generated tensions and sporadic violence for more than three decades. The tripartite agreement was signed without really figuring out ways to address all the substantive questions. For Mamata, it was essentially all about one-upmanship vis-à-vis the predecessor Left Front government.
In July 2012, the GJM put aside its resistance to the Shyamal Sen committee recommendation to include in the GTA’s jurisdiction only five mouzas in the Terai and the Dooars — against its demand for 396 — and decided to take part in the elections to the 45 GTA seats even before its final territorial contours were clear. The territorial issues need to be sorted out to the satisfaction of all concerned — including the people of the Terai and the Dooars in the Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling districts who have their reservations about coming under the GTA’s ambit. The demand for tribal status for Gorkhas (other than those belonging to the Scheduled Caste category), and withdrawal of cases pending against Morcha activists during the statehood agitation may be easier to address than others. The GJM, which chose to take its grievances to Delhi and brought up the question of Telangana in the context of its own demand, should show pragmatism, especially on the methods it employs to press its position. And the State government too needs to be politic in handling an issue that is so divisive. Having let the genie out by choosing to acknowledge in the tripartite deal the concept of Gorkhaland, the government now has the unenviable task of managing the contradictions that have emerged in a realistic manner. Without standing on prestige, the Chief Minister ought to call an all-party meeting and formulate a common approach to the issue.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/save-that-accord/article4606991.ece
13,4,2013,A lost opportunity,"In declining to interfere with the President’s rejection of the clemency petition of Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar, the Supreme Court has lost an opportunity to invoke the sound legal principle that prolonged delay in disposal of mercy petitions could be a key ground for commuting the death penalty. Although a 1989 Constitution Bench in the Triveniben case had leaned towards the view that there could be no hard and fast rule on what constitutes a delay so unacceptable that a death sentence should be converted to one of life, it did note that “the only delay which would be material for consideration will be the delay in disposal of the mercy petitions or delays occurring at the instance of the executive.” Since the President took over eight years to dispose of Bhullar’s mercy plea, this was surely a fit case for the Supreme Court to exercise judicial discretion in favour of commutation. Instead, the two-judge Bench chose to take the view that the rule that prolonged delay may be one of the grounds for commutation cannot be invoked in terrorism cases. The reasoning is curious since it is already settled law in India that the death penalty will apply only in the “rarest of rare” circumstances and only those cases reach the stage of clemency where the crime committed fits that description. It is surely tautological, then, to cite the enormity of the crime as the ground for denying mercy.
Though Bhullar evidently showed little mercy to the targets of his attack that left nine dead and 17 others injured in Delhi in 1993, the fact that the apex court confirmed his death sentence nine years later in a 2-1 verdict in which one judge actually voted to acquit him of the crime should make us all pause and think. In its order on Friday, the Supreme Court acknowledged “considerable delay” in disposal of Bhullar’s mercy petition, but also noted that a substantial part of the delay was due to the unending spate of petitions on Bhullar’s behalf. In the process, it has brushed aside an argument in the prisoner’s favour based on his present mental condition, saying the documents produced were not enough to conclude that his mental health has deteriorated to such an extent that the sentence could not be executed. The power of pardon resides in a higher constitutional domain in which the executive is free to come to its own conclusion based on an assessment of the totality of circumstances. If the exercise of such a higher power is marked by unexplained delay and leads to prolonged incarceration under the shadow of the noose, then that must be grounds for commutation regardless of the crime committed. The ultimate solution, of course, lies in abolishing the death penalty.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-lost-opportunity/article4611023.ece
13,4,2013,Not so free,"There are genuine concerns that the Free Trade Agreement India is finalising with the European Union can prove detrimental to health equity. Supply of low cost generic medicines to patients within the country and in less-developed nations should not in any way be threatened by a treaty that may further tighten an already rigid global regime represented by the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement (TRIPs). This singularly important issue has been engaging the public health community in India and elsewhere for a long time now and the Centre must take the country into confidence on the text of the India — EU FTA. The history of trade agreements is replete with instances of big pharmaceutical companies lobbying to shoehorn provisions into them to delay or stop the production and distribution of generic drugs. The protests being witnessed against a restrictive FTA with the EU echo the sentiments expressed by AIDS campaigners in Morocco in 2004 against drug companies pressuring U.S. negotiators working on an FTA to ensure delayed introduction of generic medicines. It is such special interests that India must prevent from asserting themselves.
The Centre should pay closer attention to the report of the Planning Commission’s High Level Expert Group on Universal Health Coverage, which calls for vigilance against FTAs containing restrictive elements. Among the key recommendations is one that says any Data Exclusivity Clause in such an agreement should be removed, as it would extend the life of patents and facilitate evergreening. Also important is the suggestion to set up a National Health Promotion and Protection Trust that should, among other things, assess the likely impact of free trade agreements on access to medicines. Viewed from a commercial perspective, any straitjacket treaty is likely to mean a setback to Indian pharmaceutical exports. It is worth pointing out here that EU ports have, in the past, seized Indian generics destined for developing countries. Accepting stricter patent norms can only intensify such actions. As Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz points out in his analyses of globalisation, TRIPs was designed to increase the price of medicines. Depressingly, in spite of the rising cost to patients and massive revenues for pharmaceutical companies, the profits have not led to remedies for diseases affecting poor countries. Considerable research funding is devoted instead to discovering drugs for lifestyle diseases. The priority for India should be to preserve the existing provisions in global agreements and domestic patent law that facilitate production of generics, stop evergreening of drugs and enable compulsory licensing.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/not-so-free/article4611212.ece
15,4,2013,Staring down the barrel,"By 68 votes to 31, the United States Senate has voted to debate proposals for regulations on gun ownership; an expected filibuster did not materialise, as 16 Republicans voted for debate. The proposals themselves are very limited, but are bitterly opposed by several high-profile Republicans and also attract opposition from swing-state Democrats, who have good reason to fear the money and influence of the National Rifle Association. That the Senate will even hold a debate may, nevertheless, be a response to rising public disquiet throughout the U.S. especially since the December 20, 2012 episode in which 20-year-old Adam Lanza murdered 20 children and six adults before killing himself in Newtown, Connecticut; he had earlier killed his mother at home. The recent Senate vote, however, is procedural, and only allows debate to start on plans like expanded background checks, such as records of any previous psychiatric treatment, on those trying to buy firearms. A reduction in the size of magazine clips will, however, meet stiff resistance, and any proposal may yet be filibustered. Even if the Senate approves some or all the present proposals, the House of Representatives may reject debate.
In the U.S., gun control is not only a matter of legislation but a difficult constitutional issue, over which several questions remain unresolved. The Second Amendment, part of the Bill of Rights that Congress ratified in 1791, says, “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” Therefore, gun control could be a State subject alone. On April 5, Connecticut passed some of the tightest controls in the country, but a Republican-held state like Arkansas now lets people carry guns into churches and colleges. Secondly, many historians argue the Second Amendment was meant to protect the body politic against takeover by a standing army, and not to give individuals an open-ended right to bear firearms. Whatever the historical context, it is absurd that U.S. lawmakers cannot reform a system that provides people such easy access to firearms. Congress is prepared to back the use of force in every continent in order to make the world safer for America but it is unwilling to take a basic step to protect American lives where they are most endangered: in the U.S. of A.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/staring-down-the-barrel/article4617463.ece
15,4,2013,Common sense on capital flows,"As India’s external balances continue to flounder, the fact that the International Monetary Fund’s thinking on cross-border capital flows has slowly come in line with emerging countries is a cause for some comfort. In December 2012, the Fund, which has been the global arbiter of external account policies for the past 70 years, endorsed a new institutional view on capital account liberalisation and management of capital flows. While earlier it dogmatically espoused capital account liberalisation as the ultimate goal for all countries, it is now much more accommodative to contrarian views: it is prepared to concede that under certain conditions it would be adequate to regulate capital flows. Though subject to caveats, the new thinking, which will condition the IMF’s surveillance and reporting efforts, explicitly recognises a few scenarios that call for intervention by individual countries to protect their interests. For emerging markets whose financial institutions and markets are still not fully developed, unbridled capital flows carry greater risks. This is a view that the Indian policy establishment has for long supported. Way back in July 2006, the Tarapore Committee on capital account convertibility prescribed macroeconomic adjustments and market development as essential prerequisites before relaxing capital controls. More recently, India, Brazil and a number of developing countries have had to reckon with the worst effects of short-term capital flows surges and sudden reversals. At the same time, advanced economies like the U.S., the European Union and Japan need to be more aware of the harmful consequences of their ultra-soft monetary policies on emerging markets.
A striking feature of the IMF’s current view on capital flows is that it differs sharply from the ground rules governing several trade and investment treaties which generally do not allow regulation of cross-border finance. The old “one size fits all” approach has been discredited and each country can set its own time table for capital account liberalisation. The fact that the IMF has not given up on its eventual goal has come in for criticism, though it is certain that it has loosened its stance after learning from several countries in Asia and Latin America. Malaysia’s successful defiance of the then prevailing orthodoxy at the time of the Asian currency crisis in the late 1990s had demonstrated the value of controls in crisis management. When capital flight threatened to weaken several Asian currencies and swell their foreign currency debts, the IMF prescribed fiscal and monetary austerity to convince investors to stay put. Malaysia came out on top after taking a diametrically opposite course, imposing heavy restrictions on foreign exchange transactions and capital flows. For India, which has won kudos for its calibrated approach to capital account liberalisation, the new orthodoxy should strengthen its intellectual and political resolve to deal with its external sector problems in a manner best suited to its national conditions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/common-sense-on-capital-flows/article4617461.ece
16,4,2013,Homeland security breached,"The Boston Marathon bombings of Monday afternoon marked the first major terror attack carried out on U.S. soil since al Qaeda struck with devastating force on September 11, 2001. With three confirmed dead, among them an eight-year-old boy waiting for his father at the finish line, and local hospitals receiving at least 176 persons, many with serious injuries and some requiring amputation, the city of Boston turned from jubilation to stunned silence. Shortly before 3 pm, a quarter of a mile or so before the finish line, two loud blasts went off within seconds of each other. Spectators and runners knocked over by the force of the blast sat amidst blood and debris on the road. Doctors treating the injured were said to be pulling ball-bearings and shrapnel out of people, suggesting a bomb designed for lethal impact. U.S. law enforcement, which did not appear to have any advance intelligence of the incident, went into fourth gear immediately. Major cities were put on high alert, and a no-fly zone and temporary airport “ground stop” were imposed in Boston. On Tuesday morning the Federal Bureau of Investigation, now in charge of the criminal investigation into the attack, raided a high-rise apartment in Boston in search of a “person of interest.”
In a statement made a few hours after the attack, President Barack Obama seemed to be conscious of the legacy of suspicion that followed 9/11, particularly the violent backlash against Muslims, Sikhs and other ethnic minorities. “We don’t yet have all the answers,” he said. “We still do not know who did this or why... People shouldn’t jump to conclusions before we have all the facts.” Yet even as he spoke there were unconfirmed reports in the media about a Saudi national said to have been questioned at a hospital. Some media outlets got ahead of themselves, speculating over whether foreign or home-grown terror groups could be involved. Yet as of Tuesday, the authorities made it clear they had no concrete leads. After nearly a decade of polarising experience with hate crimes, Islamophobia and the suspension of civil liberties under legislation such as the U.S. Patriot Act, it is only in the past few years that the U.S. has enacted stronger protections for minorities and free speech. There is a real risk that Monday’s bombing and Mr. Obama’s promise that the attackers would feel the “full weight of justice” may lead to the rollback of these hard-fought rights. If they do, it may once again draw the U.S. back into a negative spiral of injurious overreach in foreign policy and domestic policing that will damage the civilisational fabric of America without making the country any more secure.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/homeland-security-breached/article4624060.ece
16,4,2013,Not for sale,"Tamil Nadu’s deceased donor organ retrieval programme is a good example of a transparent, State-led initiative that can demonstrably curb trade in human organs. It is not by accident that the programme has achieved a donation rate for kidneys, livers, hearts and lungs that is many times higher than the national average; last year, nearly half of all donations from dead donors in India were in Tamil Nadu. A combination of socially-minded medical professionals, supportive governments and high levels of openness has encouraged several families to altruistically give away the organs of their kin who suffer brain stem death, mostly in road traffic accidents. The Tamil Nadu model, recently featured by BMJ (the British Medical Journal) as a replicable framework for other States, has many aspects that merit close attention. What stands out in its design is the requirement that all hospitals doing transplant surgeries register with a State authority, offer counselling to the kin of potential donors, submit records of transplants and declare their charges. The online publication of waiting lists, the hospitals involved and guidelines for allocation of organs has strengthened public confidence in the system. Notably, many recipients are poor.
It is no secret that the evolution of such a forward-looking measure in Tamil Nadu is the response to an unedifying past — one that made the State notorious for trade in kidneys procured by middlemen from living donors, mostly the poor. Commerce in organs continues in many other parts of the country, exploiting a provision in the Transplantation of Human Organs Act that allows living unrelated people to give, for reasons of attachment to or affection for the recipient. This must be countered forcefully by promoting the cadaver donation model. Even Tamil Nadu can do a lot more, by devoting attention to trauma units in district hospitals, where cadavers can be maintained for organ donation, and doctors trained to identify brain stem death and perform transplants. Commendably, the expertise acquired thus far by the State is being widely shared with health systems across the country, and there can be no excuse for others not to institute similar programmes. It is, of course, vital to remember that the major supply of cadaveric organs comes from the shocking number of road accidents that kill over 134,000 people a year. On the other hand, organ demand is also inexorably rising due to weak preventive measures and treatment access for diabetes and hypertension. Free public provision of dialysis, which is currently unaffordable in the private sector to most patients, can help many with end-stage kidney disease. Curbing organ commerce needs a national initiative.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/not-for-sale/article4624063.ece
16,4,2013,Continuing Chávismo,"Former Venezuelan Vice-President and interim President Nicolás Maduro, whom the late President Hugo Chávez named as his preferred successor, has won the April 14 presidential election, but has done so by far less than polls had portended he would; even a week earlier, some surveys had suggested a winning margin of 14 per cent. Mr. Maduro, a member of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, a former bus driver and trade union negotiator standing on behalf of the Great Patriotic Pole coalition, defeated his closest rival, Henrique Capriles of the Democratic Unity Roundtable, by 50.66 per cent to 49.07 per cent of the vote. The turnout, 78.7 per cent of the country’s 19 million voters, was slightly lower than it had been in the October 2012 election, which saw Mr. Chávez, who was already ailing and died of cancer on March 5, elected for a fourth successive term, by a resounding margin of 11 percentage points. Now Mr. Capriles has alleged irregularities and has refused to concede, demanding a recount instead. Before the contest, he had rejected a National Electoral Council document which would have required accepting the outcome, though he had signed a similar document before running against Mr. Chávez in October; Mr. Maduro, however, announced that he would accept the result.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/continuing-chvismo/article4620670.ece
16,4,2013,NaMo and Nitish’s dharma,"The Bharatiya Janata Party and its principal ally, the Janata Dal (United), have warred and sparred before — and almost always over Narendra Modi. With the general election looming large, it was a given that Nitish Kumar’s digs at Mr. Modi would become progressively more unsubtle. At a rally in Delhi last month, the JD(U) chief had lampooned Mr. Modi’s model of “skewed” development and showed off his own ‘inclusive” strengths vis-à-vis the Gujarat Chief Minister. Last week, a JD(U) spokesperson taunted Mr. Modi on his inability to contain the 2002 anti-Muslim violence. Mr. Kumar’s party has since passed a ‘shock and awe’ resolution asking the BJP to name a “secular” candidate to lead the National Democratic Alliance into the coming election. The BJP has retaliated by telling its partner it had no business tarnishing Mr. Modi. Admittedly, the resolution, adopted at the JD(U)’s national executive, is the strongest attack yet by the party on the Gujarat Chief Minister. However, there is a catch here. The JD(U) has set the year-end, still some eight months away, as the deadline for the BJP to meet its demand. If a week is too long in politics, eight months is long enough for the political world to turn topsy-turvy. For the moment, the BJP-JD(U) mutual name-calling must be understood for what it is : shadow-boxing between two partners each of whom has a separate electoral constituency to address.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/namo-and-nitishs-dharma/article4620668.ece
18,4,2013,"Resources below, turmoil above","Last month’s coup d’état in the Central African Republic (CAR), in which the northern-based group Séléka fought its way into the capital Bangui and overthrew President François Bozizé, is yet another destabilising development in a country which has had a troubled and violent modern history. The coup resulted from the collapse of a January 11 agreement, which was itself meant to end fighting that had broken out late in 2012 over the alleged failure of a 2007 peace deal. Mr. Bozizé, who had seized power in a coup in 2003 but won elections in 2005 and 2011, has reportedly escaped to neighbouring Congo. The five-faction Séléka, which means “alliance” in Songo, is led by Michel Djotodia, who has suspended the constitution and announced rule by decree. Though he has promised that the 2016 elections will occur as planned, he also says he will review existing deals with foreign mining firms. In response, the African Union has suspended the CAR and imposed travel restrictions on Séléka leaders. Unsurprisingly, the country faces a humanitarian crisis. Some 40,000 people have fled to Congo, Chad, and Cameroon; even a fortnight before the coup, the fighting had displaced 175,000 people internally, and violent looting continues apparently unchecked.
Things do not bode well for the country’s 4.5 million people. Though Mr. Djotodia, who heads the Union of Democratic Forces for Unity (UFDR) faction within Séléka, claims to be a secularist, some among the majority Christian population are nervous because he is a Muslim. However, his earlier record in getting himself appointed to replace a sheikh as the CAR’s consul in Nyala, capital of the Sudanese state of Darfur, suggests that he puts his own ends first. A more serious problem, however, is Séléka’s use of child soldiers. Members of a South African force which tried to defend the Bozizé government say they were sickened to find children among those they had killed; they themselves lost 13 troops in a serious foreign policy disaster for President Jacob Zuma’s ANC government. A further complication is that the CAR’s Muslim minority, which mainly lives in the northeast, considers that it has long been neglected by successive governments in Bangui. As if that were not enough, Joseph Kony, the leader of the Uganda-based Lord’s Resistance Army, who is wanted for war crimes, has disappeared, with some of his forces, somewhere in the CAR, and U.S. troops assisting the Bozizé government in searching for him have abandoned the hunt since the coup. Although rich in resources, the CAR is one of the world’s poorest countries. But it seems the AU will get little international help while it tries to create stability and legitimate authority there.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/resources-below-turmoil-above/article4627713.ece
18,4,2013,Hit by violence,"The terrorist violence that has plagued Pakistan unchecked all these years has now turned to disrupt the elections. The Tehreek-e-Taliban has made it clear that any politician from the ‘secular’ Awami National Party, Pakistan People’s Party, and Muttahida Quami Movement, is fair game. The three, which made up the last government, are also seen by the Taliban as ‘pro-West.” The TTP’s spreading reach was evident in a series of targeted killings in Karachi. Now, it has claimed responsibility for shooting an MQM candidate in Hyderabad, Sindh. In the same province, the PPP had to call off a scheduled rally on the anniversary of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s hanging in its stronghold in Larkana for security reasons. Clearly, the memory of Benazir’s assassination in the 2008 election campaign remains fresh for the PPP. It is not certain that Bilawal Zardari Bhutto, Benazir’s son and the party’s hope, will address any rallies; his father, Asif Ali Zardari, must sit out this election as the President.
But it is in the north-western Khyber Pakhtunkwa province where the TTP is carrying out its deadly threat on a daily basis: a bomb attack on an election rally one day; a car bomb explosion the next; bombing houses of candidates. Across the province, ANP politicians have come under repeated attack. Not surprisingly, the PPP has kept its head down. Only Imran Khan’s Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaf and Nawaz Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League — the Taliban views both as friendly parties — have been able to hold meetings and rallies in the province. But the PML(N) too has not escaped unscathed. In Balochistan, where Islamist militants and Baloch separatist insurgencies are both active despite the huge military presence, the provincial PML(N) leader Sanaullah Zehri was attacked. The politician escaped but not his son and two other family members. These incidents are part of the continuing war by militants of various kinds against the Pakistani state, and they must be unhesitatingly described as such. Unfortunately, years of military backing for militancy have made Pakistan’s political leaders afraid to call a spade a spade. Save the MQM, no other political party has condemned the relentless attacks on ANP. The PPP has been silent, while those not on the hitlist have been eager to use this omission to their advantage. Against this backdrop, Pakistan’s Election Commission and caretaker government face a difficult challenge in holding a free and fair election. Any thought of postponing the elections at this stage can only play into undemocratic hands. Of course, the next government faces the even harder task of deciding whether it, or the terrorists, should run the country.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/hit-by-violence/article4627714.ece
19,4,2013,On the bright side,"Street lighting is the most ignored and the least efficient of urban services. It may appear ubiquitous but, in reality, public lighting in most cities is inadequate and has led to poor road safety conditions and loss of precious energy. Concerned by the bad quality of service and impelled by Justice Verma Committee’s recommendations in the aftermath of the shameful Delhi rape to provide ‘street lighting everywhere,’ the Ministry of Urban Development recently sent an advisory to all States to strengthen public lighting in their cities. Infrastructure benchmarks recommend that local bodies should provide lights every 40 metres and the level of illumination has to be a minimum of 35 lux. Many cities may claim that they have adhered to these norms, but the truth is that a large number of street lights do not function properly. For instance, in Karnataka towns, about 30 per cent of the street lights are dysfunctional. The local bodies, which periodically survey and evaluate urban services, repeatedly and conspicuously fail to enumerate lighting facilities. But it is evident from the estimate of the high powered expert committee on urban infrastructure services that unmet demand for improved public lighting, valued at Rs.9,594 crore, persists.
Performance is another issue of concern. Street lights consume a total of 6,131 million kilowatt-hours in a year (Bureau of Energy Efficiency, 2007-08 figure) and about a quarter of this consumption could be easily reduced. Many cities continue to use Mercury and Sodium vapour lamps, which have a poor lamp life and relatively low luminous efficacy, defined as the rate of conversion of electrical power to light. On the other hand, Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamps have 50,000 hours of life and are highly efficient. For a given unit of power, LED lamps provide better light. By converting existing lights to LED lamps, cities can reduce energy use, expenditure and green house gas emissions. Choosing the right kind of lamp alone is not enough. The lighting system too needs innovation. Most local bodies use manual switching systems, which keep street lights on for a fixed time. Studies show that if such static systems are replaced by smart ones, which adjust operational time according to ambient lighting conditions, modify intensity during lean traffic and correct voltage, cities could save about 20 per cent in energy. Revamping street lighting and using LED lamps would entail higher capital cost, but the savings in terms of operational and maintenance expenditure would offset this quickly. What is more important is that efficiently lit streets would provide a safe environment and create a sustainable city.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/on-the-bright-side/article4634186.ece
19,4,2013,Export the pride,"The last lions of Asia found in Gir have been nurtured with great care by Gujarat. The protective hand of the government and people there enables an estimated 400 members of Panthera leo persica to survive today, overcoming a variety of challenges. This is an achievement that the State can be justifiably proud of. It is now time for Gujarat to build on its success and help improve the long-term survival prospects of these magnificent animals. Rather than stand on prestige, it must wholeheartedly accept the Supreme Court’s decision directing that lions be translocated to create a second population in Kuno, Madhya Pradesh. Providing new habitat for the cats is important for several reasons. There is scientific consensus, for one, that Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary and its surrounding areas cannot support many more lions. More significantly, the existing isolated population could face annihilation in the event of a disease outbreak, or a natural disaster. These key questions were considered by experts at the Wildlife Institute of India and elsewhere two decades ago, before arriving at the conclusion that Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary, among three locations, is best suited for translocation. Gujarat can easily identify a pride of five to eight lions to be moved, since they are now found even outside the protected area of Gir.
The fundamental test that the plan must satisfy is scientific. Happily, conservation science has matured considerably since a failed attempt was made over five decades ago to create a second home for lions in Chandraprabha Wildlife Sanctuary, Uttar Pradesh. The one significant issue to be addressed in Kuno is that of poaching. A reduction in the major prey base including large animals such as nilgai and spotted deer due to hunting automatically depresses big cat populations. The Madhya Pradesh government, which has spent large sums to relocate villagers and prepare the sanctuary for lions, should curb poaching effectively. Together with the Ministry of Environment and Forests, it must also double the protected area to 700 sq km and upgrade it to National Park status for viability. For Gujarat, there is much to gain from the rise of a second population. After all, the species is now emblematic of its home and commonly referred to as the ‘Gir lion,’ even if it comes to exist at a new location. Historically, Asiatic lions were free-ranging over a large area that included parts of central India and much of the northwest, and thrived in climates as varied as hot desert in Palestine and cold forests in Iran. As an experiment in species survival, the Kuno project must be actively pursued by Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and the Centre.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Export-the-pride/article12204283.ece
19,4,2013,Time to close ranks,"India’s politicians seem unable to resist the temptation to politicise terror acts. Soon after Wednesday’s bomb blast near the office of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Bangalore, Congress spokesperson Shakeel Ahmad tweeted his concern that the terror attack would benefit the BJP in the upcoming Karnataka Assembly election. For a senior politician to think of the possible political benefit or cost of a bomb blast, and not of the innocent victims, is shocking in itself. Worse, he showed no sense of remorse for his insensitivity and lack of political judgment even after his party disowned the remark. Congress spokesperson Janardhan Dwivedi sought to limit the damage by cautioning against framing terror issues in terms of profit and loss, and on behalf of the government, Union Minister of State for Home R.P.N. Singh warned against extracting political capital out of the blast, but Mr. Ahmad was adamant. By way of explaining his line of thinking, the Congress leader referred to a statement by the Karnataka Home Minister R. Ashok that the attack was a terrorist activity targeted at BJP workers. Evidently, calculations of political gain and loss had so blinded Mr. Ahmad that he was unable to see the thoughtless and tactless nature of his own remarks.
With spokespersons like these in the Congress, the BJP needs to say or do precious little in the run-up to the Assembly election. At a time when the BJP was entirely on the defensive after five years of non-performance in Karnataka, this self goal from the Congress must have given it a measure of relief. On their part, the BJP and other opposition parties have also tended to use terrorist incidents as an excuse to pillory the government, citing them as evidence of the Congress’s mismanagement of national affairs. On the whole, the tendency of Indian politicians to try and score political points in such situations stands in stark contrast to the attitude of the political class in the United States. There, in the aftermath of the recent Boston bombing or the earlier terror strikes of 9/11, one has seen none of the tiresome grandstanding that accompanies a terrorist incident. Despite the sharp political divisions which exist on most issues in the U.S. — or indeed in the United Kingdom, which has also experienced terrible attacks — terror is seen as a common threat, a national challenge that requires and demands a unified response. Political parties close ranks during terror attacks and refrain from making divisive and sectarian remarks. Our politicians must learn to wield power and responsibility well, and to be a calming influence at a time when people are feeling vulnerable.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/time-to-close-ranks/article4630864.ece
19,4,2013,Coding error,"It never is wise to try and discern a trend from a single example. Ask stock market investors who sold off shares of information technology companies last week when industry bellwether Infosys turned in a tepid financial performance, taking it as the harbinger of an adverse trend. As it happened, Tata Consultancy Services, the software industry’s numero uno, and fourth-placed HCL Technologies, turned in stellar performances on Wednesday proving that it is indeed possible to perform well even in these difficult times. Importantly, they also showed up Infosys’s unattractive report card for what it is: a reflection of troubles within, compounded by headwinds in the market. The contrast couldn’t have been greater. While Infosys Managing Director and CEO S.D. Shibulal said its downbeat outlook and performance were a “reflection of the extreme volatility in the market,” his counterpart at TCS, N. Chandrasekaran, was characteristically upbeat: “…the environment presents a lot of opportunities for us … we have a strong deal pipeline, deal closures are happening and there is traction in discretionary spends.” Now, how does one explain contrasting assessments of the same market by two of the top three players?
Infosys has always laid store by what it calls “qualitative growth,” which is all about emphasising margins rather than pursuing volumes at any cost; it appears to be moving away from that now though. TCS is relatively more flexible on that especially when going after large deals. While the Infosys approach can work wonders in a strong market where clients do not mind spending the extra dollar, in a difficult market such as what prevails now, it is TCS’s strategy that will work. Clients are seeking to pare costs, which means that contracts are won by those who can bid aggressively. Infosys also depends much more than competitors on discretionary spending by clients, which is the first casualty in an adverse environment. That the company is in the midst of rolling out an all new business strategy now only compounds its problems. Infosys’s inherent strengths and its tremendous management bandwidth lend confidence that it will fly through this momentary turbulence without much damage. Indeed, it is important for the country’s outsourcing industry that it gets back to its winning ways soon; not merely because it employs over 1,13,000 people but also because it is one of India’s major success stories. The industry also needs Infosys to be firing on all cylinders at a time when newer hurdles are being put in its path in the U.S. — its biggest market — through immigration law changes that will make it expensive and difficult for Indian outsourcing companies to do business there.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Coding-error/article12202616.ece
22,4,2013,End this callousness,"It’s been four months since agitated citizens exploded in anger against sexual violence directed at women, since the Prime Minister said the Delhi gang rape victim’s death last December would not be in vain and the nation took a collective vow to repudiate the medieval social attitudes and patriarchal prejudices that give rise to and sanction violence against women. More than two months have gone by since the law relating to sexual violence was bolstered by a series of penal measures. Yet, India continues to be a country highly unsafe for women and girls. The latest incident in which a five-year-old was left fighting for survival after being raped and brutalised is yet another reminder that penal processes, greater security and harsher laws are not enough to protect the innocent. It may be possible to police late night bus or train services, and even our ill-lit streets, but what does one do about the predator lurking in the garb of a close relative or neighbour? Crime statistics say most rapists are known to their victims, and perhaps no defence is available against them except for families and communities to stop tolerating and making excuses for crimes committed by “their own.”
In the midst of indignant protests over the Delhi incident last December, there was talk of channelling the emotion and energy into a constructive course of action. There were calls for rational debate and a positive change in the attitude of society, of men, and, in particular, of the law enforcement machinery. However, what seems to remain unchanged is the callousness of sections of officialdom. The police station to which the parents of the five-year-old girl went to complain that she was missing made them wait for hours to register the complaint. And there was an unacceptable delay in acting on it. The police did not even search the building in which the family lived, and ultimately it was the girl’s cries in a ground floor room that attracted a neighbour’s attention. A policeman has been accused of offering Rs. 2,000 as hush money to the family so that they did not go to higher authorities or the media. Similarly, the police in Tenali in Andhra Pradesh was accused of doing nothing when a woman was pushed under the wheels of a truck after she took on a group of men harassing her daughter. In Kancheepuram recently, a police officer said that a woman, who had confronted some men teasing a child, “should have ignored them and walked past quietly.” He would have us believe that she was responsible for the eventual killing of her father by those men. No law will achieve its purpose unless its enforcers shed their insensitivity and callousness towards the victims of sexual crime.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/end-this-callousness/article4640450.ece
22,4,2013,The road from Boston,"Less than a week is what it took U.S. law enforcers to track down the suspects of the bomb attacks on the Boston Marathon. For sure, not all questions have still been answered. For instance, if as the FBI has said, there was a request back in 2011 from Russian authorities for information about Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his suspected radical links, and the FBI did carry out some checks on him, including face-to-face interviews, how did it drop the ball on him? More worryingly, did it not fail to read the warning signs? Were Tamerlan, who was killed in last week’s manhunt, and his brother Dzhokhar acting on their own or as part of a group? Did the two men, ethnic Chechens who moved to the U.S. as children, commit this hideous crime for political or ideological reasons? Or are they the product of the same pathological anomie that has driven other shooters and killers in America to perform nihilisitic acts of violence in schools and places of worship from Newtown to Milwaukee? Dzhokhar will no doubt have some of the answers when he recovers enough for officials to speak to him.
The U.S. can take quiet pride in a first class investigation that used the right mix of old fashioned detective work, citizen participation, social media and technology to narrow down a vast and shambolic body of evidence from the scene of the bombing to just the two right suspects. The enormous quantity of blood-stained clothing and other personal effects, and the thousands of video and still images captured by bystanders at the marathon, must have been overwhelming. Yet, a serious, painstaking and methodical sifting, particularly of the images, led investigators to one suspect; the lead for the other came from a man whose legs were blown away in the explosion, but who managed to provide an accurate description of the person who had put a bag with the bomb near his feet. Resisting the pressure there must have been on them to show results, including from a competitive social media doing its own parallel investigations, officials took their time to establish a chronology for the two suspects before going public with their images. The strategically timed release smoked out the two men leading to the manhunt that saw Boston paralysed for a full day last week. The next stage of investigation must now draw in Russia. Putting aside the chill in ties, the presidents of the two countries have already spoken to each other. Among the many lessons from Boston is that international co-operation on fighting terror needs to be taken more seriously, and has to go on, irrespective of the nature of relations between two countries.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-road-from-boston/article4640449.ece
23,4,2013,A question of proportion,"If a citizen applies to the government for security cover, is the latter bound to oblige him even if he is the country’s most wealthy individual? The short answer is yes, provided the government finds the threat credible. Why then has the decision to accord >Mukesh Ambani ‘Z’ category security — which is second only to the ‘Z-plus’ protection accorded to such VVIPs as the Prime Minister, the President, the Congress chief and her children and a few hand-picked Chief Ministers — generated such a controversy? The reason is the lack of proportionality in the official response to the written threat Mr. Ambani received in February, purportedly from the Indian Mujahideen (IM). The writer Salman Rushdie was provided round-the-clock police protection for years following the price that was put on his head by Iranian clerics upset at his authorship of The Satanic Verses. But that security detail, which the British government was obliged to provide him, was a far cry from the over-the-top and ostentatious security blanket that Mr. Ambani will now be cocooned in wherever he travels. The issue is not the financial cost involved, as some have argued, but the opportunity cost. The redeployment of manpower on the scale demanded by Z-category protection — the Reliance boss will henceforth be guarded by 22 armed commandos drawn from the Central Reserve Police Force — means less security for others elsewhere.
Earlier this month, the Mumbai police acknowledged receiving a request for the setting up of a police chowki at Mr. Ambani’s multi-storied residence in Mumbai. Within the space of a fortnight, the government has gone from dragging its feet on his demand for a mere police post to sanctioning the full bandobast that comes with ‘Z category.’ One can only assume — or hope — that this decision is the result of a careful threat assessment done by intelligence professionals. The CRPF is stretched enough without having to extend its jurisdiction to men of immense wherewithal who are usually quite happy to invest in private security. With VIP security seen by many protectees as a status symbol, the government’s decision was always going to be controversial. The fact that it coincides with the climate of lawlessness prevailing in large parts of the country has made matters worse. In February this year, an angry Supreme Court, speaking in the context of the infamous Delhi gang-rape, ordered State governments to furnish details of police personnel seconded for VIP security. The numbers are huge. In a country where there are just 131 policemen and policewomen for every 100,000 residents, there has to be a better way of protecting our “national assets” than this.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-question-of-proportion/article4644428.ece
23,4,2013,Crowdsourcing science,"A group of Russian space enthusiasts has shown the world how citizen science can contribute to scientific advancement. They have spotted in an image four objects that supposedly belong to the defunct Russian Mars 3 spacecraft that landed on the Red Planet on December 2, 1971. The four objects — parachute, heat shield, terminal retrorocket and lander — that resemble the Mars 3 mission were identified in an image taken by the HiRISE camera on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. They are seen in a follow-up image as well. Thanks to the amateurs, the Mars 3 lander, which transmitted signals for 14.5 seconds before falling silent, has come alive in a different way. Since nearly 2,500 computers were required for viewing the high resolution image, crowdsourcing was resorted to. This is not the first time that crowdsourcing has been used for solving complex scientific problems. The concept was popularised way back in 1999 by the SETI@home project at the University of California, Berkeley; the project was to search for alien signals from radio telescope data. The August 2010 discovery of a rare pulsar (PSR J2007+2722), the first astronomical object to be found through volunteer computing, attracted worldwide attention. Today, hundreds of citizen science projects have been completed and many more are in different stages of completion. In the past few years, citizen science has evolved tremendously; current projects require active participation in the form of collecting data from the field, in much the same way scientists do. The concept has become acceptable and popular among scientists of late. In fact, researchers are using citizen science to justify and improve the possibility of getting funding. That hundreds of papers based on citizen science data have been published in reputed journals, including Science, is proof of how traditional science has come to accept the model.
It is difficult to say who stands to gain the most by involving non-scientists in scientific endeavours. While the benefits reaped by researchers and science are immediately visible, the wider gain will become tangible only in the long run. The most important immediate impact of well-planned projects is inculcating and building the spirit of inquiry and rigour. Except for a few projects, it is a pity that scientists in India have yet to tap the latent talent. When designed and executed properly, citizen science projects can turn out to be an excellent way of getting students to do real science and learn the basics of how research is carried out. This will surely turn out to be a good way of attracting students to science. What is India waiting for?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/crowdsourcing-science/article4644429.ece
24,4,2013,More of the same,"Commerce Minister Anand Sharma is obviously aware of India’s serious external payments situation, centred on the persistently high merchandise trade deficit. Last year, exports contracted marginally to just over $300 billion compared to the previous year’s $306 billion. With imports growing to $491.48 billion, the trade deficit at nearly $192 billion is almost two-thirds of export receipts. Far from being a temporary aberration, which will be substantially corrected by a continuing fall in gold and oil prices or by the slightly improving trend seen in exports over the past three months, the trade deficit ought to be seen as a major macroeconomic shortcoming, requiring all round policy intervention. From that standpoint, the Annual Supplement to the Foreign Trade Policy, released last week, is a disappointment, featuring more of the same incremental, largely procedural measures as in previous years. The zero-duty Export Promotion Capital Goods scheme, which allows for duty-free imports of capital goods subject to fulfilment of export obligations, has not only been extended beyond March 31, 2013, but its benefits can now be availed across all sectors. A positive feature has been the attempt to make most concessions universally applicable. Exporters would be entitled to additional 2 per cent tradable duty free scrip that can be used against payment of customs and excise duties on whatever incremental shipments they make over last year. These and other measures are not unwelcome. Specific sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery stand to benefit. But this is not enough.
By all accounts the external situation is expected to remain grim in the coming months. The World Trade Organisation says that global trade will remain sluggish with the eurozone countries struggling to recover. Even the incipient recovery in the U.S. might still flounder over issues of fiscal consolidation. All this is not good news for India, which despite a conscious policy of diversifying its export markets, is still largely dependent on western markets. It is possible that the FTP, both in its design and substance, is not the best way to deal with the external situation. The Commerce Ministry for all its intentions can at best be a facilitator of policy measures decided by other, more powerful ministries, notably the Finance Ministry. The two pressing hurdles to a superior export performance — high transaction costs and the shortage of physical infrastructure — need to be tackled by the government as a whole. Finally, there ought to be a recognition that some of India’s competitive strengths, such as in telecom, and internet based export-import procedures, are losing their edge and require new innovative approaches.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/more-of-the-same/article4647772.ece
24,4,2013,Protecting India’s migrants,"Human trafficking for labour exploitation is a global concern. In West Asia and the Gulf Cooperation Council region, it is a particular worry given the scale of labour migration and the prevalence of opaque and exploitative regulatory systems. A new report on forced labour and human trafficking in the Middle East, based on research sponsored by the International Labour Organisation, attempts to quantify the scale of the problem. Not surprisingly, it makes for some disturbing reading. The report puts the estimated number of victims of forced labour in the region at 6,00,000. These numbers have a huge resonance for India, which accounts for a significant chunk of the labour force there. What emerges is the close relationship between human trafficking and labour migration, and how failures in labour migration governance systems are allowing trafficking to persist. In the region’s capital-rich economies, the rapid development of infrastructure has relied on the use of short-term labour immigration. An estimated 14 million migrant workers, originating mostly in Asia and Africa, were in the GCC states between 1975 and 2010.
In order to manage the influx, many countries in the region rely on kafala, or the sponsorship system, that creates an unequal power dynamic between employer and worker as it determines the latter’s terms of residence and employment. Today, this system governs the lives of most of the migrant workers, who cannot leave their employers. Thus, loopholes and deficits in labour law coverage reinforce underlying vulnerabilities. Even where legal redress is provided for under national law, and human trafficking is criminalised and punishable, there have been few prosecutions. In such a context, there is first of all a clear case to regulate and control the role of recruiting agencies that very often overlook the interests of migrants while pursuing their own agendas. The Gulf states need to get more serious about implementing labour protection measures, and giving all expatriate workers a better deal in wages, housing, and health. The 2008 Abu Dhabi Declaration was an acknowledgment of the issues that had piled up. It outlined a collaborative action plan to give a fair deal to workers. However, the recommendations that emerged, including that effective actions be initiated to root out illegal recruitment, and that more transparent policies and practices of recruitment and employment be promoted, remain largely a mirage. India should weave in these concerns while firming up the provisions of its new emigration bill and signing any new bilateral agreements with countries of the region.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/protecting-indias-migrants/article4647773.ece
25,4,2013,Restraint is the key,"The Line of Actual Control is crossed many times each year as if to underline the fact that India and China do not agree fully on its contours, but the latest incursion by Chinese troops in Ladakh has cast a shadow on the new warmth in ties between New Delhi and the new leadership in Beijing because the troops have stayed put and not returned. Just a month ago, at their meeting on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Durban, Chinese President Xi Jinping told Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that the two countries must “broaden exchanges and cooperation between their armed forces and deepen mutual military and security trust.” President Xi also talked about both sides striving towards “a fair, rational solution” on the border issue “as soon as possible.” Further, he said both countries should “continue to safeguard peace in their border areas and prevent the issue from affecting bilateral relations.” The developments in Daulat Beg Oldie, 10 km inside Indian territory, near Burthe in eastern Ladakh, are contradictory to the spirit of the sentiments expressed by the Chinese President. A flag meeting between the two sides on Tuesday, the second in a week, failed to resolve the issue, and the PLA soldiers continue to camp on the Indian side. To their credit, both governments have seen the wisdom of not allowing the matter to escalate, and have been restrained in their statements.
In the last decade or so, both sides have tried to quarantine the border issue from the rest of the bilateral relationship, succeeding in large measure. India and China have held 15 rounds of talks on their border dispute since 2005; additionally, in 2012, a border management mechanism was set up to sort out potential threats to ‘peace and tranquillity’. Meanwhile, trade relations have grown to a point where they are routinely cited as a model in how nations with a border dispute can still have civil ties. Despite many other irritants, there have been high-level contacts to widen engagement to strategic and security related issues, including a bilateral dialogue on Afghanistan, and an agreement on maritime co-operation. On the military front too, there has been interaction. Army exercises are planned and there is greater coordination on anti-piracy measures. Unfortunately, incidents such as the one in Ladakh take away from these successes, feeding into unhelpful popular perceptions about India-China relations. The scheduled visit by Premier Li Keqiang next month, in itself significant as it is likely to be his first tour abroad after assuming office, is now likely to be dominated by the border issue. It is essential that both sides work swiftly to clear the air.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/restraint-is-the-key/article4651216.ece
25,4,2013,Last domino in the Balkans,"The April 19 agreement between Serbia and Kosovo, reached under the auspices of the European Union, could be a historic political development for both the Balkans and the EU. Baroness Catherine Ashton, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, brokered the talks through 10 rounds starting in March 2011, and saw the deal through to its signing by Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Daèiæ and Hashim Thaçi, the Kosovan Prime Minister. The process was fraught, and as recently as April 8 Serbia rejected the draft, saying it did not give ethnic Serbs in Kosovo enough autonomy. The signed deal means Belgrade cedes legal authority over Kosovo, but it still does not recognise Kosovan independence. Pristina’s side of the agreement involves giving the 50,000 or so ethnic Serbs who live in northern Kosovo their own police and justice representatives within the Kosovan system; about another 90,000 Serbs live elsewhere among Kosovo’s 1.8 million people. There is no doubt that the agreement opens the way for Serbia to start talks on EU membership. Belgrade has already met several conditions for accession, such as arresting and handing over the former general Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic, both of whom are now being held by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
The deal will stand or fall on whether or not Kosovo upholds the Kosovan Serbs’ new rights. The genocidal wars of the 1990s have left terrible wounds among all the region’s peoples, and few of the governments and movements involved — including the erstwhile Kosovo Liberation Army — have clean hands. Secondly, both Serbia and Kosovo will find EU requirements for probity in public institutions difficult to achieve. Though the aim of some European powers is clear, the agreement does not address Kosovan sovereignty. Five EU countries are among dozens, including India, which have not recognised Kosovo, for a range of valid reasons; 99 countries, however, have recognised the autonomous region, which unilaterally declared its independence on February 17, 2008, to the fury of the then Serbian government. The underlying and too often unstated problem is that the carrot of EU membership may itself be part of a wider western strategy to force the eventual de jure secession of Kosovo. The dismemberment of the former Yugoslavia — once one of the world’s most vibrant multi-ethnic states — is proof that the pursuit of ethnic chauvinism invariably rebounds on the chauvinists.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/last-domino-in-the-balkans/article4651219.ece
26,4,2013,"Cheat funds, again","The spectacular failure of the Saradha Group domiciled in West Bengal but also operating in a few adjoining States reinforces certain important messages from past scams. The first lesson to investors and regulators alike is that it is still possible for unscrupulous promoters to design and operate Ponzi schemes built around promises of extraordinary returns that are clearly unsustainable. Such schemes depend upon a steady stream of fresh deposits — at least — replacing the maturing ones, and when the chain snaps lots of people besides the investors stand to lose. The second message is that the State governments concerned cannot escape responsibility. In this case, the West Bengal government is clearly at fault for failing to take timely action against the high profile, illegal fund collection. The Saradha Group’s promoter has now accused a few ruling party politicians of complicity. Though the persons he named have protested their innocence, these allegations need to be carefully probed. However, past experience with other financial frauds suggests that politicians and other influential individuals always manage to keep themselves one step ahead of the investigating agencies.
Unfortunately, therefore, it is ordinary investors who will bear the brunt of the Saradha Group’s losses, which are estimated to be above Rs. 30,000 crore. The West Bengal Chief Minister’s proposal to set aside Rs. 500 crore to partly compensate investors is not workable as it assumes a fair method for distributing the money to several competing claimants can be worked out. It also runs the risk of moral hazard, of taxpayers’ money being used to underwrite scam losses. Regulators like the Reserve Bank of India and the Securities Exchange Board of India have much to answer for. Despite impressive strides in extending regulation to wide swathes of the financial sector, the system has not managed to check the dubious activities of the Saradha Group or for that matter those who have attracted deposits for raising emu birds in Tamil Nadu. Most of these ‘collective investment schemes’ operate in a grey zone where the role of specific financial regulators has not been clearly spelt out. It is only recently that SEBI has promised strong action against fraudulent operators. For Saradha’s investors, that will be cold comfort really. While greed and gullibility might have induced them to part with their savings, it is also possible that many of them chose risky avenues simply because it is more convenient to invest in them than with say, banks. The mainline financial system too has much to ponder over. When policymakers say they are committed to financial inclusion and financial literacy, scams like these should not happen.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/cheat-funds-again/article4654467.ece
26,4,2013,"Debate, not disrupt","Parliament has long since ceased to need an excuse not to function. The reconvened Budget session has augured particularly well for bedlam and disruption with 2G, Coalgate and other scams converging into a fresh nightmare for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the government. The baffling thing in all this is that the government and the Opposition have been over this track many times before. The 2012 monsoon session was washed out over allegations of corruption by the UPA regime in the allocation of the nation’s coal deposits. Instead of seizing the opportunity it had to skewer the government on the floor of the House, the Bharatiya Janata Party boycotted business insisting that Prime Minister Singh resign accepting moral responsibility for the scam. The drama looks set to be re-enacted in the current session with the government thick-skinned as always, and the BJP reverting to the beaten path of holding up business and asking for the Prime Minister’s resignation.
The material the BJP has is explosive enough: New revelations suggest interference by the Union law minister and the Prime Minister’s Office in the Central Bureau of Investigation’s status draft on the coal block allotments. In another bombshell, A. Raja, former Telecom Minister and main accused in the spectrum scam, has linked Dr. Singh to all key decisions made with regard to the 2G allocation. Yet neither the government nor the BJP has acted responsibly in the face of the serious charges. Sonia Gandhi’s response to the rising chorus for the Prime Minister’s resignation was “let them ask.” Presumably this insouciance stems from the assumption that the government will not be challenged where it counts: in the Lok Sabha where the numbers will be tested during the passage of the Finance Bill. Ms Gandhi should know that post the exit of the Trinamool Congress and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the UPA government literally hangs by a thread. The BJP’s ultimatum to the Prime Minister makes no sense given its own unwillingness to rock the UPA’s boat. No chief executive will step down because the Opposition deems it a moral obligation. The plain truth is that the BJP has too many issues to thrash out, including its problems with allies over Narendra Modi, before it becomes battle-ready. At the start of the 15th Lok Sabha, Speaker Meira Kumar resolved to sit longer hours to conduct more business. The 2009 Budget session did accomplish that by putting in a record 104 per cent of working hours. The current Budget session has clocked only 63 per cent by comparison with a none-too-good prognosis for the month that remains before Parliament ends.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/debate-not-disrupt/article4654468.ece
3,5,2013,Silent spread,"With the continued spread of influenza A(H7N9) virus to 127 people in China and a concomitant increase in the number of deaths (26), the outbreak has confirmed what the World Health Organisation had earlier noted — H7N9 is “definitely one of the most lethal influenza viruses we have seen so far.” Nineteen people infected with the virus in a short span of a week is proof that the virus is gaining momentum in jumping from its animal host to humans. Surprisingly, the virus does not exhibit the same virulence in those infected. Twenty-six people have recovered and a few asymptomatic cases have also been found. Though recovery from infection is good news, the presence of asymptomatic cases does not augur well. Scientists are yet to confirm with certainty the host that harbours the virus, and the infected birds show no visible signs of illness. Though the virus has been detected in a small number of poultry and a link found between poultry and four patients who had occupational exposure to poultry, over 20 per cent of those infected have had no contact with poultry. While sustained human-to-human transmission has not been seen, there have been proven clusters of such a spread. A May 1 paper in The Lancet clearly brings out the complexity of H7N9’s origin. According to the study, the virus has originated from “multiple reassortment events” and might have evolved from “at least four origins” involving migratory birds and poultry, and has evolved to at least “two different lineages.”
The only silver lining in the latest episode is the willingness of China to readily share live virus samples with WHO and other laboratories and upload the genetic sequence of the virus to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database the very same day the first human case of infection was reported. This is a huge leap forward compared with its near secrecy during the 2002 SARS outbreak. But the darker side of data sharing has already reared its ugly head. According to Nature, Novartis in Basel and the J. Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland planned to use the data to make H7N9 vaccines but without informing or involving the Chinese team. Though the issue seems to have been ironed out, the episode brings back memories of what Indonesia faced following the H5N1 outbreak. In 2007, the country refused to share samples after an Australian drug company developed a vaccine using the Indonesian strain but without their knowledge or consent. This episode confirms that GISAID, launched in 2008 to bring in more transparency and engagement, is struggling to fully deliver on its promise.

3,5,2013,The significance of Niyamgiri,"The Supreme Court has strongly endorsed the role of the gram sabhas as democratic decision-making fora on issues of individual, community and cultural rights of tribals and traditional forest dwellers. Its recent ruling in the Niyamgiri bauxite mining case has far-reaching impact because environmental laws such as the Forest (Conservation) Act, the Forest Rights Act and the Environment (Protection) Act are given scant respect by industrial project proponents looking for natural resources. This trend has accelerated in recent years, with national development being measured by a single number, the Gross Domestic Product. Under pressure, the Ministry of Environment and Forests has generally adopted a benign approach to enforcement. In the bauxite mining project promoted by the Vedanta group in Odisha, the Ministry made a welcome exception and recorded “violations too egregious to be glossed over.” The Supreme Court order in the case, endorsing the rights of tribals under the Forest Rights Act and the Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act to make fresh claims and designating the gram sabhas as the competent fora to decide them, should end strong arm measures against defenceless communities. It is beyond doubt that there is an organic connection between tribals and the land, and this has been accepted by the Supreme Court in another case in 1997. That bond must be respected.
Besides this fundamental issue, several key questions relating to negative externalities caused by development projects have also been addressed: diversion of forest land for industry should be compensated through payment of Net Present Value; separate funds must be earmarked for compensatory afforestation and wildlife management; designated pre-tax profits should be allocated for development of scheduled areas. Unfortunately, such basic requirements are often portrayed as impediments to economic growth, and environmental losses stand ignored. Moreover, a transparent, independent assessment mechanism to monitor implementation of conditions set for grant of clearance does not exist. In Odisha, for instance, environmental rules and conditions were brazenly violated by Vedanta Alumina when it launched the expansion of its project before clearance was given, a fact recorded by the Saxena committee of the Environment Ministry. Now that the gram sabhas, and thereafter the MoEF have another opportunity to revisit the Niyamgiri project, they must ensure that tribal rights are recognised. The Supreme Court order is a good precedent for all projects that have environmental and social consequences. Development is a natural aspiration, but it must be genuine and not result in the loss of even the existing quality of life.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-significance-of-Niyamgiri/article12120104.ece
4,5,2013,Caution still the key,"In its annual monetary policy statement for 2013-14, the Reserve Bank of India was not expected to depart from the cautious stance that has characterised its recent policy statements. Therefore, the reduction in the policy repo rate by just 0.25 percentage points to 7.25 per cent has not caused much disappointment, although there were some who were hoping for a similar cut in the Cash Reserve Ratio too. Whatever expectations there were of more generous monetary easing were dashed by the RBI’s report on the macro economy which was released a day ahead as a backdrop to the monetary policy statement. The report, after listing various macro-financial risks, said that “the space for action for 2013-14 remains very limited.” In its March policy statement too the RBI had conveyed the same message. These statements are, however, not cast in stone and much would depend on the rapidly changing growth-inflation dynamic in India and abroad. For now, inflation remains a big worry, even though WPI inflation for March 2013 had turned out to be lower than the RBI estimate. For 2013-14, the RBI expects it to be range bound, at around 5.5 per cent, with the March 2014 target even lower at 5 per cent. The Consumer Price Index-based inflation rate remains in double digits, a point surprisingly not highlighted by the RBI.
Economic growth during the current year is expected to be not more than 5.7 per cent, which is far lower than the 6.4-6.5 per cent that the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council and, earlier, the budget had estimated. This is another instance of the central bank being cautious, no doubt prompted by its expectation of sluggish performance in both industry and services. Interestingly, the RBI’s baseline growth projection of 5.5 per cent for last year turned out to be higher than the official estimate of 5 per cent. Among the major macroeconomic risks, the biggest is the current account deficit, which last year was at its historic high and well above the 2.5 per cent level which the RBI considers to be sustainable. As much as the size of the CAD, its financing exposes the economy to the risk of sudden stop and reversal of capital flows. The advanced economies from where these flows originate themselves face an uncertain economic outlook. Within India, a growth revival is not possible without a revival in investment. But business confidence is at a low and both borrowers and lenders have become risk averse. Finally, the effectiveness of monetary policy in easing inflation pressures could be undermined by supply constraints in the economy, especially in critical areas like food and infrastructure.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/caution-still-the-key/article4681083.ece
4,5,2013,Keeping children out of labour,"The economic vulnerabilities that confront households in the current sluggish recovery from the global meltdown are aggravating the fight against child labour, says the International Labour Organisation. Its latest report emphasises the need for universal coverage of at least a minimum level of social security to help some 215 million working children. Half that number is trapped in the worst forms of child labour — work akin to slavery, debt bondage, child prostitution and hazardous occupations harmful to health and safety. To be sure, the number of child workers did drop by some 30 million in the last decade. But job losses in the adult population in the wake of the global financial crisis and shocks related to crop failure and recurrent freak weather patterns are threatening a reversal of recent gains. The report collates findings from various studies that establish a clear correlation between adverse macro-economic indicators and the recourse to child labour. Correspondingly, cash transfers are known to prove effective in reducing child labour in Asia and Latin America, subject to supply-side conditions such as the availability of education facilities. Similarly, in many African countries where parents have been lost to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, social protection measures such as health insurance, targeted at the elderly, ensure uninterrupted school attendance among children.
It is abundantly clear then that the elimination of child labour is predicated upon making progress on many fronts. Getting kids to go to school, a key priority that drove the abolition campaign a decade ago, is obviously a necessary but not sufficient condition for the eradication of child labour. Surely, there has been a surge in enrolments in recent years and there has even been some talk of devising ways to retain wards beyond primary school. But all of this presupposes a sound overall policy framework to be sustained over the long term. A scenario where as much as 75 per cent of the global population (more than 5 billion people) has no access to comprehensive social protection, as per ILO estimates, hardly inspires confidence in the capacity of countries to kick start the lives of millions. To make headway, governments must be prepared to spend more. A hugely influential 2010 study which claimed that public debt ratios in excess of 90 per cent of gross domestic product would automatically lead to a decline in growth has recently been exposed as relying on erroneous calculations, a fact conceded by its authors. Several governments that have so far persisted with crippling austerity measures to cut back on welfare spending, with severe socio-political ramifications, should reconsider their stance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/keeping-children-out-of-labour/article4681082.ece
6,5,2013,"When it rains, it pours","If misfortunes never come singly, who should know it better than a party and government whose fate through the past four years has been to lurch from scam to scam, crisis to crisis? Not only have the scandals around the Congress and Team Manmohan acquired a Terminator-like ability to morph and resurface, each new day seems to bring fresh allegations — against one or another minister with the Prime Minister barely escaping the heat. All of last week, Law Minister Ashwani Kumar was in the dock for interfering in the CBI’s status report on coal block allocations. The government was still fending off the Opposition and Supreme Court onslaught on that accusation, when corruption charges hit, of all people, the soft-spoken Pawan Kumar Bansal. Although there is no direct evidence connecting the Railway Minister to a bribe allegedly received by his nephew to facilitate a key Railway Board appointment, the relationship is close enough to raise questions. More so because the nephew, Vijay Singla, who has been arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation, oversaw the minister’s constituency interests in Chandigarh.
The ruling establishment has brushed off the Bansal bribery charge with typical nonchalance. But the denials have become too routine and too practised for anyone to buy them. Indeed, it is not so much this case as the fact that it has been raining scams in the Congress-government backyard that has allowed any and every new accusation to stand in the face of refutations. The reconvened Budget session of Parliament had started riotously enough with explosive new angles emerging in the handling of 2G and coal block allotments. The Bansal case has added further to the image of a government corrupt beyond redemption and arrogant to boot. To be sure, the government has been able to weather the storms partly because the Opposition offensive has not resulted in the ruling numbers being tested on the floor of the Lok Sabha. So much so, Parliament has been reduced to a charade with the Bharatiya Janata Party incessantly demanding the Prime Minister’s resignation, and the latter treating the warnings and threats as if they were of no consequence. Sushma Swaraj recently went on record to say that the government had no business to stay even one more day in power. That very day the BJP walked out of the two Houses, allowing the passage of the Finance Bill. Regardless of how events turn out for Ashwani Kumar and Pawan Bansal, one thing seems certain: The BJP has too much on its own plate — for which read Narendra Modi and alliance troubles — to bother with dispatching a government it claims is on its way out.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/when-it-rains-it-pours/article4686662.ece
6,5,2013,Degrees of change,"The Delhi University decision to adopt a four-year Baccalaureate undergraduate degree programme in place of the contemporary three-year Bachelors degree may be an attempt at curriculum innovation, but the absence of academic refinements and adequate discussion among teachers and prospective entrants is a disappointment. The standardisation of courses and certification has provided a stable system for students across the country, and led to predictable outcomes for employers. This is not to say that the products of the system have emerged uniformly educated, skilled and employable. Moreover, there is a long and justified debate on encouraging real innovation in education, with the goal of breaking the silos that mark individual disciplines and allowing students to choose from diverse courses, combining even mathematics and music, and qualify for a degree. It is in this area that DU’s new four-year honours degree system must be put to the test. Does it provide such flexibility to the students or does it enforce a rigid curriculum? Evidently, it would be counterproductive to simply regiment students into a set of foundation and application courses, not all of which match their aptitude. That apprehensions exist about the likely outcomes of the changed curriculum indicates that the university has done a poor job of convincing the intended beneficiaries and the faculty.
At the 61st meeting of the Central Advisory Board of Education last month, the point was underscored that India needs a modern national higher education qualification framework. This is based on the need for recognition and acceptability of courses and degrees by all universities on the question of equivalence. As a country with one of the largest higher education systems anywhere — involving over 600 university-level institutions and more than 36,000 colleges — the issue of degree-equivalence, and vertical and horizontal mobility of students must be an important priority when curricular reform is undertaken. While the duration of degree courses may vary, as it does in different countries, it would serve the goals of education better if the credit system for individual courses is standardised and introduced in all universities recognised by the University Grants Commission. Such reform would be a genuine silo-breaker, since students can take a variety of courses including those in core subjects and qualify for a degree. The change at Delhi University has tweaked the course duration, but appears to be short on academic liberalisation of the kind that would make it a real model. Allowing students more choices to exit the degree programme before the fourth year with certification is welcome, but that in itself is hardly revolutionary.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/degrees-of-change/article4686790.ece
7,5,2013,Work in progress,"It took several flag meetings on the ground and much diplomatic energy on both sides but the abatement of tension near the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh came not a day too soon. The Chinese troops who had set up tented positions around Daulat Beg Oldi inside Indian territory some three weeks ago have withdrawn; Indian troops who pitched their tents in response to this provocation have also withdrawn. The Chinese withdrawal may be a victory for diplomacy but it is important to remember that the Depsang Plain, located in a far corner of Ladakh, has only reverted to being what it was — part of the unsettled portion of the LAC between India and China. What that means is that India and China need to make a push for resolving the boundary question quickly. As a first step, completing the process of exchanging maps depicting each side’s understanding of where the LAC lies is crucial. Unless this happens, such disputes are likely to arise again, and strain the entire gamut of ties. Thanks to the stand-off, Indian public opinion has become suspicious of Chinese intentions to the point of making irrelevant the important progress achieved in the bilateral relationship over the past decade. The proposed visit by Chinese premier Li Keqiang later this month — and the preparatory visit by External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid to Beijing this week — will be important for restoring a measure of confidence in the relationship.
It is still unclear what caused the People’s Liberation Army to move troops into the Depsang Plain. There is speculation that it might have done so to convey its displeasure at the recent infrastructure development undertaken by India in Ladakh. Given that a diplomatic mechanism already exists to regulate and draw down mutual deployments along the LAC, it would be unwise for any stakeholder on the Chinese side to try and unilaterally force an outcome through provocative actions. Indeed, Beijing must realise that its attempts to resolve long-standing disputes with countries across Asia through coercive tactics will only rebound on itself. As in Japan and South East Asia, in India too such methods are bound to strengthen those who advocate joining hands with the United States in its efforts to counter Beijing’s influence in this region. Of course, the Indian champions of this strategy must realise that notwithstanding the American “pivot to Asia,” the Ladakh stand-off did not so much as elicit a murmur from the U.S. or its allies. This episode has been confirmation, if any was required, that India’s foreign policy, while answering to what is best for the country, must be able to stand on its own feet.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/work-in-progress/article4689892.ece
7,5,2013,Letting go of the leash,"It’s not the nature of the changes made, but the very act of changing that is at the core of the controversy over the Central Bureau of Investigation allowing the Law Minister and the Prime Minister’s Office to go through the draft status report on the probe into allocation of coal blocks. As the CBI submitted in its affidavit before the Supreme Court on Monday, no names of suspects or accused persons were removed from the status reports at the suggestion of the government. But the question of propriety in sharing with the political executive the details of a case in which the government’s own actions are suspect still remains. That the officers of the CBI worked into the status report some of the suggestions from the government is deeply worrying, even if, as the CBI director maintained before the court, the “central theme” of the report had not been changed. Moreover, the changes are significant even if these had no direct bearing on the criminal culpability of the suspects and the accused. Besides the deletion of a finding about the screening committee not having prepared any broadsheet about applicants for the coal blocks, what went missing in the report before the court was also a line on the legality of allocations while amendments in law were in the process of being taken up. A reference to the absence of a weightage system in the allocation of blocks also did a vanishing act in the final report.
Even if these changes do not alter the “central theme” of the report, surely questions are bound to be asked about whom these changes would benefit and on what the rationale was for their original inclusion and their later exclusion. The CBI’s defence, if it can be called that, about only the draft report being shared, and not the final report submitted in a sealed cover to the court, is rather lame. If indeed the suggestions made by the political executive were incorporated after the vetting of the draft report, it is no consolation that the revised report was not again shown to the government. Surely, the CBI will also have to answer questions on the nature of the changes sought by the government, and whether some of the changes sought were too serious and damaging to the larger case to be incorporated into the status report. If there is anything at all to cheer about in this sordid episode, it is that the Supreme Court might sense the need to guarantee the CBI the institutional freedom and autonomy it needs to carry out independent investigations, especially in cases involving political corruption. Otherwise, the CBI can do no more than strain at the leash. And the government might just tighten its hold.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/letting-go-of-the-leash/article4689893.ece
8,5,2013,Power with responsibility,"There are two parts to the Supreme Court’s landmark decision on Kudankulam, and each is equally important. Much to the relief of the Centre, which had invested hundreds of crores of rupees there, the Tamil Nadu government which desperately needs electricity, and the nuclear establishment whose very raison d’etre had been challenged, the court has said the power plant can now be switched on. But it has laid down important caveats on safety — the chief concern of those opposed to the project — and urged the authorities to roll-back the hundreds and thousands of cases that have been foisted, mostly unfairly, on the protesters. Apart from underscoring the need for the plant to satisfy all environmental safety conditions stipulated by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, the judges have wisely tasked Kudankulam’s operator — the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited — and its regulator, the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, with a review of the plant every three months, after initially certifying the safety and reliability of all the components and systems installed. It would add to the credibility of India’s atomic energy establishment if it widens the ambit of such reviews by making them truly independent and transparent. The AERB today is not independent of the Department of Atomic Energy, which is the parent body of NPCIL, and the government itself plans to replace it with a more credible Nuclear Safety Regulatory Authority. In the interim, and indeed even after the NSRA comes into being, the Supreme Court ought to subject these reviews to judicial scrutiny. This approach would mirror the apex court’s efforts to strengthen the independence of the Central Bureau of Investigation.
Apart from expeditiously withdrawing the cases lodged against those who participated in the anti-nuclear agitation, the Tamil Nadu government must also actively follow-up the neighbourhood development and housing programmes for which funds have been allocated. While judicial orders can help ensure that Kudankulam starts its operations on a sound footing, building public confidence will depend on the approach of the nuclear establishment to a host of issues: of safety of nuclear material, handling of spent fuel, and the need to build scientifically validated nuclear waste repositories without delay. Since spent fuel is not to be reprocessed at Kudankulam, and must be transported to other facilities as per international safety norms, it is reasonable to expect that the modalities, if not the details, will be shared with the country. For instance, is transport by rail adequately protected? Equally, it is incumbent on the Centre and Tamil Nadu to show demonstrable proficiency in emergency and disaster management preparedness up to the district level, as mandated by national guidelines. After Fukushima, it should be clear that indifference to safety can jeopardise the future of the entire nuclear energy programme.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/power-with-responsibility/article4693181.ece
8,5,2013,Access to the printed word,"Talks on a global treaty to give copyright exemptions for the blind and print disabled are inching close to fruition at the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), notwithstanding sticky areas in the draft text. The half-a-decade-long negotiations at the relevant standing committee at the world body concluded last month, paving the way for a diplomatic conference in June in Morocco to fine-tune the law. Deliberations were deadlocked for months on the question of balancing the need to extend cross-border access to reading material with the interests of copyright holders. Developed nations have been lobbying hard for assurances that accessible formats of books were not already in circulation whenever fresh material is transferred to recipient states. Developing countries have legitimate concerns in terms of the practical difficulties that such monitoring — principally by non-government organisations — would entail. It is relevant to note here that many countries already have in place suitable amendments to their domestic copyright laws to address the special needs segment. It is thus a matter of establishing the mechanisms for applying the same principle internationally. Though concerns exist over the potential unauthorised use of copyright exemptions in the developing world, the rights of creators must be weighed against the larger interests of equity and justice. The harsh reality for disabled end-users the world over is that some 95 per cent of published literature today is beyond their reach.
The refusal by western countries, in particular the United States, to move forward on the treaty obviously has to do with concerns over the general lack of protection against piracy in the developing world. But the message from the WIPO talks in Geneva is also that the advanced world can’t ignore the needs of the disabled elsewhere for too long. With disability likely to figure high among global development priorities post-2015, the availability of accessible information would prove a key determinant of the educational and employment attainments of the disabled. Moreover, it does not stand to reason that while the rights of disabled people for access to the physical environment has acquired wide currency, access to published information and knowledge through accessible formats should continue to be denied.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/access-to-the-printed-word/article4693183.ece
9,5,2013,A stand-alone victory,"Sometimes, the ruling party is the opposition’s biggest benefactor. In Karnataka, the Congress returned to power with a comfortable majority on the strength of what was clearly a mandate against the Bharatiya Janata Party. All that the BJP was trying to do against the Congress at the national level, the Congress successfully did against the BJP in Karnataka. Corruption, nepotism, non-governance, inefficiency, and instability all constituted the campaign themes in this multi-cornered contest. For this very reason, the Congress might have more lessons to learn from its victory than the BJP from its defeat. If the Karnataka Assembly election is a pointer to the national mood, it is as a verdict against corruption and non-governance, not as an endorsement of the Congress and the many scams that have unfolded under the watch of the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre. Indeed, the fact that the Janata Dal (Secular) got as many seats as the BJP is an indication that the vote was primarily anti-incumbent and pro-change, and not necessarily pro-Congress. While it is true that the exit of former Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa hurt the BJP badly, there was a clear away-swing from the ruling party, with the Congress being the principal gainer.
For five years, the BJP wrestled with its own internal problems, spending more time and effort on survival than on governance. After having come to power in the southern State more as a non-Congress alternative than as a Hindutva extremist party, the BJP got everything wrong within a few months of the 2008 election. The party appeared beholden to the Bellary mining lobby, and Mr. Yeddyurappa was left with the difficult task of holding his flock together in the face of inducements from factions within his own party. Clearly, the focus was on ensuring Independents and BJP legislators were kept happy with cabinet berths and official posts. In coastal Karnataka, no effort was made to curb the thuggish acts of Hindutva vigilantes. Matters came to a head when Mr. Yeddyurappa was caught in allegations of corruption, and had to step down after being indicted by the Lokayukta. From then on began the unseemly spectacle of Mr. Yeddyurappa trying to make a puppet of his successors, first Sadananda Gowda and then Jagadish Shettar. The national leadership of the BJP, which was on an anti-corruption campaign drive against the Congress at the Centre, was at a loss in Karnataka, where its government was mired in corruption cases and scandals. For the Congress, the victory in Karnataka will be difficult to replicate, not only in other States, but also in the 2014 parliamentary election. If the Congress is not careful, Karnataka 2013 might turn out to be more of a blip than a spark.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-standalone-victory/article4696269.ece
9,5,2013,A tale of two verdicts,"The Supreme Court’s verdict last week quashing the President’s rejection of a mercy petition by Mahendra Nath Das, who was to hang for a gruesome murder, shows a salutary approach to the question of whether a prolonged delay in disposing pleas for clemency should not be a ground for commuting death sentences to life terms. The court took note of the 12-year delay prior to the rejection of Das’s mercy plea. Of these, there were two spells of three and five years during which there was no explanation for why his file did not move. Another fact the court took note of was that President Pratibha Patil was “kept in the dark” about her predecessor, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam suggesting in 2005 that Das be granted clemency, as this was not mentioned in a summary prepared for her consideration. It held that the President was not properly assisted or advised. The principle that unexplained delay on the part of the executive will be a constitutional limitation on carrying out an execution stands reconfirmed by the Das judgment.
However, while considering the same question last month, the Supreme Court declined to commute the death penalty awarded to Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar, holding that as a terrorist, he could not be allowed to take advantage of the prolonged delay in the disposal of his mercy petition. In other words, facts and circumstances, which are often cited to distinguish one case from another, are irrelevant if what is involved is an offence under anti-terrorism laws. It is tempting to see the fact that the same Bench — comprising Justice G.S. Singhvi and Justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya — delivered both verdicts within three weeks as ironical or contradictory. It isn’t really, for the Das verdict shows that the court is willing and able to decide a challenge to a Presidential rejection on merits, facts and circumstances as well as sound principles of jurisprudence. However, it may indicate a piecemeal approach on the part of the judiciary by which an expedient principle is laid down to defeat the case for mercy in some cases, while others are decided on facts and circumstances. A moot question is what future judges would do if similar circumstances are seen in cases involving terrorism. Will an unexplained delay of over a decade, coupled with the executive’s failure to place all relevant material before the President or to advise the incumbent properly, be brushed under the carpet merely because the individual to be hanged was involved in, say, a bomb blast or a political assassination? A wiser course is to avoid laying down rigid principles such as the ‘Bhullar rule’ against any mercy in terrorism cases.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-tale-of-two-verdicts/article4696272.ece
10,5,2013,Too early to die,"It cannot get any worse than this. Over three lakh newborns in India die on the very first day of their birth. With this the country ranks as number one in terms of first day of birth mortality; its share in global first-day deaths stands at 29 per cent. The appalling state of Indian health care to which this speaks is further highlighted by the fact that the next worst performer, Nigeria, is a distant second with less than 90,000 deaths a year and a nine per cent share of global deaths. These are some of the statistics in the “State of the World’s Mothers” report released by Save the Children recently. With 28,000 deaths a year, Bangladesh is not only better off than India, but is also one of the 12 developing countries that have made the greatest strides in achieving a significant decline in deaths between 1990 and 2011. As one of the most populous countries, it is inevitable that India may continue to register a greater number of deaths even if it achieves an appreciable decline in percentage mortality. Hence it must simultaneously adopt multiple strategies, and with greater immediacy, for a large reduction in the number of newborn deaths. Tremendous gain can be achieved by preventing childhood marriages as teenage pregnancy greatly contributes to first-day deaths.
Poor mothers living in rural areas are another at-risk group that needs undivided focus. If poor health before and during pregnancy is already a big risk factor, lack of good medical care during delivery exacerbates it. This brings to the spotlight the need to have a greater percentage of institutional deliveries. Forty-six per cent of mothers deliver at health-care facilities in sub-Saharan Africa. Though India’s national average of 73 per cent is much higher than sub-Saharan Africa’s, why is neonatal mortality still high in many States? For instance, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha have high newborn (0-7 days) deaths despite having high institutional deliveries of 63 per cent, 46 per cent and 53 per cent respectively. The uncomfortable truth is the questionable quality of care at many of these facilities. The personnel attending to deliveries are very often not properly trained and hence not fully proficient in labour-room protocols. Labour rooms are not always fully equipped with essential medicines, equipment and electricity. All these result in the incongruity between more facilities but poor outcome. States must therefore emulate the Tamil Nadu model where women-friendly public services are provided by fully equipped health-centres with a well-trained nurse round the clock to ensure safe deliveries.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/too-early-to-die/article4699657.ece
10,5,2013,The Levant’s last chance,"The joint Russian and United States announcement of a conference to bring together Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government and opposition groups could be a decisive moment in a terrible civil war which has lasted over two years and caused some 70,000 deaths so far. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated the plan in Moscow on the night of May 7-8, and the meeting is likely to take place later this month. Mr. Lavrov says the aim is to enforce the Geneva communiqué issued on June 30, 2012 calling for the implementation of the United Nations six-point plan. The plan requires that violence cease immediately, and that any process towards settlement be Syrian-led; it also calls for the release of relevant detainees as well as freedom of association, the right to demonstrate peacefully, and freedom of the media. In addition, Mr. Kerry’s comment that he could not personally see how Mr. Assad could remain in power is a significant move away from the U.S. insistence that the Syrian leader step down, and towards the consistent Russian line that it is solely for the Syrian people to decide whether or not their President stays in office. The U.N.-Arab League Special Envoy for Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, says the Moscow announcement is “very significant” and the “first hopeful news” concerning Syria in a long time.
The reason for a renewed U.S. commitment to talks is probably that the civil war has clearly become a regional war. The Assad forces have long been aided by Hizbollah combatants from Lebanon and Iraq; the opposition Syrian National Coalition (SNC), for its part, receives arms from Qatar and Saudi Arabia, as well as U.S. funds for non-lethal equipment. Another complication is that the extreme Sunni group Jabhat al-Nusra is trying to replace the SNC as the main opposition. Nevertheless, Israel’s air attacks against Syria last week — the second such attack since January — reportedly on a consignment of missiles intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon, and on Syrian military installations, amount to a potentially deadly escalation. The direct involvement of Tel Aviv will only worsen the existing problem but has drawn no western condemnation; indeed U.S. officials have even approved of Israel’s attacks. Reports that the Damascus-based leadership of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (General Command) is now readying itself for actions against Israel provides one indication of the difficult days which lie ahead if diplomacy is sidelined. The U.S. must ensure that its Israeli allies do nothing to undermine the forthcoming conference, which provides the embattled region with its best chance yet of avoiding a wider war.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-levants-last-chance/article4699658.ece
11,5,2013,"Two down, what next?","After brazening it out for as long it could, the Manmohan Singh government has finally bowed to the inevitable and sacked Pawan Kumar Bansal and Ashwani Kumar. The Railway Minister was on a sticky wicket over a serious bribery case involving a close relative, and the Law Minister had been pulled up by the highest court for interfering in a status report on coal block allotments due for presentation in court by the Central Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Bansal’s position had become completely untenable following disclosure that contrary to the Railway Minister’s own claim, he was possibly aware of how the bribery deal was clinched by his nephew, Vijay Singla. Mr. Bansal had stoutly defended himself when news first broke of Mr. Singla’s arrest by the CBI on charges of accepting a hefty bribe towards a promised appointment in the Railway Board. The minister insisted that he had no business relationship with Mr. Singla even as it emerged that the nephew was overseeing his constituency interests in Chandigarh. A photograph revealed Mr. Singla’s presence in Mr. Bansal’s office at the time the latter took charge as Railway Minister. As further details surfaced, things began to spiral out of control and soon there was no telling fact from fiction.
A tell-all tape in the possession of the CBI has been hinted at, and there are accusations that large loans were extended to the Bansal family by a public sector bank coinciding with Mr. Bansal’s earlier term as minister of state for finance. Mr. Kumar’s wrongdoing was of a different order and there were no personal or financial accusations against him. Yet what was passed off as a mere impropriety became indefensible after the Supreme Court took the view that the heart of the CBI’s report had been altered under the minister’s supervision. The court was also unsparing of the government for treating the CBI as a handmaiden, suggesting that immediate steps be taken for liberating it from executive influence. Together the two scandals dealt a body blow to a government already in all manner of trouble over 2G, Coalgate and other scams. But typically the regime waited until matters had reached a head and it was no longer possible to follow the usual drill of delaying until the pressure had eased. The plain truth is that the government’s image has hit rock bottom with any protestations of innocence being seen only as an extended act of chicanery by an establishment practised in deceit. This was to have been the moment to rejoice for party and government. But thanks to these ministerial misdemeanours, and the government’s own refusal to act before irretrievable damage was done, the sheen has been taken off the Congress’s glorious victory in Karnataka.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/two-down-what-next/article4703138.ece
11,5,2013,Time to go unilateral,"When it comes to reciprocity, there is no equal to the kind practised by India and Pakistan with each other. No wonder, because it requires a special talent to mirror hostility in such a perfectly choreographed manner. The attack on prisoner Sanaullah Haq in Jammu’s Kot Bhalwal jail that sent him into a coma and led to his eventual death from multi-organ failure was part of the endless tit-for-tat that the two countries end up playing with each other. That it was a fellow prisoner who assaulted him in retaliation for the killing of Sarabjit in Pakistan by inmates does not exonerate Indian officialdom. In fact, it is unforgivable that even after there was an alert across jails to ensure no revenge attacks on Pakistani prisoners, the Jammu attack could not be prevented. The jail superintendent and other officials have rightly been suspended, and an inquiry has been ordered. Even so, the incident has exposed India as a country that still has to grow up, and that despite its eagerness to pretend otherwise, suffers from some of the same dysfunctionalities as its western neighbour. In keeping with the pattern, Pakistan gave a state funeral to Sanaullah, a Harkat-ul-Ansar militant convicted and sentenced to life for two bomb blasts in Kashmir, to match the one given Sarabjit, convicted for bomb blasts that killed 14 people in Pakistan. None of this reciprocal madness gives much hope for the future of India-Pakistan relations.
Until now, tit-for-tat hostility was practised only by officials on both sides, sometimes targeting each other’s diplomats for surveillance, attacks or expulsion, at other times targeting ordinary people, as for instance by denying them visas or harassing them in other ways. What is worrying about the Sanaullah incident is that people-to-people relations are also on their way to getting tainted in the same way, and officials are allowing this to happen. A section of khadims at the Ajmer dargah said they would not permit Pakistani pilgrims to attend the urs. Shockingly, New Delhi also recommended to Pakistan that the pilgrimage be called off as after the Sarabjit incident, it could not ensure the security of travellers from across the border. Going by this, next it will be the turn of the Sikh jathas who go on pilgrimages to gurudwaras in Pakistan to face a similar situation. Before it comes to that, the cycle of nastiness has to be broken. Telling Pakistani pilgrims that they are welcome to come to Ajmer would be a good place to begin. And there’s no need to demand reciprocity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/time-to-go-unilateral/article4703141.ece
13,5,2013,Pakistan’s vote for change,"Ahistoric election has just been held in Pakistan, enabling a transition from one civilian government to another for the first time in its 65-year existence. In the run-up, an orgy of violence unleashed by the Taliban threatened to overwhelm the country’s date with democracy, but democratic change was what the people wanted and they turned out in large numbers to vote out the Pakistan People’s Party, whose five-year term was marked by an abysmal absence of governance. While the Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaf — led by Imran Khan — disrupted what has traditionally been a two-horse race with its heady new slogan of a New Pakistan, the electorate preferred to vest its trust in more experienced hands. The Pakistan Muslim League (N) of Nawaz Sharif — whose second term as Prime Minister was terminated by the 1999 military coup that brought General Pervez Musharraf to power — is on course to win enough seats in the 272-strong National Assembly to form the government. Its centre-right agenda, similar to Imran’s but offering more details and stability, clearly touched a chord in a population that is increasingly suspicious of the U.S. but also knows the country cannot live in isolation. Even so, this election offers no simple reading. The PML (N)’s mandate came almost entirely from Punjab. While that confirms the province's predominance, it questions the national character of the vote, which seems to have split along provincial lines. Official results are still coming in, but most of the PTI’s parliamentary seats were won in Khyber-Pukhtunkhwa, where Imran Khan’s anti-drone campaign was most effective. Neck and neck with the PTI, the PPP won mostly in Sindh, its traditional stronghold, and was routed elsewhere. The verdict in Balochistan, where turnout was low, was too fractured to offer any hope to the restive province.
Mr. Sharif knows only too well the enormity of the challenges ahead of him. In his last term, his ties with right-wing groups led him into costly Islamist adventurism. He has evolved in the last decade but members of his party still consort openly with jihadist outfits. He and his party have also sent out mixed messages on how to deal with the terrorism that is devouring Pakistan, and which threatens India and the neighbourhood. It is likely that being in power, and dealing with a world that has changed much since 2001, will help clear his vision. Where he gives most hope is in his strong and unambiguous articulation of better India-Pakistan relations, though this will depend on his stated determination to correct the civil-military imbalance, and reclaim the national agenda from the security establishment. Whether he can succeed is another question, but India will be hoping he will.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pakistans-vote-for-change/article4709298.ece
13,5,2013,The right choice,"In choosing Siddaramaiah as its Chief Minister in Karnataka, the Congress party has made a good beginning. The 64-year old Lohiaite socialist scored over several other claimants, notably Union Labour Minister M. Mallikarjuna Kharge and Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee President G. Parameshwara, in a Congress-style ‘secret ballot’ — in which the number of votes each candidate receives is also kept a secret by the ‘High Command.’ The Congress government, however, is unlikely to enjoy the initial lease of public goodwill and patience that a new government normally gets. After all, its elevation to power was due to voter outrage against the Bharatiya Janata Party’s misrule rather than for its own appeal, a point established by the voting pattern. Though it won 121 out of the 223 Assembly seats for which polls were held, thereby giving it a comfortable majority, it could increase its vote share by just under 2 percentage points over the 2008 polls. It is the BJP that lost considerable ground, its vote share falling by 13.89 percentage points over the 2008 polls. The Congress wants to show that it means business in vesting responsibility in a clean leader with proven administrative acumen, for Mr. Siddaramaiah has presented seven State budgets as Finance Minister. A lawyer by training, Mr. Siddaramaiah is of Janata Parivar lineage. He left the Janata Dal (Secular) in 2006 and took up the cause of the AHINDA (a Kannada acronym for the minorities, backward classes, and Dalits) movement before joining the Congress. He was the Leader of the Opposition in the last Assembly, and perhaps its only effective voice, taking the then government to task over its failures on many fronts.
In defining his immediate future as “a bed of thorns” in an interview to this newspaper on Saturday, the Chief Minister-designate was perhaps referring to the formidable task of dismantling the old and re-constructing afresh. Undoubtedly, the last five years have seen a deep loss of public faith in government and its institutions. Mr. Siddaramaiah must be empowered by the Congress ‘High Command’: to choose a team free of those with tainted records, to deal firmly with factionalism that the Congress is known for; and to tackle key state sectors that have been neglected. These include agriculture, pro-poor human resource development (including fulfilling promises on the development of the Hyderabad-Karnataka region) and employment. Last but not least, the State’s voters expect the new government to ensure that the institution of the Lokayukta regains the position of authority and independence it enjoyed during the tenure of Justice Santosh Hegde.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-right-choice/article4709406.ece
14,5,2013,Set a lobby to stop a lobby,"The ugly head of protectionism seems to be rising yet again in the United States where a group of senators — the Gang of Eight as they have been nicknamed — have introduced a bill in the Senate with provisions designed to make outsourcing expensive and cumbersome. The provisions of the bill will affect Indian IT companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Cognizant and Wipro, for all of whom the U.S. is the biggest market accounting for at least three-quarters of their respective businesses. There are three key provisions of the bill that worry Indian IT companies. First, H1B/L1 visa holders should not account for more than 50 per cent of the workforce of outsourcing companies in the U.S. Second, ‘outplacement,’ or the number of employees working at client sites, should not constitute more than a specified part of the workforce. Finally, wages paid to H1B/L1 visa holders should not be less than the prevalent wages for similar work in the U.S. In addition, the visa fees will also increase steeply. The objectives of the Gang of Eight are clear: push outsourcing companies to recruit local talent, and blunt the cost advantage that they enjoy through the relatively lower wages that they pay their employees in relation to equivalent American talent. Laudable objectives really, except that the senators have overlooked one important issue: the shortage of technology workers in the U.S.
Cognizant, one of the top three IT companies in India, is on record about the difficulty in acquiring adequate workers in the U.S. for equivalent work done by Indian employees. Clients in the U.S. themselves appear none too happy about the provisions of the bill as they realise that critical projects that the Indian companies are now implementing for them will be affected if the bill is passed in its current form. Indeed, that’s the crux of the matter: in the effort to create more jobs, the Gang of Eight may well be making things more difficult for a whole bunch of U.S. industries, from insurance and banking to health care and automobiles. Indian IT companies and the projects they are working on for their clients have helped the latter to cut costs and increase efficiencies in these times of recession. This coupled with the fact that the unemployment rate for technology workers in the U.S. is less than 4 per cent makes it clear that the bill is a very bad idea. To be sure, the draft will undergo several changes. As the bill passes through the House of Representatives in the next few months, U.S. clients of outsourcing companies are likely to weigh in and demand dilution of its provisions. To push them towards doing that should be the single-point agenda of the Indian IT industry.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Set-a-lobby-to-stop-a-lobby/article12133694.ece
14,5,2013,Reducing the harm,"In a country where one in 20 young men could die of cancer by the age of 70, it is essential that the ban on the sale of gutka and pan masala containing tobacco be effectively enforced in every State and Union Territory. A total of 24 States and UTs — Tamil Nadu is the latest to join the list — have introduced a ban based on the August 2011 regulation issued by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. The campaign to stop the manufacture, storage and sale of this injurious product has been greatly aided by the Supreme Court, which has been asking for compliance reports from State governments. The control of tobacco is an integral part of global public health strategies to reduce the incidence of cancer and the growing burden of non-communicable disease. This objective is vital to India and China, which together represent the biggest markets for growth, and need to be at the forefront of the struggle to curb consumption. For India, the significance of a countrywide ban lies in the potential impact it can have: about 52 per cent of oral cancers are attributable to the consumption of smokeless tobacco products. A significant reduction in newly initiated users as well as weaning away of existing consumers will therefore prove immensely rewarding.
State governments must take extraordinary measures to make up for the delay in implementation of a ban on gutka and pan masala caused by legal hurdles. Given that food safety has not enjoyed high priority, there has not been much capacity-building or recruitment of personnel in this area. It is essential that the State food safety authorities and Tobacco Control Cell enter into a partnership with civil society to identify the weak links in the enforcement chain and take remedial action. The approach to any violation must be one of zero tolerance. There is something to be learnt here from the aggressive international efforts to curb the sale of tobacco products, with the help of NGOs. These agencies, such as the Asia Pacific Association for the Control of Tobacco, have forged alliances that cover entire countries and regions, and they meet regularly to discuss experiences and strategies. Evidently, the ban on gutka and pan masala containing tobacco could be enforced because there is a law against the addition of harmful substances to food. The bigger and unmet challenge, though, is to bring smoked tobacco, including bidis, under similar control. Industry has been exaggerating the impact of eliminating tobacco from an economic viewpoint, while good smoking cessation programmes for consumers are absent. Until all forms of consumption are choked off through regulation, the leaves of Nicotiana tabacum will continue to take a heavy toll.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/reducing-the-harm/article4712273.ece
15,5,2013,An arresting Act,"The pressing need to end the misuse of Section 66 A of the Information Technology Act has once again been underscored by the arrest of Jaya Vindhyala, president of the People’s Union for Civil Liberties in Andhra Pradesh. Her alleged offence of putting up posts critical of a legislator, Amanchi Krishna Mohan, and Tamil Nadu Governor K. Rosaiah on Facebook has resulted in heavy-handed police action. Clearly, the Supreme Court’s searching questions to Maharashtra over the arrest of two young women near Mumbai and the national outcry over that incident have had no restraining influence on police forces across the country. Several people have been arrested in recent months, one as recently as in February, for offences involving social media communications that either do not qualify to be prosecuted as offences, or may attract only civil defamation. The absurdity of police action, invariably launched by politically-connected individuals who can influence the course of prosecution, is compounded by the approach of the magistracy. Those accused of nothing more than engaging in ‘annoying’ or ‘offensive’ communication under the poorly drafted IT Act are routinely remanded in custody. This is not what the country expected after Union Minister Kapil Sibal said Section 66 A will not be allowed to be misused, and guidelines will ensure that senior police officers apply their mind before acting.
The Chirala case is depressingly similar to many others, in which identical or similar allegations published by the mainstream media have not invited prosecution. In fact, the publication of the allegations of the PUCL activist by the newspaper Sakshi was followed only by a notice of defamation, but their publication on social media led to immediate arrest and remand. This conflicting interpretation of free speech in the era of the Internet is discriminatory and violative of fundamental rights. It is necessary to point out here that Mr. Sibal’s defence of the legal validity of Section 66 A rests on a weak foundation. The provision in the IT law of the United Kingdom, Section 127 (1) (a), which is cited in its support, has been tightly interpreted by the House of Lords, to include the norms of a free society, the overall context and all relevant factors, in assessing complaints. It is no one’s case that grossly offensive materials should be allowed to freely circulate on the Internet, but equally, to use the law on behalf of power elites and nullify free speech guarantees enjoyed by the citizen is an outrage. Ultimately, the many instances of abuse of Section 66 A of the IT Act confirm that it does little to enhance the rule of law, and must be removed from the statute book.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-arresting-act/article4715144.ece
15,5,2013,"New leader, daunting job","There is plenty of symbolism and not a little substance in the selection of Brazil’s Roberto Azevedo as the new head of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Though not the first from the developing world to occupy the post, he is the first from Latin America and comes from a major emerging market country rapidly growing in stature and ready to demonstrate its clout in the international economic arena. Mr. Azevedo’s diplomatic skills and familiarity with the workings of the WTO will stand him in good stead when he takes over on September 1. The incumbent, Pascal Lamy, a Frenchman and a former European trade commissioner, has been accused of bias towards the West. Although the selection process at the WTO is opaque, it is the near unanimous support of the developing countries that reportedly saw him through, overcoming the tepid response of the U.S. and the European Union. The vote is a pointer to what would happen at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund if those institutions were to ever be democratised.
The problem is that if the developed countries remain lukewarm to his leadership, Mr. Azevedo’s task of reversing the WTO’s declining relevance in the wake of its failure to broker a global trade deal becomes that much more difficult. The Doha round was launched in the Qatari capital nearly 12 years ago to cut tariffs and trade distorting subsidies but is now on life support. Talks broke down in mid-2008 over seemingly irreconcilable differences, between the U.S. and India, and also between other countries and groupings. Of course, the WTO continues to have a trusted role in monitoring trade agreements and umpiring disputes. Its dispute settlement mechanism allows even the smallest of countries to enforce the rule of law against their more powerful trading partners. But deadlock in the multilateral talks has prompted many countries, India included, to go in for bilateral and regional free trade agreements. These are only a second best option as they involve trade displacement from third parties. Besides, as a rule, FTAs make an eventual multilateral trade agreement infinitely more difficult. In a weak global trade environment caused by the failure of important countries to adhere to multilateralism, the threat of protectionism looms large. In 2012, global trade grew by just 2 per cent — a rate lower than global GDP growth — and turned in the second worst performance since records began in 1981. Mr Azevedo will need a successful meeting at Bali later this year to advance the heavily scaled down Doha round. But only diehard optimists can hope for a breakthrough.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/new-leader-daunting-job/article4715145.ece
16,5,2013,"Right decision, wrong reason","The Narendra Modi government’s decision to put on hold its earlier move to seek the death penalty for former minister Mayaben Kodnani and Bajrang Dal leader Babu Bajrangi may have been prompted by pressure from the sangh parivar but that does not mean it isn’t the right thing to do. The two were sentenced last year to long jail terms for organising the Naroda-Patiya massacre during the anti-Muslim pogrom of 2002 in Gujarat. Although courts in India have tended to impose death sentences on those accused of terrorist crimes — and communal violence is simply terrorism in another form — the trial court judge sagely declared that “the use of death undermines human dignity.” If the view she took was universalist, Mr. Modi’s U-turn smacks of the particularist because he is otherwise a strong and even activist advocate of the death penalty. That Kodnani had led murderous mobs was no secret. Yet the Gujarat Chief Minister made her a minister in 2007. Her indictment and eventual conviction were the result of a Supreme Court-monitored investigation. The admirable administrative skills of Mr. Modi played no role. Last month, however, in a stand that was at least consistent with his strident advocacy of the death penalty for other terrorists, Mr. Modi gave the nod for an appeal to the High Court seeking death for Kodnani and Bajrangi. It is this nod towards the noose that is now being reconsidered.
Notwithstanding the role of politics in influencing this decision, any criticism of the Modi government’s latest stand must be tempered with the view that the death penalty is no answer to heinous crimes. The moral and social imperative in criminal justice must always be on establishing guilt and awarding condign punishment, the worst of which should be a life-long prison term. Death sentences achieve little more than arithmetic equivalence. In the case of the Gujarat riots, there has been a campaign to characterise the violence as a “spontaneous reaction” to the Godhra train burning incident. The strongest rebuttal of this theory lies in the Naroda-Patiya verdict of August 2012, which laid bare the existence of a conspiracy involving BJP and sangh leaders. The Gujarat government, the Special Investigation Team and the prosecution should focus on sustaining such convictions in the higher courts instead of seeking the death penalty out of a misconception that only capital punishment is complete justice. And investigators and prosecutors throughout the country would do well to address the need to identify the culprits and establish their guilt in all cases involving organised mob terrorism rather than labouring for death sentences.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/right-decision-wrong-reason/article4718598.ece
16,5,2013,A question of informed choice,"Raising awareness about a disease is something celebrities do well. What Magic Johnson did for HIV, and Amitabh Bachchan and Rajnikant for polio in India, Angelina Jolie has now done for breast cancer. The Hollywood actor is being feted worldwide for bringing awareness about genetic testing for the disease, and the options available to women who have tested positive for abnormal BReast CAncer genes (BRCA 1/2). Testing positive for either gene puts women at a 65 per cent risk of developing breast cancer on average. In April, Ms Jolie completed three months of treatment including surgeries to remove both her breasts to ensure that she did not develop the cancer that killed her mother. She has said she chose to go public with her story “because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer.” While the procedure that Ms Jolie has undergone is not new and several women in the United States have had a bilateral mastectomy before this, it is her celebrity status that could motivate women in similar circumstances to make what is a difficult decision. It would also help those cancer-stricken women for whom breast removal is no longer just a preventive option, but a necessity.
And yet, the excited urgency that Ms Jolie’s article has caused globally must not mislead women into thinking a double mastectomy is the only way to beat breast cancer before it gets to you. However appropriate the procedure was for her, there are clearly other medical options. Oncologists need to give full information on the alternatives available to women who test positive for the BRCA genes, including periodic screening. Equally important is the need to stress that a negative BRCA test result does not preclude the occurrence of breast cancer at a later date. Essentially, the lesson from Ms Jolie’s story is that cancer is preventable. Spreading awareness about this continues to be a mammoth task in India. A large number of cancers are still being caught when they are too advanced, at a stage where medicine can do little or nothing for the patient. While prevention is recommended and possible by following a healthy lifestyle, early detection is key to squashing the growth of these rogue cells. It is only recently that the concept of preventive annual checks has caught on in India. While those who are at risk stand to gain immensely from genetic testing, the dangers of this diagnostic tool being turned into another exploitative enterprise cannot be ruled out. The government will do well to ensure that a monitoring and regulatory mechanism is in place to meet the eventuality that Ms Jolie’s example will create both a demand for the test and its supply.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-question-of-informed-choice/article4718599.ece
23,5,2013,Mission Modi,"The Bharatiya Janata Party has done the expected in presenting a trenchant charge sheet coinciding with the commencement of the United Progressive Alliance’s final year in office. Like any Opposition worth its salt, the BJP loves a good fight and the Manmohan Singh government has made the competition’s job easy by getting almost everything wrong in its second term. Unfortunately, if the ruling alliance has erred without respite, the principal Opposition too has ceaselessly played shouting brigade with little to show for its exertions. Now comes a twist in the tale in the form of Narendra Modi’s dramatic entry in affairs so far strictly the business of the BJP’s central leadership. Since his admission into the BJP’s elite Parliamentary Board, the Gujarat Chief Minister has made Delhi his second home, and logged impressive hours meeting the who’s who of his party. On Tuesday he took his new role to the next level with a strong intervention in the Parliamentary Board. His pitch: the BJP must get real in its war against the government, and to do this it must harness the social media’s potential and focus on its own performing governments such as in Gujarat.
Mr. Modi knows his strengths are a worshipping middle class and a rank and file fidgeting to have him run for Prime Minister. He knows too that the road to that destination is not easy. The Janata Dal (United), and surprisingly, even the Shiv Sena, have already drawn red lines on Mr. Modi’s candidature. But more critically for the Gujarat Chief Minister, he faces resistance from within the BJP. L.K. Advani, who previously could not stop praising Mr. Modi, has taken to looking sullen, while Sushma Swaraj has outlined a complicated three-stage procedure for deciding who, if anyone, will lead the party into the general election. It is obvious enough that Mr. Modi’s PR offensive — including a tweet on a “wonderful” meeting with Mr. Advani — is aimed at winning over the BJP biggies. Over the coming months, the pressure on the party to decide one way or another will increase even as Mr. Modi systematically raises his profile by directly engaging the public. So far he has concentrated on the big idea — of a new, aspirational India led by its young. But in Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP needs to make a serious gain if it intends to win election-2014, the opposite message is going out with the party pressing into action Modi acolyte Amit Shah and Hindutva poster boy Varun Gandhi. There is enough and more in the backgrounds of the two men to suggest that their mere presence will polarise Hindi heartland votes on religious lines — something that can only unite all the rest against the BJP and Mr. Modi.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mission-modi/article4740225.ece
23,5,2013,When commerce rules the roost,"Awareness about genetic testing to know if a woman with a family history of breast cancer and ovarian cancer carries certain deleterious mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes has surely increased following Angelina Jolie’s recent revelation of her bilateral mastectomy. In the process, she has turned the spotlight on a high-voltage patent case in the U.S. Supreme Court. The court’s decision will set a precedent on whether “composition claims” on human genes (isolated but otherwise unmodified DNA fragments and complementary DNA) are valid. At stake is Myriad Genetics and the University of Utah Research Foundation’s patent claim on the two genes. Since breast cancer is the number one cancer afflicting women, and about 10 per cent of breast cancer cases are hereditary in nature, the number of women who need this test is potentially high. Those with a family history have a 35-80 per cent elevated risk of getting breast cancer. Yet, at more than $3,000 for a test, with additional cost for more tests, many cannot afford it; prohibitive cost has been a problem since 1994 when the patent was first filed. As a result, many women are unable to get breast cancer diagnosed and treated at a very early stage, and doctors lack the vital information that would be useful in treating patients.
With the testing of this case in court, the extraordinary loss suffered by human beings, and science, due to the mindless grant of patents for “engineered DNA molecules” has come out clearly for the first time. That the mere act of isolating a part of the human genome — isolated DNA — with no modifications whatsoever was and continues to be considered an “invention” is an affront to science, to say the least. After all, laws and products of nature cannot be patented. The vacuous claim that isolated DNA fragments do not occur in nature stands exposed. Apparently, isolated DNA fragments are routinely found in human blood, urine, sputum and stool. Technically, complementary DNA (cDNA) might be considered an invention on the grounds that it is not seen in nature and is a product of human manipulation. But what good is that to millions of women with deleterious BRCA mutations who would gain tremendously from the latest advancements in science? As a June 2010 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences points out, next-generation sequencing permits the identification of mutations in the “21 known breast and ovarian cancer genes” at a cost of just $1,500. Further modifications can reduce the cost to “less than $500 per sample.” Should the absurdities of patent law continue to deny women greater access to better and cheaper techniques?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/when-commerce-rules-the-roost/article4740224.ece
24,5,2013,Dare to tell,"By ordering the prosecution of two witnesses who turned hostile in the sensational Jessica Lal murder case, the Delhi High Court seems to have paved the way for a much needed corrective in India’s criminal justice delivery system. Too often, during the course of a lengthy trial, prosecution witnesses begin to think it is easier and more convenient, and sometimes even more profitable, to lie under oath than to tell the truth. The 1999 Jessica Lal killing was supposed to be an open-and-shut case, a murder in full view of several guests at a crowded, high-profile party. But, in the ensuing trial, Manu Sharma, the man identified as the murderer, the son of a senior Congress politician, was acquitted with several witnesses going back on what they had initially told investigators. The course the case took was a reminder that justice could be subverted by the rich and the powerful, no matter what the evidence. It took intense public pressure, and a sustained campaign by rights activists, before the verdict was overturned by the Delhi High Court and Sharma sentenced to life imprisonment. But if the interests of justice were to be truly served, it was necessary for the court to proceed against those who had perjured themselves. Otherwise, witnesses would have continued to think nothing of going back on their own statements, contradicting themselves, and derailing the trial. Bollywood actor Shayan Munshi and ballistic expert P.S. Manocha, now charged with perjury, were important witnesses in the case who backtracked from their statements to the police during the trial.
According to the National Crime Records Bureau, the conviction rate in India in 2011 for murder was 38.5 per cent, and 26.4 per cent for rape. These figures are shockingly low. Alongside sloppy investigation and a fumbling prosecution, the tortuous processes of the criminal justice delivery system are also responsible for this situation. Witnesses, who often have little to gain or lose personally from the outcome of a case, see themselves as being penalised for their willingness to speak the truth. Even when they have a personal stake, witnesses often succumb to bribery or intimidation and turn hostile. Zaheera Shaikh, whose family members were burnt to death inside Vadodara’s Best Bakery during the 2002 Gujarat riots, went back and forth on her testimony. She was found guilty of perjury but in the case of Munshi and Manocha, the order to prosecute comes more than six years after the High Court itself said it suspected several witnesses of perjuring themselves. Perjury and the intimidation of witnesses will remain a problem as long as the courts don’t treat these crimes with the urgency and seriousness they deserve.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Dare-to-tell/article12145708.ece
24,5,2013,Goodluck’s gamble,"Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan’s decision last week to impose a state of emergency in the three north-eastern states of Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa, followed by air attacks, shelling and the deployment of troops, marks a dramatic new turning point for a country that last found itself at war more than four decades ago. The emergency is a response to the spread of the extreme Islamist group Boko Haram, which has led a violent insurgency since 2009; some 3,000 people are estimated to have died in the last three years, either as victims of Boko Haram or of army shootings. The government’s attempts to pursue dialogue via an amnesty committee have floundered on the intransigence of the group’s leadership but the military path Mr. Jonathan has now chosen is fraught with risk. There are already reports of the army using excessive force and arbitrary detention. The Ministry of Defence says the aim of its military operations is to reassert Nigeria’s territorial integrity. Boko Haram has a strong presence in the Borno state capital Maiduguri, where the fighting has caused enough fear and insecurity to make many residents flee their homes indefinitely.
Boko Haram, Hausa for “western education is sinful,” is the short name for the Jama’a Ahl al-sunnah li-da’wa wa al-jihad, or Congregation of the People of Tradition for Proselytism and Jihad. The group likely has al Qaeda links, and now uses sophisticated weapons, such as armoured vehicles with mounted machine guns. Boko Haram has kidnapped foreigners inside Cameroon, which abuts Borno, and earlier this year it forcibly recruited Borno youth. The group has also intimidated Muslims with bombings in Maiduguri and coordinated attacks in Kano, home to Nigeria’s largest urban Muslim population. Even the federal capital Abuja has been targeted; a 2012 attack on U.N. offices there killed 23 people. Boko Haram’s violent drive for a separate Islamist state taps into broad resentment that the country’s oil revenues have not filtered through to the north-east, Nigeria’s poorest region, but its goals are ideological. The fact that Boko Haram already has Chadians and Nigeriens in its ranks is proof of its ability to eventually contribute to the destabilisation of the wider region from eastern Mali to Chad. With the door to a political settlement all but firmly shut, Abuja can prevail provided its armed forces do not squander the advantage they have on the battlefield by allowing civilians to get caught up in the violence. President Jonathan surprised his domestic critics by acting boldly and decisively against the insurgents; he must now ensure that the manner in which force is used does not end up creating support for Boko Haram.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/goodlucks-gamble/article4743561.ece
25,5,2013,"It’s time to go, Mr. Srinivasan","Cricket in India stands on the edge of a precipice and if it is to be saved, the men who have allowed the game to be placed in mortal danger must take responsibility for their acts of omission and commission. What began as a betting and spot-fixing scandal involving three players in one Indian Premier League team now seems to have drawn in team owners, and the man at the very top of cricket administration in India. N. Srinivasan is both the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India and owner of Chennai Super Kings and he is in the dock today for the way he has run both enterprises. His son-in-law, Gurunath Meiyappan, who was also Team Principal of the Chennai Super Kings, has now been arrested by the Mumbai police. He is being investigated for his contacts with an actor who served as a conduit for bookies. The manner in which a blatant falsehood is now being peddled by Mr. Srinivasan’s spokesmen — that Mr. Meiyappan was not CSK’s Team Principal — raises questions about both the nature of the son-in-law’s indulgences and the extent to which the father-in-law was aware of these. Since it is up to the BCCI to investigate and act against those who adversely affect the reputation or standing of the IPL, the board will not be able to execute its role if Mr. Srinivasan remains its president.
Indian cricket is paying the price for the original sin Mr. Srinivasan and his supporters committed when he got the BCCI’s rules amended in 2008 to allow his company, India Cements, to bid for an IPL franchise. Today, however, the central issue is no longer this conflict of interest but the spectre of impropriety and wrongdoing. In the present circumstances, where everything from runs given, wickets taken, and catches dropped are thought to be linked to corrupt practices, the continuance of Mr. Srinivasan as BCCI president not only defangs the board’s anti-corruption code but also mocks the very spirit of cricket and belittles the interest that millions of fans take in the game. To be sure, matters will not resolve themselves with his exit. The BCCI is the world’s richest cricket board and will always be seen as fair game by politicians, tycoons and fixers who have an interest only in the power and influence control will bring them. Indian cricket will also have to be saved from them, but first things first. If public confidence in the integrity of the game is undermined, “the very essence of cricket will be shaken to the core,” the BCCI’s anti-corruption code says. This is precisely what has happened during the administration of Mr. Srinivasan. He must resign.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/its-time-to-go-mr-srinivasan/article4747036.ece
25,5,2013,It takes three,"During his visit to India this week, President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan let slip that he has given New Delhi a “wish list.” His tantalising refusal to disclose what it contained has unleashed speculation that with the U.S. withdrawal of troops in 2014 drawing closer, military equipment is what Afghanistan is seeking from India. The two countries signed a strategic partnership agreement in 2011 which included a clause for training, equipping and building the capacity of the Afghan National Army. New Delhi provides some training to Afghan security personnel but no equipment. On the ANA will fall the unenviable task of securing the country once western forces leave. The sporadic, indirect contact between Kabul and the Taliban for “peace talks” has not progressed, and there is fear about the country’s future after 2014. India is right to be concerned about this. Even so, New Delhi should be very wary of acceding to any request for “lethal” military assistance, if that is what President Karzai wants. If the U.S., with all the lethality it commands, could not find a military solution to the Taliban, how likely is it that the ANA will succeed in such an endeavour? Instead, the solution lies in a concerted regional approach in which the neutrality of Afghanistan is supported and guaranteed by all countries in its extended neighbourhood. None of its neighbours should treat Afghanistan as strategic real-estate to be leveraged against third countries.
Afghan neutrality presupposes regional support for a national military capability strong enough to ensure the country’s territory is not used by terrorists and non-state actors. But as long as the Delhi-Islamabad equation is not normal, any military role for India in Afghanistan, even if as a supplier of arms, is likely to prompt further Pakistani help for the Taliban. President Karzai has been emphatic that without Pakistan’s co-operation, Afghan peace will remain a distant dream. In this regard, the recent democratic change in Pakistan is both an opportunity and a challenge. Nawaz Sharif had good relations with the 1990s Taliban government in Afghanistan; his party keeps contact with the Taliban in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. While this is a cause for concern, it also means Pakistan’s Prime Minister-in-waiting could be an important guarantor of peace and stability in Afghanistan, more so if his enthusiastic overtures towards India can overcome opposition from the Pakistani Army and bear fruit. Success will depend also on New Delhi’s willingness to grasp his hand of friendship, despite the naysayers and their misgivings. It is this, rather than Indian howitzers, that will help Afghanistan prepare for a momentous transition.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/it-takes-three/article4747011.ece
27,5,2013,Inviting repression,"In ambushing a Congress party convoy in Chhattisgarh and brutally killing 24 people, including senior leaders Mahendra Karma and Nand Kumar Patel, the Maoists have demonstrated their willingness to escalate the conflict in Bastar regardless of its consequences for ordinary people in the region. Mr. Karma, who became the public face of the violent anti-Maoist Salwa Judum movement that was initiated by the local police with Central and State government support in 2005, was a controversial figure. Indeed, the well-documented excesses committed by the movement led the Supreme Court to insist the Judum be disbanded. His killing was not unexpected, which is why he had been given Z-plus security, but was always likely to invite a major counter-attack by the security forces that would affect ordinary villagers as much as it would Maoist fighters. In going after Mr. Karma, the Maoists have demonstrated not just a lack of concern for those who will soon be caught up in combing operations but also that they have learnt nothing from their past attacks on political figures like Chandrababu Naidu and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Attacks on politicians always matter more to the ruling establishment than attacks on security forces. In both Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal, these assassination attempts marked the beginning of the end for the Maoists.
Whether seen as an assault on the Salwa Judum, the Congress, or on the combined might of the State and Central governments, the latest killings will only worsen the situation in Chhattisgarh. Far from strengthening the democratic forces working for peace and equitable development in the Adivasi areas, Saturday’s attack is likely to end up being used by sections of the political establishment to push for larger, more lethal operations by the paramilitary forces and the police. For this very reason, the Central and State governments must guard against a heavy-handed response. Purely military operations will only increase alienation and reduce intelligence gathering even more than is already the case. Indeed, the attack raises many questions about the effectiveness of the money and manpower being deployed so far. The BJP-run State government — which has spent crores of rupees on the ruling party’s Vikas Yatra — must also face uncomfortable questions about why it was the Opposition rally which has faced the brunt of the Maoist attack. If the Central and State governments are not careful, the ambush could result in the spiralling of violence in the region. Violence must always be turned into an opportunity to push for peace, and never as an excuse to use the armed might of the State on hapless villagers living in fear of both the Maoists and the security personnel.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/inviting-repression/article4753692.ece
27,5,2013,A prize that needs to get a life,"The Man Booker International Prize — awarded last week to American writer Lydia Davis known for the extreme brevity of her stories, some as short as a sentence — is now in its fifth edition. During this period it has gone to some of the biggest names in world literature, such as Philip Roth, Alice Munro, Chinua Achebe and Ismail Kadaré. Yet, it has struggled to carve out an independent, distinct identity for itself and is invariably confused with the more famous annual Man Booker Prize. Outside the literary world, few know it even exists. The media, which tends to follow every twist and turn around the Man Booker Prize, happily gives its “international” stablemate short shrift. Thanks to U.R. Ananthamurthy, who was in the running this year, the prize got more serious media attention in India than in Britain. The Times’ report was cheekily headed: “Lydia who? To cut a long story short, she’s won the Man Booker.” It then went on to say how the chairman of the judges “had not heard of many on the shortlist a few months ago and when the panel chose a winner there was uncertainty about how to describe her work.”
This identity crisis is not surprising, given the prize’s very fuzzy remit and the fact that it has to compete with a better-known award of the same name. It is often described as an example of a “vanity’” project which exists simply because its sponsors feel “good” about it regardless of its need or relevance. It was in 2005 that the Man Group, the British hedge fund behind the eponymous annual prize, decided to expand its literary “folio” by launching an international award to be given once in two years to recognise a writer’s lifetime achievements rather than a specific work. At the time, it seemed a good idea. There had been criticism that the annual prize was restricted to writers from the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and Ireland, leaving out a whole body of contemporary American and European literature. The Man Booker International Prize was aimed at filling that gap by extending it to any living author anywhere in the world who has “published fiction either originally in English or whose work is generally available in translation in the English language.” But in the process, the pendulum swung to the other extreme with novels, short stories, poetry and translations all thrown into the mix. And, with no specific judging criterion, unlike for the annual prize, works from profoundly different literary traditions got lumped together leaving judges as well as readers confused. If the International Booker is to make a mark in a field crowded with some very good literary prizes, it definitely needs a sharper focus.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-prize-that-needs-to-get-a-life/article4753693.ece
28,5,2013,Grave space,"Though welcome, the Central government’s decision to stop constructing samadhis along the Yamuna in Delhi and instead build a common facility to perform the last rites of departed leaders is unlikely to have any sobering effect on the memorial mania of political parties. The issue is not shortage of space as the government makes it out to be, but contestable commemorative practices that encroach on public spaces and impose memorials on helpless cities. Collective mourning and remembering by building structures and statuaries are valid cultural practices. However, one has to make a clear distinction between memorialising as an act of self-serving propaganda and the honouring of iconic persons who served to unify or inspire the people. Political parties cleverly manipulate this difference and legitimise their takeover of parks and waterfronts to build monuments for their leaders, many of whom have dubious standing, appeal and achievement. The Shiv Sena, for instance, after being denied permission by the Maharashtra government to build in Shivaji Park, wants to encroach on Mahalaxmi Racecourse to memorialise Bal Thackeray. It is trying hard to disguise its sinister demand as a call for creating public space, but this will not wash. The Congress and regional parties too are not free of this failing.
The Supreme Court, in January, severely criticised State governments for mindlessly allowing statues and unambiguously ordered that they should not permit construction of statues that would cause traffic problems. This should bring in some order to public areas. What is needed now is regulation of political memorials. In this context, there are a few lessons to learn from the City of Westminster’s policy for erecting statues and memorials. This London borough, which has 300 commemorative structures, faces a growing demand for building more. To handle this saturation, the city council advises groups to explore alternative practices such as putting up a plaque, planting trees or endowing a charity. When this does not work, it imposes a 10-year waiting period between the death of a person or occurrence of an event and a related commemoration. The reasoning is that this period would cool ‘partisan passions’ and ‘enable sober reflection’ about the need to commemorate. Apart from this, it insists on public consultation, aesthetic assessment of the proposed structure and upfront payment of the project and maintenance costs. The state may legally own public spaces, but parties in power cannot treat them as their personal fiefdom. While the government can allocate areas and funds for collective remembrance such as a memorial for Bhopal gas victims or the anti-colonial struggle, it should firmly stay away from building monuments to political leaders.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/grave-space/article4756946.ece
28,5,2013,Schemes to reshape,"A bewildering and endless variety of programmes with fancy names populate the annals of governance today. While the special focus that Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) thus bring to sectors that need extra attention has often proved to be an advantage, poor design and implementation with little other than fancy nomenclature and grand announcements to prop them up, have often proved to be a disadvantage. The ‘branding’ exercise has not always served the cause. Some of the schemes have been plagued by overlaps, duplication and bureaucratic mismanagement and negligence that impinge on efficiencies and lead to wastage. A Group of Ministers has now approved the restructuring of CSSs, merging some 170 of them into 79, in order to ensure better implementation and monitoring. At the end of the 11th Plan, in March 2012, there were 173 CSSs and Additional Central Assistance (ACA) schemes. Hopefully, as the matter comes up before the Cabinet again, competing, even conflicting, interests among different ministries would not come in the way of making the final push on this key issue — although the pruning will still not meet the 2011 recommendations of the B.K. Chaturvedi Committee to bring the number down to 59.
While the share of CSSs in gross budgetary allocations has gone up significantly over the last three Plans, the number of such schemes has come down. Yet, CSSs tend to pre-empt resources available to States, given that fund packages often get channelled directly for the programmes, sometimes without the tailored flexibility that is needed to optimise utilisation. In some instances, funds are transferred to district-level bodies, bypassing State governments. Understandably, several States have complained about the rationale and implementation of CSSs. The system of flexi-funds that has now been proposed, under which State governments can use 20 per cent (10 per cent in case of flagship schemes) of the budget allocated for CSSs, within the broader framework of given programmes, should address part of that problem. The GoM has favoured a system of transferring funds from the Centre to State consolidated funds, rather than directly to implementing agencies. It has also approved the setting up of State-specific guidelines for each CSS. Hopefully, the new and improved package will prove to be a more effective, flexible and efficient instrument to translate Plan objectives into actions. Meanwhile, there is a case to tighten monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, with each CSS being reviewed at least once in two years, with an eye on better outcomes and impact.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/schemes-to-reshape/article4756950.ece
4,6,2013,"Too little, too late","Those hoping Indian cricket would find a way to redeem itself in the wake of the spot-fixing and betting scandal can be forgiven for feeling let down by the uninspiring outcome of Sunday’s meeting of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. Everything from the secretive deliberations and backroom dealings to the cryptic announcement at the end assigning temporary charge of the Board’s working group to Jagmohan Dalmiya is proof that the sickness in the game’s administration goes well beyond the moral infirmities of one individual. By bringing back Mr. Dalmiya and, more significantly, by providing a face-saving way for N. Srinivasan to try and weather the present storm, the Board has sent out all the wrong signals. The emergency meeting, summoned to discuss the fate of Mr. Srinivasan — whose son-in-law, Gurunath Meiyappan, has been arrested by the Mumbai police for allegedly betting in the Indian Premier League — provided a rare opportunity for the BCCI to clean up its mess. Instead, it turned out to be a farcical exercise. None of the shocking events of the past 10 days made the slightest impact on a set of officials — including politicians — who unfailingly stood by each other to protect themselves. Lack of transparency and accountability had always been an integral part of the Board’s functioning but its credibility has been dented even more following Sunday’s meeting. Instead of being put through a cleansing operation, Indian cricket runs the risk of being shoved deeper in a muddle.
But even now, it may not be too late. If Mr. Dalmiya can use his short tenure at the helm of affairs to find redemption at many levels — he was dumped by the BCCI in 2006 for alleged financial irregularities — then cricket administration in India can still regain its lost ground. For that to happen, Mr. Dalmiya has to make public all the dealings of the Board, including the manner in which the three-member committee set up to probe the betting and spot-fixing allegations was constituted. If the two retired judges were handpicked by Mr. Srinivasan, fairness requires that the probe be entrusted to someone else. The public outrage over the mafia-like secrecy of the BCCI can only be addressed meaningfully when the ‘old boys club’ style of management is abandoned and transparency introduced. Apart from the faces presented by the IPL teams, nobody knows anything about where the money has come from — or even, where it goes. Neither the IPL franchise agreement with the Board, nor for that matter the BCCI constitution, is in the public domain. A body that has been given the right to field an “India” team should not be allowed to get away with such a scandalous lack of transparency and accountability.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/too-little-too-late/article4779004.ece
4,6,2013,Colombia’s chance at last,"The May 27 agreement between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) concludes a six-month peace process which started in Oslo and moved to Havana, and could end a conflict that started in 1964. The main issues, predictably, have to do with land rights and the exploitation of peasants in a country where one per cent of landowners hold 52 per cent of farms, only 22 per cent of potentially arable land is cultivated, and 6.5 million hectares have changed hands, been vacated, or stolen as a result of the violence. The deal is not, however, comprehensive; talks are to resume on June 11, and must address still unsolved problems, such as implementation. The government of President Juan Manuel Santos rejects Farc’s demand that some nine million hectares be declared autonomous zones, but is apparently prepared to target rural development programmes at the relevant areas. A more difficult issue involves Farc’s transformation into a political movement in the current system. Farc is rightly cautious about this; it attempted a similar move in the 1980s by forming the Patriotic Union party, but over 3,000 of its members, including two presidential candidates, were murdered.
Crucially, both sides now seem to accept that a military solution is impossible. Mr. Santos has diverged from some of his predecessors by acknowledging that Colombia is in a state of civil war; from 1999 to 2008 Farc and the National Liberation Army of Colombia controlled 35 per cent of the country’s territory, and Farc still holds the south-eastern forest and the plains at the foot of the Andes. Secondly, the recent agreement, although it has been criticised for not requiring enough concessions from Bogotá, enables Colombia to start healing some of its wounds; for example, about 30 per cent of Farc’s recruits are minors. As for Farc’s drug-based funding, the organisation has maintained tighter control over cocaine production than, for example, the Bush administration in Washington would accept, despite CIA reports that Farc was not a major source of drugs for the United States market. Farc has collaborated with the United Nations in replacing coca farming with sustainable food production, and can now start to draw world attention to the damage subsidised U.S. agricultural exports do to farmers in Latin America. In addition, Mr. Santos must continue to use help from regional states such as Venezuela, which has played a role openly acknowledged by the Colombian government’s chief negotiator, Humberto de la Calle, in making the talks a success; failure to use such assistance and good offices could result in a tragic waste of Colombia’s best opportunity for peace in decades.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/colombias-chance-at-last/article4779006.ece
5,6,2013,No place to hide,"The tag line for India’s much-acclaimed transparency law could well be: good for others, not for me. The Supreme Court loftily decreed the right to information to be a part of the fundamental right to free expression. It nonetheless resisted the application of the Right to Information Act, 2005, to itself, and went in appeal to a lower court against a decision in this regard by the Central Information Commission. The apex court has since relented somewhat and placed the assets of its judges in the public domain. It might be a harder battle to bring political parties to account judging by early reactions to Monday’s CIC order deeming them to be public authorities under the RTI Act. Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid, for one, was clear that the law could not be allowed to “run riot,” whatever that means. In the past, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has weighed in on the side of privacy in the RTI debate, arguing that the law in practice had become too intrusive. Significantly, the Association for Democratic Reforms which petitioned the CIC on bringing political parties under the RTI Act, has made the opposite case: that lack of scrutiny had led to parties being able to accumulate unexplained wealth running into hundreds of crores of rupees.
The ADR argued that political parties must be treated as public authorities because they receive substantial government support in the form of free air time on Doordarshan and All India Radio during elections, discounted rents for party offices and large income-tax exemptions. The organisation calculated that government subsidies for the two largest parties, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party, alone amounted to Rs. 255 crore. Despite the official largesse, political parties insisted that they were not public authorities and managed not to reveal the source for a large part of their incomes by showing them as small voluntary donations exempt from disclosure. The CIC accepted the petitioner’s contention, and went on to note that the “nature of duties performed by political parties points towards their public character.” There is a double irony here. The BJP, which has threatened to make repatriation of black money an election issue, refused to entertain ADR’s RTI application seeking details of its wealth and assets. The UPA birthed the RTI Act with much fanfare and the legislation holds pride of place in its list of achievements. Yet, thanks to the RTI being harnessed for unearthing scams, the government has found itself debunking a law that is its own creation. With the CIC’s ruling, the political class is bound to unite against a law that has been hugely empowering for the common person.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/No-place-to-hide/article12057815.ece
5,6,2013,Address the divergence,"The rationale behind the Union government’s decision to extend for four more years the >Integrated Action Plan for naxal-affected districts in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, is clear enough. So is its timing, coming as it does days after the Maoist rampage in Chhattisgarh. Out of an annual allocation of Rs. 1,000 crore, each of the 82 districts identified — up from the 60 that were previously covered — will get Rs. 5 crore annually. The remaining Rs. 590 crore will be distributed among the tribal and backward districts on the basis of population and area. Yet, a few basic problems with the IAP remain to be addressed. One is the decision to let the district administration solely handle implementation. Funds are placed at the disposal of a committee led by the district collector and consisting of the superintendent of police and the district forest officer. The disagreement between the ministries of Rural Development and Home Affairs on this issue is bound to affect performance and efficacy. Rural Development wants the funds to be channelled through local bodies and elected panchayat/gram sabha representatives, while Home believes the civil administration should hold the purse-strings as it would increase the government’s credibility in the districts.
It is obvious that local representation is essential to ensure popular participation and confidence, and for better accountability. There is also a need to streamline spending priorities. While currently most of the funds are diverted for the creation of physical infrastructure such as school buildings, anganwadi centres, rural roads, panchayat buildings, community halls and irrigation works, by all accounts matters that have an immediate resonance for the common person in the daily grind, such as healthcare, sanitation and water supply, seem to have been largely relegated. The Home Ministry’s stand seems to be that since the Maoists primarily target infrastructure facilities, the development of infrastructure could project a counterpoint. But this sounds less than convincing compared to the argument for spending that touches lives in a more tangible manner. Besides, the tendency to utilise funds in relatively stable areas and stay clear of sensitive spots does not help — notwithstanding claims of the ‘demonstration effect’ of such spending in peripheral areas. This intra-governmental divergence is not a healthy sign. It should be addressed at the earliest to ensure that the well-meaning scheme helps accelerate development to counter a deadly menace.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Address-the-divergence/article12057813.ece
6,6,2013,Reading the results,"Narendra Modi has reaped a bumper harvest in the form of two sets of stunning by-election verdicts ahead of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s national executive meeting in Goa. The BJP did not just make a clean sweep of the six seats for which by-polls were held in Gujarat (two for the Lok Sabha, four for the Assembly), it wrested them all from the Congress. In the second case, there was no BJP triumph; if anything, ally Janata Dal (United) failed to wrest the Maharajganj Lok Sabha seat in Bihar from the Rashtriya Janata Dal. Yet this defeat compels attention because in a situation of continuing conflict between Nitish Kumar and Mr. Modi, any reversal for Mr. Kumar unavoidably gets projected as a victory for the Gujarat Chief Minister. What happens next is fairly predictable. Mr. Modi will go to the BJP’s forthcoming conclave in Goa as a bigger hero — if such a thing is possible given that party cadres already worship him. This in turn will make it difficult for the national executive to entirely avoid a discussion on Mr. Modi’s future. Even if the BJP leadership puts off a final decision, which in any case is the jurisdiction of the party’s Parliamentary Board, one thing is for certain. The more vocal voices in the BJP will pitch strongly for Mr. Modi, asking that he be declared the face of 2014, and possibly urge the leadership to even go ahead and dump the JD(U).
But are by-elections a reliable indicator of the voter mood in the general election? For all the seeming magnificence of the Gujarat results, they were neither unexpected nor do they foretell a country-wide 2014 story. By-elections held in close proximity to a Lok Sabha or Assembly election tend to follow the same pattern. Secondly, two of the six seats in Gujarat were captured by defectors from the Congress with their own considerable votes. The Porbandar Lok Sabha seat was won by Vitthal Radadia who held it as a Congress MP until December 2012 when he opted to contest the Assembly election. Mr. Modi might not want to remember that just last year, Mr. Radadia was caught on camera pointing a gun at a toll booth attendant. The loss of Maharajganj is admittedly a setback for Mr. Kumar who had fielded a minister on the seat. However, the victor, the RJD’s Prabhunath Singh, was with the JD(U) until 2010 and had won it twice before on the JD(U) ticket. That by-elections do not lend themselves to easy generalisations is also evident from the victories registered by the Trinamool Congress, the Samajwadi Party and the Congress in three other contests held in West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra respectively. Of course, when politicians, and analysts, have a larger agenda, they will want to miss these nuances.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/reading-the-results/article4785196.ece
6,6,2013,A river ran through it,"From finding a trail of evidence supporting the presence of water on Mars a few billion years ago, Curiosity’s discovery of subrounded or rounded pebbles provides definitive proof that the red planet once had a river. According to a May 31 paper in Science, multiple exposures of a sedimentary rock (conglomerate) containing densely-packed rounded pebbles, varying in size from 2 mm to 40 mm in diameter, are particularly significant as they provide indisputable evidence of a palaeo-river. While other discoveries such as water-bearing minerals in veins at the Yellowknife Bay area in Gale crater and smectite clay in John Klein rock samples are in themselves noteworthy, they do not reveal if the water body was moving. In fact, water-bearing minerals in veins do not tell us about surface water flow. On the other hand, the very presence of big, rounded pebbles that lie overlapping along with coarse sand in the rock tell a completely different and definitive tale of Mars’s palaeo-environment. For one, the pebbles not only prove the presence of water but also shed light on the nature and quantum of moving water. Since only water transportation can abrade pebbles as big as 40 mm, and based on estimates for the riverbed’s gradient at the site of discovery, scientists have been able to postulate several characteristics about the river. First, it should have flowed at a velocity of up to 0.75 metres per second, the minimum force required to move pebbles of that size. Second, in order to initiate motion, the river should have had a flow depth of less than 0.90 m. Hence, the amount of water flowing in the river was indeed considerable. Finally, the fact that the pebbles have been abraded to produce subrounded or rounded edges despite having varying characteristics in terms of composition and shape strongly suggest that the river flowed for several kilometres.
In all, the mere presence of rounded pebbles indicates that Mars’s atmospheric conditions at some point in the past were so very different from today that they permitted liquid water to flow on the surface. In geology, the possibility of discovering prized fossils and pieces of evidence such as this lies in careful selection of the study area. In the present case, the final landing site was decided based on the presence of Mount Sharp, a layered mound within the Gale crater and its proximity to the alluvial fan, the Peace Vallis fan. The pebble discovery confirms the March 12 find of a non-acidic, fresh-water environment based on the finding of smectite clay from a John Klein rock specimen drilled by the rover. Discovering the Holy Grail of space science — a planet capable of supporting life in the past — is no longer a distant dream.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-river-ran-through-it/article4785198.ece
7,6,2013,Cart before the horse,"As the cricket spot-fixing and betting scandal sucks in players, umpires, and team owners, along with bookies, fixers, businessmen and underworld dons, investigators can be forgiven for exaggerating the nature of the crimes and the specific roles of the offenders. But even allowing for overenthusiastic excesses, the Delhi Police have gone too far in slapping stringent provisions of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act on the Rajasthan Royals players S. Sreesanth, Ajit Chandila and Ankeet Chavan. The move suffers from several legal infirmities, and could do more harm than good to the still-expanding case against the players. Although MCOCA was extended to Delhi by an executive order of 2002 under the Union Territories (Laws) Act, 1950, its use in the present scenario is open to serious legal challenge. Delhi is no longer a Union Territory. Such delegation of power by the legislature to the executive was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1951 with strict limitations and under the special circumstance of Delhi not having a legislature of its own. On a presidential reference on a section of the Delhi Laws Act, 1912, that allowed the provincial government to extend to Delhi any enactment in force in any part of India, the Supreme Court saw such delegation as historically necessary but not as ideal. With Delhi having elected its first State Assembly in 1993, questions remain on the applicability of a Maharashtra law for a crime being investigated in Delhi. Even otherwise, to equate the corruption of cricketers with the organised crime and terror network of underworld dons Dawood Ibrahim and Chota Shakeel is stretching the facts a little too much.
True, given the enormity of the scandal, it seems unjust to merely charge the players with cheating the public who pay to watch a match. The players surely betrayed the implicit trust that millions of cricket fans placed in them. But the Delhi Police should not go after imaginary ghosts. The spot-fixing scandal seems to involve an ever-widening network of people associated at various levels of the game. It is one thing to say, the cricketers were overcome by greed and sought illegal gratification for underperforming or, to be more exact, performing to order. But to charge them with knowingly abetting the operations of an international organised crime syndicate, and thus attracting the provisions of MCOCA, is to mistake a pawn for the grandmaster. To trace the links from the players to the heads of the betting and fixing syndicate is important, but to slap serious charges without establishing the money trail is akin to putting the cart before the horse. Especially when those charges might not stand in a court of law.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/cart-before-the-horse/article4788452.ece
7,6,2013,Inadequate overhaul,"The longstanding demand to ramp up conservation efforts and increase the number of protected monuments has compelled the Archaeological Survey of India to revise its century-old national conservation policy. Though late in coming, the recently published improvised version is a welcome initiative. However, the question is whether the draft policy will help overhaul conservation efforts. The answer is no. The first archaeological policy, drafted in 1915, was more of a report on the state of archaeology than a comprehensive guideline. Coming as it did after five decades of extensive excavation and discovery of new sites, the policy focused on consolidation and conservation. The primary approach, better articulated in a manual compiled in 1923, defined monuments narrowly, protected structures in isolation and ignored craft traditions. This led to alienated local communities and inadequate conservation measures. Realising these shortcomings, the ASI has now tried to define monuments more inclusively, acknowledging different approaches and making provision for community participation. It has also paid attention to visitor amenities and accessibility requirements of differently abled persons. However, the policy falls short on many counts.
A large number of historic structures are still in use, and they require a sensitive and accommodative approach. The draft policy insufficiently addresses this issue, and disappointingly suggests that structures declared as monuments “transcend their original function” and should be conserved as symbols of past. This seems to imply that ‘living’ monuments would be treated as any other historic structure — a clear recipe for confusion and conflict with local communities. The draft policy also does not adequately recognise the ‘place’ value of heritage structures. As a result, it offers no innovative ideas to protect the setting and enhance monument experience. The ASI continues to rely on the limited provision of regulatory zones, which have not delivered desired results so far. Though the policy has kind words for building artisans and their skills, it falls short of acknowledging them as equal experts. This raises doubts about the ASI’s willingness to incorporate traditional methods of conservation. Techniques alone do not guarantee effective protection. The case of the missing monuments in Delhi makes it clear that institutional infrastructure and management plans are equally important. The new draft is also strangely silent on the prevalent institutional inadequacy. The ASI must not hastily finalise its conservation policy. Based on genuine public consultation, it must comprehensively review the draft.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/inadequate-overhaul/article4788454.ece
8,6,2013,Slip slidin’ away,"Though not occurring for the first time, the rupee’s sudden and sharp depreciation in relation to the dollar has caused all round concern. A major reason has been the sheer unpredictability of the currency movements at this juncture. Not long ago, the problem seemed to be centred on rupee appreciation. There were many who had advocated Reserve Bank of India intervention to preserve export competitiveness. The fact that in the January-March quarter, India’s export performance was slightly better than in the previous quarters lent support to that view. Yet, without any significant change in external demand — Europe remains in the doldrums while the recovery in Japan and the U.S. is uneven and beset with many problems — India’s external economy faces a great deal of uncertainty. The sharp decline in the rupee’s external value is one of the important manifestations of this. Since May the rupee has fallen by 5.3 per cent. It fell below 57 to the dollar on Thursday and continued its slump Friday. It is small consolation that the currencies of almost all emerging market countries have declined. The argument that it is not the rupee’s weakness so much as the dollar’s strength that is driving down the home currency does not really help India’s currency managers.
The dollar appears to have gained on the belief that the Federal Reserve will end its controversial quantitative easing programme. Once that happens, the large capital flows that have come to India and other emerging markets will flow back to the U.S. to meet investment needs there, dangerously exposing India’s vulnerabilities in its balance of payments. The unacceptably large current account deficit — estimated at around $100 billion — crimps exchange rate management in several ways. It restricts the scope of RBI intervention, which in any case cannot count indefinitely on previously accumulated external reserves for its ammunition. In fact, reserves now estimated at around $292 billion have come under stress recently. When compared to India’s mounting external liabilities — in the region of $300 billion and growing — the level of reserves no longer gives the cushion it used to. It goes without saying that a depreciating rupee makes imports costlier. The benefit of the likely fall in global oil prices will be negated. Nor has the seemingly insatiable appetite for gold dimmed despite the administrative and tariff measures adopted recently. There is a danger of domestic price levels flaring up again in the wake of the rupee’s depreciation. Ironically, it is the slowdown in GDP growth that has become India’s last line of defence against imported inflation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/slip-slidin-away/article4792136.ece
8,6,2013,No stopping her now,"Well before the non-uniformed generals ruling Myanmar can start planning for the 2015 presidential election, Nobel laureate and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has announced her intention to contest. “I want to run for President, and I am quite frank about it,” she told the Asian edition of the World Economic Forum held at Naypyitaw on Thursday. Obviously, Daw Suu Kyi had planned the announcement for the first such gathering of business and political leaders from around the world to be held in Myanmar since the recent thaw. Of course, Daw Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy know full well that the present Constitution specifically disqualifies her from contesting an election for the post of president. Article 59(f) says any candidate who is married to a foreign citizen or has children who are foreign citizens is barred from becoming president or vice-president of Myanmar. Daw Suu Kyi’s husband, Michael Aris, who died in 1999, was a British citizen, as are her two children. By declaring her intent despite this prohibition, she has raised the expectations of her supporters and also put the country’s military rulers on the defensive.
The NLD won the 2012 parliamentary by-elections decisively but can do little to drive the process of political change in parliament because 312 of the 440 seats in the Pyithu Hluttaw, or House of Representatives, are held by the pro-military Union Solidarity and Development Party and other military nominees. Two years ago, Thein Sein, the Senior General who ruled Myanmar, hung up his uniform and became President. If Daw Suu Kyi wants to be president, the NLD and the various ethnic groups represented in parliament will have to work towards amending the rigid constitution. But unless a section of the military party is willing to work for a political settlement and reconciliation, such a major challenge cannot be met. This is where Myanmar’s neighbours, including India, need to play a constructive role. By going public with her plan at the World Economic Forum and stating that she wishes to be “honest to my people,” Daw Suu Kyi has prepared the military and the wider world for the changes and challenges that lie ahead. Now that the international community has become fully engaged with the government in Myanmar — President Thein Sein recently visited Washington and was welcomed by Barack Obama in the White House — the work can begin to effect a smooth and negotiated transition to real civilian rule. The arbitrary exclusion of Daw Suu Kyi from the 2015 presidential contest does the Myanmar military no credit. It has already gone further than anyone had imagined in opening up the system to change. It mustn’t stop half-way now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-stopping-her-now/article4792137.ece
10,6,2013,Manufactured consent,"In the end, Narendra Modi’s promotion to campaign committee chief of the Bharatiya Janata Party happened not by consensus or by consultation but by diktat, with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh virtually cracking the whip on the dissenters. Yet through the three days of the BJP’s national executive meet in Goa, one man stood his ground, defying multiple attempts to coax and cajole him out of his reluctance. Indeed, veteran Lal Krishna Advani turned out to be as much in the limelight for resisting Mr. Modi’s elevation as Mr. Modi himself for getting his coveted prize. The BJP tried hard to sell the story that Mr. Advani had been kept away from Goa by his poor health, the first time he had missed an important party meet in three decades. But the latter made sure the world knew he was hale and hearty by blogging on a film with pointed references to the Mahabharata and Bhishma Pitamaha. The situation bristles with irony, starting with the fact that a man with such a presumed fan following as Mr. Modi could not find universal acceptance in his own party. And who should be the dissident-in-chief but Mr. Advani, the Gujarat Chief Minister’s former mentor who once intervened to save his job in the aftermath of the 2002 anti-Muslim violence.
Equally paradoxically, Mr. Modi finds himself pitchforked to the national stage courtesy the RSS, which self-proclaimedly abhors the personality cult so evident in the Modi phenomenon. If despite this history of antagonism, the BJP’s spiritual mentor has handed over the election management charge to Mr. Modi, it is obviously in response to the growing clamour from the BJP rank and file. But the decision also shows the absence of real democracy in a party controlled by the RSS. What next, now that Mr. Modi has won, overriding objections from senior leaders, among them Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj? That Mr. Modi will electrify his followers on Twitter is a given. And yet, it is over-the-top to equate his new, enlarged brief to a ‘coronation’ or to see him as the BJP’s prime-ministerial nominee. Mr. Modi cannot be the BJP’s Prime Minister-in-waiting unless the party has decided to disband the National Democratic Alliance, which is surely not the case. NDA partners have chosen to treat Mr. Modi’s elevation as an internal BJP matter, clarifying that they would need to be on board for deciding who will run for Prime Minister. Pramod Mahajan and Arun Jaitley headed the BJP’s campaign committee in 2004 and 2009 respectively without the automatic assumption that either would be Prime Minister. NaMo’s frenzied fan clubs will do well to understand that their hero has some way to go before he becomes the face of 2014.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/manufactured-consent/article4797862.ece
10,6,2013,Under cover of darkness,"In response to revelations that the >National Security Agency has been extensively snooping on the telephone and internet communications of millions of Americans and foreigners, the Obama administration has said this covert monitoring under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was lawful and fully authorised by the U.S. Congress. This is cold comfort, given the shadowy nature of the FISA Court and the fact that this surveillance effort was launched with the secret cooperation of major telecom operators such as Verizon, nine large Internet companies, and even financial and credit card corporations. Leaked NSA reports specifically allude to the agency’s >PRISM programme and the Boundless Informant tool used to harvest private user data of an eye-watering magnitude, close to 97 billion pieces of intelligence from computer networks worldwide in March 2013 alone. ‘Strategic partner’ India was the fifth-largest source of such data. The NSA may not have broken U.S. statute, as per official claims, but its monitoring of Indian communications traffic has certainly violated India’s laws, not to speak of its trust.
The official dissembling on these snooping programmes is wrong on two fundamental points. First, the claim made by President Barack Obama that the NSA only captured communications “meta-data” and that >“nobody is listening to your telephone calls” is spurious, even misleading. The gathering of meta-data allows enormous intrusion into the private lives of law-abiding citizens. Second, the privacy policies of social media behemoths such as Facebook, Google and YouTube are meaningless given PRISM’s explicit reliance on their facilitating government access to user data. The clever wording of company denials that they provided “direct access” and “backdoor” entry to the government obfuscates the likelihood that they provided the NSA with something similar to an Application Programming Interface. Turning his back on the campaign promises he made in 2008, Mr. Obama has systematically exploited ‘counterterrorism’ measures instituted by his predecessor after 9/11 and covertly expanded their application on an unprecedented scale. It is replete with irony that his administration is vigorously prosecuting conscientious leakers such as Bradley Manning or media groups like the Associated Press, even as it taps the phone and internet records of millions of people around the world. Lawyers have now warned some of the journalists responsible for the latest exposés — including Glenn Greenwald and Guardian writers — that they are likely to be investigated.

17,6,2013,Writing on the wall,"Seventeen years ago, the Janata Dal (United)’s forerunner, the socialist Samata Party, stepped out of its ideological comfort zone to extend support to the Bharatiya Janata Party, thereby bringing the latter into the political mainstream. Today, that relationship has ended, not on a point of principle, though that is the JD(U)’s claimed reason, but because of one individual: Narendra Modi. There cannot be a more eloquent statement on the Gujarat Chief Minister’s disquieting effect than the fact that the JD(U) has chosen an uncertain future in Bihar, and by implication nationally, over continuing in the National Democratic Alliance under Mr. Modi’s possible leadership. Admittedly, the BJP has so far not named Mr. Modi its prime ministerial candidate, a point editorially underscored by Organiser, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s mouthpiece. The troubling aspect of the Sangh’s open orchestration of the BJP’s internal matters aside, the intervention came at a time when the alliance was beyond rescue. Besides, the Sangh was being disingenuous in rebuking the JD(U) for presuming Mr. Modi would run for Prime Minister, at the same time declaring him the fittest to fill the slot.
The JD(U) initially dismissed Mr. Modi’s elevation to the BJP’s campaign committee chief as an internal party affair. However, Mr. Modi’s cheerleaders and the party itself behaved as if he was already in the role of presumptive prime ministerial nominee. Lal Krishna Advani’s resignation came as confirmation for Nitish Kumar that what he feared would happen. Dramatic as the rupture is, it raises some unavoidable questions. Mr. Kumar did not just befriend the BJP when it was friendless, he stuck by the party through the 2002 anti-Muslim violence and even later when a near exodus reduced the alliance to a rump. The explanation for this lies in part in the electoral compatibility of the BJP and the JD(U), which together won two spectacular State elections. Secondly, Mr. Kumar dominated the BJP in Bihar, ensuring that his own secular appeal prevailed over his partner’s Hindutva image. The Bihar Chief Minister understood, and correctly too, that for Hindi heartland minorities there could be no negotiation on Mr. Modi’s unacceptability. Consequently, Mr. Modi became a metaphor for divisive, sectarian politics in a State ruled by the JD((U) and the BJP. There was no way Mr. Kumar could have continued this balancing act with Mr. Modi in a pivotal position in the NDA. The fracturing of the NDA immediately on his promotion returns the BJP to that point in history when it was proud of its ‘splendid isolation’. Unfortunately for the party, the message might not go down well with its potential allies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/writing-on-the-wall/article4820556.ece
17,6,2013,Iran’s golden moment,"The vibrant elections that have unexpectedly thrown up Hassan Rouhani — a moderate cleric — as Iran’s next President have once again exposed those quick to label Iranian democracy a sham. Mr. Rouhani’s victory following an electoral landslide, brushing aside his supposedly favoured conservative rivals, has demonstrated that the expression of popular will and its capacity to breathe fresh life into the system is far from extinguished. These elections are also important for another reason: they impart a sense of closure by healing the wounds left behind by the 2009 presidential elections, which had triggered unprecedented street protests after many Iranians suspected those polls had been rigged to give Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a second term. Four years on, the Islamic Republic appears more politically unified and ready to engage with the rest of the world.
Mr. Rouhani’s victory is the product of the complex, competitive dynamics that the ‘managed’ pluralism of the Iranian political system sometimes generates. The Guardian Council overseeing the elections disqualified Mr. Ahmadinejad’s nominee, Esfandiar Mashaei, as well as the former President, Ali Akbar Rafsanjani. While Mashaei supporters had no one place to turn to, the latter’s centrist supporters promptly joined the reformists in rallying behind Mr. Rouhani as their sole candidate. Mr. Rafsanjani and another former President, Mohammad Khatami, deserve special applause for their nimble footwork in forming this unprecedented coalition which, in the end, unlocked a surge of youthful energy that energised the polls. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s appeal to the people to come out and vote irrespective of their electoral choice seems to have played a significant part in generating voter participation on an astounding scale. Above all, the Iranian people deserve credit for not allowing their hopes to extinguish and keeping faith in the capacity of their political class to carry out a critically important course correction. Mr. Rouhani’s emergence as President offers a unique opportunity for the establishment of a mutually beneficial relationship between Iran and the West, especially the United States. The U.S. has to understand that the moderates in Iran can consolidate themselves only if they deliver on the economy — a question that is inextricably linked to the lifting of sanctions and progress on the nuclear table. The mantra of regime change will have to be replaced by a doctrine of pervasive engagement if meaningful progress is to be achieved. For India, Mr. Rohani’s rise rekindles hopes of revival of the Khatami era, when the relationship between the two countries was at its peak.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/irans-golden-moment/article4820559.ece
18,6,2013,Monetary policy and rupee volatility,"The Reserve Bank of India in its mid-quarter monetary policy review on Monday effected no changes in either the repo rate or the Cash Reserve Ratio. This was entirely anticipated by the market participants. The sharp rupee depreciation in relation to the dollar over the past one month has loomed large in the RBI’s calculations. Traditional policy dilemmas relating to growth and inflation do exist but they acquire a new edge in the light of the rupee’s fall. Between April 1 and June 14 the rupee declined by 5.8 per cent. It fell by 6.6 per cent between May 22 and June 11 and is threatening to race downwards towards new lows. What is particularly worrying is that the rupee’s aggravated decline has been caused by a sell-off by foreign institutional investors who were reacting to as yet unconfirmed news of a possible tapering off of quantitative easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve. At a very basic level, this has exposed the serious vulnerabilities of India’s balance of payments, especially in the context of a persistently high current account deficit. Even the most optimistic predictions do not place the CAD significantly below 5 per cent of GDP at the end of March 2013. Adding to the government’s woes, the trade deficit is expected to remain high in the foreseeable future. Higher tariffs and administrative measures to curtail its demand have not significantly reduced gold imports.
Fortunately, there has been some good news on the inflation front. Having eased for three months in a row, headline WPI inflation is down to 4.7 per cent in May and is considerably below the 7.4 per cent average of 2012-13. All constituent categories, with the major exception of food, have moderated. While the closely watched non-food manufactured inflation too has ebbed, the inflation outlook going forward is by no means benign. The rupee depreciation is a major reason: dearer dollars mean higher prices for imported fuel and edible oil. Other factors dampening the outlook are possible revisions in administered prices, including minimum support prices of various commodities. Retail inflation remains high at 9.3 per cent in May. In the RBI’s view “it is only a durable receding of inflation that will open the space for monetary policy to address growth risks.” Therefore, despite the obvious evidence of a slowdown that would normally invite supportive measures, it believes prudence lies in pausing and not continuing with the monetary easing that appeared to have taken hold over the past few policy statements. Framed in the shadow of the rupee’s sharp depreciation, the mid-quarter monetary policy review is a dissertation that transcends more conventional arguments for or against monetary measures.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/monetary-policy-and-rupee-volatility/article4823915.ece
18,6,2013,Violence in disguise,"Where coercion fails, persuasion might succeed. But social groups and community leaders often use a combination of the two, a kind of coercive persuasion, to ensure that individual members do not violate social mores while making life choices such as those relating to work and marriage. Recently, rural Tamil Nadu was witness to a case of a woman deserting her husband to return to her familial home, after her marriage triggered violence between her caste Hindu community and her husband’s Dalit community. What should have been a simple choice for two individuals to make was turned into a raging casteist campaign with leaders of the Pattali Makkal Katchi, a caste-based party, warning women of the Vanniyar community not to be “taken in” by Dalit men wearing “jeans, T-shirts and fancy glasses”. Even while informing the court she wanted to live with her mother, and not her husband, the young woman made it known this was not because she loved her husband less, but because she was shocked by the violence her marriage had triggered. She seemed prepared to sacrifice her love for what she must have seen as a greater social good: peace between the two communities, and quiet for her family.
The case is another reminder of the reality of caste in rural India, where the law and the law enforcers are no protection against the writ and the might of village elders and community heads. Across the country, old men who owe their position to feudal custom and traditional authority, and who therefore believe they are above the law of the land, constitute kangaroo courts (known as katta panchayats in Tamil Nadu or khap panchayats in parts of north India), which not only order social boycott or expulsion from the village, but also use coercion and force to enforce their diktats. Marriages outside the caste are frowned upon, and the whole family faces ostracism. This is especially so when it is the woman who belongs to a caste higher in the social hierarchy. Feudal values of honour and betrayal enter the equations of such marriages. Worryingly, newer forms of representative authority, especially politicians and parties with a casteist agenda, are seeking to ally with these extra-legal entities. Their attempt seems to be to accentuate existing social divisions and mobilise support through caste polarisation. Unfortunately, the civil administration in Tamil Nadu appears incapable of dealing with these katta panchayats. Unless the government takes a serious view of the legal transgressions of such bodies, instead of condoning or ignoring them, rural India will continue to be witness to tragedies similar to the one that unfolded in Tamil Nadu.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/violence-in-disguise/article4823916.ece
19,6,2013,Government in party mode,"This was no time for overhauling, but even if it were to have been only tinkering, a lot more could have been done with much better results. The general election is less than a year away, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh cannot be faulted for having focused on keeping things going while undertaking his latest cabinet shuffle. Even so, this was surely an opportunity to have infused some life and purpose into the government at the fag-end of its term. But, instead of taking in the big picture, Dr. Singh concentrated on the details in a few States. Actually, the shuffle appears intended to keep some of the party bigwigs in key States happy, and not to improve the functioning of the government. Of course, it is but natural that political as well as administrative calculations go into any change in the Council of Ministers. However, the latest additions to the Cabinet and reallocation of portfolios are mainly directed at boosting the chances of the Congress in Andhra Pradesh, which delivered to the Congress 33 of its 42 seats, and Rajasthan, which gave the party 20 of its 25 seats in 2009. For the Congress, any significant drop in the tally from these two States would seriously hurt its chances of returning to power at the Centre. Karnataka, with 28 seats, is one of the few States where the Congress can hope to improve upon its performance in 2009. Whether Mallikarjun Kharge was rewarded for bowing out of the race for the Chief Minister’s gaddi in Karnataka last month without too much of a murmur, or for improving the party’s chances in the Lok Sabha election next year, the decision was just as political. Besides Mr. Kharge, the other beneficiary from Karnataka was Oscar Fernandes, who moved from an organisational post back to the Cabinet.
When the future is seen as less than a year away, the older members of the party will manage to elbow their way in. There was no stamp of Rahul Gandhi on the shuffle. But after his elevation as the party’s vice-president, Mr. Gandhi must have been keener on building up the organisational strengths of the Congress than on improving the functioning of the government. While its principal rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party, is trying to make the next election all about Narendra Modi, the Congress appears intent on micro-managing the outcomes at the level of each State. Indeed, while the BJP seems ready to even forsake its allies in its quest to make a national hero of Mr. Modi, the Congress, less ambitiously, is looking for new friends and regional-level accretions to its vote share. But smart politics is also about good governance. In the final stretch, the Congress cannot afford to let Dr. Singh and his team run out of steam.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/government-in-party-mode/article4827438.ece
19,6,2013,"Law, sex and dicta","It is not rare in the Indian judicial oeuvre to see sound justice being mixed up with irrelevant obiter dicta, for some of the judges in our superior judiciary do tend to pontificate and sermonise when required only to reason, or seek refuge in social mores when law, precedent or practice is available to fall back upon. However, even with some allowance for superfluous observation, the Madras High Court’s view that pre-marital sex between an unmarried man and woman, otherwise unencumbered by any third party interest, amounts to marriage is truly outrageous. The remarks of Justice C.S. Karnan cannot be ignored as mere obiter dicta, as much of what he says is in some way related to his ultimate decision — allowing monthly maintenance to a woman sought to be disowned by a man with whom she had lived and begotten two children. Physical consummation between a man above 21 and a woman above 18, arising out of “sexual cravings” would be considered a “valid marriage” and they become “husband and wife”, he argues. Also, he adds a strange observation that when a couple seek to separate after being in a sexual relationship, the ‘husband’ cannot marry anyone without getting a divorce from the ‘wife’.
None would disagree with the judge for placing co-habitation above customary or religious rites when it comes to assessing the status of a relationship. Or for concluding that there was enough in the man’s conduct to say that he can no more disavow his relationship. It may even be seen as progressive that the Court takes note of the essence of a relationship — which resulted in sustained co-habitation and the birth of children — rather than its technical or legal status in granting maintenance. Yet, the problem with Mr. Justice Karnan’s assertions is two-fold: they seek to incorporate a highly personalised view of sexual behaviour into the concept of marriage, a concept that is based on law and practice and not on social or personal opinion. Also, marriage involves specific rights and responsibilities and these cannot be lightly conferred based on mere sexual behaviour. Such an approach limits the legal notion of marriage to just sexual union; and assumes, as it were, that any sex ought to be marital to emancipate it from its baser connotation. Secondly, none of what the judge has said has any basis in law, either modern and codified or customary. Nor is it based on any precedent, although a Supreme Court verdict in 2010 was available for support: the Court had then specifically recognised a live-in relationship as one akin to a marriage in the context of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/law-sex-and-dicta/article4827442.ece
20,6,2013,Clash of ideas,"With a near majority in the Bihar legislature, there was never any doubt that Nitish Kumar would sail through the confidence vote post the Janata Dal (United)’s split with the Bharatiya Janata Party. The Congress chose to back the Chief Minister, obviously with two considerations in mind. To keep alive the possibility of a future alliance with the JD (U) in Bihar and to send a wider message to the ‘secular’ polity ahead of the 2014 general election. Mr. Kumar, though, was on a different orbit. In a reasoned speech that deliberately transcended the secular-communal debate, he pitched into Narendra Modi, accusing him of envisioning a model of India that conflicted with the egalitarian, inclusive spirit of the Constitution. The picture he painted of the Gujarat Chief Minister was of a man driven by corporate interests, focused on the well-being of the already well-to-do. Mr. Kumar said while Gujarat had always been an economic and corporate success, Bihar had done the impossible in lifting the poorest of the poor from poverty. The theme of Mr. Kumar’s speech was that he was not in a personality clash with Mr. Modi but was fighting him for the survival of India.
The Bihar Chief Minister has played his cards well. He would have stepped into a quagmire had he stuck to the usual rhetoric about communalism and secularism. Indeed, given that the BJP had pressed into circulation a CD containing Mr. Kumar’s 2003 praise of his Gujarat counterpart, he had to take the discourse to loftier heights. But in challenging Mr. Modi so vocally and fearlessly, he has also set the stage for a national debate on what constitutes the “idea of India” (Mr. Kumar’s own words) and whether the Modi phenomenon needs to be viewed through the larger prism of social welfare and justice rather than only in terms of communalism and secularism. Politically, the break-up is a gamble for the JD(U). The party and the BJP made a good electoral fit. However, the BJP might have presumed too much in claiming that with Mr. Modi in command, it will sweep Bihar on its own. In the 2010 Assembly election, the BJP did perform spectacularly, winning 91 of 102 contested seats. However, it achieved this on a minuscule vote share gain of 0.84 percentage points as compared to 2005. Mr. Kumar has his job cut out. His bravura performance was aimed at Muslims as much as the caste coalition of most backwards he has put together. An alliance with the Congress will likely consolidate this constituency but in terms of votes the Congress is not a good substitute for the BJP. Whether a larger swathe of Bihar will buy into Mr. Kumar’s vision of India remains to be seen.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/clash-of-ideas/article4830976.ece
20,6,2013,Process without promise,"There is not much to celebrate in the Taliban’s announcement finally that it is prepared to hold talks with the Afghan government, and plenty to be wary about. The announcement came with the opening of a Taliban office in the Qatar capital Doha, which will, at least initially, host the talks. There is no clarity yet on the process, but it will most likely involve direct engagement between the Taliban and the United States before the group talks to the High Peace Council, the negotiating body set up by the Karzai government. What these talks will be about, however, is a question to which there are no clear or optimistic answers. The U.S. and President Hamid Karzai seem to be hoping that the Taliban will accept the country’s new Constitution, and a political role in accordance with it. But the Taliban are signalling something entirely different. The Doha office, for instance, is audaciously named the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, recalling their rule over the country between 1996 and 2001. They were not reticent in declaring that their Qatari base would help them “improve […] relations with countries around the world through understanding and talks”. The name has already cast a shadow on the process, angering President Karzai, who has consequently ‘suspended’ negotiations with the U.S. for a long-term security pact after coalition troops leave in 2014, accusing the Americans of playing a double game with him. Given his limited choices and the inevitability of talking to the Taliban, it is difficult to say how much of his outrage is real and how much smoke and mirrors. Certainly, nothing was unreal about the Taliban attack on a U.S. convoy outside Bagram that killed four soldiers, just hours after its public relations exercise in the Gulf city. Never has a peace process held so little promise.
The only sliver of hope that the Taliban have offered the U.S is the declaration that they “would not allow anyone to threaten the security of other countries from the soil of Afghanistan”, which is being read as a sign of its readiness to jettison Al Qaeda. Even so, the road ahead for this “reconciliation” process is a minefield. In the immediate term, the process could turn on U.S. willingness to release Taliban prisoners from Guantanamo, a sticking point on which the process collapsed in 2011. Pakistan’s role — especially with Nawaz Sharif, an old friend of the Taliban, now in power — will also be crucial to how the process unfolds. New Delhi, which has no part in the process, has remained a silent observer. But if India wants its concerns to be taken into account by those who are driving this process, the time to speak up is now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/process-without-promise/article4830980.ece
21,6,2013,A Himalayan tragedy,"Excessive rainfall provides only a partial explanation for why the ‘abode of the Gods’ — the Himalayan hill States of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh — has been battered beyond measure in recent days. For man’s excesses and follies have also been a factor in the destruction that nature has wrought. Whole villages, stretches of roads and communication links have been effaced. Thousands, including those from other parts of the country who were undertaking pilgrimages to religiously significant temples in the region, remain stranded. It is evident that the problem of poor soil stability on the steep slopes in this fragile region has been compounded by man-made factors like indiscriminate deforestation and mindless construction. Hundreds of buildings along the banks of the Alaknanda and the Bhagirathi have been swept away in Rudraprayag district alone. Downstream, the Ganga, Yamuna and other rivers have reached levels not seen in years, posing difficulties even in Delhi. This tragedy truly has the makings of a national calamity.
A mighty task of evacuation, relief and reconstruction lies ahead. The longer term lessons are many. Towns and villages in such terrain ought to be better planned. There should be a comprehensive renewal and relook at construction techniques and methods employed. Better systems of forecasting and dissemination of weather-related information are also essential. Over the past weekend, the India Meteorological Department did issue routine warnings about the possibility of heavy to very heavy rains, but these were not sufficiently stern, considering the uncharacteristically high precipitation levels that were recorded since. It is also unclear if the warnings were acted upon with alacrity and disseminated promptly by the State authorities. Crucially, a 2011 notification to declare as eco-sensitive a zone extending to a distance of 130 km from Gomukh where the Alaknanda begins, up to Uttarkashi, remains unenforced to this day. The Uttarakhand government’s misgivings on this move, based on the argument that it would impede development, need to be re-examined in an informed manner. Strategies to ensure better overall management of water resources in the region are needed. However, observations by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2010 expressing concern over disturbance to the natural ecology and destabilisation of hill slopes caused by the construction of hydel projects along the Bhagirathi and the Alaknanda, and over the failure of the administration to plant enough trees to mitigate risks arising out of soil degradation, have a fresh resonance at this point.
Correction:
The reference to Gomukh being the starting point of River Alaknanda was inaccurate. The Alaknanda, one of the headstreams of the Ganga, is by tradition thought to rise at the meeting point of the Satopanth glacier and the Bhagirath Kharak glacier.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-himalayan-tragedy/article4834420.ece
21,6,2013,Patent justice,"The U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark ruling that DNA segments are a product of nature and hence not patent-eligible has worldwide significance because it settles the controversial issue of patenting human genes in the one jurisdiction where it has come to matter the most. Though the ruling said that the mere act of isolating genes “is not an act of invention,” it ruled, by the same yardstick, that complementary DNA (cDNA) does not occur in nature and is therefore patent-eligible. By walking a tightrope, the ruling has ensured that research on genetic testing is encouraged. The judgment strikes at the very foundation on which Myriad Genetics and the University of Utah Research Foundation have effectively monopolised BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene testing since 1994. By possessing the exclusive right to isolate the two genes for identifying the deleterious mutations that cause breast cancer, the company prevented the entry of cheaper and better techniques of identifying the mutations. That a patent was awarded even though the process of isolating genes was widely used at that time shows little application of mind. The ruling has spelled out in no uncertain terms that such an irrational grant of patents for laws and products of nature would end up “inhibiting future innovation” and is at odds with providing protection. The judgment effectively invalidates other patents granted for genes associated with diseases such as colon cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and muscular dystrophy. But it is not clear if this ruling would invalidate patents granted to genes removed from plants and animals.
With the advent of whole genome sequencing, genetic testing has graduated to a different plane. Yet, patents granted to companies such as Myriad prevented new techniques from being used. Hence the unanimous decision by the nine judges to summarily reject patent protection to isolated genes has saved science and scientific research from the morass it had sunk into in recent times. While there can be no debate on whether scientific research should be rewarded, odious claims by Myriad and others should be roundly condemned. The prohibitive cost for a far inferior test had precluded many women from getting tested. With breast cancer being the leading cancer affecting women and about 10 per cent of breast cancer cases being hereditary in nature, the number of those who need to undergo genetic testing is high. Yet, the company’s greed had effectively prevented many women from getting tested. Thanks to the court’s decision, and greater awareness about genetic testing created recently by Angelina Jolie, who had a double mastectomy as she had a harmful mutation in BRCA1, more lives will be saved. And that’s what medical science is all about.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/patent-justice/article4834421.ece
22,6,2013,Sizing up Kerry,"When John Kerry arrives here for the fourth round of the India-United States strategic dialogue, he should not be surprised to discover that as much attention might be focussed on getting a measure of him and what he represents for South Asia, as on the actual agenda of the discussions. This is legitimate curiosity. This will be Mr. Kerry’s first visit to India as Secretary of State, and his reputation as someone who is “sympathetic” to the Pakistani security establishment precedes him. Despite New Delhi’s keenness to avoid hyphenation with its neighbour, Indian officials are bound to watch him closely for any sign of those sympathies. All the more so because of rapidly moving events in the region: the fast-approaching U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2014; the Taliban’s new legitimacy, and the Pakistan Army’s role in the Doha road-map. Afghanistan, and Indian nightmares about a possible return of the Taliban and its allies as the rulers of the country, will doubtless figure high in the talks. New Delhi will be looking to Mr. Kerry — he and the Pakistani Army Chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, are said to have been in intense backroom negotiations to nail down the Doha process with the Taliban — for reassurances.
Aside from Afghanistan, the strategic dialogue will address a range of other security, defence and geopolitical issues, as well as co-operation in trade, science, technology, agriculture and energy. In his talks with External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid, Secretary Kerry is likely to insist that India press ahead with economic decisions that will give American service and financial sector companies greater access to Indian markets. There will also be discussions on India’s nuclear liability law, which the U.S. continues to see, unreasonably, as an obstacle to the implementation of the civilian nuclear pact. India too has concerns, particularly the cuts in work visas for IT professionals. On regional strategic issues, Mr. Khurshid must emphasise that the election of Hassan Rouhani as the next President of Iran creates an opening for the resolution of outstanding issues but that progress will be impossible if Washington continues to act as if nothing has changed. India and the U.S. will also exchange views on China’s new leadership. While it is tempting to see a certain degree of strategic congruence between the two countries here, the reality is more complex. If the rise of China has the potential to destabilise the region, so does the Obama administration’s ‘Asia pivot’. Rather than divisiveness and containment, Asia needs a strategic architecture that is inclusive and open. Mr. Kerry should not be left in any doubt about the fact that this is what is best for India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sizing-up-kerry/article4837925.ece
22,6,2013,Making use of the golden hour,"The case for instantaneous, and hence cashless, treatment to thousands of road accident victims is self-evident. For it has been established that 50 per cent of fatalities could be averted through intervention in the so-called golden hour immediately after a traffic collision. This is a cause the courts and quasi-judicial bodies have consistently championed. But it has taken the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways nearly 25, distressingly long years to announce that accident victims on the Delhi-Jaipur National Highway would be covered up to a maximum of Rs. 30,000 for their treatment. The Supreme Court’s 1989 ruling is categorical that there is no bar on doctors in private hospitals giving emergency care to a victim, irrespective of whether there is a legal-criminal dimension to the vehicular accident. A doctor’s professional obligation to protect life is absolute, and laws of procedure and regulations will have to give way so as to ensure the survival of an injured person. A 1996 SC judgment alluded to a law in the United States obliging hospitals to stabilise victims in an emergency regardless of insurance cover. Drawing on these pronouncements, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in 2005 declared that neither payment of fee, nor the absence of consent from the nearest of kin, could be adduced as grounds to deny treatment. A sequel to this ruling was the amendment of the Motor Vehicles Act. The Law Commission’s draft bill of 2006 on the medical treatment of victims of different kinds of accidents, including natural disasters, deserves urgent consideration.
In 2011, as per official figures, some 4.98 lakh road accidents caused 1.42 lakh deaths and injured more than 5 lakh persons, irreversibly disabling many. Investment in state of the art technology to regulate road traffic, strict law enforcement, accent on expanding public transport network and safe pedestrian passages would all go a long way to reduce the number of mishaps. The government should ensure that hospitals participating in the cashless treatment project comply with the recently adopted National Ambulance Code. AIS:125 (Automotive Industry Standard) stipulates minimum provisions and guidelines for ambulances in keeping with global best practices. Standardisation of treatment procedures would ensure that arbitrary caps on cost do not jeopardise the full extent of intervention necessary, and prevent profiteering already rampant in other areas of insurance-based healthcare provision. Such an approach would be in keeping with the spirit of the recommendations of the High Level Expert Group on Universal Health Coverage.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/making-use-of-the-golden-hour/article4837926.ece
24,6,2013,Dilma’s dilemma,"With the wisdom of hindsight, it is tempting to say the recent nationwide protests that have stunned Brazil were in the making for some time. After all, the economy has struggled to grow for the most part of a year; the Brazilian real has weakened considerably, thanks to government attempts to woo foreign investment; the resultant inflation has pushed prices beyond the reach of the average consumer. But the sheer scale and intensity of anti-government protests — which extended to 100 cities, subsuming Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo by their rage — have taken both officials and pundits alike by surprise. When the Free Pass Movement took to Brazil’s streets last month, as it had for several years to protest hikes in transportation fare, ordinary citizens joined the chorus. The movement quickly gathered momentum, reaching a crescendo on Thursday when a million protesters gathered across the country. The ‘20-centavos’ hike in fares, which the government subsequently rolled back, was merely a figurative front for Brazilians to express their larger grievances.
Although Brazil under President Dilma Roussef and her predecessor, Luiz Inácio ‘Lula’ da Silva, has implemented progressive social programmes over the past decade, these have not managed to redress the pervasive inequalities that exist. Urban infrastructure remains poor, a reality made more jarring by the fact that billions of dollars are being spent on stadiums and arenas for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Olympics which Brazil will host. The ‘Minha Casa, Minha Vida’ housing programme is intended to redress the imbalance but allegations of corruption have taken some of the sheen off the effort. Matters have not been helped by the attempt to strip the Ministério Público — the Brazilian equivalent of an independent Lokpal — of prosecutorial powers via the proposed PEC 37 amendment to the Constitution. That this proposal comes in the wake of prosecutors investigating senior politicians and officials for their alleged misappropriation of public funds makes the motives of those pushing for the change highly suspect. For President Rousseff, these protests are a wake-up call; unlike her Turkish counterparts, she has done well to announce a series of concessions. The protestors want a deepening of democracy and a strengthening of the social programmes that the ruling Workers Party is officially committed to. Amendments like PEC 37 have no place in a constitutional republic.

24,6,2013,The kidney paradox,"Chronic corruption and lack of affordable access to treatments for serious diseases in the public health system stand exposed in the kidney commerce scandal in Tamil Nadu’s Dharmapuri district. Nothing can be a greater irony than the existence of such thriving sale of organs in a State that also has perhaps the best-run programme for donation of kidneys, livers, hearts and lungs by deceased donors. It is no small achievement that Tamil Nadu’s cadaveric donation rate for organs was reported last year to be nearly ten times the rate for India as a whole. With no ethics complaints on the distribution of organs by a government-appointed administrator, the programme is now globally acknowledged; its contribution in less than five years has been an impressive 1036 major organs, 641 of them kidneys. Yet, the vast gap in demand and supply to treat people with end-stage disease leaves plenty of room for unscrupulous medical professionals, corrupt bureaucrats and middlemen to trade in organs. In a country with an incidence of 232 people per million developing end-stage kidney disease, and a growing burden of diabetes and hypertension contributing to renal failure, States serious about closing organ bazaars should be looking not just at shady hospitals, but at their public health policies.
There is a compelling case for the Tamil Nadu government to institute an enquiry into the working of the Authorisation Committees, which, under the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994 have been sanctioning transplants from living donors as in Dharmapuri. It would raise public confidence in the process if the in camera system of functioning is replaced with independent oversight, monitoring by civil society observers, videography of proceedings and publication of data in the public domain. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and the mould of corruption can be quickly removed. Even so, a systemic clean-up cannot augment the supply of organs — the volume of patients requiring therapy is simply unmanageable, and more are added to the list constantly. To reduce the demand for organs, States have to, perforce, build capacity in district hospitals to offer free or nearly-free haemodialysis for patients with kidney failure. A second priority should be to heavily subsidise home-based peritoneal dialysis. This eminently feasible intervention in a fast-growing country will prolong life, and reduce the impoverishment of patient families. It is equally vital that official policies help prevent organ failure in the first place: by encouraging blood sugar control, legally curbing salt levels in packaged food, and making blood testing facilities widely accessible and affordable.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-kidney-paradox/article4843672.ece
25,6,2013,TRAI harder on roaming,"While a step in the right direction, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s move last week to reduce and reorganise national roaming charges fails to go the full distance. The telecom regulator has reduced the ceiling for outgoing voice charges for a roaming subscriber from Rs.1.40 to Re.1.00 per minute for local calls and from Rs.2.40 to Rs.1.50 per minute for STD calls. Similarly, ceiling tariffs for incoming calls for a roaming user have been cut from Rs.1.75 to 75 paise per minute. Since this is a cap, operators are free to charge less. In reality, though, they are unlikely to do so. While Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal and the National Telecom Policy 2012 had both spoken of “removing the roaming charge,” TRAI decided abolition was not feasible. For telecom operators, roaming costs have fallen from what they used to be but have not vanished. If roaming charges become free for subscribers, operators will not be able to recover costs from the roughly 13 per cent of the 860 million subscribers who roam nationally. To recover an approximately Rs.13,000 crore revenue loss on account of free roaming, they would be forced to hike call rates for the 600 million-odd, non-roamers. In nearly all cases, this would mean the poor subsidising the rich, which is hardly fair. Moreover, TRAI has retained the element of choice. Operators have been mandated to offer special plans where heavy roamers can avail of free national roaming for an additional fixed charge.
The problem begins when TRAI approaches data — specifically SMSs — with a mindset trapped in voice telephony-related network costs. While keeping incoming SMSs free, the regulator has dispensed with its forbearance policy and placed a ceiling for outgoing local SMS at Re.1.00 and STD SMS at Rs.1.50/SMS. This will certainly slow down the roaming SMS gravy train, which had allowed service providers to take unsuspecting roaming users for a ride. What doesn’t add up is the fact that the cost of sending an SMS, including the cost of storage and forwarding facility, is a fraction of a voice call. An SMS does not use voice channels, unlike speech, and costs just a few paise to send. The new SMS tariffs are also inconsistent with the recent reduction in 2G data tariffs by operators. TRAI’s press release and accompanying documentation fail to explain this anomaly. Consumers ought to pay much less than what TRAI has recommended. Even where local SMSs are concerned, the termination charge regime being pursued by operators makes the price exorbitant. TRAI would be well advised to review its data-related techno-economic process to acknowledge the importance and convenience of SMSs in today’s times.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/trai-harder-on-roaming/article4847328.ece
25,6,2013,Redeeming the promise,"Whatever the circumstances of the final, India’s triumph in the ICC Champions Trophy must rank as something special. For a side rebuilt after the success of the 2011 World Cup — only three survivors remain from the team that won in Mumbai — it is a remarkable achievement. Credit must go to M.S. Dhoni, the captain — and as the oldest player in a young side, now a leader in every sense of the word — for steering his men with poise through the competition. The win now also underscores the strong relationship between the team and its coach Duncan Fletcher. India’s performance over the two weeks, commanding for the most part, now bodes thrillingly well for the 2015 World Cup, with the nucleus of the team likely to stay the same. In Shikhar Dhawan, the Player of the Series, India discovered an opener once thought lost to international cricket. The left-hander has batted, to quote a former Indian opener and coach, “as if in a Ranji Trophy game,” stunning opponents who knew little of him. The Player of the Final, Ravindra Jadeja, once mocked as a bits-and-pieces cricketer, has matured into a capable all-rounder with the knack of taking wickets at the most critical moments. The off-spinner R. Ashwin and the medium-pace bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar, meanwhile, impressed with a string of consistent performances. India also unveiled a fierce fielding unit, arguably the best in the world. There are no liabilities in the field anymore; as Jadeja remarked, there is no need to hide anyone.
India’s victory achieves extra significance against the backdrop of a turbulent period for cricket at home. The IPL fixing controversy and the subsequent wrangling in the BCCI battered the image of the sport in the country. The players left for the U.K. with the matter still mushrooming, and it would have been easy to be distracted. This result comes as a relief, although the administration still needs to set its house in order. Victory on the field, achieved by talented cricketers, should not be used by the PR agents of the BCCI to give the Indian Board a clean chit. Meanwhile, the last edition of a Champions Trophy — barring an astonishing U-turn by the ICC — has been a surprisingly successful tournament, both in terms of public appeal and the quality of the competition. It is an event that has struggled for relevance and would already have been shelved but for commercial considerations. If there is criticism, it has to be over the decision to settle the final by a 20-over contest. But the packed international calendar only allowed the ICC an 18-day-window into which to squeeze 15 matches; there could be no reserve day. It might have taken a T20, but India has asserted its status as the world No.1 ODI side.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/redeeming-the-promise/article4847325.ece
26,6,2013,Beneficent and baleful,"This year, the monsoon has been in rumbustious form. It swept in to Kerala on June 1 and then headed off north with surprising rapidity. So much so that the rain-bearing cloud systems covered the whole country by June 16, a process that is typically completed only by around the middle of next month. Moreover, it has rained copiously. Consequently, about three-quarters of the country have received much more rain than usual. After last year’s poor monsoon, the plentiful rains have aided the planting of this year’s kharif crops, improved water storage in reservoirs and helped recharge badly depleted, underground aquifers. But for Uttarakhand, which in the course of a week was hammered with eightfold more rain than it typically gets, the deluge was too much. Human environmental depredations worsened the resultant flooding and landslides, and poorly managed disaster relief efforts added to the calamity. With this month’s heavy rains, flooding has been reported from other parts of the country too. North-western India has received over twice its usual rain. Although the eastern and north-eastern States are showing deficits, the country as a whole has thus far got 32 per cent more rain than average. It is a far cry from last year, when the countrywide rainfall deficit soared to 50 per cent by mid-June and the month ended with a considerable shortfall.
Good rains this month do not necessarily mean that the rest of the rainy season will be just as bountiful. However, if June ends with surplus rainfall of 20 per cent or more, then, going by the record of past years, there is a good chance that this monsoon could see above average nationwide rainfall for the season as a whole. The updated forecast that the India Meteorological Department released recently was remarkably similar to the one it issued in April: a “normal” monsoon, with countrywide seasonal rainfall between 96 per cent and 104 per cent of the long-period average, had the highest probability of 47 per cent. That was followed by the odds for a “below normal” monsoon, with seasonal rainfall between 90 per cent and 96 per cent of the long-period average. The met agency has also indicated that July, which provides close to one-third of the seasonal rainfall, could see normal or above normal rain; rains in August might be below par. But the monsoon can be capricious and difficult to predict. How sea surface temperatures and atmospheric conditions evolve in the central Pacific Ocean and the equatorial Indian Ocean can strongly influence the rains over India. Hopefully, despite such uncertainties, this monsoon will turn out well.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/beneficent-and-baleful/article4850496.ece
26,6,2013,History and sedition,"The Tamil Nadu government is palpably in error in invoking the penal provision of sedition against the author of a book that it banned last month. The book, Meendezhum Pandiyar Varalaaru (“Resurgence of Pandya History”), a Tamil work by K. Senthil Mallar, argues that the Pallars, a Dalit community, had once ruled southern Tamil Nadu. Extracts given in the government notification ordering forfeiture of all copies of the book suggest the author has made loose assertions and claims about various groups, as well as sweeping generalisations about different castes. Though such writing is ill-advised in these hypersensitive times, the May 30, 2013 government notification surely exaggerates when it claims that “the content and language employed by the author clearly reveals his intention to spread hatred and disharmony among communities in the guise of research and thereby to cause disturbance to the public peace and tranquillity.” A book that runs to more than 600 pages and purports to be based on research ought not to be banned simply because its thesis and arguments are controversial. While historians, scholars and others have the right to refute or critique the author’s claims, or even campaign against the book being taken seriously, the government cannot decide on the authenticity or historicity of events in his book or indeed the accuracy or acceptability of opinions found in it.
In any event, regardless of whether the ban amounts to a reasonable restriction on the author’s freedom of expression, the slapping of sedition charges seems to be an invidious attempt to throttle him and the viewpoint he represents. The book’s contents may, at a stretch, perhaps attract legal provisions relating to creating disharmony between different sections of society, but definitely not sedition. Sedition involves promoting disaffection against the government established by law, but it is doubtful whether merely making some explosive claims about sections of society can come under its ambit. In recent times, the use of the sedition charge in Tamil Nadu and elsewhere has been questionable. It was invoked against activists engaged in the prolonged agitation against the Kudankulam nuclear project in a bid to portray the protest as anti-national activity. For those who see this book’s subject as a form of Dalit assertion and an effort by an oppressed community to reconstruct its past, the ban as well as the sedition case against the author may mean that alternative histories are being suppressed by the authorities to placate dominant communities. There is indeed a strong case to question the State’s approach without undermining its legitimate right to take steps to maintain communal harmony.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/history-and-sedition/article4850497.ece
27,6,2013,Tall stories,"The clamour for vertical growth in Indian cities is growing, and so is the opposition. Those in support want the low-rise skyline to soar and match that of New York. While others point to the adverse impacts and caution that not all cities be painted with the same tall brush. This dilemma — horizontal or vertical expansion — is most felt in Delhi, where the Ministry of Urban Development is pressing planners to relax rules and allow for more high-rise buildings. Even the historic core of New Delhi and its immediate environs, which are known for sumptuous open spaces and heritage buildings, have come under development pressure. The Delhi Urban Art Commission, a statutory body set up to advise the government on the environmental quality and urban design aspects of the city, has rightly cautioned against the indiscriminate construction of high-rise buildings. It recently criticised the government proposal to build a large number of tall towers for poor design decisions and potential loss of green cover. What is at stake is not just the future of Delhi, but also that of other rapidly expanding cities, which often look up to the Capital for ideas worth emulating.
Those in favour of packing cities with more tall buildings argue that vertical growth enables optimal use of land, reduces home prices and creates compact cities. In particular, they focus on FAR, or the Floor Area Ratio, which determines how much can be built in a given plot area. Manhattan has a FAR of 10 for residential projects while Delhi has a low value of two. The demand for increasing the FAR mounts and the reasoning is that a higher value would help build more, go taller, and accommodate more people in a given plot. This may not be entirely true. For instance, in Chennai, a low-rise city with an average FAR of 1.5, about 26,553 persons live in one square kilometre — a density comparable to Manhattan. Complex parameters such as the number of single-family households and the size of residential units built are at play. It is also a myth that FAR and house prices are inversely proportional. Manhattan itself is a case in point. There are lessons to be learnt from New York, but they lie elsewhere. The city’s incentives to build micro-apartments to reduce the housing shortage, its commitment to improve transport options, and plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are worth emulating. Singapore, another icon of the vertical city, too has adopted a comprehensive planning approach that brings nature closer to people and enhances public spaces. The height of buildings is only one of the considerations. Policymakers should carefully review other issues — of overcrowding, infrastructure capabilities, and the state of natural and cultural assets — before taking any decision.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Tall-stories/article12091344.ece
27,6,2013,The right to sanitation,"A staggering 2.4 billion, or one-third of the world’s population will continue to remain without improved sanitation in 2015, says a recent World Health Organization and United Nations Children’s Fund report. This is a terrible violation of basic human dignity, because clean drinking water and basic sanitation are human rights that impinge on the exercise of other rights. To be sure, the proportion of the population without adequate provision decreased from 51 per cent in 1990 to around 33 per cent in 2011. East Asia has registered a 40 per cent increase in sanitation coverage. But recent global progress still falls short of the 2015 Millennium Development Goal target to halve the proportion from the 1990 baseline. The shortfall is in the region of eight per cent, which translates into half a billion people. This relative failure must also be viewed against the significance of the sanitation goal for other targets — to reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. A major cause of concern for public health still remains, with 15 per cent of the world’s population practising open defecation. Despite a declining trend from 24 per cent in 1990, the practice is rampant in over a quarter of the population in 27 countries. Water contamination is of particular concern for two reasons. First, while the MDG target relating to drinking water was achieved in 2012, some three-quarters of a billion people continue to rely on unprotected sources. Second, the MDG target on clean water is based on evaluations of the nature of construction of the source, in terms of contamination from the outside, rather than the actual quality of water people consume. Thus the treatment and disposal of faecal matter are major challenges.
Instructive for India is a study undertaken for the Water and Sanitation Program and the World Bank. It estimates the cost of inadequate sanitation for the country’s economy at $53.8 billion a year, a figure equivalent to 6.4 per cent of GDP. Among the so-called BRICS countries, India fares by far the worst, with some 627 million resorting to open defecation. The statistics elsewhere are strikingly small; 14 million in China and half that number in Brazil. The importance of proper sanitation to disaster preparedness can hardly be overstated, given the susceptibility of affected populations to waterborne diseases. Clearly, universal coverage must remain the core objective, at least at the level of basic offering of sanitation services and market-based alternatives as a supplement. This may prove a sustainable combination to rid the globe of the ruinous consequences of insanitary conditions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-right-to-sanitation/article4853820.ece
28,6,2013,"For one more, a lot lost","For once, it was the voters who caught all the attention, and not the contestants. Much of the excitement generated by the election to the six Rajya Sabha seats from Tamil Nadu had little to do with the candidates in the fray. From the beginning, the point of interest was on the political churning the election would entail, on who would vote for whom. As it turned out, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Congress got back together, and ended, for the time being at least, the expectations of a third front in the State in the form of an alliance between the Congress and the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam, the rising regional party led by actor-politician Vijayakant. The reunion of the Congress and the DMK is a telling commentary on their divorce. Although the DMK parted ways citing the inaction of the United Progressive Alliance government on the Sri Lankan Tamils issue, it had no problems at all in seeking the support of the Congress for its candidate Kanimozhi, daughter of party president M. Karunanidhi. All the DMK’s rhetoric in the weeks leading to the breakup in March this year now rings hollow. Just as cold political calculations provoked the divorce, petty political compromises have forced a reunion. On what terms the DMK bought the support of the Congress, and whether the arrangement will last till the general election next year are not clear just yet. But, for all the happy faces in posed photographs, the friends-turned-foes-turned friends again do not make a pretty picture.
In contrast, the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam played its cards far more shrewdly. The party had the numbers to win four seats comfortably, and could have bagged a fifth with the backing of DMDK dissidents, former allies, and some help from a divided opposition. Indeed, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa announced five candidates initially, before withdrawing one after an open appeal for support from the Communist Party of India. Soon after the 2011 Assembly election, the AIADMK had alienated many of its allies, particularly the Left parties. On more than one occasion Ms. Jayalalithaa had said her party would face the Lok Sabha polls alone, and aim to win all the 40 seats in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. But in scaling down her ambition a notch, she won back the support and gratitude of the two Left parties. Irrespective of whether the AIADMK decides to go along with the Left in the Lok Sabha election or not, the party’s options have only increased after the Rajya Sabha election. And, as a bonus, the party also managed to expose the DMK and the Congress as opportunistic and self-serving partners in an unholy alliance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/for-one-more-a-lot-lost/article4857429.ece
28,6,2013,Exploiting a tragedy,"Like countless tragedies before it, Uttarakhand has been reduced to a spectacle by competitive showing off verging on the absurd. The flash floods that brought death and devastation to the hill State were still expending their fury when attention got diverted from the shock and horror of the main event to a string of political shows organised on the sidelines. Unfortunately, the theatrics this time has gone beyond the usual one-upmanship to interference in official relief and rescue efforts. Uttarakhand’s terrain and weather are regarded as treacherous and have proved forbidding even for trained Air Force and Army personnel; the crash last week of an IAF helicopter underscores the risks involved in undertaking an authorised search mission in the region, not to speak of misadventures by unguided missiles. But politicians intent on heroism and adventure will hardly be deterred by the prospect of danger. One such daredevil was Congress MLA from Madhya Pradesh, Sanjay Pathak, who claimed to have rescued many stranded pilgrims by flying into Uttarakhand in his own helicopter. Other politicians made a beeline for Dehradun’s airport, adding to its already considerable problems by pressing into service their own fleet of aircraft and stampeding to be the first to organise return passage for the rescued pilgrims. A Congress MP from Andhra Pradesh and two Telugu Desam Party MPs fought bitterly over who should get the first right to ferry back pilgrims from their State.
Nothing captures the black humour in all this as much as the drama around Narendra Modi’s much-quoted derring-do in allegedly pulling off the rescue of 15,000 Gujarati pilgrims. The story, published in a national daily and since denied, had it that the Gujarat Chief Minister flew into the State right in the middle of the raging flash floods and flew out with his contingent. As bravery goes, this was hard to beat, and sure enough the ‘heroics’ got the online world buzzing with excitement. There was much exclaiming over a single determined man being able to do what the Indian Army could not. Though the story has been denied, several versions of it are now in circulation, minus the implausible figure of 15,000 but nonetheless full of dazzling details on how the rescue was organised. There has also been some angst over the Uttarakhand government’s refusal to accept from Mr. Modi the offer of two dozen helicopters, besides assistance to rebuild the Kedarnath temple. It can be nobody’s case that a Chief Minister or an individual politician should not offer help in a national crisis. But there is a time and place for it. Excessive help and excessive publicity for the help can be counter-productive.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/exploiting-a-tragedy/article4857430.ece
29,6,2013,A very reliable formula,"In going with the formula recommended by the Rangarajan Committee for pricing natural gas produced in the country — even if it means considerably higher prices — the government has chosen the practical way out of a sticky situation. Gas producers were lobbying hard for ‘remunerative’ prices while users from the power and fertilizer sectors were agreeable only to a nominal increase. With production from the KG basin fields of Reliance Industries, the lead gas producer in the country, falling drastically in the last couple of years due to what the company claims are technical problems, power and fertilizer companies were forced to either use expensive imported gas or operate their plants at sub-optimal capacities. There was thus pressure on the government to incentivise investment in the oil and gas sector by revising prices upwards to meet the expectations of gas producers. The Rangarajan formula links the price of gas in India to world prices. Though it will be lower than the price of imported gas, the new price will nevertheless lead to a sharp rise in input costs for power and fertilizer companies. Mindful of this, the government has already hinted that it will have to subsidise these two sectors for a while.
Even as it examines ways of keeping the burden off consumers, the government needs to rethink two elements. First, if there has to be an international reference point for the Indian gas price, the well-developed Henry Hub market is enough. Gratuitously including Japan and the U.K. in the pricing formula only serves to push the Indian price higher than it ought to be. Second, there must be a ceiling price under the formula. It cannot be that gas producers will reap unlimited gains in the case of an upswing in global prices; any upside has to be capped at a level that takes into account a reasonable return on investment for the gas producer. The government must also subject gas producers to closer regulation, especially on aspects of cost recovery and technical parameters related to production. The ongoing issues with Reliance — which will benefit the most from the higher prices now — over cost recovery and penalties for not meeting contracted output levels need to be taken to their logical conclusion. Once Reliance overcomes the ‘technical difficulty’ of producing gas at the KG-D6 field, the government must ensure the company delivers the shortfall it still owes at the old price of $4.2 per million British thermal unit (mmbtu) rather than getting the benefit of the new price. The government should also consider the other important recommendation of the Rangarajan Committee — of moving to a revenue-sharing arrangement with gas producers. That will eliminate future disputes over cost recovery, even as it discourages gold-plating of project costs.

29,6,2013,What was left unsaid,"It was always unrealistic to expect that Round 4 of the India-United States Strategic Dialogue would push the bilateral relationship up from its so-called plateau into the heights. So it’s not surprising that the much sought after ‘big idea’ to take ties to the next level remains elusive. What it has done, though, is confirm that there is no magic wand that can be waved to make differences disappear. Certainly, it takes more than high-sounding rhetoric about the India-U.S. relationship as “one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century” or the “common DNA” that Secretary of State John Kerry said the two countries share. External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid publicly played down New Delhi’s concerns on the Afghan ‘reconciliation’ process, but the silence of the joint statement on what is happening in Doha is one indication that India is not as optimistic about talks with the Taliban as the U.S. On a day that the Taliban attacked the presidential palace in Kabul, Secretary Kerry’s assertion that the Doha process is predicated on certain “red lines” was no consolation. The differences between the two sides on Iran were also apparent by the conspicuous omission of that country from the joint statement. It is passing odd that on two of the most pressing global and regional issues, the two sides preferred to remain silent or sparing with their comments in public. Another major difference, over visas for IT professionals, has been bumped back to industry leaders on both sides. Where there is convergence is on working together in the East Asian region, where India’s apprehensions vis-à-vis China have increased in recent months, with the joint statement stressing the importance of the India-U.S.-Japan dialogue.
Despite the low-key reception accorded to him by New Delhi and the lukewarm tone of the dialogue, Mr. Kerry could not have been unhappy with the commitment from New Delhi that it would clear the way by September this year for Westinghouse to set up a power plant in Gujarat. The company’s negotiations with the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited have gone slowly, partly over the issue of confidentiality, but mainly because of India’s nuclear liability law. It is significant that the stated timeline coincides with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s likely visit to the U.S. for the U.N. General Assembly. While the proposed visit next month of Vice-President Joe Biden is a strong signal of the Obama administration’s desire for political engagement, ensuring that New Delhi keeps its promise on the nuclear deal will be top of his agenda too. Speeding it up is desirable for both sides, but not at the cost of Indian interests.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/what-was-left-unsaid/article4860813.ece
1,7,2013,Fighting a war without arms,"That India, the pharmacy of the South, should find itself on the brink of a major TB-drug stock-out is at once shocking and shameful. The fact that an antiquated drug-procurement system and incompetent and irresponsible government departments — which dragged their feet for more than two long years to procure the drugs — could have brought us to such a situation tells us how dangerously poised the national tuberculosis control programme is. It is scandalous that no action was taken despite the Joint Monitoring Mission warning the Central TB Division of the precariously low paediatric drug stocks in August last year. Even as the government denies the possibility of a stock-out, the ground reality in some places appears otherwise. While the stocks of some drugs are claimed to last a month, a few are at dangerously low levels. A stock-out has been “confirmed” in the case of some paediatric doses. If denying drugs to new patients is unethical and has serious consequences, the lack of drugs to treat existing patients provides a perfect breeding ground for drug-resistant strains to emerge and is a sure recipe for disaster. The situation becomes all the more dangerous in the case of drug-resistant TB. It is appalling that the utter failure of a few has come so dangerously close to jeopardising the Revised National TB Control Programme, that treats more than 18 lakh patients every year. Waiting till stocks dip to dangerously low levels before resorting to emergency procurement best portrays how serious the government is about confronting a disease that kills three lakh people every year.
With TB prevalence hovering over three million, and actual incidence at two million, India has the highest case load in the world; it has the highest death rate too. At a time when lethal arsenals and novel strategies are required to tame the killer disease, it is unfortunate that the country is floundering on a most vital and fundamental issue that can have a cascading effect. Ironically, “an uninterrupted supply of good quality anti-TB drugs” is one of the five components of the DOTS programme. The current shortcoming raises serious doubts about the government’s ability to meet the increased drug demand when more MDR-TB cases are detected using the advanced molecular test. Hence it is incumbent on the government to ensure assured and uninterrupted supply of drugs. The first step to achieve that is to overhaul the outdated drug-procurement system that takes “approximately 12-16 months.” Union Health Secretary Keshav Desiraju, who inherited the two-year-old problem from his predecessors, has done well to deal with the emergency. What is needed now is a thorough enquiry that gets to the root of the procurement lapse.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fighting-a-war-without-arms/article4866601.ece
1,7,2013,With a horn and a prayer,"It does not take new accident data from the National Crime Records Bureau to confirm that India’s roads, bursting at the seams with about 141 million motorised vehicles in 2012, are deadly. The Centre has been ignoring the shameful toll of death and disability for years, responding only with token measures. State governments mostly limit themselves to granting meagre compensation to the families of victims, instead of engaging in serious reform. That 139,091 lives were lost on the roads last year seems to be an insignificant statistic, given the extraordinary indifference among policymakers to a worsening public health disaster. There is even less attention paid to the burden of disability caused annually by crash injuries. Studies show that figure could be 15 to 20 times the number of deaths. On paper, India is addressing several aspects of the problem through a Road Safety Policy: education of users, law enforcement, engineering of roads and vehicles, emergency care, and audits of highways. But none of this is really working, as the annual increase in casualties shows. What does stand out is the complete lack of accountability.
It is six years since the Committee on Road Safety and Traffic Management of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways submitted its report, but its important recommendation, that the many Central and State agencies involved in licensing, engineering, enforcement, and investigation should be coordinated by a statutory and autonomous national agency, has not been taken seriously. The Sundar committee’s criticism of the unscientific approach to safety adopted by official bodies, and the tendency of the police to criminalise accidents rather than investigate, is even more valid today. No major improvements have been made to the process of driver training and certification, in spite of a steady rise in the number of vehicles. The number of cars per 1,000 population in India has shot past the 100 mark in some big cities. Given the low political priority that road safety enjoys, State governments are dragging their feet on infrastructure creation, particularly in small and medium towns. The ever-present threat of injury and death on India’s lawless roads violates the right to life, and calls for its vigorous assertion by citizens. Municipal governments responsible for putting up physical infrastructure should be held accountable if their failure leads to accidents.

2,7,2013,Whose Supreme Court?,"By striking down a key section of the Voting Rights Act 1965, the United States Supreme Court has opened the door to the potential compromise of universal adult franchise, especially of the country’s ethnic minorities. The 5-4 majority decision, made on June 25 in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, abolishes Section 4 of the Act, which stated the conditions under which nine particular States, and specified counties in other States, had to submit proposed changes in electoral laws for prior federal government approval; in effect the decision also blocks Section 5, namely the preclearance requirement itself. The ruling, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, holds that Section 4 is no longer necessary because African-Americans in the relevant States now have higher voter registration rates than whites, and because “blatantly discriminatory” violations of federal decrees are now rare. In a dissenting judgment, however, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg notes that whenever discriminatory practices have been banned, others have arisen, and that case-by-case litigation cannot prevent racially discriminatory election procedures.
Several rights groups have denounced the ruling; the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People calls it “outrageous”. The States concerned have a long history of procedures which amount to discrimination on racial lines, even though the 14th and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution banned the practice over 140 years ago. Texas, in which Shelby county lies, has immediately started implementing a law requiring photo-identification for voting, and there is widespread evidence to support the ruling’s critics. The federal Justice Department has rejected 86 electoral changes from the listed areas in the past 15 years. Secondly, the photo-ID requirement will mainly affect African-American and Latino voters, as a majority of them are from poorer classes and find it difficult to get the kinds of documents required. Furthermore, State-level Republican parties systematically challenge ethnic-minority voters at the polling stations, for example by “caging”, that is, sending junk mail to voters in poorer neighbourhoods and then claiming that a failure to reply shows that the voters involved do not live at the addresses given in the electoral register. Moreover, there is virtually no chance that the now bitterly divided Congress can revise the preclearance section of the Voting Rights Act. To paraphrase Justice Ginsburg, African-American and Latino voters may well find that the Supreme Court has thrown away the umbrella when it is still raining on them. In sum, it is not just minority Americans who are potentially under threat, but American democracy itself.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/whose-supreme-court/article4870307.ece
2,7,2013,A home-grown epidemic,"That predators continue to enjoy impunity for crimes committed against women is now common knowledge. But less known is the fact that the worst perpetrators are often those most intimately known to women, or that the latter are vulnerable in consequence to life-long health-related risks. These frightening revelations are contained in a recent World Health Organisation report, issued in collaboration with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the South African Medical Research Council. Globally, 38 per cent of women who are murdered are killed by their intimate partners. Some 30 per cent of women worldwide are victims of brutalities perpetrated by their close partners. Not to mention that 35 per cent of all women experience abuse of some form or the other and 42 per cent sustain injuries during their lifetime. Little wonder then that domestic violence constitutes a distinct category by itself under criminal law, begging the question whether the home is a place that protects personal privacy or is an impenetrable fortress shielding those guilty of despicable crimes. Given the severe impact of domestic violence on the physical and mental health of women, the report describes the situation as a global health problem of epidemic proportions. Apart from the more visible manifestations of broken limbs, there are often complications linked to pregnancy, and low birth weight babies that more directly impact the next generation. Moreover, women who endure abuse from partners are twice as likely to suffer from depression, alcohol abuse and sexually-transmitted infections compared to others.
Governments must heed WHO’s call to incorporate its latest clinical and policy guidelines into the medical and nursing curricula. These emphasise the need to train health workers at all levels to elicit relevant information from victims in a private setting, ensuring complete confidentiality. Significantly, India was among the seven countries that endorsed a declaration in May at the 66th World Health Assembly that regards violence against girls and women as a major public health, gender equality and human rights challenge. Unsurprisingly, the country is among those worst affected in terms of violence against women from partners. For New Delhi, part of the answer at least clearly lies in an effective enforcement of the law on domestic violence. But more fundamental and urgent is the shift in age-old cultural attitudes that entrench patriarchal power relations between the sexes. One that is an affront to a sense of basic human dignity and equal respect.

3,7,2013,Head in sand on Snowden,"Three conclusions stem from the exposé by Der Spiegel of documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden on the extent of American spying on foreign governments. Like the revelations themselves, they should not come as a surprise to our readers. First, the dichotomy of ‘civil liberties versus national security,’ which the United States — and other governments — have seized upon, is not only false but also a front for expansive surveillance. The U.S. National Security Agency, whose star rose in the aftermath of 9/11, has simply used techniques endorsed by the ‘War on Terror’ to camouflage its traditional espionage operations. Second, there exists no such concept as a “friend” or “ally” of the U.S. — partnerships be damned, especially when it comes to spying on the internal deliberations of other governments. Leaked NSA documents show the European Union, Japan, Mexico, Turkey and South Korea, all partners of the U.S., had their embassies and offices bugged, telephones tapped and computers hacked into. Third, Washington continues to consider international law as applicable to others, but not unto itself. Spying on embassies is a blatant violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961. While the Obama administration decries cyber crimes and “economic espionage” by China, Iran and North Korea, it has perpetuated the very same acts, only more brazen in that they exploit the trust of friendly countries.
While courting India as a key Asia ally, the U.S. has deployed its covert machinery to watch over New Delhi’s shoulder. The latest tranche of NSA documents reveal the Indian embassy in Washington D.C. too was targeted. The Guardian had previously reported, based on Mr. Snowden’s leaks, how British and American agencies had spied on leaders at the 2009 G20 Summit — with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in attendance — in London. India is also among the biggest targets for illegal American intelligence gathering under the NSA’s datamining programme, “Boundless Informant.” It is unclear, but not unreasonable to speculate, whether such information includes official correspondence. Yet, while many countries at the receiving end of U.S. espionage, including France and Germany, have threatened to retaliate with stern measures, India’s response has been woolly at best. External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid has parroted the U.S. line on the NSA’s surveillance programme, saying “it is not actually snooping.” He has also peremptorily dismissed Mr. Snowden’s asylum request, reflecting the establishment’s callous attitude to the leaks themselves. That the U.S. spies on other countries is no revelation; but the fact that our government is choosing to react in such a supine manner and refusing to stand up for the privacy of its citizens and the confidentiality of its official communication is truly shocking.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/head-in-sand-on-snowden/article4874164.ece
3,7,2013,The emerging debt trap,"India’s external debt was a little just over $100 billion in 2004; by March 2013, this had grown to $390 billion. More worryingly, the short term debt payable within a year, an indicator of immediate vulnerability, has ballooned to $172 billion in 2013, from $54 billion in 2008. Consequently, India has to pay back $172 billion to foreign lenders by March 2014. This is nearly 60 per cent of its current foreign exchange reserves. In normal circumstances, this commitment would not appear so daunting but then circumstances are anything but normal. First, the reason India has accumulated such a huge short term debt stock is that cheap money at virtually zero interest rate was supplied in abundance by western central banks, especially the U.S. Federal Reserve, post 2008. Of course, the developed world followed an easy liquidity policy to save their own economies, threatened by the worst recession since the Great Depression. But many emerging market economies ended up walking into what can only be described as a “cheap money trap.”
But such cheap money has made many emerging economies complacent about receiving inward capital flows without creating the necessary policy framework to strengthen the sinews of their domestic industry. In the four years after 2008, India’s own experience has been one of losing its export competitiveness relative to other developing countries. This has decelerated our export earnings. Added to this is our mounting import bill, largely led by rising oil prices. The massive increase in gold imports further added to our woes. The double whammy of decelerating exports and rising imports has resulted in India becoming one of the highest current account deficit nations, at nearly 5 per cent of GDP annually. India needs at least $90 billion of fresh capital inflows a year to meet its current account deficit. It could become particularly vulnerable if the U.S. Federal Reserve decides to partially roll back its cheap money policy in the months ahead. Cheap global money, which had enabled Indian corporates and financial institutions to accumulate more and more debt, will certainly not continue for long. India must begin to prepare for such a contingency. The only way out of this predicament is for the Manmohan Singh government to build a consensus among political parties to rebuild the economy on a war footing. But with general elections less than a year away, the UPA lacks the political capital to make such a determined effort to arrest the current economic slide.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-emerging-debt-trap/article4874168.ece
4,7,2013,Affirming the right to read,"Despite our otherwise imperfect record in recognising the rights of people with disabilities, it is a matter of some pride that India’s copyright law anticipates the Marrakesh Treaty of the World Intellectual Property Organisation that has now legalised the right to read for an estimated 314 million blind and print disabled. The most notable common provision in the new treaty and India’s copyright law is the waiver of prior approval from authors and publishers for the reproduction and distribution of works into any alternative format, precluding commercial gain. This could, at least in theory, open up access to an unprecedented variety of published works to the blind and print disabled and enable a qualitatively new and real-time reading and learning experience. Public libraries should seize on this huge new avenue and cater to the needs of this hitherto largely unserved segment of the population. It is only through such interventions that there could be any realistic chance of realising the lofty objectives of universal and inclusive education. The other key provision in the Marrakesh Treaty is for the cross-border exchange of accessible formats of books. This move is truly path-breaking because exchanges between countries in the past were foreclosed given that copyright law is territorial. The new arrangement should lead to an increase in the overall number of works available in accessible formats, as service-providers around the world can share texts and eliminate duplication. Cross-country exchanges would also contribute to a more judicious utilisation of scarce resources in terms of trained manpower and other material. After all, in addition to public provision of services for the disabled, the voluntary sector continues to remain a key partner in this area. Guarantees under the treaty to protect the legitimate interests of authors and publishers should be scrupulously enforced. Such safeguards would be no less in the interest of the treaty’s intended beneficiaries, whose ultimate concern would be for a proliferation of accessible formats.
The impetus for the Marrakesh treaty was no doubt occasioned by the 2007 U.N. Convention for persons with disabilities. But global efforts to extend the scope of the Berne exceptions and limitations for the benefit of the blind and print disabled go back three decades. The upshot was the domestic legislation that currently obtains in some 57 countries to create alternative access to print. An ideal scenario would be one where all published works could be accessed in multiple formats and are also available in bookstalls and libraries. Such a world would perhaps remain elusive for a long time to come; but the dream is worthwhile.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/affirming-the-right-to-read/article4878058.ece
4,7,2013,Rudd’s revenge,"In a shock move at the end of June, Kevin Rudd, the former Australian Prime Minister, regained the Australian prime ministership, deposing Julia Gillard in a 57-45 vote among Labor Members of Parliament. Ms Gillard, who had herself deposed Mr. Rudd in similar fashion in June 2010 to become Australia’s first woman Prime Minister, had sustained a minority government with the help of the Greens and a handful of independents. She has now announced that she will leave politics at the next general election, which she had earlier stated would be held on September 14, and several of her cabinet, including Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan, have resigned their ministerial positions. Anthony Albanese, Ms Gillard’s transport minister, who managed Mr. Rudd’s leadership campaign, becomes the new Deputy Prime Minister; the Greens and the relevant independents have stated that they will still support the government. Internationally, Canberra’s key positions will not change; these include the close strategic collaboration with the United States, and the pursuit of its strategic partnerships with India and Japan.
Domestically, the new Prime Minister can expect turbulence. One likely reason for the leadership challenge was that the government’s poll standing indicated a loss of 35 seats in the impending election; that would have given opposition leader Tony Abbott’s coalition a huge majority. Labor MPs, who can also see the beginnings of an industrial slowdown, may be banking on the fact that Mr. Rudd’s ratings among probable Labor voters were better than Ms Gillard’s. They may even have been nervous of the gross sexism towards Ms Gillard that has repeatedly surfaced, revealing an ugly, misogynist strain in Australian public life. Mr. Rudd will, however, have to deal with serious problems over the carbon tax, which has voters fearing higher energy bills, and with the thorny issue of refugee policy; several Australian governments have been criticised for sending refugees to Nauru rather than admitting them to Australia for evaluation of their claims. Ms Gillard also faced Indigenous Australian resistance to uranium mining in traditional Indigenous lands. The Labor Party has, moreover, been hurt by this acrimonious second change of leaders; that only members of the federal parliament elect the leader both raises questions about intra-party democracy and can create a gulf between Labor MPs and their supporters, who may well wonder what the party stands for. Nevertheless Ms Gillard’s achievement in becoming her country’s first woman Prime Minister and in opening the way for more women will stand, and of that she can be proud.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rudds-revenge/article4878059.ece
5,7,2013,Premeditated murder,"There was never any doubt that Ishrat Jahan, her friend Javed Shaikh, and two others, all alleged players in a 2004 plot to kill Narendra Modi, were murdered in cold blood. The Gujarat government’s account of why and how the four were liquidated — referred to in police jargon as ‘encountered’ — was too full of inconsistencies to hold up to scrutiny. But the details that have unfolded in the Central Bureau of Investigation’s primary charge sheet against seven Gujarat policemen — among them senior Indian Police Service officers D.G. Vanzara and P.P. Pandey — are too horrific even by India’s notorious policing methods. What is worse, the charge sheet names the Gujarat police and State intelligence officers as collaborators in the operation, with the latter said to have been in on the kidnapping of the victims and to have supplied the weapons that were recovered from their bodies. The charge sheet discloses that Ishrat and Javed Shaikh were abducted from Vasad in Anand on June 12, 2004 and held captive for three days at various interrogation hideouts in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar before being drugged, blindfolded and driven to an isolated spot where they were shot dead along with their alleged co-conspirators from Pakistan, Zeeshan Johar and Amjad Ali Rana. Incredibly, the charge sheet says that the FIR relating to the ‘encounter’ was drafted before the event.
A crucial point that has emerged is that Johar and Rana were themselves not together and had been taken into custody one month apart, in April and May 2004. In other words, the would-be assassins hatched their plot to kill Mr. Modi even as they were under custody of the Gujarat police in different locations. While this fact by itself is hard to square with the widely circulated theory that Ishrat was a trained suicide bomber associated with the Lashkar-e-Taiba, the charge sheet has avoided going into this area for now. Another contentious question concerned the role played by Rajinder Kumar, the IB’s Special Director posted in Gujarat at the time. Mr. Kumar has not been formally charge sheeted but his name figures among those who the CBI says planned the killings. A supplementary charge sheet will likely elaborate on the conspiracy, and who participated in it. Though the aim of this murderous plot was evidently to generate a fear psychosis in the State and burnish the credentials of the Gujarat Chief Minister, there is nothing as yet in the public domain to justify holding Mr. Modi directly responsible. However, the fact that officers holding some of the highest posts in his administration could plan and execute these custodial killings indubitably tarnishes his political credentials.

5,7,2013,Egypt’s political abyss,"The Egyptian military coup led by General Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, purportedly as a response to days of public protests in which at least 16 people were killed, is an ominous development. The Constitutional Court’s seniormost judge, Adly Mansour, has been sworn in as interim President, but the deposed, democratically elected President, Mohammed Morsy, is under house arrest. According to reports, the interim government is searching for other members of the Muslim Brotherhood — the parent body to Mr. Morsy’s Freedom and Justice Party — apparently to arrest them. The coup is the latest in a series of political confrontations that have dogged Egypt since the widely acclaimed protests in Cairo’s Tahrir Square ended Hosni Mubarak’s 30-year dictatorship in February 2011. Those seemed to herald a genuinely democratic future for Egypt. Mr. Morsy was fairly elected in June 2012, but since then major political reforms have failed in the face of the inability of established Egyptian institutions to accept public accountability. The economy has slid to the point where Egypt may not even have hard currency to buy oil for export earners such as the textile industry. In addition, the Constitutional Court itself suspended the elected Parliament in June 2012, and Mr. Morsy attempted to take sweeping new powers in November 2012 but staged a partial climbdown in the face of the resulting controversy.
The army says fresh elections will be held and that it will then resume its normal duties, and there was huge public cheering when a council comprising General al-Sisi, Constitution Party leader Mohamed ElBaradei, Al Azhar Grand Imam Ahmed el-Tayeb, and Coptic Pope Tawadros II announced President Morsy’s ouster. Yet the military had earlier given all political bodies an absurdly short 48 hours to resolve their differences, and all the signs point to another crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood, which Mr. Mubarak subjected to vicious repression. While none can wish for that, the current standoff is bound to revive the power struggle between the military and the Brotherhood, which clearly has the support of Egypt’s socially conservative rural majority. Secondly, General al-Sisi’s mention of instability as a reason for the coup is a reminder both that the military was the country’s power elite for over 50 years — with a long record of corruption and other abuses of power — and that the ‘stability’ it imposed was tolerated by the West for suppressing claims by the Egyptian people for social justice, democracy and a just Israeli-Palestinian settlement. The military must hold the promised elections and quit politics, or all the gains of the Tahrir Square revolution will be tragically lost.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/egypts-political-abyss/article4881978.ece
6,7,2013,Food for politics,"The government has come good on its promise to put in place a food security architecture but the manner in which it has pushed through the historic measure, which gives roughly 67 per cent of the population a legal right over cheap food grains, suggests it was done with an eye on the 2014 general election. The ordinance route is an extraordinary move, considered legitimate only in situations of urgency. In this case, there was no such contingency, and indeed, the National Food Security Bill, which has already been tabled in the Lok Sabha, was a commitment the United Progressive Alliance government made in its 2009 manifesto. Of course, the Congress has its own justification for rushing with the ordinance, with the party’s new communication chief Ajay Maken calling it a “life saver, life changer for many people.” In reality, the government was unsure of being able to pass the Bill in the monsoon session of Parliament and with the next round of Assembly elections looming large, it did not want a situation where it would be trapped by the Model Code of Conduct and other such restrictions. In the event the Bill falls through in Parliament, party and government will undoubtedly be able to claim that while they were sincere in wanting to reach food to the poorest of the poor, they were defeated in this mission by an insensitive Opposition.
The draft National Food Security Bill is a compromise between what Congress president Sonia Gandhi wanted and what the Manmohan Singh government was willing to deliver. Public Distribution System reforms and revitalisation of the agriculture sector are pre-requisites for a rights-based food delivery system, but the government is still to unveil a road map for this. The weakest link in the chain is the lack of clarity on the criteria for identification of the beneficiaries. The intention is to make that choice based on the results of the Socio-Economic and Caste Census, expected to be available by October. There is also serious concern over the Bill’s failure to offer universal coverage in a country grappling with hunger and malnutrition. A partial scheme such as this one will have to deal with the pitfalls in the often subjective identification of target groups. For the law to take off in right earnest, the state apparatus will first have to be readied to take on the challenge. Given the reported 40 per cent diversion of foodgrains from the PDS into the open market, systems need to be strictly monitored to plug leakages, wastages and diversions. To make the scheme effective on the ground it is imperative to take on board the gram sabhas, farmers and consumers. Putting the cart before the horse will only sacrifice a well-intentioned programme.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/food-for-politics/article4885672.ece
6,7,2013,Fear unfounded,"With Britain recently deciding to proceed with draft regulations on the mitochondria replacement technique for preventing women from transmitting mitochondrial disorders to their children, the method joins the list of revolutionary fertility and embryology tools that have come under opposition and criticism. In the recent past, the somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) method has faced much resistance on ethical grounds. More than the real challenges of producing healthy organs for therapeutic use, it was the pro-life stand against the destruction of embryos for harvesting stem cells that grounded the path-breaking technique in many countries. In fact, phrasing the technique as ‘cloning’ had already prejudiced the public. Similarly, the idea of a woman, other than the mother, providing genetic material to a baby has not gone down well with everyone. As in the case of SCNT, opposition to the mitochondria replacement technique stems from the labelling — ‘three parents.’ While mitochondria from a healthy woman do provide some genetic material, the genes within do not in any way contribute to the working of the nuclear DNA that defines a person — in appearance and function. Mitochondria are the power producers of a cell and do not in any way contribute to the traits that make us humans. Hence, any fear that the latest development is a slippery slope that would lead to producing ‘designer babies’ is unfounded.
Another major concern is the long-term implication of using mitochondria from another woman as they are passed on from one generation to another. However, it must be noted that a woman contributes both nuclear DNA and mitochondria while a man contributes only nuclear DNA. The inheritance of donated mitochondria, which are passed down the maternal line, will stop with the succeeding generation if the baby is male. While the concerns and fear are baseless, the benefits are significant. In Britain alone, around one in 6,500 children is born annually with a severe mitochondrial disease like muscular dystrophy. Current methods can only reduce but not eliminate the risk; no treatment is available either. It is important to note that the British government has to change the law before the technique can be used. Even after it is legislated by the end of next year, it will take a few more years for this tool to become clinically available in the U.K.; more research needs to done to find out the safest method that can be used. By engaging the public prior to decision-making and allowing only licensed clinics to offer the technique, Britain has once again shown the way to go ahead with such sensitive scientific advancements.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fear-unfounded/article4885673.ece
8,7,2013,Letting freebies be,"Ensuring a level playing field is different from redrawing the rules of the game. While correctly holding that the promise of freebies in election manifestos by political parties would not come under “corrupt practices” and “electoral offences” defined in the Representation of the People Act, the Supreme Court went too far in directing the Election Commission of India to frame guidelines for regulating the contents of manifestos and in calling for a separate legislation in this regard. Of course, the EC is duty-bound to ensure a level playing field for all political parties, big and small, whether in a general election or in a by-election. To this purpose, it is empowered to put a cap on election expenses so as to not disadvantage smaller parties or independent candidates, and to check government spending in election-time so as to not disadvantage opposition parties. Indeed, the Model Code of Conduct for the Guidance of Political Parties and Candidates specifically bars “corrupt practices” and offences under the election law such as bribing, intimidation or impersonation of voters, canvassing near polling stations, and transport of voters to and from the election booth. However, any attempt to regulate the contents of manifestos can only be termed bizarre.
At stake is whether courts can sit in judgment over the policies and programmes of a political party, however ill-advised or impractical these might be. The Supreme Court did admit that “it is not within the domain of this court to legislate on what kind of promises can or cannot be made in the manifesto.” But what it could not do, it wants the EC to somehow push through. The apex court was willing to grant that the government had the right to decide how to implement the Directive Principles of State Policy, and that distributing largesse in the form of TVs, laptops and mixer-grinders to deserving persons was directly related to the Directive Principles. But strangely, the Bench also held that the distribution of freebies influenced all voters and shook the “root of free and fair elections to a large degree.” Election promises — whether of resource-draining, untargeted freebies or of progressive social welfare schemes — do not disturb the level playing field: after all, one promise can be matched by another. And, since a promise per se costs nothing, smaller parties are in no way handicapped in any competitive offering of freebies. Voters make choices on the basis of campaign promises and practical experience. The court may be right in expressing its disquiet over reckless populism, but the remedy for any fiscally irresponsible act by a political party can only lie with voters and not judges.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/letting-freebies-be/article4892115.ece
8,7,2013,Growing risks to stability,"In the latest edition of its half-yearly Financial Stability Report (FSR), the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has pointed out that global risks and domestic macroeconomic risks continue to be the two most important factors affecting the stability of the Indian financial system. While there might not be anything new in that observation — recent FSRs have emphasised much the same factors — the June report has been prepared in the shadow of major debates about the appropriateness, timing and pace of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s impending decision to end its highly unconventional monetary policies. This expectation has created tremors in financial markets across the globe. The rupee tumbled against the dollar to fall below Rs.60 simply on the basis of unconfirmed reports that the Fed would be phasing out its ultrasoft monetary policy sooner than expected. Practically all major emerging markets have witnessed large-scale sell-offs in their currency, bond and equity markets. India’s external sector vulnerabilities have been exposed. A critical and even fatal dependence on fleet-footed capital flows is in evidence along with the paucity of policy measures to shore up the balance of payments on a more sustained basis. Two reports released on the same day as the FSR — a snapshot of external debt as of end March 2013 and the balance of payments assessment during the last quarter of 2012-13 — are not encouraging.
India’s external debt has risen by nearly 13 per cent over March 2012. Quite disconcertingly, there is an unhealthy bunching up of short-term loans due for repayment by March 2014. The current account deficit remains high at 4.8 per cent of GDP and has been a major factor behind the rupee’s recent depreciation. Many corporates who borrowed abroad have been reckless in not hedging their exchange rate risks and are thus contributing to macroeconomic instability. Risks to the banking sector have increased marginally over the past six months, with tight liquidity and deteriorating asset quality being the main causes. In the RBI’s estimate, if current macroeconomic conditions continue, the credit quality of banks could deteriorate but all of them have enough capital to withstand pressures. Life insurance products are dominated by single premium policies. There are question marks over the funding of some of the newly defined benefit plans and these could strain the insurers on the maturity dates. In an obvious reference to recent scams in certain banks, the FSR cites instances of mis-selling financial products, mostly insurance products and other wealth management services. The overall message from the seventh FSR is that while the financial system is stable for now, it faces increased risks from home and abroad.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/growing-risks-to-stability/article4892116.ece
9,7,2013,"Protect, don’t snoop","Much like the space it aims to protect, India’s cyber security policy, launched this week, is characterised by a striking duality of purpose. On the one hand, it seeks to guard, and thus strengthen, the country’s strategic assets and online intelligence infrastructure. On the other, it hopes to secure the transactions of citizens, companies and public services on the web. The latter, more enabling goal is intended to promote the volume of e-commerce and the reliability of e-governance in India. But any attempt to harmonise the two objectives must be weighed against the United Progressive Alliance’s track record on Internet regulation. This cyber security policy emerges from a government that has systematically brought its legislative tools (Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000) and surveillance machinery (the Central Monitoring System) to bear adversely on privacy. Protecting cyber space, as the policy acknowledges, involves streamlining best practices in data security, identifying sensitive and vulnerable online content, and monitoring compliance — aspects that require entrenched collaboration between various government bodies, telecom and Internet giants, corporate entities, as well as enforcement agencies. Therefore, it is important to ensure the cyber security policy does not end up institutionalising the flow of private data to the government’s already vast and unregulated snooping systems.
Unfortunately, this is precisely the direction the policy takes in its current avatar. The UPA has sought to create national nodal agencies to “coordinate all matters relating to cyber security,” a task that includes spelling out policy guidelines, managing crises, and performing periodic security audits. The power to propose, implement and monitor India’s cyber security regulations has been concentrated in the hands of a few agencies without specifying what participatory role, if any, civil society and industry will play in them. Where Information and Communication Technology guidelines are prescriptive, the government plans to offer tax incentives for companies conforming to them, effectively coercing the latter into obedience. Most importantly, the policy fails to address the scope of oversight, parliamentary or judicial, that such entities will be subject to. Already, India’s CMS thrives on telephonic and internet surveillance that is unbridled by law. Where legislation exists, like in the United States, Britain and France, it has struggled to keep pace with changes in technology. The UPA’s cyber security policy is a laudable attempt to stay ahead of this curve. But the government should now orient its goals towards protecting India’s networked society and economy, not policing them.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/protect-dont-snoop/article4895582.ece
9,7,2013,The old order changeth,"Did the rash of upsets, which saw top-ranking players drop like flies, diminish Wimbledon 2013? Those who believe so have probably failed to appreciate the message in the madness. Obscured in the wild uncertainties of this year’s tournament were subtle signs of a shift in tennis’s old order and the emergence of a breed of bold new challengers. This is true of both draws, but particularly so in the women’s. The fall of the likes of Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova was accompanied by the emergence of a raft of fresh talent, including the reflexive Sabine Lisicki, the thoughtful Angeiszka Radwanska, and the aggressive young British and American hopes, Laura Robson and Sloane Stephens. It may have been the 28-year-old Marion Bartoli who finally won the day, but the future of women’s tennis is now so wide open that upsets and surprises may well extend beyond this year’s Wimbledon. As for the men, there is no discounting the emergence of aspirants such as the alarmingly powerful Pole Jerzy Janowicz, who showed he has all the attributes for future greatness, and the Argentine Juan Martin Del Potro, whose brutal epic against top-seeded Novak Djokovic was one of the best matches in recent memory.
But this tournament also signals some more subtle shifts at the top of the men’s order with an ageing Roger Federer and an increasingly injury-prone Rafael Nadal. The emergence of a new Wimbledon champion in Andy Murray, who held his game to defeat Novak Djokovic in straight sets, could mark the beginning of an era in which the Murray-Djokovic faceoff replaces the Federer-Nadal contest as the principal one in men’s tennis. Murray’s victory comes on the heels of performances that suggest that he is ready to finally live up to his talent, which seem almost otherwordly on some points. The narrative of Murray’s progress as a tennis player seems to have changed with his U.S. Open victory last year and his record since then speaks for it. After signing on Ivan Lendl as coach, there has been a marked change in the attitude of the British player on court. The fog of sullenness, which resulted in outbreaks of self-defeating anger, seems to have lifted to reveal a quieter and more determined intensity. He seems less discouraged when down, less upset when luck turns against him and far more trusting of himself to overcome adversity. It is possible that Djokovic, who played immaculate tennis for most of the fortnight, may have been handicapped by the after-effects of a physically and emotionally draining semi-final against Del Potro. But it was Murray’s resolve and confidence that won himself and Britain the Wimbledon crown after a gap of 77 years.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-old-order-changeth/article4895581.ece
10,7,2013,No enlightenment after Bodh Gaya,"Once again, the gaping holes in India’s armour against terrorism stand exposed. Immediately after Sunday’s >multiple explosions at the Mahabodhi temple complex in Bodh Gaya and sites nearby, the Ministry of Home Affairs was quick to point out there had been several intelligence reports that the shrine, revered by Buddhists the world over, could be targeted by terrorists. Fortunately, no lives were lost in the attacks, nor has the temple, or the tree under which the Buddha is said to have gained enlightenment, been damaged. But the MHA’s assertion immediately raises old, depressingly familiar questions: after the Bihar government was told the site was in the crosshairs of terrorists, why did it not take adequate measures to counter the threat? In all, 13 bombs were planted at various locations, of which 10 exploded. The temple was clearly not sufficiently protected, to the extent that the perpetrators went undetected even while they placed an explosive device at considerable height on an 80-foot Buddha statue. Countering the terrorist threat needs the Centre and the State to work seamlessly at all levels — information sharing, real time analysis of specific threats, and that most vital link in the chain, putting in place the men and measures to prevent threats from coming true. The >Centre believes the National Counter-Terrorism Centre is the answer, but the constitutional overreach in the initial blueprint gave the project such a bad name that even a diluted version has failed to persuade non-UPA State governments to support it.
As if the security failings have not been demoralising enough, there is the immature conduct of politicians to contend with. The Bodh Gaya attack immediately led to speculation that the Indian Mujahideen — an alleged operative of the group arrested last year is said to be the source of the pre-warning — did it to avenge recent anti-Muslim violence in Myanmar. This has yet to be established. Hopefully, footage from the cameras and other forensic material at the temple will provide investigators with clues to track down the bombers. Sadly, the absence of concrete leads hasn’t prevented some from jumping to conclusions about the incident, and senior leaders in the Congress, BJP and RJD have lost no time in using the bomb attack to score political points against each other and the Nitish Kumar government. Congress leader Digvijay Singh has blithely suggested a link between the attacks and the JD(U)’s recent exit from the BJP-led opposition alliance. All this only adds to the sense that India’s political class lacks the capacity to understand or deal with the seriousness of the threat that terrorism poses to the country.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-enlightenment-after-bodh-gaya/article4898763.ece
10,7,2013,A blow for dignity and decency,"“Latin America neither wants, nor has any reason, to be a pawn without a will of its own,” declared Colombian author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, upon receiving the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982. True to their independent spirit, the underdogs of the international community have once again stepped up to the plate, this time in el caso Snowden. While powerful nations, including India, fell over themselves to please or aid the United States in its pursuit of Edward Snowden the fugitive, three Latin American nations chose courageously to offer asylum to Edward Snowden the whistleblower. Bolivia, Nicaragua and Venezuela, who have opened their arms to him, were no doubt spurred by the shocking mistreatment of Bolivian President Evo Morales in Europe last week. His plane, returning to La Paz from Moscow, was forced to land in Austria after France, Italy, Portugal and Spain closed their airspace to it on the unfounded claim that Mr. Snowden was on board. Mr. Morales was left stranded for several hours in Vienna. During this time, Austrian officials, who say they did not formally search the plane, established, nevertheless, that the former National Security Agency contractor was not a passenger. Europe’s actions were not only insensitive to Mr. Snowden’s right to seek asylum under international law, but also a flagrant violation of the immunity Mr. Morales enjoys as a head of state.
The countries that closed their airspace to the Bolivian President were purportedly acting on the basis of ‘information’ — read: instructions — from the U.S. on the whereabouts of Mr. Snowden. If the whole episode smacks of both craven behaviour and high-handedness on the part of the Europeans, the offers of asylum emanating from Latin America remind us that Washington’s writ no longer runs large on the global stage. Those dismissive of the three countries as ‘leftist regimes’ out to settle scores with the U.S. forget they have been joined in solidarity by other governments in the region. The Union of South American Nations, broadly representative of the entire continent, has unequivocally condemned Europe’s action against President Morales. This is not the first time Latin America’s sovereign rights have been regarded as inconsequential by European powers. Last year, the United Kingdom had threatened to raid Ecuador’s embassy in London to arrest WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who had sought refuge there. Far from giving in to such threats, Quito granted asylum to Mr. Assange. In Mr. Snowden’s case, history has merely repeated itself; and it will continue to do so, until the West realises it cannot sway international politics through the brash display of power.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-blow-for-dignity-and-decency/article4898762.ece
11,7,2013,A caustic rebuke,"The Supreme Court’s ultimatum to the Centre to come up with a plan by July 16 to stop the unauthorised retail sale of acid, or face a ban on all sales, is a deserved rebuke. Horrific >instances of acid violence against women have failed to stir the government to act on the one single factor that is aiding the perpetrators — the easy availability of the chemical, at throwaway prices. The effort to end the disfiguring and often fatal attacks has progressed only in the realm of lawmaking. Stringent provisions have been introduced in the Indian Penal Code through the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, providing for a minimum of 10 years imprisonment for causing hurt by acid, extendable to life and with fine, the latter payable to the victim, besides the compensation available from the State government. Attempts to throw acid attract a five-year minimum sentence. That is welcome, but lawmaking is only part of the solution. The wide availability of the chemical — ranging from moderately corrosive cleaning acid in supermarkets, to concentrated forms used in industries such as dyeing, rubber curing, leather and gold purification — must be replaced by a system of checks and licensing. There is wholehearted national support for regulation of retail sale, and the legal battle to achieve this has wound on for seven years in the highest court. Yet, the Centre and the States have reacted with supine indifference.
>Acid attack victims have been demanding that the deadly liquid be treated as an explosive, and brought under the purview of the Explosives Act. This would restrict the movement, storage and distribution of the material, and ensure that transactions at all levels are properly recorded, particularly at the point of sale. It would also introduce much-needed accountability for producers and users in industry. As the Law Commission had noted in its 226th report, regular checks and inspections are confined to explosives. Although acids are included under rules governing hazardous chemicals, regulatory procedures are confined to industrial handling and transit. The Centre must urgently address this lacuna by prescribing a strict regime for retail distribution, including sales on the Internet. It is pertinent to point out that the dispensing of many prescription drugs, particularly psychiatric medicines, has been tightened to prevent misuse, and the system is generally working well. Acid distribution can be similarly channelled through chosen outlets, and the purchaser made responsible for ultimate use. State governments, which have thus far failed to even adequately compensate victims, must work closely with the Centre to stop the gruesome attacks.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-caustic-rebuke/article4902470.ece
11,7,2013,The Munde moment,"Gopinath Munde’s ‘confession’ at a recent public event in Mumbai that he had spent Rs. 8 crore on his poll campaign in 2009 stands out for its cynicism. The spending limit for a Lok Sabha constituency in the State that year was Rs. 25 lakh (it is now Rs. 40 lakh). The former Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra admitted to spending 40 times the amount he put down in his poll accounts. Dignifying his disclosure of this as opening up a debate on “more realistic” spending limits is nonsense. Money power has already savaged Indian elections. If Rs. 8 crore or more were to become the spending norm, the electorate would be reduced, legally, to voting for its favourite millionaires. Look at the United States, where the last presidential election saw spending of nearly $ 3 billion. Less than two per cent of Americans are millionaires, but 56 per cent of Senators and 47 per cent of members of the House of Representatives are. The less affluent cannot hope to enter a contest, let alone win it. As the fine work of the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) shows us, India is fast moving down that road. Mr. Munde is urging us to complete the journey.
In his contempt for the electoral process, though, Mr. Munde has the Manmohan Singh government firmly on his side. This March, in the now notorious ‘paid news’ case involving former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan, the Union Law Ministry filed a ‘counter affidavit’ in the Supreme Court arguing that the Election Commission of India has no powers to disqualify a candidate on grounds of fraudulent poll accounts. The court is yet to rule on that. Meanwhile, consider that Mr. Munde broke the law, knowingly filed wrong accounts, and now mocks the EC. In his ‘confession’ speech, he hoped there were no EC authorities present in the audience. But even if there were, he went on, nothing much could happen since elections were just months away. However, the EC has issued him a notice, which could, in principle, lead to action against him under the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 and possibly to his disqualification under the Representation of the People Act. Only one sitting legislator, Umlesh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh, has ever been disqualified by the EC on grounds of suppressing the actual amount spent in an election. That was in 2011 for suppressing expenditure of Rs. 21,250, barely 0.03 per cent of the amount Mr. Munde kept out of his poll accounts. The EC, the judiciary and the public must convert the opportunity that Mr. Munde’s ‘slip of the tongue’ has provided to crack down on money power and malpractice in elections. And to begin the serious poll reforms we so badly need.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-munde-moment/article4902471.ece
12,7,2013,Judicial overreach,"However well-intentioned the Supreme Court might be in its efforts to cleanse the political system of criminals, its >decision to bar any person who is in jail or in police custody from contesting an election to legislative bodies is a case of the remedy being worse than the disease. By extending the curtailment of the right to vote of a person in prison or lawful police custody to the right of the person to stand in an election, the Supreme Court has, in effect, left the door open for the practice of vendetta politics by ruling parties. All that politicians in power now need to do to prevent rivals from contesting an election is to ask the police to file a case and effect arrest. As per the 2004 judgment of the Patna High Court in Jan Chaukidar v Union of India — upheld by the Supreme Court on Wednesday — all those in lawful police or judicial custody, other than those held in preventive detention, will forfeit their right to stand for election. The judges relied on the Representation of the People Act (RPA), which says that one of the qualifications for membership of Parliament or State legislature is that the contestant must be an elector. Since Section 62(5) of the Act prevents those in lawful custody from voting, the reasoning goes, those in such custody are not qualified for membership of legislative bodies. But law enforcers are notorious for carrying out the orders of their political masters. Confusion and chaos will necessarily follow this order of the Supreme Court unless it is tempered along the lines suggested by the Election Commission, which wants only those cases in which charges are framed six months prior to an election to be taken into account.
Less controversial is the >court’s decision to declare Section 8(4) of the RPA ultra vires of the Constitution. Sitting MPs and MLAs will now automatically be disqualified upon being convicted of a serious crime rather than after all their appeals are exhausted. In India, appeals drag on for years, and certainly for more than five or six years, which is the tenure of an elected representative. Politicians have often taken cover under this section to continue as legislators long after the slow wheels of the law have caught up with them. But here too, there could be complications. An acquittal on appeal during the tenure of the legislature is one. Moreover, a by-election to fill a seat vacated by a convict takes time and a government surviving on a wafer-thin majority could be jeopardised. Governments should be allowed to continue until by-elections are held to fill vacancies caused by such disqualifications. Instead of taking a narrowly legalistic view, courts should also consider the likely practical consequences of their judgments.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/judicial-overreach/article4905788.ece
12,7,2013,Helping towns take flight,"The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has recently come up with two welcome proposals that aim to promote the development and use of smaller airports in the country. In the first move, the >AAI plans to go in for tax-free bonds of up to Rs. 1000 crore to modernise some of the smaller, non-metro airports. In its other initiative, the Authority intends to offer a three-year concession scheme for airlines willing to operate to a select lot of smaller airports. To at least about 15 such airports, the AAI proposes to extend a 75 per cent concession on landing and related handling charges in the first year, 50 per cent in the second year, 25 per cent in the third and normal charges from the fourth year. The expectation seems to be that once traffic gets generated from these centres, the airlines will be able to make them viable operations. The plan is to plough some funds this year to improve facilities in 15 airports, and over a period of time, to promote 51 other smaller airports. The bulk of these will be in central and western States, in addition to Uttar Pradesh. While Finance Minister P. Chidambaram has already backed the plan for State-run agencies to issue tax-free bonds of up to Rs. 50,000 crore, the Civil Aviation Ministry has yet to clear the proposal to introduce a concession scheme for airlines to fly to small centres.
The >move to promote smaller airports should be a welcome signal for Air Asia, a new private joint venture airline that is set to begin operations in India this October. The AAI has offered its scheme to all airlines willing to consider this option. The idea will work well for an airline thinking of developing ‘hub-and-spoke’ operations. In this concept, airlines operate feeder services from the small (spoke) centres to a regional hub, from where regular flights connect to the major and metropolitan cities in the country, in addition to providing links to international services. Though the Government of India did its best to encourage a concessional approach to ensure air services for the northeastern Indian States, the results have not been too successful. This despite the fact that air services provide the easiest and quickest connection to these States. A decade ago, low-cost carriers such as Air Deccan came like a whiff of fresh breeze to connect India’s smaller cities by air. But as costs rose, operators found that these flights were not always viable. A combination of concessions in both landing charges and the VAT on aviation fuel, which the State governments must offer, ought to make these routes profitable over the medium term. The Civil Aviation Ministry must take the initiative to push this concept as soon as it can.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/helping-towns-take-flight/article4905789.ece
13,7,2013,"Organs, made to order","Producing fully functional human organs using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) will, in the foreseeable future, cease to remain in the realm of science fiction. In a game-changing study published recently in Nature, a team of Japanese scientists led by Takanori Takebe from the Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine has taken a giant step by providing proof-of-concept demonstration of a “functional” miniature human liver that produced blood proteins and broke down drugs when transplanted into a mouse. This is the first time >a rudimentary functional human organ has been produced using iPS cells. Though it might take about a decade for the technique to reach clinical application, it marks a “promising approach” for regenerative medicine. The same technique can be used to grow other organs like kidneys and pancreas. Even as others have had little success in growing liver and other organs, Mr. Takebe’s team adopted a novel approach to produce in lab three-dimensional liver buds with blood vessels. Unlike others who used only cell lines of the organ they wanted to grow, the Japanese team closely mimicked the conditions that exist during the very early stages of organ development. For this, cell lines from liver buds — a primitive, condensed liver mass that starts forming on the third or fourth week of gestation — were mixed with a few other essential cell lines. While reprogrammed adult stem cells are capable of becoming specialised cells, this study has highlighted that functional organs cannot be grown using the iPS cells alone. The presence of other cells that are normally found during the early stages of organ formation is essential.
But the need for >liver stem cell therapy or even transplantation should never arise as, unlike other organs, the liver exhibits excellent regenerative capacity; it can heal when less than 70 per cent of the organ is damaged. While the liver’s failure due to moderate alcohol consumption can be prevented by providing it sufficient time every year to heal, >liver failure due to hepatitis B infection can be easily avoided by getting vaccinated. Unfortunately, as the recent WHO figure indicates, a vast majority of Indians are not vaccinated against hepatitis B — over one million Indians are infected by hepatitis B, resulting in about 250,000 deaths annually. Hepatitis C kills about 100,000 Indians every year. While the hepatitis B vaccine is given to children as part of their immunisation programme since 2007, the vast majority of adults are not vaccinated. This is an irony, considering that the vaccine — three doses of which cost only a few hundred rupees — is one of the cheapest and most effective shields against a mass killer.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/organs-made-to-order/article4909343.ece
13,7,2013,Go beyond tinkering,"Adapting tools of governance to suit evolving needs is essential to bring administrative systems up to speed. The Union >government’s recent decision to restructure centrally sponsored schemes, merging them to more than halve the number in order to improve implementation, was one such move. Now, its decision to disband District Rural Development Agency units in those States where they still exist is a step in the same direction. Their separate, independent and autonomous existence did not make them quite amenable to functioning as professional units, and the move to attach the mechanism to district panchayat bodies could help address this issue, while also possibly containing overheads. Over the 33 years they have been in existence, DRDAs have admittedly fallen short of meeting their objectives. As the number of schemes and the quantum of funds they oversaw grew, the challenges multiplied. In the context of the centrality given to panchayati raj institutions and the growing role of community-owned institutions such as self help groups, the need to attune and align DRDAs with them also grew. The professional staffing component of DRDA is relatively small; generalist ministerial staff abound. Lack of training led to poor understanding of, and sensitivity and commitment to, >poverty alleviation programmes. Overall, the decision to restructure and streamline the DRDA mechanism will, hopefully, solve many ills.
That said, two points need emphasis. One, the new set-up should not get rural development efforts mired in the routine of the bureaucracy. There should be enough leeway available to adapt to local needs and conditions, rather than be caught in a national straitjacket. Two, mere tinkering with systems can hardly lead to desired outcomes given India’s stupendous challenges in fighting poverty. Rural development should spell comprehensive and integrated development with stress on closing the glaring divides. For this to happen, the implementation mechanism for poverty alleviation programmes should seek participatory rights-based goals. Only those initiatives that recognise the capabilities of the poor and their desire to come out of poverty, and build their action strategies around groups of the poor, can hope to succeed. For this to happen, arms of the government should develop sensitive support mechanisms that could act as catalysts and facilitators of change. They should create and nurture sustainable institutions of the underprivileged. Unless the changes initiated in the anti-poverty programme implementation mechanism help serve this purpose, India’s development dreams will remain unfulfilled.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/go-beyond-tinkering/article4909354.ece
15,7,2013,Bhutan’s change of guard,"The long election process in Bhutan has ended in the >victory of the opposition People’s Democratic Party. The election, Bhutan’s second after it became a parliamentary democracy in 2008, was a two-stage process, in which two political parties were eliminated in the first round, leaving the remaining two to battle it out in the final round. While the results of stage 1, held in May, indicated that the ruling Druk Phuensum Tshogpa (DPT) was on a strong wicket, the opposition PDP won 32 of the 47 National Assembly seats in the run-off. A combination of factors led to the >PDP victory, including the dynamism of its leader, Tshering Togbay, a former civil servant. The PDP’s focus on ‘ >Gross National Happiness’ — a concept that had caught the world’s imagination — as nothing more than an empty slogan also seems to have had considerable resonance. In the final few weeks though, India’s >decision to end a subsidy to Bhutan for cooking gas and kerosene, sending up the prices of these two fuels, brought relations with India squarely into the election campaign. Despite New Delhi’s strenuous denials that the withdrawal was not aimed at influencing the election, the timing was certainly odd. That the state of Indian finances was so precarious that it could not shoulder the burden for a few more days was not lost in Bhutan. The previous DPT government’s overtures to China were quickly identified as the possible reason for the Indian action. This gave the PDP a handle to blame Prime Minister Jigme Thinley for mishandling relations with India, on which Bhutan is massively dependent for almost all its development, economic and security assistance.
It is difficult to determine how much this imbroglio actually affected the eventual outcome. Even if it played no part, New Delhi must desist from using its privileged position in Bhutan to play games of the sort it did with Nepal or risk alienating another neighbour. Already, DPT sympathisers are blaming New Delhi for the party’s defeat. Under the 2007 renegotiated India-Bhutan Treaty of Friendship, Thimphu’s foreign policy is its own. Ensuring it will not act against New Delhi’s strategic interests requires constructive diplomacy and an engagement with all political players, not interference. The India controversy was the only discordant note in an otherwise smooth election. The 66 per cent turnout in the run-off was much lower than the 79.4 per cent in 2008. But the full-throated campaign, the keenness with which it was followed by the public at large, the debates it generated in Bhutan’s print and social media, all showed that by and large, the Himalayan nation has settled in its new democratic groove.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bhutans-change-of-guard/article4915204.ece
15,7,2013,Dynasty in Jharkhand,"Jharkhand has played true to form in acquiring one more >Chief Minister — the ninth since it was carved out of Bihar in recognition of its tribal character and to uplift its people from endemic poverty and deprivation. That lofty goal has of course been forgotten in the rush by a procession of rulers to feather their own nests. Indeed, Hemant Soren’s elevation to Chief Minister comes against a background of broken promises and amassment of wealth by a succession of regimes brought down by their own brinkmanship games and misconduct. Add to this the young Chief Minister’s inexperience, the fickle nature of Jharkhand’s political loyalties, and the slow withdrawal from active public life of his father Shibhu Soren, and it could be anybody’s guess if and how long the new regime would last. The complexities inherent in the situation must explain why the Congress chose not to jump into the vacuum left behind by exit of the JMM-BJP government. That government was doomed to fail because the two parties had manoeuvred themselves into an alliance despite being placed at two ends of the ideological spectrum. The pact finally broke in January 2013 over the JMM’s growing proximity to the Congress.
The Congress’s first instinct was to stay clear of government formation machinations fearing the damages to its electoral prospects from another failed experiment. However, with the passage of time, party strategists appear to have reasoned that there were larger dividends to be had from exploiting the JMM’s desperation to return to power. Towards this end, they placed before the JMM a demand for extending the alliance into the general election. The JMM, in turn, asked for the pact to apply to neighbouring Bihar and two other States with tribal population — Orissa and Chhattisgarh. The Congress added West Bengal to this package. The deal has helped the senior Soren realise his dream to install his son as Chief Minister before his own failing health rendered him unfit for negotiations. But governance is easier envisioned than executed in Jharkhand. For an idea of what awaits Soren Junior just consider this fact: among his supporters are seven legislators who are either independents or belong to smaller parties, many of them with dubious track records. The Congress has taken a calculated risk in Jharkhand, seeing it as part of a larger alliance-making exercise ahead of 2014. However, with its fortunes sinking across the country, it might need more than just smart seat adjustments to take it past the victory post.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dynasty-in-jharkhand/article4915205.ece
16,7,2013,Banking after the sting,"Wealth management services (WMS) undertaken by banks have gained substantial prominence in the reform era. With bank managements forced to look for additional avenues to boost profitability, catering to the rich through special products and niche services became common practice even among public sector banks. At the same time, disintermediation has been gaining hold in the financial sector, giving traditional bank customers ample choice in parking their savings in a variety of non-banking products such as mutual funds. As stock markets boomed, it was a question of time before well-heeled bank customers — now referred to inelegantly as high net worth individuals (HNIs) — forced banks to offer market-related products. Public sector banks faced a stark choice: either allow HNI accounts to migrate to private Indian or foreign banks or offer these services, even if at the risk of breaching rules and regulations.
The regulation of WMS has been sparse and vests with different agencies like the RBI, SEBI and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority. The need to bring decades-old regulatory rules up to date has been felt not just because of the tremendous growth in the volume and range of businesses that go under the broad category of WMS but also because as many as 25 banks, three prominent private banks earlier and very recently 22 banks, both public and private, were found guilty of stretching even these minimal rules and slapped with stiff fines. Their complicity in aiding and abetting tax evasion and possibly money laundering, all in the name of providing value-added services to clients, is a matter of serious concern. More so because the sting operation by the website, Cobrapost, also showed them having scant regard for well-established account opening procedures such as know-your-customer rules. Reframing guidelines is an important step, but it will be more productive if individual banks put in place an enforceable control mechanism to weed out abuses. The RBI is prescribing new guidelines for three services under WMS — referral, investment advisory and portfolio management services. It is certain that not all the activities that banks undertake under WMS can be covered by guidelines, however well drafted. Besides, activities such as portfolio management services are undertaken by a number of others, especially stock brokers. Traditionally, banks have kept away from stock market activities and for very good reasons too. It is perhaps time to try a new approach by conferring special licences to entities including banks to undertake key WMS activities in separate structures. Banks can then pursue their traditional activities of deposit taking and lending without fear of being driven by unhealthy competition.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/banking-after-the-sting/article4918145.ece
16,7,2013,The right to choose,"A personal tragedy which shattered an Indian family living in Ireland has catalysed that country’s political class to debate and overhaul one of its oldest and most restrictive laws. Savita Halappanavar, who left Karnataka with her husband to raise a family in Ireland, suffered a fatal miscarriage in October 2012 after being denied the abortion she requested. Her shocking and preventable death has not been in vain. Last week, members of the Irish Parliament’s lower house, the Dáil Éireann, passed the >Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill, 2013, which allows medical practitioners to terminate a pregnancy if it poses a “substantial” or “immediate” risk to the mother’s life. The law heeds the recommendations of an investigative report commissioned by Ireland’s Health Service Executive, which lambasted extant regulations that deterred Mrs. Halappanavar’s doctors from performing a life-saving abortion, rendering them insensitive to her health. Upon its final enactment, the Bill will offer considerable latitude to Ireland’s doctors in evaluating and, where needed, aborting risky pregnancies on a case-to-case basis, presumably in consultation with patients and their families. Nevertheless, the law is still some distance away from embracing a ‘pro-choice’ approach: an amendment introduced by women TDs that would have permitted the termination of pregnancies arising from rape or incest failed to win support in the Dáil.
If this development highlights the declining influence of the Roman Catholic Church, which is staunchly opposed to abortion, in Irish politics, the Church has left no stone unturned to defeat the Bill. Not all Catholic countries, however, have opened their doors to progressive abortion law. Latin America’s record on this count has been abysmal. Six countries in the region still endorse a blanket ban on abortion — among them Chile, where an 11-year-old girl, pregnant after being raped by her mother’s partner, was in the news recently for announcing her decision to “have the baby.” Far from expressing their concern at the girl’s declaration — doubtless extracted through coercion — Chilean lawmakers have, rather deplorably, given their thumbs-up to it. One politician claimed the child was “prepared” to be a mother, given that her menstrual cycle had begun. He later apologised. President Sebastian Piñera has waded straight into the controversy by praising the girl’s “depth and maturity.” If only depth and maturity were transferable attributes, the girl could pass them on to Mr. Piñera and other politicians around the world who continue to deny women their rights to reproductive health and autonomy over their bodies.
This editorial has been corrected to incorporate the following correction:

17,7,2013,Perpetuating short-termism,"The measures announced by the Reserve Bank of India on Monday evening, aimed at restricting credit to banks and curbing speculation in the foreign currency markets, reflect the central bank’s growing helplessness in the face of the rupee’s free fall against the dollar. Since the beginning of June, the >rupee has lost 5.51 per cent. On July 8, it touched an all-time low of 61.21/$. More conventional >RBI intervention — selling dollars, usually through public sector banks — has had temporary results, with the rupee stabilising for a short while only to resume its downward path. Besides, the extent of central bank intervention is constrained by the availability of dollars in its hands. Drawing down forex reserves to bolster the rupee is never a healthy option and obviously cannot be continued indefinitely. That explains why the RBI chose on Monday to target liquidity in the banking system rather than the exchange rates directly. The measures announced include a Rs.12,000 crore open market sale of bonds, fixing a lower borrowing limit for banks and raising the interest rate on the marginal standing facility (MSF). The last is an emergency funding option available to banks from the RBI, with its interest rate aligned to the repo rate. The new rate, 10.25 per cent, is 3 percentage points above the repo rate; and, despite denials from the Finance Minister, might well portend a tighter than anticipated monetary policy statement two weeks from now.
Concerns over the rupee’s sharp decline have dominated recent macroeconomic policy discourse in other ways too. The financial markets’ sharp reaction to the reported tapering off of the ultrasoft monetary policies of the U.S. Federal Reserve might be an overreaction but it has clearly exposed the external economy’s vulnerabilities, especially in the context of the large current account deficit. Exports are still to pick up and the recent fall in gold imports will be offset by the higher petroleum import bill. Unfortunately, India does not seem to be pursuing any option other than continuing to woo portfolio flows and encouraging corporate houses to continue borrowing from abroad, at least in the short term. The rupee’s fall has shown the pitfalls of these two policies. In June, there has been a big sell-off in India’s equity and debt markets and this has been in tandem with the fall in the rupee. Indian companies which were encouraged to borrow abroad are now saddled with substantially higher repayment obligations. Of the medium-term strategies discussed, the flotation of a quasi-sovereign bond issue to tap non-resident Indians needs to be pursued with circumspection. There are a number of hidden costs, as past bond issues show, besides regulatory hurdles.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/perpetuating-shorttermism/article4921423.ece
17,7,2013,Cricket’s uneven morality,"The >first Ashes Test at Trent Bridge was something of an instant classic. But as engaging as the contest was, it was nearly eclipsed by an incident that tested the cricket world’s internal logic. In choosing to remain at the wicket after edging a ball, England’s Stuart Broad did what countless batsmen before him have done. But this time was different. The act’s rank obviousness; the significance of the stage; the immersive, amplified coverage, not least on social media sites where matters quickly escalate: each contributed to the cricket world focusing on ‘walking’ more intensely than ever before. The irony involving the lead actors outlined the debate. The catcher, Michael Clarke, captains a team that has traditionally “let the umpire make the decision,” Adam Gilchrist being an exception. Clarke himself edged Anil Kumble to first slip in the fractious Sydney Test of 2008 and stood his ground before being sent on his way. As for the batsman, in June his father, match referee Chris Broad, banned Denesh Ramdin for two Champions Trophy matches. He judged that the West Indian wicketkeeper had failed to uphold the Spirit of Cricket in not telling the umpires that the ball had slipped from his grasp.
At the heart of the issue is cricket’s uneven interpretation of morality. The game sees bowlers who appeal excessively with disfavour and fielders who routinely claim ‘50-50’ chances with censure. But batsmen who as a breed refuse to ‘walk’ do no wrong. Indeed, many cricketers hold that ‘walkers’ are selfish and unprofessional. Gilchrist’s decision didn’t endear him to his team-mates. This conditioned bias — a consequence first of the English class system and then the game’s structure, both of which have privileged the batsman — has remained unchecked by cricket’s legal system. In the Spirit of Cricket, written in 2000 as the Preamble to the Laws, all instances of on-field “cheating or sharp practice” pertain to the bowling side. So “to appeal knowing that the batsman is not out” violates the Spirit, but to stay at the crease knowing one is out doesn’t. To be fair, both the Laws and the ICC’s Code of Conduct contain catch-all clauses that can be used to sanction what Stuart Broad did. But the disparity with which the ICC has acted in Ramdin and Broad’s cases shows what it thinks of the matter. And yet this incident has the potential to drive change: the increased awareness that has come as a consequence of visibility, and the questioning of the ethics involved, could lead to a more enlightened perception of ‘walking’. But as things stand, Broad is merely guilty of individual dishonesty; by cricket’s canons, his wasn’t an act of immorality.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/crickets-uneven-morality/article4921426.ece
18,7,2013,The poisoned plate,"The fatal consequences of having a routine midday meal for at least 22 children in Bihar’s Saran district expose the chronic neglect of school education in a large part of India. That governments cannot find a small piece of land for a school and are unable to store food materials without the risk of contamination is a telling commentary on their commitment to universal primary education. The Bihar horror clearly points to the absence of strong normative procedures for the provision of infrastructure, even for a new school. Such inefficiency and indifference is deplorable, considering that the Centre has been levying a cess on taxes, part of which is given to States to strengthen the Mid Day Meal Scheme; the collection stood at Rs. 27,461 crore during 2011-12. If the preliminary evidence pointing to food poisoning and ingestion of yellow phosphorous — which is used in fertilizers and as rat poison — is confirmed as the cause of the tragedy, it points to a colossal failure to observe minimum food safety standards. It is a matter of concern that man-made tragedies such as these can shake the faith of the citizen in a crucial welfare programme, rightly lauded as the biggest school meal programme in the world covering 10.54 crore children.
The scheme has the vital objective of providing specified levels of calories and protein to pre-primary and primary school students. It achieves a lot more, by involving the entire community, providing employment to women, and breaking caste barriers by ensuring that all children have a meal together. It must also be pointed out that public provision of meals has been working well in the better-administered States, while partnerships with NGOs have sometimes miserably failed. The Ministry of Human Resource Development has confirmed that a staggering 95 per cent of meal samples prepared by NGOs in Delhi did not meet nutritional standards last year. The lesson here is that an accountable public system can perform well, arguably better than other arrangements, if there is strong commitment among policymakers and the bureaucracy. Evidently, even the vaunted ‘Bihar model’ of the Nitish Kumar government has a lot of distance to cover. It would be doubly tragic if the death of so many children is turned into a political arm-wrestling event, with little attention paid to systemic changes that can prevent a recurrence. State governments often show great concern for provision of infrastructure for economic growth but fail to see where it all begins — in a school system that produces the workforce of the future. Without even being able to guarantee children a safe meal, their assertions are meaningless.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-poisoned-plate/article4924872.ece
18,7,2013,Betting big on FDI,"The government’s decision to liberalise the foreign direct investment regime stems directly from its concerns about the deteriorating external account but its impact both in the short and medium term will depend on how the new policy is implemented. At about $85 billion, or 4.5 per cent of GDP, India is running one of the highest current account deficits in the world. With the rupee coming under relentless pressure, not least from speculators and portfolio investment outflows, the government appears to have made a strategic decision to push for stable capital flows in the form of FDI, which stay committed to the host country in times good and bad. At present, our dependence on temporary capital inflows is high — some $25 billion worth of FII money is needed to plug the current account gap. By any yardstick, this is an uncomfortable position to be in. In theory, FDI helps stabilise the external situation in two ways. First, because of its longer investment horizon, and second, because it could help reduce the country’s dependence on imported manufactures. The government’s new policy on FDI in defence, telecom and other sectors will make a difference if it leads to the infusion of critical technology and the augmentation of our productive capacity. For example, the Cabinet Committee on Security can now clear defence FDI proposals beyond 26 per cent; it is essential that this authority be used to reduce India’s dependence on future defence imports in critical technology areas rather than displacing existing capabilities.
The same is true for telecoms and other high-end electronics, where our import dependence is still high. One reason why India’s trade deficit has widened over the years is because of telecom and other technology product imports. Using foreign capital to create a larger domestic manufacturing base is a laudable objective but to achieve this, India must learn how to invite investment and technology on its own terms. Unlike China, we have failed to do this in the past. The West, as also Japan, are increasingly aging societies and should not be allowed to dictate terms to large consuming markets in the same way they did 20 years ago. India must fully leverage this aspect when dealing with the U.S., EU, Japan and even China, which see India as a big market. Preference must also be given to greenfield FDI projects rather than mergers and acquisitions, which unfortunately account for a large percentage of cross-border investment flows. Nor should any corners be cut as far as the process of acquiring land and environmental clearances are concerned. Large projects cannot get off the ground if local communities are sidelined.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/betting-big-on-fdi/article4924874.ece
19,7,2013,An uncomfortable truth,"When it began its work, the Abbottabad Commission, set up by the Pakistan government to inquire into the circumstances and happenings of May 2, 2011, the day United States commandos carried out a secret ‘kill’ operation against Osama bin Laden in his hideout, declared it would not indulge in a witch hunt or a whitewash. In the event, the commission’s report, leaked to Al Jazeera, is a few-holds-barred analysis of what went wrong. In the commission’s view, that would be just about everything. It has concluded that the al Qaeda chief was able to make Pakistan his home for nine long years, six of those in a “hardly normal” house in the garrison town of Abbottabad, due to the “collective failure” of military and intelligence authorities, the police and the civil administration. Importantly, it leaves the question of complicity tantalisingly open, underlining that incompetence alone does not adequately explain this failure. Declaring it had no conclusive evidence that any government officials, present or past, including from the military and intelligence agencies, were part of bin Laden’s support group, given the length of his stay in Pakistan, it says “the possibility of some such direct or indirect and ‘plausibly deniable’ support cannot be ruled out.” It has also squeezed in some home truths, among them that while the influence of radical Islam on the Pakistani armed forces is often exaggerated by the West, it “has assuredly been underestimated by senior military officials that the Commission met”.
The Commission has pulled no punches in probing the other main question in its terms of reference either, of how U.S. military helicopters entered sovereign airspace undetected by the country’s armed forces. Few might have expected it would castigate the security agencies for inviting military action against Pakistan by a superior power, by not going after high value terrorist targets themselves, or dismantling extremist groups in the country. The military, particularly the ISI, has come off badly. The report is emphatic that what Pakistan needs is civilian control over all aspects of governance and administration. For sure, there are many questions the report leaves unanswered. It appears to have no concerns about the jailing of the doctor who assisted the U.S. in locating bin Laden. For all that, the 337-page report — even if only a rough draft, as is being made out — is a fascinating commentary on the state of Pakistan, and contains several valuable lessons in how not to run a nation. The Nawaz Sharif government should make the report public and initiate a national debate on it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-uncomfortable-truth/article4929036.ece
19,7,2013,No ground to stand on,"Race has once again torn a deep gash through the conscience of the United States. >Protesters took to the streets across the U.S. this week after a Florida jury acquitted a gun-toting “neighbourhood watch officer” of second-degree murder despite his shooting dead an unarmed 17-year-old African-American, >Trayvon Martin, in February last year. The decision to set >George Zimmerman free raises troubling questions about whether this multiracial nation can ever transcend its painful history of slavery and ugly, persisting racial hatred. There are two aspects of this polarising case that matter to the debate. The first relates to the limitations of the criminal justice system stemming from the formidable legal protections that many U.S. States have instituted favouring ultra-liberal gun ownership rights. The success of conservative lobbies in hectoring into law some version of the “Stand Your Ground” provision in Florida and 33 other States has hobbled the prosecution of ‘white on black’ gun crimes. In Florida, Stand Your Ground imposed no legal duty upon Mr. Zimmerman to retreat, but granted the right to apply deadly force if he “reasonably believed” that it was necessary to prevent his death or bodily harm. Further, the Florida police anticipated Mr. Zimmerman’s sound legal standing under the aegis of this law and refused to arrest him for an astonishing 44 days after the killing, until a major national campaign forced their hand. By that time, however, some evidence was lost. When the judge banned prosecution lawyers from describing Mr. Zimmerman’s intention in going after Mr. Martin as “racial profiling,” acquittal was all but certain.
The second undercurrent — and one that President Barack Obama’s call for post-verdict calm conveniently sidestepped — is the deeper narrative of crime and punishment in the U.S., which is intimately interwoven with the fabric of racism and manifested in everything from capital sentencing to incarceration rates. What about Mr. Martin’s right to stand his ground as he faced down his abuse-hurling stalker? If the roles were reversed, would an armed African-American man have faced the same odds of acquittal? The statistics behind this sort of encounter would terrify any African-American parent. According to data compiled by the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement, an African-American is killed by state-sanctioned violence every 28 hours. In 2012 alone 313 African-Americans were reportedly killed by the police, security guards and vigilantes, most of whom got off lightly. The message that emerged from this verdict was only one: if you’re African-American and are set up against someone who isn’t, then there is literally not a square inch of ground for you to stand on.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-ground-to-stand-on/article4928897.ece
20,7,2013,Back to the drawing board,"The idea of a National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for medical courses in the country was perhaps too good to succeed. The >Supreme Court’s decision to quash the Medical Council of India Regulations that introduced NEET is a direct consequence of the laissez faire in education endorsed by an 11-judge Bench in the TMA Pai Foundation case in 2002. The right to establish and administer institutions under the Constitution was held to include the right to admit students without any interference from the state, subject only to the condition that merit not be ignored. P.A. Inamdar (2005) evolved a triple test for admissions — that they be fair, transparent and non-exploitative — but reiterated that the right to frame such an admission procedure would remain with the unaided institutions. It was too late, anyway, for a smaller Bench to dislodge the earlier ruling that minority institutions had an unfettered right to select or reject candidates based on their own “procedures, beliefs and dispensations.” Some States saw the national eligibility test as an invasion of their rights, besides posing a threat to their scheme of reservation. Further, the States were not given the draft Regulations for their comments before they were framed. All these factors have led to the invalidation of NEET. A significant finding is that the MCI’s power to frame regulations for maintaining standards and conducting professional examinations does not include the right to hold an entrance test.
The question that one should ask is whether an eligibility test necessarily impinges on the rights of minority institutions or undermines reservation. Justice A.R. Dave’s illuminating dissent argues that it does not. In his view, NEET creates a national pool of eligible candidates from whom institutions could select those belonging to a particular minority group they prefer or to any class or category that State-owned or aided institutions want to select under their reservation norms. Instead of reading down the Regulations to that effect, the majority has chosen to declare them wholly unconstitutional. While a single national test may be seen as unfeasible, the reasoning in the main judgment would render even a State-level common test unconstitutional. Unlike engineering, medical courses have far fewer seats in proportion to the number of aspirants, and the scope for profiteering is demonstrably higher. Preventing undue state interference in the right to establish and administer institutions is indeed a constitutional requirement, but maintaining fairness in admissions, preserving inter se merit and curbing commercialisation also need constitutional protection. The Union government must consider fresh legislative measures to meet these objectives.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Back-to-the-drawing-board/article12012554.ece
20,7,2013,Dancing in the dark,"First it was Chowpatty, the historic beachfront in South Mumbai where trees were cut down so couples couldn’t hang out, then the furore over Valentine’s Day, the ban on dance bars in 2005, and this year, the attempt to proscribe lingerie clad mannequins. That the nouveau political class in Maharashtra can’t see the wood for the trees has been proven time and again. Caught in a cauldron of poverty and helplessness, something the State government lacks the willpower to address, it is young women, real or lifelike, who bear the brunt of the State’s ire. When Maharashtra Home Minister R.R. Patil took the moral low ground and decided to ban dance bars, ostensibly to deter young Maratha and other men from squandering currency notes over dancing women, there was justifiable outrage. Everyone wept over this attempt to kill the city’s famed nightlife. Some fretted over the fate of the bar owners and staff. Above all, there were worries about the fate of the young women who danced there for a living. Mumbai is home to Kamathipura, a ramshackle conglomeration of houses and streets where women sell their bodies for a pittance. Mr. Patil is not outraged by the fact that hundreds of garishly made up women, many of them trafficked minors, stand on the streets every day waiting for customers. His government will not dream of passing a law that criminalises the men who frequent these places, as some countries have done.
Most of the women in Kamathipura and in the dance bars come from the border areas of Karnataka where the Devdasi tradition acts as a catalyst, from the North, Nepal or West Bengal. Poverty is among the strongest factors driving them into the city. The dance bars offered many women the possibility of hope in their otherwise desolate lives, but not for long. The State government is impervious to the plight of these women, and while it criminalises prostitution and bans dancers, it is slow to prosecute brothel owners or pimps and traffickers. Some law enforcers even believe that rapes would increase if prostitution were to be shut down. In this patriarchal and unconscionable scenario, Mr. Patil is a shining beacon, a symbol for everything that is wrong with our political culture. Both the Bombay High Court and the Supreme Court have put him in his place but he is not giving up. As Chief Justice Altamas Kabir said in his judgment, the cure is worse than the disease as many of the dancers were forced into the sex trade after the ban. The apex court has ruled wisely. The Maharashtra government must address the disease instead of grandstanding.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dancing-in-the-dark/article4932416.ece
22,7,2013,Home for everyone,"Providing adequate numbers of affordable houses for the urban poor remains an elusive target. Policies framed in the past have failed to deliver. About 96 per cent of the 18.78 million housing units shortage pertains to lower income groups. Hence, when the >Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation recently published its task force report on promoting affordable housing, it raised a familiar question: whether the new recommendations would succeed where previous policies failed. Would it bring elusive homes within the reach of the urban poor? The answer is not a convincing yes. The report has many useful suggestions on the financial aspects, but it inadequately addresses supply issues. It rightly points out that many existing schemes have barriers that prevent the poor from benefiting. For instance, the >Affordable Housing in Partnership Scheme, launched four years ago to produce one million houses, has so far delivered only 5776. Though the scheme provides a subsidy of Rs. 50,000 per dwelling unit, the government spends only Rs. 26,000. This is due to an unreasonable condition — that the subsidy not exceed 25 per cent of the amount spent on providing services such as water supply. The task force wants the government to fine tune the scheme and increase the subsidy to Rs. 100,000.
Other welcome recommendations include raising the cap on interest subsidy schemes and fixing affordable housing loan targets for banks to achieve. However, such creative approaches are missing when it comes to augmenting the supply of affordable housing. For instance, existing policies recognise that the government alone cannot meet the needs and have tried to rope in private developers. They insist that >housing projects built in plots exceeding one hectare in size should reserve about 20 per cent of the developed land for social housing. If these measures have not worked, this is not because the reservation rate is high as the task force reasons. The problem is that these supply-enhancing measures focus only on large-scale projects, which are few and far between. Second, developers do not invest in social housing because the profit margins in the flourishing real estate market are high and incentives offered by the government cannot match the potential gains they could expect to make otherwise. Strangely, the task force misses the point and recommends reducing the reservation percentage to 15. It overlooked the fact that even when land reservations are as low as 10 per cent, as in the case of Chennai, this has not yielded sufficient affordable houses. There is a lesson to learn from countries such as England, which insist that even projects as small as 15 housing units must have a social housing component. The way forward is to cast the net wide.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/home-for-everyone/article4938175.ece
22,7,2013,The politics of war crimes,"It would seem the road to justice in Bangladesh has been laid in loops. The all-too familiar cycle of violence that has followed an >International Crimes Tribunal verdict sentencing Ghulam Azam, prominent ideologue and former chief of the Jamaat-e-Islami, to >90 years in jail reflects the tardy progress the country has made in reconciling with its past. Soon after the tribunal — set up to investigate mass atrocities committed during the war for Bangladesh’s independence in 1971 — announced its decision, Jamaat activists took to the streets, torching vehicles, blasting crude bombs, roughing up policemen and vandalising public property. Political violence is expected to escalate over the next few days, now that Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Mojaheed has been sentenced to death by a similar tribunal. Whatever the Islamist party may say or do, most Bangladeshis wish to see 1971’s perpetrators brought to book. The protests in Shahbag earlier this year saw huge crowds demanding even capital punishment for those convicted of war crimes. The Jamaat, which saw in this groundswell of anger an existential threat, has since retaliated with violence.
To be sure, the dispensation of justice in these cases should neither be an exercise in retribution nor do away with the rule of law to assuage popular sentiment. Thus far, the ruling Awami League has failed to cultivate a modus vivendi between the belligerence of foot soldiers beholden to the Jamaat and the impassioned, but adamant, stance of those seeking death for the party’s former leadership. If the war crime trials are to bring closure to a horrific chapter in Bangladesh’s history, they must be seen at home and abroad as adhering to due process — in gathering evidence, protecting witnesses, and hearing both sides. The special tribunals, it has been alleged, have not fully complied with their rules of procedure as laid down in the International Crimes Tribunal Act, 1973. Far from addressing this serious concern, Prime Minister Hasina and her government have glossed over it, with a view to winding up the trials in time for the upcoming general elections. On its part, the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has chosen, unconscionably, to side with the Jamaat in decrying the push for justice. Both mainstream political parties must realise electoral dividends are a cheap substitute for national reconciliation. Already the events of 1971 have demonstrated their potential to hold captive the popular imagination of younger generations. To politicise the trial of war crimes would be to let their polarising narrative persist — akin to opening new wounds while sewing old ones shut.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-politics-of-war-crimes/article4938177.ece
23,7,2013,The evidence is mounting,"Nine years stand between the killing of Thangjam Manorama Devi in 2004, while in custody of the Assam Rifles in Manipur, and the >killing of four unarmed civilians last week by the Border Security Force in Jammu & Kashmir. They coincide with nine years of broken promises from the United Progressive Alliance — to amend the >Armed Forces Special Powers Act, 1958, to roll back its application in peaceful areas, and to pursue a policy of “zero tolerance” to human rights abuse by the armed forces. The UPA’s strategy, in the face of vocal opposition to AFSPA’s continued existence, has been to create a façade of “internal deliberation” that invariably falls short of consensus. While the government has taken refuge under the multiplicity of views — emerging from the Army, the Supreme Court, and civil society — to steer clear of concrete action on AFSPA, little has changed on the ground. Nothing but the seductive lure of impunity could have prompted BSF troops in Ramban to fire upon a crowd protesting the latter’s alleged entry into the town mosque. After all, not one member of the armed forces has been made to stand trial in an open court for alleged atrocities committed in Jammu & Kashmir over the last 24 years.
A similar sordid saga has been playing out in the north-east, where >AFSPA has been in existence since its inception. The Santosh Hegde committee, appointed by the Supreme Court to investigate encounter killings in >Manipur, has methodically exposed the legislation’s failure to tackle insurgency in the State. The committee, >whose findings were released last week, examined six incidents, said to have taken place between March 2009-10. It found five of them to be fabricated encounters; all of them involved the disproportionate use of force by the Indian Army and Manipur state police; and all of them resulted in the death of persons with no known criminal antecedents. The committee’s findings with regard to the collaboration between the Assam Rifles and the State Police Commandos are particularly worrisome. During joint operations, the committee notes, CDOs have themselves used lethal force against suspected insurgents, taking advantage of the immunity AFSPA grants to paramilitary forces. The Assam Rifles, on the other hand, have partnered with local police to conduct operations in non-notified areas beyond AFSPA’s realm. Unlike in J&K, where the political establishment has taken a stern and commendable stance against AFSPA’s application to the Valley, Manipur’s politicians are hand in glove with the Centre. If the UPA intends to follow through on its promise to defang AFSPA, it must implement the >Hegde Committee’s recommendations and not consign its report to the dustbin the way it did with the B.P. Jeevan Reddy committee that preceded it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-evidence-is-mounting/article4941923.ece
23,7,2013,Making negligence pay,"The recent Supreme Court ruling should serve as an occasion for sober reflection on the vexed question of award of >compensation to victims of road accidents. To be sure, the pecuniary and non-pecuniary nature and extent of loss sustained by victims and their families are factored into the computation of the quantum of reparations. In this regard, a familiar refrain of courts over many years has been to emphasise the notion of just compensation, as stipulated in the 1987 Motor Vehicles Act. However, the precise interpretation of that provision in practical cases continues to remain elusive. Consider for instance the courts’ oft-repeated observations. Compensation must be reasonable, pragmatic and realistic; that is, it cannot be equated to either a windfall or a bonanza, while simultaneously not amounting to a mere pittance. Or, conversely, that tribunals should be liberal in arriving at the quantum of compensation since life and limb are valued under the law. Such remarks may at best mirror the extreme difficulties involved in determining the amount of damages to be settled.
The task of affixing monetary value to human life is an awkward and intractable one. But this dilemma must be squarely faced by earnestly engaging with the question of what can be done to prevent such loss of life. The means of minimising the number of accidents would obviously be to hold public authorities accountable for grossly inadequate investment in transport infrastructure, traffic regulation and enforcement of safety standards. This is an urgent task considering that roads are the dominant mode of transport in India, carrying about 90 per cent of passenger traffic. Its record as the country doing the worst on road safety paints a bleak picture of official attitudes. If anything, these considerations suggest the current legal approach to compensating accident victims is antiquated. In addition to monetary compensation for death and grievous injury due to negligent and rash driving, non-compliance with global standards on the quality of roads and safety should also be liable for deterrent punishment under the law. An emphasis on prevention would be consistent with the court’s many injunctions on instantaneous and >cashless medical intervention for accident victims — most recently in June 2013. To ensure our roads are less accident-prone, we need to promote an overall culture of safety that is now woefully missing. Sadly, neither the still inconclusive judicial process in the >1997 Uphaar Cinema tragedy that took 59 lives, nor the pending high-profile cases of drunken driving resulting in fatalities gives the public much reason to hope.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/making-negligence-pay/article4941924.ece
24,7,2013,Let the science decide,"That the Union Health Ministry takes critical decisions affecting a large number of people without any scientific basis does not portend well for public health in India. Neither the >ban imposed on the oral anti-diabetes drug pioglitazone on June 18 nor its revocation a month later with a requirement that the medicine be sold with a boxed warning highlighting the adverse side-effect of bladder cancer was based on any scientific evidence from India. The excessive haste and utter secrecy in which the drug was banned raises serious concerns about the decision-making process. It is shocking that eight ‘cases’ of bladder cancer in patients who are on pioglitazone was the only ‘data’ the ministry relied on to ban a drug that has been used by a sizeable number of diabetics for about a decade. As if the statistically insignificant number of ‘cases’ it relied on to take a decision was not shocking enough, it relied on ‘data’ that never came under scientific scrutiny. This best portrays how cavalier policymakers can be. If the basis on which the drug was banned is baffling, the grounds on which the ban was revoked with a box warning is puzzling. After all, an Indian study of 958 patients who are on pioglitazone but with no cancer after two years of treatment is the only scientifically valid data currently available. It is also well known that Indians have a different genetic profile from Caucasians and very contrasting characteristics, which make them more susceptible to diabetes.
While a few large studies conducted elsewhere have shown increased risk, a few others have not. The fact that three countries have placed varying restrictions on the drug’s use should have prompted Indian officials to conduct large-scale studies. Even now, there are overwhelming compulsions to immediately undertake such studies to know the actual risk. Any decision to continue with, remove or rephrase the contents of the boxed warning should be based on those results. Last month’s decision by an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to “ease restrictions” on the sale of Avandia (rosiglitazone), a much maligned diabetes drug, is a case in point. Avandia was found to increase the risk of heart failure and death. But a re-evaluation has led to a softening of stand. Tobacco being a leading cause of bladder cancer is well known. With millions of tobacco users in the country, only well-designed studies can help in pinpointing the pioglitazone-cancer causative association. The cheap and effective drug has been in the market for about a decade and many thousands have been using it for a long duration and at lower dosages than in the West. The government may have the power to act but Indian diabetics have the right to an informed decision.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/let-the-science-decide/article4945959.ece
24,7,2013,A potential game changer,"It’s not exactly the great new gold rush in sport in this country, but the >Indian Badminton League may turn out to be a smash hit if audiences in our cricket-crazy nation patronise it with anything like the kind of enthusiasm displayed by the franchises at the inaugural auction of players in New Delhi on Monday. The IBL has the potential to serve as a game changer and take a sport that is hugely popular in many countries to a wider audience in India. While the memorable achievements of players such as Nandu Natekar, Dinesh Khanna, Prakash Padukone, Syed Modi, Vimal Kumar and P. Gopi Chand helped keep the game in public focus in the past, it is the emergence of the charismatic Saina Nehwal as a potential world-beater that offers the cash-rich new league a chance to capture the imagination of young sportspersons in the country. Saina fetched $120,000 at the auction, an amount that Mumbai Indians or Chennai Super Kings may throw away without a second thought on a cricketer who may never get past the dugout in the Indian Premier League. But that cynical point of view would do no good to a new event that might well become a popular permanent fixture in the Indian sports calendar while attracting fresh young talent to badminton. With Saina and P.V. Sindhu already among the world elite, and P. Kashyap showing immense potential, competitive badminton has never had it so good in India. In the event, you can hardly fault the timing of the league organisers.
The Chinese, who swept all gold medals in the 2012 London Olympics, have stayed away from the IBL. But the available depth in the field is still good enough to provide some thrilling and competitive matches for the lovers of the game for just over two weeks. Billed as the world’s richest badminton league, with $1 million as the prize fund, the event was aimed at benefiting the home players. Going by the players’ auction, the first objective has been achieved. The fact that the franchisees spent $861,000 on 36 Indian players reflects the quantum of monetary gain for home-bred talent. Should the IBL gain in stature by attracting the Chinese in its future editions, the bids will surely be much higher. This time, the presence of the men’s world No.1, Lee Chong Wei of Malaysia, has burnished the organisers’ credibility. But most franchises had reasons to be pleased with the way the auction went. Some may have faltered with their shopping strategies but then they will learn to do better over time. Finally, the success of the league will depend not only on the organisational skills of the Badminton Association of India and its commercial partners, but also on audience turnout at venues and television ratings. But for a start, things do look positive.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-potential-game-changer/article4945964.ece
25,7,2013,Vanishing poverty trick,"In figures officially released this week, the Planning Commission claims that >poverty incidence had declined from 37.2 per cent of the population in 2004-05 to 21.9 per cent in 2011-12. This 15.3 percentage points decline over a seven-year period amounts to an unprecedented annual decline of 2.2 percentage points in the poverty rate. If that trend is sustained, it would lead to an end to “official” poverty in India in a decade. The previous year for which a comparable estimate based on the Tendulkar Committee’s methodology is available, using data from a similar survey, is 2009-10. In that year, the incidence of poverty was reported at 29.8 per cent, reflecting a 7.4 percentage points reduction relative to 2004-05. A further 8 percentage points reduction over the next two years, when GDP growth in fact slowed, has substantially hiked the annual reduction rate.
The view that this evidence is not the outcome of a routine evaluation of the extent of poverty, but is politically influenced, is not without basis. To start with, despite the recent furore over the appallingly low level at which the Tendulkar committee set the “poverty line” (which works out to Rs. 33.3 in urban areas and Rs. 27.2 in rural areas for 2011-12), the government has chosen to stick officially with that line even though it knows that for all practical purposes the incidence of actual poverty is nearly three times higher. It knows, for example, that the calorie intake figures yielded by the same survey and hunger indices do not tally with the poverty reduction record that the Commission’s methodology yields. Second, the 68th Round National Sample Survey on Household Consumer Expenditure is atypical, if not abnormal, to say the least. From the early 1970s, till 2009-10, the “large sample” consumer expenditure surveys by the NSS were undertaken once in five years. If that schedule had been followed, the next large sample survey should have been in 2014-15. This, however, made the available poverty estimates politically irrelevant. They did not refer to the period after the UPA’s second term started in 2009. They would be superseded only in 2014-15, well after the next election. So in a sudden show of concern for more regular statistical information, the government decided on undertaking a large sample survey after just two years. It obviously knew that if combined with the Planning Commission’s methodology such a survey would point to a significant reduction in poverty. But even the Commission must have been surprised by the actual figure it finally got. The fact that the government is rightly unwilling to base its new food security initiative on these unrealistic numbers suggests the Planning Commission must rethink its formal methodology. But politics requires otherwise.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/vanishing-poverty-trick/article4949611.ece
25,7,2013,Sanctions are louder than talks,"The statement by the United States that Israel and the Palestinians are to meet for the first direct talks between the two sides since September 2010 confirms yet again the gulf between the two sides. For the record, on July 19 U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry concluded four months of West Asian visits and intensive exchanges with all parties with his announcement, made in Amman, that >talks would resume. Martin Indyk, twice Washington’s ambassador to Tel Aviv during the Clinton years, is reportedly to manage the meetings, which are to be a “basis” for final-status talks. Saeb Erekat is likely to represent the Palestinian Authority (PA), and Israel’s current justice minister Tzipi Livni will attend for Israel. The previous exchanges broke down acrimoniously after only 16 hours. In any case the new round will only be talks about talks, and will occur in a context of profound distrust among the main protagonists. The initial Palestinian response has been cautious, with spokesperson Yasser Abed Rabbo saying nothing would happen before the PA resolves certain issues with Washington, but the PA supports talks “in principle”, and Israel has started releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.
Israel, however, is already trying to maintain the current stalemate. It has expressed reservations about Mr. Indyk’s perceived pro-Palestinian leanings. Secondly, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu says any deal will be put to a referendum — a procedure which would itself require new legislation. Furthermore, Israel’s cabinet is severely divided, with trade minister and leader of the extreme Jewish Home Party Naftali Bennett categorically rejecting any construction freeze in the illegally occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Even more problems lie in the future status of Jerusalem, which both sides want as their capital, and on Palestinian refugees’ right of return. Above all, Israel refuses to accept the 1967 borders as an absolute precondition for any kind of agreement, and neither Tel Aviv nor Washington can admit that Hamas and not the PA are the elected representatives of the Palestinian people. Therefore, another breakdown in talks is the most probable result. If all is not lost, it may well be because the European Union has finally started to enforce its own law by telling Israel that EU funding must not go into the illegal settlements. The reaction has been that of a bully facing unexpected resistance, but Tel Aviv’s vehemence indicates genuine alarm over the prospect of sanctions. Officials in the old South Africa later admitted that sanctions had really hurt the apartheid regime, and now the message for the rest of the world, including Israel, is clear.

26,7,2013,Detox for pollution boards,"Making the Gross Domestic Product the sole measure of national development for many years has left Indians with a natural environment that is among the most polluted in the world. Regardless of that dismal outcome, and in spite of settled law that polluters should pay, the Centre and State governments continue to balk at stronger enforcement of environmental laws. New evidence from a >study by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences on the approach of the States to their environment protection duties only confirms the view that they pay no more than lip service. The findings make it clear that the position of Chairman of a State Pollution Control Board is often used to reward political loyalists. This has been done even when the candidates lack prescribed qualifications, brazenly violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981. The malaise, though, is not of recent origin. An evaluation of SPCBs done more than a dozen years ago during the Eighth Plan and published by the Planning Commission referred to ‘the predominance of non-technical members in most of the Boards and the lack of professionals.’ The effects of such policies of convenience were felt acutely over the last decade when GDP growth was robust. Unsurprisingly, India today brings up the rear in air quality even among Asian countries.
Last year, the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests disclosed that the Central Pollution Control Board had identified 43 critically polluted industrial clusters in 2009 for remediation. The outcomes are far from clear. Moreover, the poor record of SPCBs became evident when the CPCB issued 118 directions, after surprise checks, on failure of industries to comply with water and air quality laws between 2009 and 2012. Surprise checks and directions to State Boards can, however, cover only a small portion of industrial activity. Major laws relating to pollution remain a dead letter in most States, with rivers turned into sewers transporting waste downstream. Such contemptuous disregard for the environment can continue only at the cost of public health. There is a strong case to compel the SPCBs to publish, in real time on the Internet, data they gather under various laws and rules, particularly on water and air quality, noise pollution, and disposal of different types of waste. Lack of transparency in their working should be eliminated by setting up oversight panels with civil society representatives and independent technical members from reputed institutions, such as the Indian Institutes of Technology. The moribund environment protection boards need a thorough shake-up, starting with the appointment of individuals with the right credentials to lead them.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Detox-for-pollution-boards/article12021373.ece
26,7,2013,The power of a visa,"Like moths to artificial light, controversies have a way of attaching themselves to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi. By now a deeply polarising figure in India’s communally charged politics, Mr. Modi cannot help inviting constant attention to what he says or does. But the latest commotion that the Bharatiya Janata Party’s prime ministerial aspirant finds himself at the centre of is not of his own making. A >petition urging United States President Barack Obama to continue to >deny a visa to Mr. Modi allegedly contains the forged signatures of several Members of Parliament. No visa request of Mr. Modi is pending, and the petition seems more like an immature attempt to embarrass the Gujarat strongman than anything else. Surely, too much is being read into the granting or denial of a U.S. visa. True, Mr. Modi was denied a visa by Washington in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat riots citing “violation of religious freedoms”. But India’s law enforcement agencies and judicial system have so far not held Mr. Modi criminally accountable for the riots, and to see in the granting of a visa an endorsement — or in the denial an indictment — of the Gujarat Chief Minister makes no sense at all. Governments throughout the world consider their right to issue or deny visa to individuals from other countries a legitimate instrument of foreign policy. But what should worry Indians is how India’s criminal justice system makes politicians in power accountable for their acts of omission or commission. If Mr. Modi did indeed act irresponsibly during the Gujarat riots, the forum to establish that is in an Indian court, as Zakia Jaffrey and others are trying to do. There is little comfort to be had in his being denied a visa to the U.S.
The petition, submitted at the initiative of independent MP Mohammed Adeeb, is certainly ill-advised. Apparently, Mr. Adeeb wanted to counter what he saw as an attempt by BJP president Rajnath Singh to lobby Washington for a visa on behalf of Mr. Modi. Any U.S. decision on this issue is unlikely to hinge on the efforts of Mr. Singh or the letters of Mr. Adeeb. But the allegation that forged signatures were appended to the petition is serious, and needs a thorough probe. While Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP Sitaram Yechury has termed the affixing of signatures a “cut and paste” job, a few other MPs have also denied signing the petition. To set to rest all doubts, Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar should order an investigation into the allegation of forgery as at least one BJP MP has formally requested her to do. But for now, far from embarrassing Mr. Modi, the petition seems to have embarrassed many of his political opponents.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-power-of-a-visa/article4953363.ece
27,7,2013,The signs are ominous,"The Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) cannot hold the prospects of the country’s hearing impaired ransom to the whims of a single individual head of institution. In a patently regressive move, the premier university has recently decided to shut down the >Indian Sign Language Research and Training Centre (ISLRTC) from the current academic year. This, despite the growing emphasis on signing as a language to bridge the communication barrier between the deaf and the hearing. Ironically though, it was IGNOU that took the pioneering initiative to start a Bachelor of Arts degree in sign language in 2009, in collaboration with the University of Central Lancashire in the United Kingdom. It was this programme that prompted the Union Human Resource Development (HRD) and Social Justice and Empowerment (SJE) ministries to involve IGNOU in the establishment of the ISLRTC on its campus in 2011. This was the very Centre for which a huge headline-grabbing outlay was announced in the 2010 Union budget. Beyond the fanfare, the Finance Minister’s statement raised hopes that the government was at last acting on a promise, contained in the 11th Plan document, to set up a nodal centre to standardise Indian sign language and train a large number of people in it. But suddenly, the larger objective of bringing the hearing impaired into the national mainstream seems in danger of being ignored. The factors that appear to have influenced the current deplorable move are not particularly clear. But the Vice Chancellor’s reasoning that a dual degree course was not conceived under the IGNOU Act does not stand up to scrutiny considering that the conception of new programmes and alterations to existing ones are well within the powers of the academic council. Nor is it the case that open and distance education preclude teaching and learning face-to-face.
Admissions for the sign language course have been frozen since last year and the first batch of students on the verge of completing their degree face the unsavoury prospect of being awarded a mere certificate. IGNOU’s ham-handed approach betrays the precarious situation that prevails in India as regards the welfare of people with disabilities. The SJE and HRD ministries should intervene expeditiously to ensure the resumption of academic activity at the sign language centre. They should also strive towards according sign language the status of an official language, promote education of the hearing impaired in that medium and establish appropriate interpretation services. Each one of these is consistent with the mandate of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which the government has already ratified.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-signs-are-ominous/article4957077.ece
27,7,2013,Pulling out all the stops,"On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of India sought to reinforce last week’s package of >measures curbing liquidity in order to check speculation in the currency markets. In beefing up an already rigorous package so soon, the RBI is sending the message that it will pull out all stops to defend the rupee from falling below Rs.60 a dollar, which, according to market consensus, is the target level. The rupee, which fell to an >all-time low of 61.20 on July 8, has since recovered to trade above Rs.60, but the danger of a slide back remains. Great significance is attached to the fact that the RBI’s recent package has not supplanted its more conventional intervention strategy of selling dollars by drawing down reserves. So far, some $5 billion to $6 billion dollars seem to have been expended and quite obviously, reserves cannot be run down indefinitely to support the rupee. But last week’s surprise announcement caught the markets off-guard. Though unconventional and certainly out of the ordinary in the Indian context, the RBI’s action follows the classic textbook approach to countering depreciation of the home currency by hiking interest rates and squeezing liquidity. Higher interest rates make domestic bonds more attractive and invite capital flows while the liquidity squeeze targets speculators.
The package has included a cap on short-term borrowings at the repo rate (the amount banks borrow from the RBI using government bonds as collateral) and a sharp hike in the marginal standing facility rate (which is a non-collateralised overnight borrowing facility available to banks). These will be further backed by bond sales to suck out liquidity. Obviously these measures come at a price. Higher bond yields — an intended consequence of RBI action — do not augur well for the government’s borrowing programme. A higher interest bill will impact fiscal consolidation. Tight liquidity will percolate to the banking system and that is certainly not good news for GDP growth. Money market mutual funds came under pressure as large institutional investors and banks dumped their holdings and the RBI had to open a special Rs.25000 crore window for them. Recent auctions of government paper did not elicit the right response from a majority of banks that were expecting a more attractive price. These and other deleterious consequences suggest that the RBI might withdraw its measures sooner rather than later. However, currency markets are unlikely to remain stable for a reasonable period of time. While the government and the RBI will step up their efforts to increase dollar inflows, there is perhaps no alternative for the RBI but to maintain a hawkish stance in its forthcoming credit policy statement.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pulling-out-all-the-stops/article4957078.ece
29,7,2013,A reprieve for reason,"The Supreme Court’s recent decision to institute a larger Bench to consider commuting the sentences of death row prisoners is both a nudge to the political establishment and an attempt to navigate the court’s own muddled pronouncements on mercy petitions. It is no secret that clemency pleas to the President have been gathering dust, some for decades, at Rashtrapati Bhavan. Many on death row suffer this torturous wait for mercy — by any measure, an affront to human dignity — only to find their petitions eventually dismissed. Another long wait for the execution follows, unless their death, like that of Ajmal Kasab or Afzal Guru, is hastened because of political expediency. Through its decision to review death row cases marked by uncharacteristic delay, the court has made it clear to the executive that its powers of pardon must be exercised like any administrative action: in a reasonable and non-arbitrary manner. While the court will consider each plea on its merit, the hearings, it is hoped, will produce a sound jurisprudence to guide future cases. So far, the Supreme Court’s verdicts on this count have been confusing and contradictory. While rejecting the plea of Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar in April 2013 — on account of his being a ‘terrorist’ who deserved no leniency — the SC, a month later, commuted the death sentence of Mahendra Nath Das, convicted of a gruesome beheading, despite both their clemency pleas having been rejected after inordinate delay by former President Pratibha Patil. The court’s reasoning in the latter case — that the President had failed to consider the Home Ministry’s recommendation to commute Das’s sentence — has cut no ice with anybody.
That said, the Supreme Court’s intervention must not give way to the law of unintended consequences: its attempts to commute delayed executions should not prompt the government to hastily reject pending mercy pleas. Already, the Central government has expressed its displeasure at the judiciary’s attempts to ‘dilute’ the scope of presidential pardon under Article 72 of the Indian Constitution. Moreover, since assuming office last year, President Pranab Mukherjee has rejected clemency petitions at an alarming rate. The executive, shy to test political waters through decisive action, has for long sat on mercy pleas. Now it seems to have swung to the other extreme, in an attempt to ‘clear the backlog’ of such petitions. The United Progressive Alliance must have the courage to respond favourably to the pleas of death row convicts, many of whom have long been kept alive only to die. The upcoming hearings offer the government and the court an opportunity to institutionalise the commuting of death sentences, pending the eventual abolition of this abhorrent form of punishment.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-reprieve-for-reason/article4963975.ece
29,7,2013,Look beyond poll position,"As Zimbabwe goes to the polls this week, its electorate and southern African neighbours will be concerned less about who wins than by what follows. The country, which is still recovering from the disastrous hyperinflation it lived with for nearly a decade, can hardly afford the sort of political violence it saw after the 2008 elections. As for the poll outcome, expect no surprises. President Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) will likely beat its main rival, the Movement for Democratic Change-Tsvangirai (MDC-T), led by Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai. ZANU-PF’s aggressive campaign has relied both on populist measures and the intimidation of the opposition and its supporters. Local and regional election monitors have already highlighted gross irregularities in the list of registered voters and the printing of ballot papers. Early polls for security personnel and bureaucrats were so haphazardly conducted that the Zimbabwe Election Commission had to tender an apology. In power for 33 straight years, Mr. Mugabe’s party has essentially wrested control of most institutions in Zimbabwe, including the armed forces, the police, the media and the election commission; the opposition knows there will be no independent national oversight of the polls.
Even if Mr. Tsvangirai were to attract enough votes to allow a power-sharing agreement to be brokered by friendly neighbours once again, it is improbable he could strike an equitable bargain. The MDC not only received flak for coalescing into the Mugabe-led government in 2008, but is widely perceived to have lost the plot since. Its leaders have been mired in a host of personal and political scandals. The Movement is plagued by factionalism, which led to a split between Tsvangirai and Arthur Mutambura (Deputy PM) affiliates in the first place. What’s more, Mr. Tsvangirai is no longer the darling of the West — in fact, this tide has turned distinctly in favour of Mr. Mugabe. The European Union has promised to lift sanctions on Zimbabwe if the upcoming elections are certified as ‘free and fair.’ There is no doubt the President enjoys considerable support, owed largely to the remarkable land reforms he has pursued during his tenure. But he must not seek to retain power through threats and coercion. Zimbabwe’s fractured political landscape has to unite to shore up its fragile economy. Mr. Mugabe is 89, and is probably contesting his last elections. He has a final opportunity to confound his critics by winning fairly and ensuring the integrity of institutions whose role in guaranteeing the country a stable future is absolutely vital.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/look-beyond-poll-position/article4963976.ece
30,7,2013,Promises to keep,"One finding from the opinion poll that the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies conducted on behalf of this newspaper and CNN-IBN was that the one country Indians trust ‘a great deal’ is Bangladesh. So it is somewhat ironic, and downright regrettable, that India’s domestic politics is the main reason why the UPA government has been unable to keep two promises to this important neighbour on issues vital to it. The fate of an accord on sharing the Teesta’s waters — which Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was to conclude on his 2011 visit to Dhaka but which was jettisoned due to opposition at the last minute by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee — remains uncertain. The 2011 protocol to the 1974 Land Boundary agreement has been signed by the two countries, and ratified by the Bangladesh parliament, but the Indian parliament is sitting on it. The Bharatiya Janata Party has created irrational and unfounded fears around the agreement for the exchange of Indian and Bangladeshi enclaves located in each other’s territory. Unfortunately, the Opposition has chosen to project the agreement, which would help rationalise the border and help people in these enclaves lead normal lives, as a territorial loss for India. During last week’s visit by Bangladesh foreign minister Dipu Moni, New Delhi tried to make amends by offering a stake in the yet to begin Tipaimukh hydel project in Manipur. Also, Bangladesh is soon set to receive 500 MW of power from India. This, though, is small consolation for the Sheikh Hasina government.
Since the Awami League came to power in 2008, the Bangladeshi opposition has lost no opportunity to paint its policies addressing Indian security concerns as a ‘sell-out’ to New Delhi. Thanks to Dhaka, the United Liberation Front of Assam was neutralised, and there was a clamp-down on other anti-India insurgencies and Islamist extremist groups. If Indians today trust Bangladesh more than any other South Asian state, it is in no small measure due to this. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had hoped to fight the “pro-India” accusation against her by getting something substantial in return from New Delhi. But these hopes have been belied. Meanwhile, her government has been under attack by the religious right-wing on the war crimes trial issue. The Jamaat-i-Islami’s violent retaliation to the conviction and sentencing of some of its leaders, provoking a heavy-handed response from the government, has led to more cycles of violence. As Bangladesh prepares for elections in early 2014, in addition to the turmoil over the trials, the failure of the Awami League to keep India to its promises has strengthened the party’s adversaries. If New Delhi is unable to pull its act together before Prime Minister Hasina’s scheduled visit in September, it can only blame itself for losing an opportunity to help a friend.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/promises-to-keep/article4967448.ece
30,7,2013,Empowering SEBI the right way,"In using the ordinance route to give sweeping additional powers to SEBI, the government is conveying a sense of urgency in plugging loopholes in capital market regulations. The absence or inadequacy of laws should no longer constrain SEBI from taking on the likes of the Saradha group in West Bengal or the Sahara Pariwar. The former failed after collecting huge sums of money through its Ponzi schemes, causing acute financial and social distress in eastern India. SEBI’s case against the Sahara group was buttressed by the Supreme Court, which ordered a refund of more than Rs.20,000 crore to investors. Yet, the company has been flouting the court’s orders even after being slapped with contempt notices. Down south, financial shenanigans have surfaced in Tamil Nadu and Kerala in the form of emu farms and dubious investments in solar energy. The Centre’s expectation is that a suitably empowered regulator would nip such financial misadventures in the bud. That might still be a tall order given that most recent scams have thrived by exploiting differences in the regulatory jurisdictions of SEBI and the RBI. The Indian financial code which has been drafted to address inter-regulatory issues has not found universal acceptance and will take time before it is adopted.
Hopefully, the Securities Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2013 will not be allowed to lapse because of the legislative logjam in parliament. SEBI is a relatively young organisation. Both its creation and the grant of additional legal powers along the way have been in response to some crisis or the other. During most of its 25 years of existence, it has had to regulate entities such as share brokerages which often have more experience in the capital market. Many of SEBI’s early rulings were overturned on appeal, a record which has just started improving. A few urgent tasks confront the newly empowered board. It should strive to build up adequate resources, especially human resources, to effectively exercise its powers. There have been several instances where SEBI has not been able to use whatever limited powers it has had for lack of manpower. For instance, even though it was given permission way back in 2002 to effect searches and seizures after obtaining a magistrate’s order, it has used these powers just once and that too not very successfully. The new powers, sweeping as they are, ought to make the regulator both responsible and accountable. The government’s support to SEBI should be continuous and go well beyond promulgating ordinances.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/empowering-sebi-the-right-way/article4967449.ece
31,7,2013,Controlling the Board,"While deeply disturbing, the betting and spot-fixing scandal the Indian Premier League (IPL) has been embroiled in actually afforded the Board of Control for Cricket in India the opportunity to cleanse and reform itself. But with reports emerging that the BCCI’s probe panel investigating the matter had found no evidence of wrongdoing against anyone, it is difficult to dispel the feeling that the operation was a cover-up, not a clean-up. There had always been questions regarding the constitution of the panel. It was an act of opacity, like so many of the Indian Board’s decisions. It came to be known that the panel had been appointed without a formal meeting of the IPL’s governing council. Two of the governing council’s eight members weren’t aware of who had constituted the panel. Two others had consented over the phone. Sanjay Jagdale, a man with a reputation of being clean, resigned as Board secretary and left the panel, raising more concerns. With the >Bombay High Court observing on Tuesday that the panel was “ >illegal and unconstitutional,” it’s clear the concerns weren’t unfounded.
The larger point, however, pertains to the relevance of the panel’s findings. It isn’t known if Raj Kundra, co-owner of Rajasthan Royals, or Gurunath Meiyappan, first “team principal” then “enthusiast” with Chennai Super Kings, deposed. But neither the Mumbai nor Delhi Police, the investigating agencies with the evidence, did. On what basis, then, did the panel conclude that nothing untoward had happened? If the sole purpose of forming the panel was to discover if >BCCI president N. Srinivasan was involved in any serious wrongdoing, the Board needn’t have bothered. For nobody accused him of falling foul of the laws of the land. But if the BCCI was keen to embark on a course of principled self-scrutiny to establish its credibility in the eyes of the public, it should have waited for the Mumbai police to frame charges and then sought legal counsel. Indeed the Board hasn’t bothered to address the central issue — the conflicts of interest that, beginning at the very top, run right through its structure. The BCCI cannot forever take shelter behind being a ‘private body’. Nothing in Indian sport is quite as public. Without the public support the game has, the BCCI could never have wielded the sort of clout it does in world cricket. Yet it seems to want to enjoy power without responsibility, particularly towards the game’s fans. It operates like a strictly private club, most of whose members appear to swear by a code of Omertà. It is imperative that the Board make its decisions and dealings more transparent. Failure to do so can only invite greater judicial and legislative scrutiny.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/controlling-the-board/article4971009.ece
31,7,2013,"Predictable, but challenging","For monetary policy watchers, the >Reserve Bank of India’s decision to keep policy rates and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) unaltered ought to be a source of comfort. Few had expected the RBI to hike the repo rate; fewer still had hoped for a reduction. In matching the expectations of the overwhelmingly large majority, the RBI is sending out a message: that notwithstanding the recent nasty surprises it sprang on the markets, the broad contours of its policies can be anticipated even over the short-term. That, in turn, should enhance the credibility of its guidance, especially on continuing with the strong liquidity-squeezing medicine it administered over the past few weeks to check volatility in the exchange markets. Those measures did succeed initially. But they cannot be rolled back just yet. As the RBI puts it pithily but inelegantly, India is currently caught in a classic “impossible trinity trilemma” and has to forfeit some monetary policy discretion to support the external sector. Only when it is satisfied that stability has been restored in the foreign exchange markets will the bank consider a calibrated retreat. While not being in a hurry to loosen its policy, the RBI has given an assurance that with the right conditions prevailing, monetary policy will revert to supporting growth while maintaining a vigil on inflation. That, unfortunately, seems far away as the rupee quite unexpectedly tanked again on Tuesday. The authorities have been quick to blame speculation but only the next weeks will show whether it is a one-off development or the beginning of a new period of stress for the rupee.
The RBI sees a window of opportunity in its >recent measures, which should be used to address structural issues on a war footing so that the burgeoning current account deficit can be checked. The CAD appears to have climbed up again in the first quarter of the current year. Other risk factors include a weak investment climate with high risk aversion. The industrial outlook is inhibited by time and cost overruns, and deteriorating asset quality, among other factors. Low and stable inflation will anchor inflation expectations and is absolutely necessary to sustain growth over the medium term. The RBI has revised its projection for growth during 2013-14 from 5.7 per cent in May to 5.5 per cent. The new estimate might be conservative. A revival in the latter part of the year, albeit at a slow pace, is widely expected on the back of good monsoons. Most professional forecasters are looking at a slightly higher GDP growth rate. But this can only happen if the RBI contains headline WPI inflation to around 5 per cent in the short-term and to 3 per cent over the medium term.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/predictable-but-challenging/article4971011.ece
1,8,2013,New dawn for Telangana,"The Congress Working Committee’s historic resolution to create India’s 29th State — Telangana — by partitioning Andhra Pradesh redeems a pledge the party made to the people of the region on the night of December 9, 2009. Compared to the Congress’s flip-flop earlier, its present resolve to fast forward Telangana when the Lok Sabha election is barely 10 months away lays it open to the charge of political expediency. But what matters now is that the people of Telangana are celebrating the decision, which they see as crucial to the fulfilment of their social, economic and political aspirations. As much as the formation of Telangana is a source of joy to its people, the bifurcation is a cause for despondency to those living in coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema. Though a separate Telangana State was first conceived in 1953, the fact that the region spoke the same language as Rayalaseema and Coastal Andhra became the basis for the formation of India’s first linguistic State when a unified Andhra Pradesh was created in 1956. What followed, unfortunately, was a saga of unkept promises, violation of the Gentlemen’s Agreement of 1956, and two violent agitations in 1969 and 1972. Slowly, a feeling built up among the people of Telangana that they were being discriminated against in employment and education.
These wrongs will hopefully be set right when Telangana begins its tryst with destiny soon. Without much ado, the Congress has cut the Gordian knot that was Hyderabad’s status by deciding to make it the common capital of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, for a period of 10 years. Seemandhra will receive Central assistance for building a new capital, and the classification of Polavaram — a massive multipurpose irrigation venture — as a national project will help protect the “rump” Andhra Pradesh’s interests. What is a source of worry, however, is that the CWC resolution leaves slightly open-ended the question of whether Telangana will have 10 districts or 12, with the addition of Kurnool and Anantapur in Rayalaseema. There will be other practical difficulties too but the political and civil society leadership of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh must shun regional chauvinism and violence and grasp with both hands the great future that lies ahead of them. If the Congress has opened a Pandora’s box by giving an impetus to similar demands for statehood in Gorkhaland, Bodoland and elsewhere, the party must draw lessons from its chequered handling of the Telangana question. Instead of finding ad hoc solutions to crises as and when they erupt, serious thought must be given to the creation of a second States Reorganisation Commission that will take a structural approach to the problem.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/new-dawn-for-telangana/article4974755.ece
1,8,2013,Convincing but flawed win,"Two years after the Trinamool Congress swept into Writers’ Building in Kolkata, it has seized control of 13 of the 17 zilla parishads, and secured over half the seats in the two lower tiers of the panchayats, breaking the Left Front’s hold over rural West Bengal. But if Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee captured the Left’s one-time citadel in central Bengal, she also showed the Congress its place by ensuring the party’s defeat in its key northern bastion of Malda. Indeed, the Congress is possibly the biggest loser among the three parties. But Ms Banerjee’s electoral success has been marred by the unseemly controversy surrounding her face-off with the State Election Commission, large-scale violence accompanied by over 20 deaths, reports of Central forces being kept away from poll booths by the State administration, and widespread intimidation by Trinamool workers of their political rivals. Poll statistics reveal that the ruling party’s candidates won unopposed in as many as 6,272 seats, that is around 11 per cent of the State’s 57,000-odd panchayat seats. Reports suggest that in another five per cent, opposition candidates went underground shortly after filing their nominations. Taking its cue from Left tactics in local elections till 2003, the Trinamool scared away opposition candidates in these seats. Even then, the Trinamool could not match the Left Front’s success at the height of its powers, only narrowly surpassing the latter’s overall tally in 2008.
The significance of these results lies in the special place that panchayats have come to hold, thanks to the 34 years the Left Front ruled West Bengal. Control over these local bodies provided the key to the Left’s vice-like grip over the State. In 2008, when the Left’s zilla parishad tally slipped from 15 to 13, and it lost in the two lower tiers in eight of 17 districts, the message that went out was that the Left “Party Machine” could be breached. The 2009 Parliament election followed and the Left Front’s seat share came down; finally in 2011, it lost the State. Over the years, the handsomely-funded panchayats were not just handing out everything from birth certificates to government jobs, they also controlled the personal lives of those who lived in the villages, arbitrating even in cases of marital discord. It will now be the Trinamool’s turn to use its elected representatives to consolidate its support base. But if the record of its panchayat members over the past five years is any indication, Ms Banerjee will have to keep a very sharp eye on her colleagues: the minor reverses that the Trinamool has suffered are in those very places such as Nandigram or in South 24 Parganas, which it had wrested from the Left in 2008.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/convincing-but-flawed-win/article4974758.ece
2,8,2013,Promised land,"Last October, the Ministry of Rural Development promised thousands of landless Jan Satyagraha agitators that it would draft a new land reforms policy, correct the inequitable distribution of land and safeguard the rights of traditional forest dwellers. To its credit, the Ministry kept its word and recently published a draft policy for public comments. The proposed framework has done well to protect the existing land of the marginalised sections, but falls short in improving the condition of the landless. Despite laws such as the Forest Rights Act which are meant to protect their rights, tribal communities remain the most exploited and worst affected. About 40 per cent of the total land acquired so far belongs to them. To set this right, the proposed policy has directed all States to delineate tribal habitation areas within a year, and statutorily protect them. It reaffirms the importance of the gram sabha and assigns it the role of a competent authority. No project is to be undertaken or land acquired without its consent. In the event that mining is taken up after getting consent, the sabha would retain ownership of the land and receive 50 per cent of royalty or revenues. The policy also proposes to create funds to help the vulnerable poor who tend to sell land when in distress.
The land rights of women have been another vexatious issue. Despite 75 per cent of India’s working women being involved in agriculture, the state has invariably ignored them and allotted land to the male head of a family. This has made it difficult for women to free themselves from violent relationships and claim relief. The draft policy has done the right thing by recommending future allotments in their name. To make this change more effective, related reforms such as joint holding of land by women groups that would help them access financial assistance should also be implemented. The proposed policy fails to exhibit similar creativity when it comes to distributing surplus lands to the needy. About 30 per cent of rural households remain landless, while the wealthiest 10 per cent holds 55 per cent of the land. About 8 million rural households are yet to get even the promised minimum — 1/10th of an acre. It is naïve to assume that advances in surveying techniques would improve the situation when the core problem is a reluctance to enforce reforms. The Minister of Rural Development has proposed well-meaning changes, but contradictory positions taken by other ministers, including the Prime Minister in recent months on infrastructure projects and mining in tribal areas, have raised serious doubts about the future of the proposed policy. If the government is serious about equitable development, it has to implement an improved land reform policy without delay.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/promised-land/article4978555.ece
2,8,2013,A levy for the Chevy,"Last week’s recall by General Motors of 1.14 lakh Tavera vehicles sold by it in India between 2005 and 2013 flags off two important issues for the fast-growing automobile industry. First, the need for a mandatory vehicle-recall policy in the country and secondly, strengthening of vehicle testing and certification procedures. The automobile industry has grown tremendously in the last decade — 2.7 million cars, 13.8 million two-wheelers and about 8 lakh trucks and buses were sold in 2012-13, making India one of the world’s biggest automobile markets. As with any rapidly growing industry with multiple players, there is tremendous diversity in brands, categories and models making it all complex not just for the consumers but also for regulators. And as is always the case, regulation has failed to keep pace with the explosive growth. The Tavera case is only the latest in a spate of recalls by well-known manufacturers such as Honda, Maruti, Toyota, Ford and Renault in recent times. Anticipating pressure on itself, the automobile industry adopted a voluntary code of recall last year. After all, a defective vehicle affects the brand as much as the buyer and it is in the manufacturer’s interest to recall the vehicle and correct the defect. Yet, it is also true that such a critical aspect that involves safety cannot be left to self-regulation.
It is, therefore, time for the government to frame a comprehensive policy for vehicle recall. As part of such a policy, it should create an online database of vehicle recalls in the country that sets out the reason, the defect and the solution for the benefit of consumers. The U.S., which has a mandatory recall policy, has such a website which not only details all motor-vehicle recalls but also allows buyers to report technical defects that could be a potential safety issue. The policy should also prescribe strict penalties for recalls that arise from negligence or a deliberate attempt to cut corners due to competitive pressures, as was the case with Tavera. In a strict technical sense, the Tavera episode cannot be termed a recall; it is more about how the company deliberately misled the certification authorities about the vehicle’s emission standards. It was not about a faulty part or component. Even as the government investigates GM, it is clear that we need a comprehensive review of testing and certification norms. If required, institutions such as the Automotive Research Association of India — which is responsible for homologation and certification of new vehicles — and the National Automotive Testing and R&D Infrastructure Project that offers vehicle testing facilities, must also be strengthened.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-levy-for-the-chevy/article4978559.ece
3,8,2013,Accounting for accountability,"Surely something is amiss when ideologically diverse political parties reach a consensus on anything in quick time. Without even waiting to legally challenge the order of the Central Information Commission bringing parties under the ambit of the Right to Information Act, the Union Cabinet has decided to amend the Act to nullify the effect of the order. Political parties will have to accept the fact that they are accountable to their members, and to the people they seek to represent. Transparency in the funding of parties and monitoring of their expenses are essential in any functioning party-based democracy. Parties, especially bigger ones, sustain themselves on off-the-books transactions, and lean on business houses for expenses at the time of elections and public events. Inevitably, there is a price to pay when these parties come to power, a price that is often willingly paid in terms of policies and concessions tailored to the needs of the election-time benefactors. This nexus between industrial houses and political parties operates in the shadow economy. As with all corrupt exchanges where both giver and taker are benefited, the opacity of the dealings serves as immunity against prosecution. At present, parties are required to declare to the Election Commission donations in excess of Rs.20,000. However, non-reporting and under-reporting is common, and the EC does not have the power or the capacity to verify declarations. Opening up the ledgers of political parties to public scrutiny could be the first step in making them more accountable.
However, in making the internal deliberations of parties and their criteria for selection of candidates also subject to the RTI Act, the CIC clearly exceeded its jurisdiction. Free and frank discussions behind closed doors are intrinsic to inner-party democracy, and to open up all deliberations to RTI queries is tantamount to silencing, or wiping off the record, dissenting voices. Those wanting answers on the criteria for selection of party candidates for an election might have been hoping to expose choices made on the basis of caste identity or muscle power, but the use of the RTI Act in such matters can make political parties vulnerable to motivated attacks from opponents and wreckers from within. A better way of ensuring transparency in candidate selection is to push for effective empowerment of constituency-level party members — as in the United Kingdom — but RTI can hardly be the vehicle for this. That said, instead of hurriedly seeking to nullify the effect of the CIC’s order, the government should use it as an opportunity to find ways to make political parties more financially accountable — and less corrupt.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/accounting-for-accountability/article4982507.ece
3,8,2013,Substance behind the style,"Pope Francis has opened questions of both style and substance with his first press conference, which he himself initiated and conducted for a papally unprecedented 80 minutes on July 29 aboard the flight carrying him back to Rome after a week-long visit to Brazil. The Brazil tour, the Pope’s first overseas visit as pontiff, had itself attracted worldwide attention, and had among other things involved a mass attended by an estimated three million people on Copacabana beach, but the Pope’s airborne comment — “If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge him?” — has predictably eclipsed much else about Francis’s first few months in office. The pontiff also reminded his audience of the Church’s 1986 catechism, which requires that gays must not be marginalised but instead “integrated into society.” The Pope’s unpretentious style and inclusive tone were in keeping with his general manner, and his use of the word “gay” rather than “homosexual” is a first for the Catholic Church. Above all, this way of restating the current position constitutes a marked shift in tenor from that of the pontiff’s predecessor Pope Benedict XVI, who in 2005 blocked men of “homosexual tendencies” from entering the priesthood, and it is a welcome development.
To be sure, the Pope has not changed the Church’s substantive positions. The existing catechism calls Christians who are homosexuals “to a chaste life,” and holds that homosexual acts are “intrinsically disordered”; clearly, there is no foreseeable question of allowing same-sex marriage. Secondly, the prohibition on the ordination of women stands. Therefore, on gays in particular the Pope may be conveying a more complex message, one intended as much for the Vatican as for the rest of the Catholic congregation. In his press conference, the pontiff, albeit jokingly, denied the existence of a gay lobby within the Vatican, but even senior Catholic insiders accept that there are homosexual relationships among some of the clergy, although they do not reject the prohibition. The Pope’s tone may well signal a willingness to acknowledge certain ground realities, such as the 2008 United States federal government survey finding that 98 per cent of sexually active American Catholic women over 18 had used some form of contraception banned by the Vatican, and the finding that in 1995 the figure for women in a union who used contraception in Catholic-majority Spain was 87.2 per cent. While there is no predicting future Catholic doctrine, His Holiness is making the rest of the world, and very probably his Vatican colleagues too, think.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/substance-behind-the-style/article4982508.ece
5,8,2013,A suspicious suspension,"At worst, it’s a criminal conspiracy; and at best, it’s cynical politics. Either way, nothing can possibly justify the suspension of Uttar Pradesh IAS officer Durga Shakti Nagpal by the Samajwadi Party government. Even going by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav’s explanation that action against her was taken as the government anticipated communal trouble after an illegally constructed wall of a mosque was demolished under her supervision, the hastily-ordered suspension makes no sense. While the villagers are upset at the demolition of the wall, they also insist there is no danger of violence. The most charitable explanation for Ms Nagpal’s suspension would have to be that the SP is trying to play politics with the religious sentiments of the people. But at what cost? Though there is no evidence of Ms Nagpal having acted illegally or irresponsibly, Mr. Yadav appears to have based his decision on the petty political calculations of a local ruling party MLA, Narinder Bhati, who nurses ambitions of standing from the area for the Lok Sabha. Sadly for the Muslims of U.P., politicians seeking the votes of the community do so on the basis of protection racket politics rather than actually working to improve the living conditions of ordinary Muslims. As we head towards 2014, it is apparent the Samajwadi Party intends to pursue this approach.
What makes Ms Nagpal’s suspension as the Gautambudhnagar sub-divisional magistrate doubly alarming is that she was active in the crackdown against illegal sand mining on the Yamuna and Hindon river banks. The IAS officer had made enemies of the politically powerful sand and building mafia by organising special squads against illicit mining and seizing their illegal loads. Whether it was Mr. Bhati who chose to take political advantage of the mosque wall demolition or it was the sand mining mafia that used the mosque issue as an opportunity to get rid of an inconvenient officer, the unmistakable fact is that Ms Nagpal is a victim of political machinations. The rules governing tenure for the bureaucracy, including all-India services like the IAS, are complicated. While there is no easy way for the Central government to intervene in favour of Ms Nagpal, as suggested by Congress president Sonia Gandhi in a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the Uttar Pradesh government must realise its mistake and revoke the suspension immediately. The facts being what they are, this is not a matter that ought to be escalated as a dispute between the Centre and the State; hopefully, Chief Minister Yadav will see sense, and not sacrifice the interests of governance and administrative efficiency for some imaginary political gain.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-suspicious-suspension/article4989038.ece
5,8,2013,Half measure on tobacco control,"The Supreme Court has once again ensured that public health overrides commercial interests. The court’s intervention a few days ago brought to an end an eight-year delay in vacating the Bombay High Court’s stay in implementing point of sale rules on tobacco and tobacco products. Though the High Court has to still adjudicate the case, the manner in which the apex court faulted it for “passing the impugned orders” leaves no doubt that the 2004 statute, as amended in 2005, will not be struck down. Coming down heavily on the government’s lackadaisical attitude, a clearly enraged Supreme Court bench noted that the manner in which the government handled the matter in the High Court was “quite intriguing.” With all other avenues for promoting their products shut, tobacco companies had effectively used the last few opportunities to continue reaching out to their target audience. Captivating display boards placed strategically at the entrance to, and inside, shops helped them target vulnerable young people, and strengthen bonds with existing users. After all, the use of display boards and placards is one of the time-tested strategies used by marketers. The only difference is that the products advertised consist of harmful material rolled in paper or packed in sachets and sold as cigarettes and pan masala. Together, they kill one million people every year in India.
The rules allow only 60 cm by 45 cm boards without colour, brand names, logos, promotional messages, pictures or special illuminations to be used. The board shall only list the type of tobacco products available, and a sizeable portion at the top would carry a health warning to put off new customers and inform and dissuade existing users. However, what use are the restrictions on display boards when tobacco products displayed strategically on shop shelves themselves communicate a harmful message most powerfully and effectively? That the government has not been serious and sincere in preventing point of sale promotion becomes evident from the way the rules have been ambiguously and vaguely framed. They state that tobacco products shall not be displayed in such a way that they are visible, “so as to prevent easy access to persons below the age of 18 years.” Though in practice there is no way of complying with this rule while displaying the product, it provides ample scope for shops to violate the law but still argue that they are not falling foul of the law. The government should, therefore, follow the WHO’s recommendation by banning product display and “keeping tobacco out of public view.” It will result in fewer youths taking to smoking and also “reduce impulse purchases among adults wanting to quit.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/half-measure-on-tobacco-control/article4989039.ece
6,8,2013,Run out opacity,"The Board of Control for Cricket in India has long used its financial muscle and political clout to remain above public scrutiny. It has elbowed out regulatory oversight in crucial areas, including media licensing rights, procurement and maintenance of sporting infrastructure, sources of revenue, and anti-doping policies. That the BCCI has become an entity unto itself is manifest in the aftermath of the spot-fixing and betting controversy that plagued the Indian Premier League this year. The Board’s attempts to investigate the scandal were merely pro forma and the courts have predictably taken a dim view of this. What is staggering about the ‘probe panel’ instituted by the BCCI is that its mandate ran parallel to that of enforcement agencies. Two former High Court judges were appointed to the panel to legitimise the exercise but no information exists in the public domain about the manner of their selection. Money power and political patronage stand in the way of rudimentary accountability but opening up the Board’s activities to public scrutiny just might set the clock back. That is why the Justice Mukul Mudgal Committee’s efforts to ensure the BCCI comes within the purview of the Right to Information Act needs to be backed to the hilt.
The Committee — set up to draft the Sports Development Bill, 2013 — has struck the right balance between preserving the Board’s functional autonomy and ensuring transparency in its administrative agency. The BCCI’s records on issues like selection criteria, fitness details of players, and their individual terms of contract will not, according to the draft law, be subject to the RTI Act. This proposal to render the Board accountable is not new: it had gained currency even in 2011, when the first version, now junked, of the National Sports Development Bill was mooted. The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports sought to recognise the BCCI as a “National Sporting Federation” and consequently, as a “public authority” under Section 2(h) of the RTI Act. The BCCI sought refuge in a 2005 Supreme Court decision — which had ruled that it was neither managed by nor affiliated to the State — to claim it did not function in a public capacity. The government can be sure to expect similar legal challenges from the Board this time too. The Sports Ministry must stand its ground and accept the Mudgal Committee’s recommendations. There is nothing “private” about Indian cricket — not in the revenue it rakes, or in the loyalty it commands or in its role as a sport that brings the nation together. The Board that administers the game and fields a team that represents India must open itself to the public for whom it is played.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/run-out-opacity/article4992751.ece
6,8,2013,Signs of plentitude,"Rains have been good this year across much of India. With half the monsoon over, countrywide rainfall showed a surplus of 17 per cent. Last year, by contrast, after poor rains in both June and July, there was a deficit of 19 per cent and a drought appeared to be looming; heavy rains in September, however, came to the rescue. Helped by ample rains, this year the area sown for kharif crops is 12 per cent more than for the corresponding period in 2012. But not all parts of the country have shared in the bounty. Rains were below par in the eastern and north-eastern States in June as well as July, and the region as a whole ran up a deficit of 33 per cent for the first half of the monsoon. North-west India too did not fare well last month, although it got more than twice its usual quota of rain during the previous month. The meteorological subdivision of Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi had a deficit of about 41 per cent in its July rainfall and Punjab a shortfall of about 37 per cent. Central and southern India, on the other hand, were showered with surplus rain during both June and July. Indeed, many parts in these regions have already received much of the rain they typically get during the entire season. By the end of July, the meteorological subdivisions of Vidarbha, Kerala as well as Konkan and Goa had got more than 90 per cent of their monsoon rains.
It is almost 20 years since nationwide rainfall in the first half of the monsoon had a surplus of more than 15 per cent. The last time this happened was in 1994, when the country got nearly 24 per cent excess rain by the end of July. Rainfall records for the past 140-odd years show that when the first-half surplus crosses 15 per cent, the monsoon is likely to end with countrywide rainfall that is higher than the long-period average. In 1994, the season ended with a surplus of over 12 per cent. Since then, India has not experienced an ‘excess monsoon’ in which the seasonal rainfall surplus is 10 per cent or more of the long-period average. The India Meteorological Department’s forecast issued in June put a very low probability on that sort of monsoon occurring again this year. It gave the highest probability to a ‘normal’ monsoon (defined as one where any deficit or surplus in the country’s seasonal rainfall remains within four per cent of the long-period average). In a forecast issued recently, the IMD indicated that rains during the second half of the monsoon too were likely to be ‘normal’ (with any surplus or deficit in rainfall across the country during August and September coming within six per cent of the long-period average). For the present, the omens for this monsoon seem propitious.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/signs-of-plentitude/article4992756.ece
7,8,2013,Playing Parvez,"Politics cannot do much good to sports, but sports can do some good to politics. Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has been criticised for his tweets on the >non-selection of Kashmiri off-spinner and lower middle-order batsman Parvez Rasool for India’s last One Day International cricket match against Zimbabwe. But there is no denying an Indian team with Rasool playing would have been great not only for cricket in Kashmir — and thus, by extension, for cricket in India — but also for a people long on hurt and short on hope. Rasool would certainly have brought cheer to a State that has lived under the constant shadow of violence for more than two decades. Rasool’s selection to the playing XI would have provided a big inspirational boost to cricket in J&K, encouraging other youngsters to take to the game quickly and earnestly. The wider the talent pool, the greater the chances of finding more and better players, and the cause of Indian cricket would have been served well. Of course, stand-in captain >Virat Kohli cannot be blamed for not keeping the bigger picture in mind since his priority was to go with a team that would win all the matches. Giving everyone on the bench a look-in was secondary in his to-do list. In many ways, to have chosen Rasool for purely political considerations would have been worse than not having chosen him. The promising spinner would then have remained a ‘regional’ cricketer, and not earned the respect and admiration of India’s players and fans. The Kashmiri all-rounder did not need political godfathers for reaching this level in cricket, and he surely does not need them to climb further.
While there is surely a vast reservoir of cricketing talent waiting to be tapped in Kashmir, those who think a Kashmiri playing cricket for India can change the troubled history of the Valley are mistaken. The Kashmir issue is a complex one and Rasool, or cricket itself, can make no definite impact on the State’s future. It is surely too much to expect one cricketer playing for India to contribute in any substantive way to ending the alienation of Kashmiri Muslims in the Valley. Rasool has talent and his day will come. But getting him to do well for Indian cricket is the easy part. Untying Kashmir’s political knots will require more than the combined efforts of Kohli or M.S. Dhoni or the Board of Control for Cricket in India. Cricket is no magic wand that can erase scars that have accumulated over long years. When all is said and done, a political problem can only have political solutions. Cricket isn’t the problem in Kashmir, and cricket can’t be the solution.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/playing-parvez/article4996506.ece
7,8,2013,An unwarranted ban,"The Bangladesh High Court’s recent decision to annul the registration of the Jamaat-e-Islami does little to enhance the country’s democratic credentials. Whatever the Jamaat’s faults — and there are many, ranging from the still unresolved question of its complicity in the massacre of civilians during the 1971 war, to present-day acts of thuggery and street violence — banning it will not rid the country of its divisive ideology. The >Jamaat’s registration has been cancelled on account of its failure to acknowledge, in its charter, the supremacy of Bangladesh’s Constitution and parliament. The Election Commission and the Jamaat had been engaged in a back-and-forth since 2008, when the registration of political parties was made compulsory; while the latter had made substantial changes to its original charter, the EC felt it needed to do more to conform to the country’s statutory requirements. The >HC’s drastic ruling now bars the Islamist entity from contesting the next general elections, thus depriving the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party of a crucial electoral ally. On Monday, the Supreme Court’s appellate division — consisting entirely of judges appointed by the ruling Awami League (AL) — refused to stay this verdict, indicating clearly what its fate would be in appeal.
Banning the Jamaat may find support in some sections of Bangladesh’s civil society, but the action reeks of political persecution, coming as it does on the eve of elections. If the Jamaat’s attempts at stoking communalism for electoral gain are detestable, the guardians of Bangladesh’s secular character must ask themselves why it has been successful in this pursuit. In June, the BNP-Jamaat alliance trumped the AL comprehensively in elections to four major city corporations. Thanks to its lacklustre performance in office, Sheikh Hasina’s government has grown increasingly unpopular; banning the Jamaat will not resuscitate its poll prospects. In fact, doing so will not only deepen the theological-secular divide in Bangladesh, but also ensure the scars of 1971 remain open. Repressing the Jamaat’s political aspirations may even drive it underground — as with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt during President Hosni Mubarak's regime — offering it a freer hand to engage in violence. The Jamaat’s chequered history no doubt colours its political future. But Bangladesh has already set in motion an investigative process to hold those accountable for atrocities of the past. The Jamaat’s future is a political question, not a legal one. The decision to reject its communal mandate, and thereby put politics above religion, must come from the Bangladeshi people. Neither the government nor the judiciary can force its will on the electorate.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-unwarranted-ban/article4996503.ece
8,8,2013,Let’s not be so predictable,"The ambush and >killing of five Indian soldiers on the Line of Control has produced exactly the reaction that the perpetrators must have wanted — an overheated political and media pushback in India against moves by the two countries to restart their stalled dialogue. Over the last month, New Delhi and the new government in Islamabad were quietly setting the stage for the resumption of talks that had been derailed by the beheading of an Indian jawan at the LoC in January. Emissaries shuttled between the two capitals, and both sides were said to be on the verge of restarting the process. A meeting between Manmohan Singh and Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York had also all but been finalised. But it has been clear since the Mumbai attacks that whenever the two countries take even the most tentative steps forward, there are elements out to ensure such attempts make no progress. This time, the efforts at sabotage appear to have begun with the recent attempted bombing of the Indian consulate in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, except that it was foiled and instead ended up killing hapless Afghan civilians, including children. Rather than seeing through this game, the Bharatiya Janata Party, which made bold moves for peace with Pakistan while in power, has chosen to be predictable. The Congress’s craven surrender on earlier occasions, when it hit the “pause” button on talks out of sheer political panic, has only encouraged such grandstanding.
The uproar against talking to Pakistan and on Defence Minister >A.K Antony’s alleged “escape route” to the Pakistan Army misses the point that despite the bluster of a “befitting response”, there is no alternative to dialogue. Whether it was Pakistani soldiers or terrorists in military uniforms who killed the Indian soldiers is not germane. This is not the first time the truce along the LoC has been violated in the past 10 years of its existence. It is only by engagement that the two sides can protect this ceasefire, the value of which cannot be overstated. And, it is only through engagement that Islamabad can be held to its 2004 commitment not to permit terrorists to operate from territory under its control, and be pushed to act against those responsible for violence against India. Prime Minister Sharif has given every indication that he is sincere in his wish for friendship with India but equations between him and the Pakistan Army are yet unsettled. Which way the civilian-military balance tilts will depend in large measure on how Prime Minister Singh reacts to Mr. Sharif’s overtures. If India fails to grasp the civilian hand this time, that balance will only end up tilting in a way that will further harm its interests.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lets-not-be-so-predictable/article5000176.ece
8,8,2013,Cat and mouse games,"The Congress and the Samajwadi Party are natural rivals forced into an unnatural relationship by their respective political compulsions. This explains the SP leadership’s volatile and frequent mood changes with respect to the Congress and the United Progressive Alliance. Mulayam Singh and other SP leaders have become painfully formulaic in their reactions to the Congress: attack the party, take the quarrel to a level where a parting of ways seems imminent, but at the critical moment somehow find an excuse not to execute the threats. There is no longer any surprise or suspense over how a spat between the two parties will end, and the charade looks like playing out in one more case — that of >IAS officer Durga Shakti Nagpal, whose suspension by the Akhilesh Yadav government has triggered a national uproar. The SP blew a fuse when Sonia Gandhi wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh urging that the officer not be “treated unfairly.” What must have riled the SP is that the Congress president’s letter was not written for form’s sake or merely to appear to be doing justice. Far from it, Ms Gandhi not only made it clear she did not buy the SP’s story, she robustly endorsed the commonly accepted view that the officer was in fact vindictively suspended for standing up to the sand mining mafia in western Uttar Pradesh.
With the SP expectedly livid, the stage was set for another round of bitter verbal warfare and retaliation. Mr. Mulayam Singh justified the action against Ms Nagpal and the State government proceeded to charge-sheet her even as the party made headlines with its announcement that it will oppose the Food Security Bill awaiting passage in the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament. There are multiple reasons why the SP is unlikely to go the full hog. It can press amendments to the Bill — failing which stage a walkout — but it cannot afford to be seen as voting against a welfare measure for the poor. The party is aware that the Congress is in a position to find other supporters for the Bill. And finally, given the SP’s precarious situation in U.P., the party will be wise not to precipitate a crisis with the potential to lead to an early general election. The SP has to attack the Congress because of their shared pursuit of the Muslim constituency, which is perceived to have become more amenable to shepherding with the arrival of Narendra Modi as the face of the BJP. So when the Congress takes up for an officer like Ms Nagpal, it becomes the perfect opportunity for the SP to showcase its allegedly pro-Muslim credentials. The SP will of course calibrate its moves to suit its own partisan interests. But tragically for Muslims, they are more harmed than helped by these brinkmanship games.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/cat-and-mouse-games/article5000178.ece
9,8,2013,Spot in a fix,"It may be easy to say this with the benefit of hindsight, but the fact is that the payments crisis at the National Spot Exchange Ltd. (NSEL) was something waiting to happen. Here was >an exchange that was pushing the envelope well beyond its stated mandate of offering a trading platform for buying and selling commodities, mainly agricultural but also metals. From being a spot exchange, >NSEL morphed into yet another vehicle for speculating on commodities, especially at a time when equity markets were listless. And worse, unlike other commodities trading exchanges such as the MCX or NCDEX, NSEL operated in a regulatory vacuum, making it a dangerous proposition not just for traders but for the entire market system in the event of a collapse, as now. The government’s questionable decision to allow NSEL to deal in one-day forwards without bringing the exchange under regulatory watch has now caused a Rs.5,600 crore payments crisis. It is difficult to believe that the commodities market regulator — the Forward Markets Commission (FMC) — and the government were not aware of the goings-on at NSEL. More so considering that just in February 2012 the government had directed NSEL to file periodic reports with the FMC on its business. The regulatory inaction can only mean one of two things — benign neglect or tacit approval of NSEL’s activities. Either way, the government and the FMC need to answer for this.
If this was bad, worse was the manner in which the crackdown on the exchange finally came. By asking NSEL to stop launching new contracts forthwith and wind up existing ones on their due dates, the government probably precipitated a crisis. A gradual, orderly wind down of outstanding positions over an extended timeframe would have been a saner way of reining in the exchange’s business. These actions show up the FMC and the government in rather poor light. That said, the priority now is to ensure that the crisis is contained within NSEL and does not pose a risk to the system itself. This is important considering that there are a few big traders who are also major players in the stock markets. NSEL has already appointed a committee with independent members to oversee the settlement but the FMC has to be involved too. The government on Tuesday issued a notification empowering the regulator to oversee the settlement process and the FMC should get down to the job in right earnest. A number of small investors have been caught in the net unwillingly and their interests have to be secured. From the long-term viewpoint as well, the government should bring spot exchanges under the regulatory purview of the FMC, even if it means amending the Forward Contracts Regulation Act.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/spot-in-a-fix/article5004095.ece
9,8,2013,"Tehran is changing, pity about DC","The inaugural speech by >Iran’s new President, >Hassan Rouhani, who addressed the national parliament, or Majlis, in Tehran after being sworn in on August 3, reflects the mandate his landslide victory has given him. To a cheering Majlis, Mr. Rouhani announced that his domestic approach would be one of >moderation, together with advances in women’s rights and a reduction in government interference in everyday life, as well as improvements in the economy. Internationally, the President’s position is that if the West wants an “adequate response” from Iran, it should not speak the language of sanctions but that of respect. Secondly, Mr. Rouhani’s foreign minister is Mohammad Javad Zarif, a former ambassador to the United Nations, a veteran of secret bilateral talks with the U.S., and a remarkably accomplished diplomat. Encouragingly, leaders and other representatives of over 50 countries attended the new President’s inauguration; they were the first such to attend the ceremony since 1979. The Obama administration, for its part, stated that if Iran chose to “find a peaceful solution” to “the international community’s concerns” over its nuclear programme, it would find a “willing partner” in the United States.
Nevertheless, the U.S. kept away from the inauguration, and the White House’s curmudgeonly comment evades many key issues. The first is that of U.S. and European Union sanctions against Iran, which have been intensified by U.S. boycotts and threats against countries that still trade with Iran. The Iranian economy has suffered severely, and even western consumers are losing out; for example, U.S. residents are banned from buying the world-famous handmade Persian carpets and rugs. The U.S. seems to be fixated on hostility towards Tehran; the House of Representatives, despite the fact that 131 of its 435 members wrote to Mr. Obama on July 19 urging that he “reinvigorate” nuclear talks with Iran, voted by 400 to 20 on July 31 to toughen sanctions. The vote will seriously retard the prospect of any improvement in Washington-Tehran relations, and puts great pressure on Mr. Obama. Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s inflammatory statement, made in the context of Iran, that he is prepared to do anything necessary to defend his country against “a regime that threatens us with renewed annihilation” is equally obstructionist. Mr. Rouhani and his people could be forgiven for thinking that as far as the U.S. and Israel are concerned they can do nothing right, and that the nuclear issue is a smokescreen for their desire for regime change in Tehran. If Mr. Obama intends better, he has to show that clearly, courageously and swiftly.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tehran-is-changing-pity-about-dc/article5004096.ece
10,8,2013,A year of curiosity,"Curiosity — the car-sized remote vehicle with an array of sophisticated instruments — may have travelled only a little more than 1.6 km within the Gale Crater on Mars as it completed >one year on the red planet August 6, but the invaluable information it has sent back has certainly changed our understanding of the planet. In all, it has so far transmitted more than 190 gigabits of data and about 37,000 full images. The breathtaking discoveries started well before it soft-landed on Mars; for the first time ever, it became known that astronauts travelling to Mars on a round trip would be exposed to a “hefty dose of damaging radiation” that is close to the lifetime limit. The wealth of information it returned fulfilled the mission’s prime objective — to know if Mars ever had a habitable environment. The presence of paleowater had to be established to prove habitability. Its discovery of a “higher than anticipated” amount of water bound to sand grains in the soil sample came first. Curiosity then provided conclusive evidence that not just water, but drinkable water once existed. This was when the rover became the first to ever drill into rock on another planet. The powered mudstone sample analysed on board confirmed the presence of clay — it forms when water is neither acidic nor alkaline. Gypsum veins confirmed that water once flowed through fractures, even if the quantum of water present is not known. The presence of sedimentary rocks provided more information. But the discovery of a dry river bed with rock layers containing rounded pebbles was a bonanza. The rounded nature of the pebbles revealed many facets of the river, including the depth and speed of water flow and the length of the water course.
NASA announced in December last year the launch in 2020 of a Curiosity clone. But the mission’s goals are bound to go up many notches in the light of our changed understanding of the red planet’s environment a few billion years ago. If instruments to look for signs of life that once existed were already factored in, the array of instruments to be carried and the complexity of measurement to be made are surely bound to be upgraded. Whether the agency would wait for a future mission to bring back samples remains to be seen. Aside from the unimaginable palaeo-environmental findings by the rover since February, the radiation dose data collected by it during its long journey would mean that manned missions to Mars may not be possible in the immediate future. The agency has to go back to the drawing board to build a better spacecraft and protection gear for astronauts when they are on Mars for a year and outside the spacecraft conducting experiments for even very brief periods.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-year-of-curiosity/article5007484.ece
10,8,2013,Squaring the Turkish circle,"The conviction by Turkish courts of 275 military officers, politicians, academics, and journalists, after a five-year trial on terrorism charges, has exposed fundamental differences over the very nature of the Turkish state; it has also deepened the confrontation between Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Justice and Development party (AKP) and many other groupings in Turkish life. Among those sentenced to life are Ilker Basbug, chief of military staff until 2010, 16 other military officers, and Tuncay Özkan, a journalist. Another journalist, Mustafa Balbay, who is one of three MPs convicted, was sentenced to 34 years. 21 defendants were acquitted. The trial resulted from the 2007 discovery of 27 grenades in an Istanbul house owned by a military officer, with the prosecution claiming that a body called Ergenekon, after a mythical Turkish valley, was conspiring to overthrow the Turkish state. All the verdicts are to be appealed, but the conspiracy claim is not the first; in 2012, 300 officers were convicted in a separate trial known as the “Sledgehammer” case, which involved charges of conspiracy to bring down the government in 2003. Those convictions are also under appeal.
Turkey has long-standing tensions between civilian politicians and the military, which carried out coups in 1960, 1971, and 1980, and in 1997 forced a moderate Islamist government to resign. While the military sees itself as preserving Mustafa Kemal Atatürk’s secular legacy, Mr. Erdogan sees a major problem in what Turkish observers call the “deep state”, an unofficial but powerful network of senior civil servants, the upper military, and other officials. The idea of a “deep state” in which high officials are hostile to certain parties is not confined to Turkey, and as recently as the 1990s, eminent political scientists described a similar phenomenon in British politics. But then neither is it solely a Turkish issue that many major media bodies are owned by conglomerates whose owners may hesitate to endanger their other businesses by being too critical of the government. Mr. Erdogan, in response, points out that in 2011 his AKP won its third successive election with a 50 per cent share of an 83 per cent turnout. Nevertheless, the harsh Ergenekon sentences have evoked fears of executive pressure on the judiciary and have diminished public support for Mr. Erdogan’s attempts to curb the military. Secondly, the fact that the bulk of AKP support is in socially conservative rural areas and favours an Islamist agenda gives the military political leverage. To square that circle, the Prime Minister will need to respect the secular, liberal ethos of modern Turkey, even while he tackles the “deep state.”

12,8,2013,A scam from the sky,"Openness and transparency are great virtues in governance, but by themselves they do not guarantee an efficient administration. Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy assumed his accessibility as head of government will complement his simplicity as a politician and help him through his five-year term without a whiff of controversy. But after two years at the helm of the Congress-led United Democratic Front government, Mr. Chandy finds his carefully-constructed image of a people’s chief minister in tatters under the glare of the solar panel scam involving members of his own staff. Those who gained easy access to the Chief Minister’s Office were not just ordinary folk with grievances and petitions, but also fraudsters who leveraged their proximity to Mr. Chandy’s staff in order to dupe several people into investing in non-existent solar and wind-mill energy projects. Suddenly, what was earlier seen as accessibility turned out to be laxity, the simplicity more like naïveté. That his personal assistants and security personnel have been directly linked to the scam makes the situation extremely uncomfortable for Mr. Chandy. It is no longer enough for him to say he has not been accused or charged by any investigating agency or court. If indeed he wants to clear his name in this sordid episode, a judicial inquiry is necessary. Merely protesting his innocence won’t do.
For a coalition government surviving on a thin majority, a scam of this proportion could spell real trouble. Sensing an opportunity to take the initiative, the Left Democratic Front was quick to call for Mr. Chandy’s resignation. The CPI (M) and other Left parties are now planning to lay an indefinite siege of the Secretariat. The more the Chief Minister stalls an impartial inquiry, the greater will be the pressure on him to step down. Another worry for the Chief Minister emanates from within his own camp. The UDF is a group of opportunistic allies who have often forced the hand of the Congress high command against chief ministers with a dipping popularity graph. Mr. Chandy is not short of rivals even within his own party: the president of the State unit of the Congress, Ramesh Chennithala, is waiting in the wings should circumstances require a new head of government. The LDF may or may not be able to gain much from the scam before the 2014 Lok Sabha election. But if Mr. Chandy fails to play his cards well, his losses could be more immediate. Popular perceptions of guilt might be enough for the Congress high command to want to ring in a change in Kerala. The more he lets the situation drift, the more untenable his position becomes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-scam-from-the-sky/article5012984.ece
12,8,2013,An ugly campaign,"Mobile billboards in London boroughs warning illegal immigrants who are in the United Kingdom to “go home or face arrest”; stop and search operations against suspected illegal immigrants. While comparing the situation today with what prevailed some four decades back, when Enoch Powell could make his venomously racist speech, may be a stretch, the current slew of anti-immigration measures marks a new low in the Conservatives’ ostensible bid to tackle illegal immigration. The government more recently announced a visa bond scheme that it said was under consideration, which drew a domestic and international uproar, as the scheme targets six Commonwealth countries — India included — from where visitors on six-month U.K. visas would be asked to pay a bond of £3000. Stung by the sharp response, the government has put the scheme in cold storage for the moment stating that it will first do a pilot. In sum, the latest turn the immigrant policy has taken is unconvincing at best and offensive at worst. It lacks thought and planning, and strips people of human dignity both at home and abroad.
Curiously, the Commons select committee headed by a Conservative MP sees little merit in the Cameron government’s current goal, namely to narrow the difference between migration in and emigration out. The difference between the two is the net migration figure, and is based on an extremely random sample survey of international passengers, originally introduced to study tourism trends. Besides a large margin of error, this whole approach must also be grossly misleading because the largest number counted as ‘immigrants’ are overseas students. But the Commons report also says that Home Office statistics do not indicate the number of visa-holders who have leave to stay, or those that have over-stayed. The approach of the Home Office has yet again exposed cracks within the ruling Conservative-Liberal coalition. The Business Secretary, a member of the junior partner, has dubbed the entire campaign as highly exaggerated, considering that it is almost impossible for undocumented migrants to work in Britain legally and claim benefits. Labour’s shadow justice secretary has alleged that the real targets of the current anti-illegal immigration drive are the UK Independence Party voters whom the Conservatives want to win over. While there may be substance in these objections, the Lib Dem and Labour parties themselves are not free from the charge of playing the immigrant card at one time or the other. At another level, all the mainstream parties in Britain are guilty of pandering to the British National Party’s hostile anti-European stance, one that is essentially anti-immigrant.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-ugly-campaign/article5012985.ece
13,8,2013,A strategic milestone,"Technical accomplishments aside, the true significance of the reactor on board India’s first Indian nuclear submarine achieving criticality is strategic. INS Arihant marks the first step towards completing the third component of the triad of air, mobile land-based and sea-based deterrent forces envisaged in India’s nuclear doctrine. The advantage of nuclear submarines over conventional ones is their ability to remain under water for long without refuelling, and thus to travel long distances. It will, however, be a long haul from here on towards making this sea-based naval nuclear asset fully operational. Having validated the performance of the primary power pack, it has to be proven that the propulsion system can indeed be driven by nuclear power. The subsequent sea trials, which would involve complex speed, pitch and rolling manoeuvres, will test the ability of the reactor to withstand high acceleration loads and the fast response needed for rapid power ramp-up. These issues have posed serious nuclear fuel, material and engineering challenges, not hitherto encountered in land-based reactor systems. The Department of Atomic Energy and the Defence Research and Development Organisation deserve credit for successfully overcoming these. The full fleet, according to reports, will include seven such boats over a decade. This calls for enhanced submarine building and reactor fabrication capacity. More important perhaps would be preparing the operating personnel psychologically for long endurance inside an underwater cocoon.
Considering that most submarine accidents have involved nuclear submarines — most of them Russian — safety assumes great importance. Especially since there seems to have been substantial Russian assistance in the design of both the boat as well as the power pack. From a safety perspective, there is a larger issue that needs to be addressed. The entire strategic sector has remained out of purview of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board and the safety overview system in place for strategic nuclear systems has never been discussed in public. The issue obviously gets more complicated for sea-based nuclear assets. Moreover, the DRDO and the Indian Navy, under whom the nuclear submarines will operate, have limited expertise in nuclear-related matters. In terms of technology, India has now clearly demonstrated that it has the requisite expertise to launch a parallel stream of enriched-uranium based Pressurised Water Reactors (PWRs). The land-based prototype 80 MWt PWR reactor at Kalpakkam is expected to serve as a platform for the proposed chain of 900 MWe PWR power reactors in the country, whose design is stated to have been completed. But that would call for a substantial increase in uranium enrichment capacity as well.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-strategic-milestone/article5016330.ece
13,8,2013,No immediate threat,"The influenza A(H7N9) virus may not have the characteristics required to quickly and easily spread among humans but the first confirmed case of human-to-human transmission recently reported in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) indicates that it is not completely devoid of such ability either. The novel bird flu strain that emerged in China in late March caused infections in about 134 people and killed 43; WHO declared it to be “one of the most lethal influenza viruses seen so far.” As per an April 24 study, only two family clusters showed any possibility of spread among humans. The BMJ study has now confirmed a person-to-person transmission in one of the two suspected clusters — a 60-year-old father passing the virus to his 32-year-old daughter; the index patient and daughter both died. The father had definite exposure to poultry like a majority of infected people, while she only came in contact with his oral secretions. The route of transmission from the index patient has been confirmed by genome sequencing — the strains from both the patients are “almost genetically identical.”
The number of new infections in humans has dropped significantly in recent weeks. The closing down of poultry markets, and not the virus’s waning infectivity, could be the likely reason for this. In fact, the last infection was as recent as August 3. A recent study has detailed the H7N9’s potential to spread through air. While the avian strains failed, a strain isolated from humans was found to be “highly transmissible in ferrets” through respiratory droplets. Ferrets are the best animal models to study virus transmission among humans. The virus’s ability to efficiently replicate in human airway cells has also been demonstrated. Hence, there is no reason to drop our guard, considering the number of undetected cases in humans and H7N9’s ability to silently spread in poultry without causing disease. People with undetected infection may provide the virus an ideal opportunity to “adapt to humans.” The virus may also re-emerge in winter. Transmissibility among humans has so far been “non-sustainable” but it is important to know what changes are required to make the virus spread easily and become more virulent. Though controversial, there is a case for allowing scientists to engineer H7N9 strains to “assess the pandemic potential” of the circulating strains. This is a test case for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services after the huge controversy triggered last year over the H5N1 strain. Its decision would go a long way in dictating the kind of research that can be undertaken using U.S. federal funds.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-immediate-threat/article5016332.ece
14,8,2013,Acting on the bigger picture,"A multi-pronged strategy to shore up the rupee was widely expected and this is what Finance Minister P. Chidambaram announced on Monday. Three sets of measures by the >RBI — the first one was on July 15 — have given only limited respite with the rupee falling relentlessly after a brief period of trading in a narrow range of between 59 and 60 to the dollar. However, going by initial reactions on Monday and Tuesday, the government’s new package might not yet succeed in stabilising the rupee. The time has come to view the rapid rupee depreciation in a larger perspective — as a highly visible symptom of a much deeper economic malaise represented by the burgeoning current account deficit >(CAD), which, at over $90 billion, threatens macroeconomic stability. Through its latest measures, the government hopes to bring the CAD down to $70 billion, or around 3.7 per cent of GDP, a level it considers to be manageable at the present juncture. Towards that end, the new package seeks to address supply-side issues, curbing the import of gold, silver and a few “non-essential” items as well as oil. Tariff walls for >gold and silver are being raised. The government ambitiously expects to shave off $4 billion from the gold import bill alone.
The other part of the strategy is to stimulate dollar inflows by further liberalising external commercial borrowings (ECBs), freeing interest rates on non-resident Indian deposits, and directing a few public sector finance companies to mop up dollars by issuing quasi-sovereign bonds. The government hopes to bring in $11 billion through these measures but will the new strategy pay off? The near term goal of calming the rupee might not be achieved but what ought to be the real test is the government’s determination to get a handle on the CAD. There are pitfalls to be sure. The government’s neat estimates of dollar accruals and savings might be embarrassingly wrong. For instance, despite previous hikes in import duties, gold imports have surged. Oil imports have been inelastic and it is not clear how bulk consumers will reduce their consumption. Further relaxations in ECB norms will not be an unmixed blessing. Hedging costs for the corporates have soared, and non-hedging is extremely risky. It is hoped that the proposal to issue quasi-sovereign bonds has been duly deliberated upon. Their timing at this juncture is apt to send wrong signals to overseas investors. Forced into a corner, the government has at last looked at the big picture. But that should not be an occasion for espousing short-termism or untested policies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/acting-on-the-bigger-picture/article5019653.ece
14,8,2013,Justice as a game of chance,"The quality of mercy, Shakespeare would be disappointed to learn, seems highly strained in India. If Maganlal Barela, a convict on death row in Jabalpur Central Jail, is still alive, he has a newspaper report that broke the story of his imminent hanging to thank for the temporary reprieve. Barela was sentenced to death in 2011 by the Madhya Pradesh High Court for murdering his five infant daughters, after a heated argument with his wives over property. Last month, President Pranab Mukherjee rejected Barela’s clemency petition — nearly 18 months after the >Supreme Court turned down his appeal. It is unclear how long Rashtrapati Bhavan took to decide Barela’s fate but within days of it doing so, he was served a black warrant and readied for the gallows. The alacrity with which the establishment pursued his hanging reflects a disdain for his constitutional rights. A prisoner on death row is entitled to challenge in the Supreme Court the President’s rejection of a mercy petition. It is improbable that Barela had a chance to exercise this right in such a short span of time. In fact, the government’s attempt to rush his execution seems highly suspect given that it coincides with the Supreme Court’s recent comments calling it out for inordinate delay in deciding mercy petitions.
That it took a newspaper report to alert lawyers and activists to >Barela’s imminent execution highlights the arbitrary system in place to evaluate mercy pleas. The Ministry of Home Affairs is neither required by law to publish a list of pending and processed mercy petitions nor does it have to disclose the reasons tendered by the President. The Central Information Commission in July rejected a request by A.G. Perarivalan — convicted in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case — for those details. In fact, Rashtrapati Bhavan, which had put up a section devoted to mercy petitions on its website, removed it earlier this year. The ambiguity in this process of dispensing mercy may give the government some room to navigate hot-button cases — as it did with the stealthy execution of Ajmal Kasab and Afzal Guru — but it also subjects death row prisoners to an excruciating wait, undermining their rights. Recognising this sordid state of affairs, the Supreme Court has rightly pressed ahead with plans to institute a larger bench in October to review mercy pleas rejected after delay; Maganlal Barela’s will be one among them. Last week, the Court rejected the government’s request to review its decision to commute the death sentence of M.N. Das, whose mercy plea had been rejected after 11 years. The Court must now favourably receive the pleas of Barela and others who have shuttled between life and death thanks to the executive’s arbitrary policies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/justice-as-a-game-of-chance/article5019652.ece
15,8,2013,A tragic loss,"The sinking of INS Sindhurakshak, a Kilo-class diesel-electric submarine of the Indian Navy with enormous loss of life is an unprecedented setback to the national effort to strengthen undersea defence capabilities. Defence Minister A.K. Antony has correctly described it as the greatest tragedy in recent times. His department must get down to the task of determining what caused the explosion on board a vessel that has only recently returned after a two-year refit at the Zvezdochka shipyard in Russia. It should be possible to retrieve the damaged submarine, since it sank at the Mumbai dockyard. The wrecking of an important submarine capable of carrying cruise missiles is undoubtedly a matter of great concern, but it is the death of a large number of submariners who work in some of the most difficult conditions that makes the incident extremely tragic. Incidents in the past have been much less damaging. Some of them involved minor collisions between submarines and accidents with ships. For the Ministry of Defence, this is an alarm call to ensure that safety in design and operation is given top priority in the Navy’s ongoing programme to induct six Scorpene-class submarines. Regrettably, indigenous efforts at repairing and retrofitting Kilo-class submarines have not been successful. Recently, Mr. Antony spoke of adequate funding having been included in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Plan periods for the “Project 75 – India” submarine programme. The inquiry into the Sindhurakshak incident will potentially indicate design and safety aspects that must be strengthened without compromise.
What has happened to India’s submarine is of global significance because there is a downward trend in the number of incidents involving such vessels since the mid-1970s. In fact, fewer vessels have sunk due to explosions in recent decades, than due to flooding and collisions. A notable exception was the explosion that sank the Russian vessel, Kursk, killing 118 men in the Barents Sea 13 years ago. It is possible that the explosion on the Sindhurakshak, apparently intensified by the presence of munitions, was caused by the failure of safety systems linked to its power mechanism and batteries, or due to lapses in standard operating procedures. Clearly, the lessons from this disaster will be vitally important for the safety of the nine other diesel-electric submarines of the same class that the Navy lists as ‘active.’ Equally, there is bound to be greater interest in the Naval Materials Research Laboratory project to design a propulsion technology that is “air independent.” In other words, it could lower explosion risk from submarine power plant gas leaks, and help vessels stay underwater longer. For the Navy, though, this is a time of trial as it sifts through the wreckage of what was till yesterday a symbol of great pride.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-tragic-loss/article5023151.ece
15,8,2013,More than a game of chess,"It is indeed troubled times for the Darjeeling hills. Before matters are totally sucked into the vortex of deepening social and political unrest, the major players — the Centre, the State government and the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha — will have to stop their sabre-rattling and head for the negotiating table without further delay. The need of the hour is an inclusive, pragmatic approach to unscrambling the new dynamics that have arisen from a combination of various factors, not least of which is New Delhi’s nod to a separate Telangana State. The cry for Gorkhaland has received a fillip, ending the tentative silences born of the papering over of unresolved grievances and thwarted aspirations. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s almost flippant claim that “the hills are smiling” elicits little more than sneers in the hills. The three chief protagonists now need to take a fresh and hard look at the emerging scenario and negotiate a more relevant, less ad hoc solution. It needs going beyond the tripartite agreement they had signed more than two years ago for the setting up of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration. That agreement now seems like little more than a myopic, tacit pact of convenience intended to buy time rather than win an enduring peace.
The game of one-upmanship must be given up for good, as must brinkmanship, if calm is to be restored in a strike-weary region that has plunged into yet another spell of political uncertainty. There is more at stake than just the fate of a beleaguered, autonomous, regional body that never really got to take off since it was formed a year ago. The Darjeeling hills should not be viewed as a mere political chessboard where pieces are moved about with the aim of checkmating popular aspirations. Just as it is imperative for the Centre to assume a more proactive role and not remain content with the tripartite deal it was signatory to, the State government will have to learn the art of exercising tact. It is, after all, dealing with an issue governed by strong, emotive compulsions underpinning which are questions of self-identity. What is unfolding in the hills is more than just a “law and order situation.” As for the leadership that navigates the statehood agitation, it needs to abandon its recalcitrant posturing. Smarting under the admonishment of the Calcutta High Court for persisting with an indefinite strike that has been declared illegal, it is playing cat-and-mouse by trying out new forms of protest like janata curfews.

Vice-President Hamid Ansari was thus right in rebuking unruly members of the Rajya Sabha who did not allow him to conduct the business of the House earlier this week. “Every single rule in the rule book, every single [bit of] etiquette is being violated...If the Hon’ble members wish the House to become a federation of anarchists, then it is a different matter,” he noted when faced with disruptions from members of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Congress and the Telugu Desam Party. Members of Parliament who want his remarks expunged would do well to reflect on their own behaviour. Surely, if they are so alarmed at hearing the word “ >anarchists,” they should support strict adherence to the rule book in Parliament. There is really no cause for Mr. Ansari to withdraw his remarks. In any case, he did not refer to the House as a federation of anarchists; he only wondered whether the members wanted to make it one. As he himself has clarified, this was more in the nature of a question than an allegation or an observation. The matter should be allowed to rest here.
But the larger issue is not about expunging the remarks or letting them stay on the record. If all the voices in Parliament are not to be drowned in noise, then political parties must agree on not letting debate sink to the levels of a slanging match. The live telecast of proceedings, far from improving decorum, seems to have only contributed to attention-seeking disorders. On occasions, a few unruly members have been able to stall proceedings of Parliament taking advantage of the silence of the majority. The Women’s Reservation Bill, for instance, which supposedly had the support of an overwhelming number of MPs, could not be passed in the Lok Sabha thanks to the antics of members of parties such as the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal. Although the presiding officers of the House have powers to evict members, these are, quite rightly, used sparingly in Parliament. But if floor leaders of the parties are unwilling or unable to ensure good behaviour in the House and conditions for meaningful debate, then there will be a public clamour for harsher methods of dealing with deviant members. When MPs and legislators fail to use their mandate as representatives of the people in focusing attention on important issues and raising the quality of debate, public confidence in democratic institutions can only get eroded.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/for-voices-not-noises/article5026432.ece
16,8,2013,Looking for good company,"With Parliament passing the Companies Bill last week, the country will finally have a contemporary legislation to regulate the corporate sector. The existing Companies Act dates back to 1956, since when the corporate landscape has dramatically changed. While the new Companies Act takes into account the present environment by overhauling several provisions of the existing Act, such as, for example, the one pertaining to auditor appointments, a lot will depend on the subordinate rules under the different provisions that will framed by the executive. Even so, one particular provision — on corporate social responsibility (CSR) — has attracted a lot of attention and comment. The new law stipulates that companies above a certain size have to spend two per cent of their average net profit of the last three years on CSR. This is the first time that CSR has been mandated by law in any country in the world and that the government means business is evident from the fact that the company’s board has to create a committee to oversee CSR activities and the company’s policy in this regard has to be posted on its website. The board is also answerable if it fails to spend the mandated sum on CSR in a particular year.
The intent behind the provision is obviously noble and meant to nudge companies to give back to society a little of what they take from it. Yet, there are a few dangers of mandating CSR on companies which are basically profit-seeking enterprises answerable to their shareholders. There are companies and industry houses such as the Tatas that are known to spend liberally on CSR but on activities that are carefully chosen by them or their trusts established specifically for this purpose. What happens if the activities under the CSR rules to be framed now do not fit into the existing programmes which benefit society anyway? There is a danger here that the best will turn an enemy of the good. Second, there is genuine concern that companies will now be open to arm-twisting by local politicians seeking funds for activities that further their own interests. What protection do companies have in such an event? Third, to cut down on compliance costs, companies may well opt to mark the required contribution to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund or similar such schemes recognised by the Act as CSR spending. Given that these contributions also offer tax-breaks, the temptation will be tremendous indeed. In such an event, the larger purpose of the provision will obviously be defeated. The rules governing the provision to be framed in the next few months will, therefore, be crucial to the success of this initiative. It is important that the government involves industry associations such as CII and FICCI in this matter.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/looking-for-good-company/article5026433.ece
17,8,2013,"Egyptians die, the West watches","The violent crackdown throughout Egypt is exposing the depth of the crisis in that country even as those who elected President Mohamed Morsy in 2012 face increasing brutality at the hands of the security forces following the July 3 military coup. In the third and most brutal series of attacks on Morsy supporters since his ouster, at least 638 people have been killed and thousands injured, with improvised street treatment centres overwhelmed and hospitals struggling to cope. Security forces have also bulldozed protesters’ makeshift camps, with victims saying the vehicles ran over people; the camps in two Cairo squares included women and children. Doctors also report officials as blocking ambulances from reaching the injured. A dusk-to-dawn curfew imposed under laws passed by the now deposed Mubarak regime has been partly successful, but further and potentially even deadlier confrontations loom. The Muslim Brotherhood, parent body to Mr. Morsy’s Freedom and Justice Party, has called for a nationwide protest march. The coup leadership, for its part, has declared a one-month state of emergency.
Reactions, both domestic and international, remain totally ineffective but this is hardly surprising given the prevarication earlier witnessed on the coup itself. The military’s nominated Vice-President, Mohamed ElBaradei, kept his promise to resign if the confrontation became violent, but even his own National Salvation Front, the main political opposition, which has substantial support among the purportedly liberal classes, has distanced itself from him and has backed the coup. Neither United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s nor the European Union’s condemnation of the violence has had any impact. Above all, U.S. President Barack Obama’s cautious equivocation is very revealing. Saying that cutting annual Egyptian aid would only bring about more funding from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is disingenuous; U.S. aid greatly helps the Egyptian military, and it helps U.S. arms manufacturers, whose exports to Egypt Washington subsidises heavily. This hypocrisy is further confirmed by the White House’s failure to call the coup a coup, because U.S. law would then require an automatic stop to aid. Second, even the coup leaders have deplored the violence. Yet, international mediators have said it was the Egyptian military that wrecked a brokered plan which the Brotherhood had accepted. It is Egypt’s 84 million people who will pay the price for the military’s fear of democracy and for western self-interest, which is coupled with the West’s inability to accept the results of the very democracy it rapturously claimed heralded a new dawn for West Asia and North Africa.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/egyptians-die-the-west-watches/article5029716.ece
17,8,2013,Waving the wrong flag,"From the moment he was anointed the head of the campaign committee of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi seemed intent on drawing all attention to his own self. With his work area extended beyond Gujarat to the national stage, Mr. Modi evidently longs to be recognised as the face of the opposition to the Congress and the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre. It was no surprise, then, that he used his Independence Day speech in Bhuj to launch a frontal attack on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Regrettably, the unfurling of the national flag was turned into an occasion to pursue partisan politics as Mr. Modi sought “freedom” from rulers with a “slave mentality”and blamed Dr. Singh for not being “tough” on Pakistan. While the Congress leaves Modi-bashing to second-rung leaders like Digvijay Singh, Mr. Modi tirelessly picks on those he wants to rival, Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh. In his new role as prime ministerial challenger, Mr. Modi is entitled to hit out at the enemy whenever he gets an opportunity but he should remain within the bounds of propriety. An Independence Day function led by an elected official is not a party rally. Even within the BJP, L.K. Advani was inclined to take a jibe at Mr. Modi by pointing out that Dr. Singh’s speech did not criticise anyone. The veteran leader knew that such excesses of rhetoric on a day that belongs to all Indians regardless of their ascriptive or political identities will not win the party any new friends.
Ironically, less than a week ago, while addressing a public meeting in Hyderabad, Mr. Modi appeared to accept the fact that the BJP needed to woo new allies and influence more people before the next general election. That is why he actively wooed the Telugu Desam Party and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. This was tacit admission that while his brand of aggressive Hindutva could serve to excite the traditional voters of the BJP, he would still have to find allies in the south and broaden the National Democratic Alliance if his prime ministerial ambitions were to have any meaning at all. The overtures to the TDP and the AIADMK, both former allies of the BJP, were especially significant as he was the person responsible for the exit of the Janata Dal (United) from the NDA. While a BJP-TDP adjustment could win the NDA some seats in Telangana, Mr. Modi hopes his personal equations with Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa will eventually be translated into firm political support. But if he is serious about reaching out to others, Mr. Modi will have to decide what kind of politics he intends to pursue. Shock and awe tactics of the kind we saw on August 15 are likely to rebound on him.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/waving-the-wrong-flag/article5029718.ece
19,8,2013,Nothing here to like,"Mixed signals emanating from the Supreme Court have done little to strengthen efforts to protect free speech online. Last week, the court rightly hauled up the Uttar Pradesh government over its arrest of scholar and writer Kanwal Bharti for his Facebook post criticising the suspension of IAS officer Durga Shakti Nagpal. The same day, however, the SC refused to stay the implementation of the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011, which require websites to take down objectionable material posted by third-party users within 36 hours of being notified of the need to do so. Although the two incidents which drew the Court’s attention are separate, they point to a larger, systemic problem: the ultimate arbiter of what constitutes offensive online content is the executive. In practice, that means touchy politicians and trigger-happy policemen. Given that the imposition of penal laws falls within the domain of States, it was ill-advised for the Supreme Court to have left the IT Act’s implementation to them without framing clear guidelines. States have seized on this legal vacuum to use the Indian Penal Code and the IT Act to clamp down on dissent.
Kanwal Bharti’s case highlights this problem. The policemen who arrested him were acting on a criminal complaint filed by a close aide of Samajwadi Party (SP) leader and local MLA Azam Khan. Thanks to a simple Facebook post, Mr. Bharti was charged under Sections 153 and 295A of the IPC — the latter, like Section 66A of the IT Act, is a cognizable offence that requires no warrant — for “wanton provocation with intent to cause riots” and insulting religious sentiments. As if these ludicrous charges were not enough, the SP has egged on Muslim clerics in the area to demand the writer be booked under the National Security Act. The Supreme Court’s intervention comes not a moment too soon — but the judiciary needs to realise that Mr. Bharti’s harassment was made possible thanks to the discretion governments exercise in regulating cyberspace. That the court is inclined to view the IT intermediary rules favourably does not bode well for social media sites, on whom the United Progressive Alliance government has launched an assault for their hosting of politically sensitive content. The unfortunate fact remains that the implementation of penal provisions has not been tweaked to reflect the constitutional rights of “netizens” in India. The Supreme Court has a chance to set this record straight: in its verdict on S. 66A, expected later this year, it should strike down the provision while setting a higher bar for invoking penal provisions in the IPC and other statutes against internet content.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/nothing-here-to-like/article5035535.ece
19,8,2013,Food for thought,"At €2,50,000, the burger produced recently using meat cultured in a lab is probably the world’s most expensive sandwich. But it marks a major milestone in the long pursuit by a few scientists to grow meat in vitro. The small piece of meat containing 20,000 strips of muscle tissue, each one mm thick by 2.5 cm long, is a proof of concept that culturing meat in a petri dish is indeed scientifically possible. The starting material for the lab-made meat is a kind of adult stem cell harvested from the muscles of cattle. Unlike embryonic stem cells that need to be coaxed to become cells of a certain kind, adult stem cells are preprogrammed to produce specialised cells — muscle cells in this case. But the downside is that adult stem cells cannot replicate endlessly like their embryonic counterparts. Having proved the science, commercial production of meat would become a reality only if scientists solve a few major problems. The most challenging is finding a truly cheap, efficient, animal-free media in which the stem cells can be grown. The foetal calf serum media currently used come from slaughtered animals. Aside from the source of the nutrient broth, the fact that it also contains antibiotics and anti-fungal agents almost rules out this serum as a likely candidate when mass production becomes a reality. Animal-free media are commercially available, but are equally expensive. As a December 2010 paper in Nature points out, the nutrient media make up for about 90 per cent of the material cost of in vitro meat.
It may take a few decades for the technology to reach the stage where meat grown in customised bioreactors becomes available in supermarkets at a competitive price. But there is a clear need for such meat. Besides saving more than 42 million cattle from being butchered every year in the U.S. alone, the huge environmental gain that would accrue cannot be dismissed lightly. According to a 2006 Food and Agriculture Organization report, livestock raised specifically for meat release 18 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions; about 30 per cent of land is used for grazing and growing animal feed. The quantum of antibiotics used in livestock is one of the main reasons for the rise in drug-resistant bacteria. It would also minimise many viral strains from jumping from animals to humans. But logic alone will not help the cause. There is a need to make the product quite comparable in taste, texture and nutrient content to find more takers. Such hurdles can be overcome only if sustained funding is available. With the exception of the Dutch government, no country or major organisation has shown any inclination to fund this research. Hopefully, the latest demonstration may change all that.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/food-for-thought/article5035538.ece
20,8,2013,Irrational inexuberance,"On Monday, the financial markets continued to decline sharply from where they had left off on Friday. The rupee, under relentless pressure, fell below an exchange rate of 63 to the dollar, closing at yet another all-time low. Benchmark indices declined in tandem, while bond yields, reflecting the great uncertainty, zoomed. Gold prices have shot up as attempts to rein in demand ahead of the festival season failed miserably. This mayhem cannot be attributed to any one factor but clearly, recent rupee support measures have failed. Specifically, the Reserve Bank of India’s moves last week to restrict the scope of overseas investments by resident Indians and companies have not been received well. Although on closer examination the new rules are not as stringent as the financial markets make them out to be, the very idea of imposing restraints on any type of capital flows seemed to harp back to the days of foreign exchange rationing. It may not be a reversal of the liberalisation process as many have claimed, but the underlying fear that controls would be applied to inward flows as well, including those by foreign institutional investors has to be assuaged urgently. Even the Prime Minister’s assurance on this count has not been enough. Another aggravating factor has been the growing evidence of an economic recovery in the U.S. This has already caused capital invested in India and other emerging markets to flow back to the U.S. The prospect of the Federal Reserve’s ultra-soft monetary policy ending has already raised bond yields there.
Exaggerated or not, the financial markets’ sharp reactions ought to be seen as another instance of collateral damage in the wake of the rupee stabilising policies that began in mid-July. The inability of policy measures to check the fall of the rupee should prompt a debate on the costs of implementing them. The dilemma will then become obvious. If, for instance, the RBI’s moves to tighten liquidity and indirectly raise interest rates to check the rupee’s fall stays longer than intended, there is no doubt that growth will suffer. But growth will also be impacted if the rupee continues to weaken, inflation remains high, unhedged corporate balance sheets come under increased pressure and fiscal consolidation becomes even more challenging. The urgent task is to calm the markets. Clearly, for policymakers there are no easy options at the moment. Having chosen a particular line, it is best to stay on course lest the credibility of our monetary institutions is undermined. More effective communication will certainly help, as will the RBI and the government following the elementary rule of not speaking in discordant voices.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/irrational-inexuberance/article5039272.ece
20,8,2013,Mugabe’s machinations,"Any day now, Zimbabwe’s highest court is expected to hand Robert Gabriel Mugabe five more years to add to the 33 spent at the helm of his country. Four years after the bloodshed of the previous elections resulted in an internationally brokered unity government comprising Mr. Mugabe’s ZANU-PF party and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), the President has delivered a largely peaceful if not entirely credible election. In 2008, Mr. Mugabe was trailing the MDC’s Morgan Tsvangirai when the security forces essentially ended the contest by killing more than 200 people. This time around, the 89-year-old liberation veteran won 61 per cent of the vote, while his party claimed a two-thirds majority in parliament. The African Union and Zimbabwe’s neighbours, barring Botswana, have cautiously endorsed the result but have rightly pointed to serious shortcomings in the polling process — particularly voter registration, inaccurate voters’ rolls, printing of millions of additional ballot papers and the disenfranchisement of hundreds of thousands of voters. The conduct of the electoral commission, as Mr. Tsvangirai noted, resembled a referee who had thrown away his whistle and joined the other team. Mr. Tsvangirai had asked Zimbabwe’s Constitutional Court to nullify the elections, but withdrew his challenge on the expectation that the judiciary is unlikely to cross swords with Mr. Mugabe. Nevertheless, the court, which had directed the government to hold general elections by July 31 at all costs, is expected to rule on the matter on Tuesday.
If Mr. Mugabe has manipulated the process, Mr. Tsvangirai must also accept that his party was hopelessly outmanoeuvred. The MDC was caught unawares by the sudden declaration of polls and went into the election in two minds, promising victory while insisting that the process was rigged against them. Torn between its many constituencies of white farmers, western allies, trade unions, civil society, disaffected urban youth, and the countless others alienated by ZANU-PF’s interminable rule, the MDC failed to put forward a clear agenda. The ZANU-PF, in the meantime, spent four years fine-tuning its party machinery, rallying its supporters, demonising its detractors and spelling out a coherent strategy of land reform and indigenisation that consolidated its impressive rural mass base. After a decade of economic turmoil, ZANU-PF’s controversial land reform has delivered farms to hundreds of thousands of families, while the dollarisation of the economy has lent some stability to the national economy. In the run-up to this election, Mr. Mugabe’s supporters and critics were predicting a ZANU-PF victory anyway; the tragedy of the managed polls is that we shall never really know for sure.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mugabe%E2%80%99s-machinations/article11942331.ece
21,8,2013,A preventable tragedy,"Even by the standards of Indian Railways, the tragedy in Bihar in which nearly 30 pilgrims were mowed down by an express train is especially shocking. Collisions, derailment, fire and human failure cause railway accidents every year, taking a heavy toll of life. But what happened at the Dhamara Ghat station in Khagaria district on Monday morning was beyond imagination. There are cases reported every day of trains running over an odd jaywalker, or even elephants crossing the track. But when dozens of people, a majority of whom were women and children, are stranded on a track at a station that does not even have a proper platform, the picture changes vastly. The tragedy happened around 7.45 a.m. and visibility was apparently not an issue. The Patna-bound Rajyarani superfast express was crossing the station at about 80 kmph, something it apparently regularly does. The pilgrims, who were trying to cross the tracks to participate in a temple festival nearby, were trapped. They could not climb to a platform for safety and another train was standing on a parallel track. The engine driver had a green signal and was running through. On seeing the track full of people, he jammed the emergency brakes. But it was too late.
Though the agitated locals assaulted the engine drivers, it is wrong to fault the latter for a tragedy in which they arguably played just one part. The Railways claims complete right of way for a running train, and any person, animal or object on the track is, by definition, held to be at fault for being there. But the responsibility of the Railways does not end with technical adherence to right of way rules. Given the fact that Dhamara Ghat is not even a middling station, trains hardly ever stop there. Presumably, that is why a proper platform was never built. But shouldn’t the Railways have at least made provision for the safe passage of people wanting to cross from one side of the tracks to the other? At the very least, a pedestrian overbridge ought to be provided. If the Railways can maintain a small station and staff for the place, surely they have to ensure that the safety of local residents is also taken care of. Obviously, like unmanned level crossings across the country, Dhamara Ghat cannot be the only such station without basic safety provisions. Railway tracks have been a part of the Indian landscape for more than 150 years and that familiarity has bred a certain indifference to the danger involved in stepping across them. While inquiring into this terrible accident, the Railways must identify all such vulnerable places where people gather in large numbers for one reason or another and make provision for the orderly and safe crossing of tracks.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-preventable-tragedy/article5042513.ece
21,8,2013,What lies beneath,"Nothing represents the near collapse of governance more acutely than the manner in which over 200 files pertaining to the controversial coal mining licences have gone missing. Indeed, what is most shocking is that the CBI is unable to trace these files even though identical copies are supposed to be lying in the custody of at least four Central ministries, not to speak of State governments from where the original recommendations for the coal block allocations came. Some 45 files relating to coal block allocations between 1993 and 2005 are missing from the ministries of coal, steel, power, industry and the relevant departments of the State governments. Another 157 missing files relate to the rejection of applications by the screening committee comprising members of all relevant Central government and State government departments. The screening committee would surely have recorded reasons for those rejections in those files based on certain criteria and guidelines. The CBI is trying to lay its hands on these files to see whether consistent guidelines were followed in granting or rejecting coal blocks. But the agency has received no help so far in tracing the missing papers, this despite the Supreme Court’s directive that the Central and State authorities share all relevant files with the CBI.
After the court’s directive, the government appointed a search committee consisting of members of various ministries. The search committee has also expressed its inability to trace the files. The minutes of the search committee proceedings, which are in The Hindu’s possession, are not without a touch of unintended black humour: at one place, the committee even suggests that the government should go back to each applicant to get the original details of their applications made over 10 years ago. Can one get more bizarre than this? Will an applicant who has illegally got a coal block share any information? Clearly, there appears to be a collective attempt to cover up the procedures adopted so that the allocations made from 1993 to 2005 cannot be probed. After The Hindu highlighted the search committee findings last week, the >Opposition has demanded a thorough probe into the matter. The government has given an assurance that it will trace the missing papers and hand them over to the investigating authority. One doesn’t know whether the present conspiracy to cover up illegal coal allocations is so deep as to have actually removed every trace of the files in its wake. This will be known only after the probe is completed. But the fact that this could happen in a case that the Supreme Court is closely monitoring is a pointer to the high stakes that the truth must surely involve.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/what-lies-beneath/article5042514.ece
22,8,2013,A shot across freedom’s bows,"“[He] that do bring the news made not the match,” wrote Britain’s most celebrated playwright; that country’s government should perhaps learn his lines. On Sunday, the police at Heathrow detained David Miranda — the partner of lawyer-journalist Glenn Greenwald who brought Edward Snowden’s leaks of U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) documents to light — for nine hours, interrogating him under the Terrorism Act. Mr. Miranda, a Brazilian, was returning home from Berlin, where he had been in touch with a film-maker working on the Snowden files. If the Cameron government took aim at the messenger, it has shot itself in the foot. The episode reveals an establishment desperate to please its “special” ally, the U.S., and cover up its own egregious surveillance operations. That Mr. Miranda’s airport detention was meticulously orchestrated indicates it had the blessings of elected officials at the highest level — the White House’s acknowledgment, that it was given “a heads-up” in advance, confirms as much. This is not the first time innocent individuals have been targeted for their alleged role in the NSA leaks. Last month, four European nations closed their airspace to Bolivian President Evo Morales, on the unfounded claim he was ferrying Mr. Snowden to safety. Attempts to intimidate David Miranda, and through him, Mr. Greenwald, represent a new low: the “liberal democracies” in question seem capable of plumbing any depth to mask their surveillance schemes.
Edward Snowden may have been granted temporary asylum in Russia, but the West has taken upon itself to plug any further leaks by harassing journalists. Alan Rusbridger, The Guardian’s editor, has narrated how officials threatened him for months to surrender or destroy the material his newspaper obtained from Mr. Snowden. The British government then used the threat of legal injunction to ensure the physical destruction of Guardian computers purportedly containing sensitive material. If Mr. Miranda’s ordeal exposes the readiness of governments to twist the implementation of draconian laws out of context, the threats Mr. Rusbridger has written about highlight the scant regard the British government has for its own press. Mired in their efforts to “control the damage” caused by Mr. Snowden’s leaks, the U.S. and its allies seem to have lost the plot. The NSA documents, in the publication of which Mr. Greenwald and The Guardian merely served as conduits, have triggered a robust public debate over where intelligence agencies should draw the line in their snooping. Instead of swiping blindly at those standing up for privacy, the U.S. and Britain should learn to respect within their own borders the freedoms they supposedly champion around the world.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-shot-across-freedoms-bows/article5045645.ece
22,8,2013,Crowd censoring,"Tamil nationalist groups are again displaying an intolerant streak. They want Madras Café, a film loosely based on the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, to be banned because it shows the Tamil Eelam struggle in Sri Lanka in a poor light. Though the Madras High Court has rightly declined to stay the release of the film, some groups seeking to ban the film are readying themselves to create a law and order problem as a form of protest. That apprehension of law and order disruptions cannot be grounds for banning a film is settled law and has been upheld repeatedly by the Supreme Court of India. In its judgment in S. Rangarajan v Jagjivan Ram involving the film Ore Oru Gramathile, in 1989, the court was unequivocal that “freedom of expression cannot be suppressed on account of [the] threat of demonstration and processions or threats of violence.” The right to freedom of speech and expression is enshrined in the Constitution, and chauvinist elements, no matter of what hue, should not be allowed to infringe on this right citing some imagined slight to a group or community. The onus is on the State government and its policing arm to act against those attempting to disrupt law and order. Whether the film is good or bad, whether it is fact or fiction, all these have nothing to do with the right to freedom of expression of the film-makers and artistes.
Of late, film-makers and distributors have been organising special screenings for representatives of groups or communities who apprehend that the film could be offensive to their sensibilities. In Tamil Nadu, the government appears to have encouraged such groups by banning the film Dam 999 and seeming sympathetic to those wanting a ban on Vishwaroopam. The Central Board of Film Certification is the only competent body to censor a film, and once cleared by the board, no film should again have to be subjected to “clearance” from groups claiming to have been offended by it. Chauvinist elements are emboldened when a government adds to the pressure on the film-makers, instead of getting tough on those threatening to disturb law and order. Too often, the producers are forced to compromise and agree to cuts rather than risk prolonging the release of the film. When the government does not stand up for freedom of speech and expression, film-makers, distributors and exhibitors think it is safer to buy peace with the chauvinist groups. It would reflect very poorly on the administrative capabilities of the Tamil Nadu government if the film is withheld from exhibition for fear of violence. As for those who wish to protect their fragile sensibilities from being hurt in any manner, how’s this for a really simple remedy? Don’t see the movie.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/crowd-censoring/article5045646.ece
23,8,2013,Debate and pass the Food Bill,"The National Food Security Bill (NFSB) has been derailed yet again in the past few days due to continuous disruptions of Parliament. The Congress Party made an ill-advised attempt to pass the bill on August 20, Rajiv Gandhi’s birth anniversary. Sure enough, the opposition parties went out of their way to scuttle this move and fell over each other to disrupt the Lok Sabha that day. This is only the latest episode in a long saga of virtually continuous disruption of Parliament from the Budget session onwards. The pretexts used by opposition parties include the coal scam, the Chinese incursion in Ladakh, the plight of an Indian prisoner in Pakistan, a case of child rape, the creation of Telangana, and the price of onions, to name a few. The government has not helped matters by giving opposition parties so many good reasons to be agitated. But paralysing Parliament for months on end does nothing to resolve these problems. The NFSB is only one casualty of this stalemate. Other important social legislation are also languishing. For example, a bill that could give enormous relief from excruciating pain to millions of cancer patients, by removing outdated restrictions on the use of morphine, has sunk without a trace.
Some parties have lost all credibility in this tussle. The Bharatiya Janata Party, for one, speaks in different voices on the Food Bill. Even as some BJP leaders complain the draft does not go far enough, others argue that it is unaffordable. For all its claims of supporting the bill, it is increasingly apparent that the BJP would like to see it scuttled. This obstructive attitude seems to be rooted in a fear that the law, once passed, will bring votes to the Congress. This fear is unfounded. The bill is an opportunity for any party to get popular support by making a good job of implementing it. In any case, since it will take at least a year for the provisions to get off the ground, the NFSB is unlikely to have much impact on the 2014 election. Sadly, the Congress itself has similar delusions about quick political dividends. And its attitude to the subject, too, is contradictory. On the one hand, the party insists food security is a non-partisan issue. On the other, it is trying to use the bill as an electoral card. As tensions intensify, it is increasingly difficult to be optimistic about a rational and effective roll-out of this crucial legislation. MPs need to take a more enlightened view of the bill, instead of focusing on very speculative electoral dividends. Many parties have tabled useful amendments that require informed discussion. A constructive resolution of the current impasse could make a big difference to millions of people who live in conditions of intolerable insecurity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/debate-and-pass-the-food-bill/article5049426.ece
23,8,2013,The Palk Bay catch,"Sri Lanka’s latest position that it will prosecute Indian fishermen arrested for poaching instead of arranging for their early release is bound to cause alarm in Tamil Nadu, where over 100 families await the return of their kin from Sri Lankan jails. The country’s External Affairs Minister, G.L. Peiris, has clarified that the stress is not on detention, but deterrence; and that a fine, rather than a long jail term, could be equally effective. This may not be enough to address the disquiet in Tamil Nadu over their continued imprisonment. Chief Minister Jayalalithaa has repeatedly asked for India’s intervention, and the Union government has summoned the Sri Lankan High Commissioner and issued a démarche. Sri Lanka’s response has been to highlight the frequency, scale and unsustainable nature of poaching by Indian fishermen. It is understandable that Colombo believes imprisonment for just a few days is insufficient deterrence against repeated incursions and plunder of its marine resources. It is possible that diplomatic intervention may ultimately set free all those detained, but it will hardly be the end of the problem.
Routine crossings, arrests and release need not be the only way of dealing with this seemingly intractable problem. On the one hand, fishermen in Tamil Nadu believe Sri Lankan waters are their “traditional” fishing grounds, and on the other, their Tamil counterparts in northern Sri Lanka, eager to make full use of their post-war freedom to fish, understandably resent the repeated incursions of Indian fishers into their maritime territory. Any meeting ground between these two claims will have to come from the fishermen themselves. Any settlement they arrive at will have to be backed by appropriate government measures. It is in this context that New Delhi and Colombo must facilitate a fresh process of negotiations on how best the two sides could share the marine resources. The earlier such a process is begun the better for fishermen from both sides. Further, the bilateral Joint Working Group on Fisheries has not met for a long time and it is India’s turn to host it. A key priority will be to ensure that Tamil fishermen in northern Sri Lanka, who were robbed of their livelihood during the war years, be given a chance to reclaim their maritime resources. The available resources are insufficient to meet the competing demands of both sides, and some will have to look for alternative livelihoods. Instead of crying foul over routine arrests, the Tamil Nadu government must strengthen measures to wean its fishermen away from unsustainable fishing practices, encourage deep-sea fishing and come up with livelihood solutions for those left out.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-palk-bay-catch/article5049428.ece
24,8,2013,The right to talk and write,"Journalists in India have no special rights. Unlike the United States, freedom of the press in the country does not flow from any special provision or amendment to the Constitution, but from the right to free speech and expression. Article 19(1) (a) of the Indian Constitution confers this right subject only to reasonable restrictions specified in Article 19(2). Therefore, to propose licences, qualifications and common entrance examinations for journalists, as Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari did a few days ago, is to try to circumscribe and limit the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. Dissemination of information might be the business of some news organisations, but it is also an essential part of the everyday activities of countless Indians who talk, post, upload or tweet what they see, hear, sense or think. What distinguishes journalists employed by a news organisation and private individuals taking advantage of social media and personal communication channels to disseminate information is not the nature of their work, but the public standing and credibility that they command. Any attempt to prescribe licences and qualifications for journalists will necessarily end up limiting what ordinary citizens can do. As in other democracies, newspapers in India do not require a licence to operate. In authoritarian or managed democracies, where press licensing is the norm, the threat of a cancelled licence is often enough to ensure the media toes the official line. If journalists are to be given licences, can newspaper licensing be far behind?
All of this is not to say that news organisations need make no effort to improve the standards of their journalism. In the race to be the first to break the news, television channels, and sometimes newspapers too, often get their facts wrong and the context mixed-up. But, as the best journalism schools have already realised, practice, not theory, makes a good journalist. Mr. Tewari’s proposal seems more like a trial balloon: he gave no details of what exactly he had in mind, and did not appear to have given serious thought to all the implications. Indeed, his train of thought mirrors that of the Press Council of India Chairman Markandey Katju, who, some time ago, set up a committee to decide on minimum qualifications for a journalist. The Minister wants the minimum qualification to apply equally to subject experts contributing to a news organisation, reckoning that they would not resent the requirement. What is mooted as an exercise to raise the quality of journalism could just as well pose a threat to the free flow of information, and to the freedom of speech and expression.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-right-to-talk-and-write/article5052987.ece
24,8,2013,The way forward in Assam,"The Manmohan Singh government’s decision to carve Telangana out of Andhra Pradesh has given fresh impetus to statehood demands across India but nowhere has the effect been more divisive than in eastern India. At least four ethnic groups have begun to press their claims for separate States to be carved out of Assam. The Bodos, the Karbi, Dimasas and Koch-Rajbongshis are up in arms in support of their respective demands. But the simple fact is that these cries for statehood are not only ill-advised but also untenable and impractical. For one, the territories being demanded by the different groups in pursuit of their own ethnically, homogeneous provinces actually overlap with one another. Besides, Assam’s own territorial issues with more than one of its neighbouring States remain unresolved. Third, these conflicting and often competing political aspirations make for a toxic cauldron, predicated as they are on the dangerous assumption that it is not possible or desirable to create multi-ethnic or multicultural provinces in which the rights of ethnic, linguistic and cultural minorities are constitutionally guaranteed and administratively ensured.
Whatever the trigger, the present unrest highlights the urgent need for administrative systems that can help meet regional, developmental and identity aspirations. This can be done by strengthening the autonomous, administrative divisions in Assam established on the basis of the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. Currently, these are the Bodoland Territorial Council, the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council and the Dima Hasao Autonomous District Council. In addition, there are six notified tribal autonomous councils where the territory has not been specified. One of the sticking points with regard to the latter group relates to dual authority owing to the simultaneous existence of panchayati raj structures. This needs to be addressed suitably. The experience in Tripura over the past decade and more has shown that the implementation of appropriate autonomy packages could prove to be an effective salve, and an aid to development. As in Tripura, the functioning of democratic processes at grass-roots level ought to be ensured in Assam. The sensitive handling of grievances over funding, and the protection that needs to be extended over issues of language, culture and land are essential. Powers and functions consistent with local customs, traditions and needs have to be conferred on tribal autonomous systems. The fair and practical long-term solution to the turbulence in the region lies along this path. But at the end of the day, as Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi has repeatedly said, Assam and its people should “live together” by making peace among themselves.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-way-forward-in-assam/article5052988.ece
25,8,2013,Attacking Syria is a bad idea,"As allegations fly thick and fast that the Syrian Army attacked a Damascus suburb with chemical weapons last week, the West seems once again on the verge of committing itself to another disastrous military adventure. Though opinion is still divided within the United States, all indications are that Washington is thinking of aerial bombardment along the lines of Nato’s 1999 attack on Yugoslavia, once again citing humanitarian compulsions to justify what would be an act of aggression. Before the international community evaluates and debates its options, however, surely it is essential that there be an independent investigation of the incident. Though the Bashar al-Assad regime possesses stocks of chemical weapons, earlier allegations of their use by the government have never been conclusively verified. Ironically, U.N. investigators arrived in Syria right before the attack in which chemical munitions were allegedly used; only a government looking to discredit itself would have timed their deployment in this manner. Did hotheads within the regime act recklessly, disregarding the obvious international consequences? Or has the opposition staged a provocation to tarnish the regime, as the Assad government and its allies like Iran believe? Damascus has said it will allow U.N. experts to visit the site of the alleged attack, a counter-intuitive offer if it really used chemical munitions there. The fact that Washington is not interested in on-the-ground forensics suggests the Obama administration has already made up its mind.
Whatever the case, the alleged use of WMDs in Syria must not be made a pretext for illegal intervention. There is no basis in international law for drawing “red lines” — as U.S. President Barack Obama has done — the crossing of which would permit the unilateral use of force without U.N. Security Council authorisation. Even if law and morality were on its side, western military strikes would still be a bad idea. As it is, the expectation that some messianic solution to the civil war will come from outside Syria’s borders — either from the West’s military might, or the money and arms pumped by regional powers — has made the armed opposition consistently oppose any proposal for a political settlement. Syria’s toxic environment, in which both the government and sections of the opposition have committed war crimes, cannot be cleaned up by the West’s firepower. Even if the U.S. and its allies were to succeed in destroying the Syrian state, as they did the Iraqi and Libyan ones before, an anarchic, partitioned Syria will radiate instability throughout West Asia. As he ponders his next move, Mr. Obama should be careful what he wishes for.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/attacking-syria-is-a-bad-idea/article5058891.ece
26,8,2013,Playing politics,"It is a pattern with bullies that they back off when challenged. Ground reports from Ayodhya and neighbouring areas suggest that the Vishwa Hindu Parishad exhibited this typical trait on day one of its fortnight-long “84-kosi parikrama,” now renamed a “yatra.” With the principal dramatis personae rounded up and placed under house arrest, the inauguration of the yatra fizzled out, though it is difficult to say whether the peace will hold. Just why the right-wing Hindu organisation renamed its programme is a story in itself. It turns out that seers attached to Ayodhya’s different akharas (religious traditions) had ritually performed the parikrama three months ago, in accordance with the Hindu calendar period of Chaitra Purnima extending up to Baisakh Navami (April-May, 2013). Not surprisingly, as our field report recounts, there is anger among the Ayodhya priests over the VHP misinterpreting the Hindu ritual with political dividends in mind. Last heard, they were busy organising a “siddhi-buddhi yagna,” praying for the VHP to gain wisdom. That the yatra has been intended with electoral calculations ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election is apparent from its suddenness. Indeed, relative calm had prevailed coinciding with the chief ministership of Mayawati, who, notwithstanding her other faults, kept a hawk-like watch on law and order in Uttar Pradesh.
The reason for the renewed tensions has been attributed to the Samajwadi Party’s interest in occupying the opposite side of the communal divide. A noticeable escalation in sectarian incidents has marked the tenure of Akhilesh Yadav. And yet, the Chief Minister deserves praise for acting firmly in this instance. The tight measures, including detention of the VHP’s top-order, were required because there was enough in the build-up to the yatra to suggest it could turn violent. Unlike the April-May parikrama that concluded peacefully largely because it stuck to the traditional route, the VHP’s yatra was deliberately designed to go through communally sensitive areas. Against this backdrop, it was incumbent on the Bharatiya Janata Party to rein in its troublesome affiliate, establishing thereby that it had left behind its divisive past and evolved into a mature political party capable of acting impartially when required. Unfortunately, the BJP has not only lent full support to the VHP, arguing that the yatra was a fundamental right, on Monday it disrupted Parliament over the issue. This overt support to the VHP does not square with the BJP’s stated claim that it will contest the next general election on the platform of good governance and development. When there is ample ammunition at hand to deploy against the Congress on the corruption front, why the BJP would choose to rake up a divisive, communal issue is anybody’s guess.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/playing-politics/article5062023.ece
26,8,2013,A persisting confusion,"The entire world has been waiting for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to articulate his government’s plan for dealing with the scourge of terrorism that has not just eaten into Pakistan’s vitals but remains a threat to other countries as well. It was hoped he would do so in a national address last week, his first after taking charge of the country in June. Disappointingly, Mr. Sharif seemed to have little to say that inspired hope. He accurately described terrorism as an existential threat to his country, but appeared confused on how to deal with it. He spoke in several voices, saying the government was prepared to do so by dialogue or through the use of force, ultimately suggesting that the best option was to talk with those who had chosen the path of violence. Pakistan’s new political leadership evidently remains under the illusion that the Taliban and the array of militant groups allied with them across the country can be persuaded to rejoin the national mainstream. Considering that these elements killed more Shia Muslims in Pakistan last year than at any other time before, tried their best to scupper this year’s elections by unleashing bloody violence, and declared they had no belief in democracy, the most charitable explanation for Mr. Sharif’s vaguely outlined half-plan is that it is naive. His cabinet’s defence committee, which includes the Service chiefs, subsequently decided that any talks would be conditional on the militants laying down arms. There is no word on what the plan is if these groups, as is most likely, refuse to disarm.
For one with a progressive vision of friendship with India, which too he reiterated in his speech, it is unfortunate that Mr. Sharif has been unable to bring similar clear-sightedness to his views on terrorism. Terror constitutes the single biggest threat today to peace between the two countries and the region. It is the groups raised by the Pakistani state for proxy battles in Afghanistan and India that are now striking terror within Pakistan. With his mandate and constituency, and his apparent determination to reset the civilian-military balance, the Pakistan Muslim League (N) leader is uniquely placed to convince his people that militant groups are certainly not part of God’s army. Certain sections in Pakistan may still harbour the illusion that some groups retain a strategic utility, but the country really has no alternative but to turn the lights off on them — all of them — decisively. Nor is there any time to lose in this task: the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan is about a year away. By acting now, Pakistan can ensure that the consequences for itself and India will be better than current predictions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-persisting-confusion/article5062018.ece
26,8,2013,United they fell,"A united opposition is not necessarily a stronger opposition. In recent by-elections to the Lok Sabha from Karnataka, the two major Opposition parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Janata Dal (Secular), have lost more than they gained by putting up a show of unity against the ruling Congress. Fresh from its triumph in the Assembly election earlier this year, the Congress led by Chief Minister S. Siddaramaiah seemed to have no trouble at all in defeating JD(S) candidates in the two constituencies, Mandya and Bangalore Rural, both considered to be JD(S) strongholds. Without keeping an eye on the long term, the BJP, quite inexplicably, chose to support the JD(S) against the Congress in an apparent effort to unite opposition votes. True, the Congress benefited greatly from a divided opposition in the recent Assembly election, especially the split in the BJP with the exit of former Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa. But opportunistic alliances of the kind struck by the BJP and the JD(S) inspire no confidence in voters. The two parties have been partners in government before, only to break away just as opportunistically as they had come together. As the principal Opposition party in the State, the BJP did itself no favours by staying away from the contest in support of the JD(S). On the other hand, the JD(S), which relies to some extent on a secular image for its votes, was shown up as ever so eager to do not-so-secret deals with the BJP. For JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy, the loss is especially demoralising. Bangalore Rural was won by him in 2009, and he had vacated the seat for his wife Anita following his election to the Assembly in May. The huge margin of defeat, 1,37,007, can do little for the spirits of the party’s cadre.
Mr. Kumaraswamy’s loss is Mr. Siddaramaiah’s gain. In the few months he has been in power, the Chief Minister has done almost no wrong. Although he is a recent entrant in the faction-ridden Congress, Mr. Siddaramaiah managed to take along with him other leaders of the party. And the social welfare schemes initiated by his government came to the aid of the Congress. The winning candidates, actor Ramya from Mandya and D.K. Suresh from Bangalore Rural, were new to electoral battle, but they managed to get the full support of the party’s organisational machinery. Clearly, the Congress government is still in the honeymoon period. But in politics, a month is a long time, and the challenge for Mr. Siddaramaiah is to maintain his party’s winning streak till Lok Sabha 2014, more than six months away. With a little help from the BJP and the JD(S), he could deliver what his party high command expects of him.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/united-they-fell/article5058892.ece
28,8,2013,Faithful to a cause,"Public outrage over the brutal slaying of renowned rationalist Narendra Dabholkar finally forced the Maharashtra government’s hand in clearing an ordinance against superstition and black magic. Based on a bill that Dabholkar championed for almost 20 years, it could be the first such legislation in India. The ordinance is a path-breaking one in a country which lionises godmen and is steeped in obscurantism. It seeks to curtail superstitious practices which are “misused to exploit people” or cause them “financial or physical harm.” Dabholkar did not target religion and concerned himself only with the misuse of faith to victimise innocents. The law he drafted — which faced years of opposition from political and religious groups — follows this impulse. The ordinance, which will have to be ratified by the State Assembly, seeks to ban a range of superstitious practices including “black magic,” displaying so-called miracles to earn money, or insisting that mantras, not medicines, will cure critical injuries like snakebites. Also, assaulting and humiliating people under the guise of exorcising ghosts, and the sexual exploitation of women after claiming supernatural powers will also be banned. Complaints are to be probed by trained policemen and can even be lodged by third parties not involved in an exploitative ritual.
While inculcating a scientific temper is one of the Constitution’s Fundamental Duties vide. Article 51 A (h), seeking to regulate personal faith and beliefs is always tricky. The Bill underwent as many as 29 drafts and was introduced several times without success. Many saw it as an impediment to the freedom of religion and feared it would even ban poojas where the priest was paid for his services. Or painful, self-inflicted religious practices. Pontiffs felt vulnerable to complaints by motivated individuals. There were concerns that religious pilgrimages would be monitored, even stopped. But Dabholkar had argued these fears were unfounded. The ordinance targets forced and exploitative practices, not those that are voluntary or that do not take a physical or financial toll on people. Chanting mantras on a personal level to ward off evil spirits will not constitute an offence. But forcing an expensive, exorcism ritual could attract a complaint.
Weeding out motivated complaints and distinguishing a forced ritual from a voluntary one will be a serious challenge. Yet, ensuring that a law which opposes a society’s entrenched beliefs is actually enforced is perhaps the greater challenge. The law will gain greater meaning when there is a parallel process of social reform and education against superstition, the very tradition that Dabholkar himself epitomised.

28,8,2013,Down but not out,"The failure of the second of the four gyroscope-like reaction wheels of the Kepler space telescope in May this year brings down the curtain on its primary mission of identifying planets outside our solar system, namely exoplanets. A spare wheel failed in July last year. Three wheels are necessary for maintaining precision steering for the telescope to identify exoplanets that are orbiting Sun-like stars at distances where the surface temperature of earth-sized planets might be suitable for liquid water to exist. Till recently, the 0.95 metre-aperture telescope was fixedly gazing at some 150,000 stars in the constellation Cygnus to look for any dip in a star’s brightness when a planet crossed it. At least, three such transits are required to confirm the signal as an orbiting planet. Based on this approach, the telescope has successfully been able to confirm 135 exoplanets and identify over 3,500 candidates during the four-year period from May 2009 to May 2013. More importantly, the space telescope, which completed its prime mission in November last year, has returned voluminous data. As about two years’ worth of data remains to be analysed, the treasure trove may, in all probability, spring some more surprises and answer the very question that inspired the Kepler mission — “are earths in the habitable zone of stars like our Sun common or rare?” Aside from using the transit method to hunt for exoplanets, Kepler has used the asteroseismology technique to decipher, among others, the size and mass of about 500 stars. This technique looks for subtle periodic variations in a star’s brightness.
Though the telescope can no longer hunt for exoplanets using the transit technique, as an August 22 study in Nature reveals, the data collected by the telescope would help in estimating a star’s size and mass by studying the “minute variations in total solar brightness” using a different technique — the flicker method. Calculating the size of a star would help in confirming if the candidate exoplanets are indeed earth-like. The technique, first tested on 500 stars whose size and mass are known, has already been used to determine the size of 1,000 stars; Kepler has collected the flicker data of about 50,000 stars. Even in its crippled state, Kepler can still be used for collecting information about extrasolar planets by using yet another technique — microlensing. This method looks for magnification of a star’s light when two stars align themselves with respect to the telescope. Any star with orbiting planets could even double the brightness of the other star’s light. Even as Kepler’s fate is being decided, there can be no denying that it has revolutionised our understanding of stars and earth-twins.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/down-but-not-out/article5065457.ece
29,8,2013,Let the music play,"There is nothing right about the opposition by Kashmiri separatist politicians and sections of its civil society to a western classical music concert that is to be held in Srinagar next month. The concert, by the Bavarian State Orchestra under the baton of Zubin Mehta, has been organised by the German Embassy in New Delhi. Those who want the concert cancelled argue that the high-profile event is in fact a proxy project aimed at showing Kashmir to the world as “normal and peaceful” even though that description is neither true nor accurate. Aside from missing the point that a specially organised music concert in Kashmir actually highlights — in a counter-intuitive way — the continuing uncertainty in the Valley, the view that the “sanctity” of a conflict zone must be respected until the conflict itself is resolved is deeply disturbing. The same argument was forwarded by those who successfully managed to kill the holding of Harud, a literary festival in Kashmir two years ago, much to the disappointment of many in the State.
If the relationship between politics and conflict tends to be linear, the interplay of culture and conflict is far more complex. Instead of asking that the event be cancelled, those opposed to the Zubin Mehta concert could register their protest through a separate cultural event of their own. This could take the form of a parallel concert, or an exhibition of photographs or art, to highlight their view that the situation in the Valley is far from normal. And if the government stopped people from attending such a counter-event, the entire world would be witness to its intolerance. Kashmiri intellectuals denouncing Mr. Mehta for his association with the Israel Philharmonic perhaps don’t realise that Mr. Mehta’s long and illustrious career has been punctuated by protest in only two places — Kashmir, and Israel. In 1981, loud protests erupted inside a Tel Aviv concert hall when he conducted a piece from Richard Wagner’s Tristan und Isolde. The 19th century German composer is hated in Israel for his anti-Semitism and for the liking that the Nazis had for his music, but in his introduction to the piece, Mr. Mehta spoke of how Israel as a democracy must learn to accept all music. Kashmir has, over the years, fallen well short of democratic standards, something which, for different reasons, can be said of Israel, too. But through all of their prolonged torment, the people of Kashmir have retained their reputation for cultural refinement. How ironic, then, that culture should now fall victim to politics in the Valley. And how sad it would be if a people who have had little joy in the past two decades, were denied the pleasure of beautiful music, brought to them with the best intentions.
An earlier version of this editorial had incorrectly referred to the orchestra Zubin Mehta will conduct in Srinagar as the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/let-the-music-play/article5072337.ece
29,8,2013,Don’t blame the Food Bill,"The currencies of India, Indonesia, Brazil, South Africa and Turkey have fallen quite dramatically against the dollar in the past few months. Whatever their domestic weaknesses, the reasons for this unprecedented decline — ranging between 13 to 21 per cent — are primarily global. In the past 48 hours, as tension mounts in West Asia, an already unprecedented situation has become even more difficult. On Wednesday, the rupee, as also other emerging market currencies, fell yet again as it became apparent that the Obama administration is preparing to bomb Syria. Ignoring the global context, many analysts in India are attributing Tuesday’s big fall in the rupee and the Sensex to the fiscal excesses that the new food security law may create. In reality, the food law did not have much to do with the sharp fall in the rupee’s value. Given that it is party time for bear operators in the financial markets, big players are now looking for any reason to ride on pessimism. The food security law has been actively debated for a year and its cost was worked into the Union Budget for 2013-14. Indeed, no such reaction was seen in the stock market when the Finance Minister announced the outlay in the budget. At most, the extra expenditure on account of the Food Security Bill will be no more than 0.3 per cent a year. Besides, the government explicitly said that it would stick to its fiscal deficit target of 4.5 per cent in 2013-14.
The truth is that big institutional investors have an inherent bias against welfare expenditure. Psychologically, market players seem to assume that any welfare scheme is bad for capital. This is a flawed assumption because the history of the market economy in the West clearly shows that a strong welfare framework has played an integral part in the expansion of capitalism. There is also a lot of hypocrisy in the way market players view government support to various sections of society. They reject loan waivers to farmers but welcome the massive loan restructuring and postponement of repayment obligations done for big business. Among neo-liberal policymakers, there is also a tendency to paint a worse picture than actually exists on the ground in order to push the very same reforms that end up creating external debt traps. The massive support in Parliament for the Food Security Bill sharply contrasted with the lack of support it had from market players and businesses. This chasm between the political class and market players needs to be bridged. As Jean Drèze and Amartya Sen have convincingly argued, nowhere has capitalist growth preceded improvement in human development indices. The market needs to internalise this reality.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dont-blame-the-food-bill/article5068742.ece
29,8,2013,The IOA needs tough talking,"By its unabashed posturing against the suggested course of return to the Olympic fold, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has staked India’s future in the sporting movement. In amending its constitution to bar only those convicted for two years or more, instead of those charge sheeted by a court, as suggested by both the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Union Government, the IOA has kept the door ajar for a possible return to power by officials being prosecuted in the 2010 Commonwealth Games (CWG) scam. For decades, sports administrators in India have been in the news for all the wrong reasons. The cloak of “autonomy” granted to them by the IOC gives officials the freedom to perpetuate their reign. The set of government guidelines for National Sports Federations, formulated in 1975, which stipulated an eight-year tenure at a stretch for any office-bearer, was an attempt to break the hegemony of vested interests. The guidelines, violated at will from the mid-1980s, were revised by the then Sports Minister M.S. Gill in 2010 to provide them with more teeth. Subsequent legal battles, formulation of the National Sports Code and redrafting of the National Sports Development Bill after it failed to clear a Cabinet meeting, all contributed to a churning out process at the end of which the IOA still looks the “winner.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-ioa-needs-tough-talking/article5068741.ece
30,8,2013,International order be damned,"The West’s attempt to ride roughshod over the United Nations Security Council with a hastily drafted proposal to authorise the use of force in Syria sets the stage for its second military intervention in West Asia and North Africa in as many years. The resolution, drafted by the United Kingdom and backed by the United States and France, seeks two things from the Council: one, a condemnation of President Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons on his people and two, its blessings to deploy “all necessary measures” to protect Syrians. If the first asks the U.N. for a leap of faith on a premature claim, the second requires it to turn a blind eye to history. While acknowledging there exists no “smoking gun” to establish Mr. Assad’s culpability, the West has tried its best to impede the working of the U.N.’s team in Syria investigating claims if chemical weapons were used at all. The charade now unfolding before the UNSC reflects the West’s desperation to have its way with a military intervention that has few takers. If the Arab League, including key members and U.S. allies like Egypt, has expressed its reluctance to support the imminent assault, public opinion in the U.S., Britain and France too is overwhelmingly opposed to a new war.
After the disastrous 2011 NATO bombing of Libya, which began with the objective of protecting civilians but ended up being a full-blown attack on the Muammar Qadhafi regime, the Security Council is rightly wary of the Anglo-American plans for a “limited” intervention in Syria. Expecting the world to believe a military attack will destroy Mr. Assad’s chemical weapons arsenal without inflicting unacceptable civilian casualties is silly. If anything, a targeted attack is not so much a guarantee of minimal damage, but an attempt to fulfil President Barack Obama’s vain promise to punish the Assad regime if it used chemical weapons. After proffering sketchy evidence in support of this grave allegation, the President is now being forced to walk his talk by the liberal interventionists who populate his administration and by a trigger-happy British Prime Minister. One senior U.S. official let slip that the planned assault will be “just muscular enough not to get mocked,” revealing how this issue is now entirely about American “credibility,” as opposed to the humanitarian tragedy in Syria. The Council’s likely rejection of the draft resolution will be portrayed as Russian and Chinese intransigence. The fact remains, however, that influential powers like India, Brazil and South Africa too are against military intervention pending a complete investigation of WMD claims. The West’s failure to act through the U.N. not only betrays the Syrian people but also reflects its contempt for the international order.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/international-order-be-damned/article5072336.ece
31,8,2013,Eminent domain lite,"So patently unjust was the colonial era Land Acquisition Act that it is hard not to consider the >Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill passed by the Lok Sabha on Thursday a major improvement. The purpose of the original 1894 law was to merely expedite the acquisition of land. Whether it actually does so or not, the new law at least sets out to ensure adequate compensation and rehabilitation. Monetary compensation for acquired land has been pegged at twice the market value in urban areas and four times the market value in rural areas. But it is not clear how the value of rural land located close to designated urban areas will be realistically determined. The new law does well to provide farmers with 20 per cent of their acquired land developed for urbanisation purposes, but is otherwise silent on how the benefits of higher future land values could be shared with all those whose land is acquired. One innovation is the provision allowing the leasing of land for development purposes. This opens the possibility of “acquired” land reverting to the original owner at a later date. Another important clause provides for the rehabilitation of non-landowning individuals who lose their livelihood once the land of others is acquired.
The biggest source of concern, however, remains land acquisition for private or PPP projects. The new law mandates that all the land within an area can be acquired for private projects once at least 80 per cent of the landowners agree to sell. States are free to extend this to 100 per cent consent. Instead of insisting that companies take responsibility for acquiring the land they need for their projects — at whatever price the market demands — just as they do other factors of production, the government will continue to wield its power of eminent domain on their behalf. Of course, this help comes at a cost: the Bill makes the government a mandatory broker. If two private parties want to reach a settlement under the same legal framework of compensation, rehabilitation and resettlement, it will no longer be possible to do so. In fact, some MPs pressed home the point that the Bill could open up avenues for undue rent seeking by officials. The government argues that its role as an arbiter is necessary as the sheer inequality in terms of bargaining power between large corporations and small farmers and other marginalised groups increases the likelihood of unfair agreements. However, historical evidence suggests government agencies end up supporting private companies rather than farmers and marginalised groups in such situations. If the new law doesn’t deliver on its promises, Parliament must be prepared to take another look.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/eminent-domain-lite/article5076288.ece
31,8,2013,The King’s speech,"For many Indians, our first tryst with Martin Luther King Jr. came about not from a textbook or classroom discussion highlighting his figurehead role in the American civil rights movement. It usually happened on account of an elocution competition in school, ahead of which enthusiastic parents would be seen tutoring their kids with lines from King’s “ >I have a dream.” For all the learning by rote this process entailed, many parts of the storied speech — which turned 50 this week — including its titular lines, were actually ad-libbed by the great orator. Delivered from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. on August 28, 1963, King’s stirring speech on persistent racial inequality in America singularly changed its social and political landscape. It brought the preacher widespread international recognition as a rights activist and was also instrumental in King being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. What made his speech iconic was the pragmatism it evoked through fiery rhetoric: at a time when violence against blacks had reached a new high, >Martin Luther King asked them to revolt against injustice not by “drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred” but on “the high plane of dignity and discipline.” King’s dream epitomised his larger efforts to ground civil disobedience in the rule of law, which the Lyndon B. Johnson administration channelled to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
That King was influenced by the Indian freedom movement, particularly Mohandas Gandhi’s non-violent resistance against colonial rule, is no revelation. He also stood in solidarity with his Indian contemporaries in their struggle for social justice. In a 1959 essay for Ebony — the pre-eminent magazine for blacks in America — penned soon after his brief visit to India, King identified, with remarkable insight, the three major problems facing Indian society: the lack of urban housing, food security and rural employment. What’s more, he endorsed a leadership role for India in the international community: King’s letter condoling the death of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru praised the latter as a “mediator and honest broker” whose “policy of non-alignment” allowed emerging powers to “play a constructive role in world affairs.” Martin Luther King Jr. dedicated his life to empowering the racially subjugated through legitimate and irreversible means. If he dreamt of equality among Americans, King had a lesser known dream for India too: that it show the world “a democracy could provide good living for everyone […] without surrendering to a dictatorship of either the ‘right’ or ‘left’.” Would it be too much for our political class to aspire to this vision?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-kings-speech/article5076286.ece
2,9,2013,Much-needed clarity,"The Supreme Court’s categorical ruling that any compromise between victim and perpetrator in a rape case cannot be grounds for awarding a lesser prison term is a timely restatement of a salutary principle in sentencing policy. It is a reminder of the basic principle that punishment must be proportional to the gravity of the offence, and that there is no room for extraneous factors, much less something as invidious as a compromise, invariably arrived at under pressure. Some courts, including the High Courts, have made use of a proviso in the Indian Penal Code concerning rape to hand out jail terms less than the prescribed minimum sentence of seven or 10 years, citing factors such as a compromise between the rape survivor and the convict or accused, the efflux of time, claims that the woman is happily married or, more odiously, that the offender had promised to marry the target of his predatory crime. Thankfully, the amendment to criminal law brought in earlier this year has omitted this proviso to Section 376(2). The Court has done well to rule out compromises, noting that it will only be an additional burden on victims. In the last decade, the Apex Court has repeatedly deprecated the tendency to take judicial note of purported compromises and reduce sentences given by the trial court for rape.
In the latest judgment in Shimbhu and Another vs. State of Haryana, Chief Justice P. Sathasivam refers to a 2011 case in which the Supreme Court itself had accepted such a compromise, but wisely rules that such verdicts, which seem to run afoul of sound sentencing principles, ought to be seen only in the light of the peculiar facts of those cases and not cited as precedents. He also strikes a note of caution to subordinate courts against any casual or cavalier use of judicial discretion to reduce the quantum of punishment. After all, as courts have often pointed out, rape is a crime against society and not merely against an individual. The restatement of basic principles, often a necessity in a diverse country, is particularly welcome in the context of the disturbing frequency with which the offence of rape hits the headlines today. What another Bench of the Apex Court noted last month is further cause for concern: 90 per cent of rape cases in the country end in acquittal. It has expanded the scope of a plea for justice on behalf of a gang rape survivor and sought responses from all State governments on the question of rehabilitating such victims. While social conditions vary from State to State, depending on how entrenched feudal and patriarchal tendencies are in a particular milieu, the vulnerability of women seems to be uniformly high.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/muchneeded-clarity/article5082949.ece
2,9,2013,It all ads up,"Forget the race for eyeballs, TRPs and “breaking news.” The fiercest battle the broadcasting industry is fighting today is against the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), whose decision last March to enforce a rule limiting advertisement time on television to 12 minutes-per-hour has news channels up in arms. Though worried about the financial implications, the Indian Broadcasting Foundation, the umbrella industry body, had initially accepted the directive. Indeed, broadcasters had signed up to the rule as part of their original licensing arrangements. Though the regulator allowed a transition period whereby networks could gradually come into compliance, news channels lobbied the government and Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari urged an unmoved TRAI to stand down till digitisation was complete. Citing shrinking revenues due to the ad-cap rule, the channels then moved the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), which on Friday restrained TRAI from taking any coercive action for non-compliance.
While TRAI seems to have gone overboard in seeking criminal prosecution of channels, it would be unfair to blame it for going by the rule-book. The regulator is acting on behalf of consumers, who form the silent majority, rather than the vocal media businesses, which constitute a minority. At stake is not freedom of expression, but the bottom line, which is in trouble because of structural factors. Many news channels have a top-heavy model with distorted salary patterns. News networks have expanded way beyond their means. Their credibility is at an all-time low. A skewed television rating system allowed them to project greater reach than they had; expanding measurement to smaller towns is already reflecting different — and more realistic — viewership patterns. The gloomy economic environment is not helping. Many channels made a conscious decision to move towards integrated newsrooms to take advantage of technology. To only blame the TRAI decision for recent job-cuts — as is being done to exert pressure on it to pull back — is disingenuous. In the case of one big network, the downsizing appears to be a result of assertion of control by its new corporate owners. In fact, this issue — of corporate ownership and cross-media holdings — is next on TRAI’s agenda. As the regulator tries to clean up India’s broadcasting space, it should act only after due consultation with all stakeholders. It must also keep off issues of content. On its part, the government may be keen to curry favour with corporate media houses in the election season. But it would do well to stay out of the ad-time issue and allow the industry’s regulatory institutions to do their work.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/it-all-ads-up/article5082950.ece
3,9,2013,Towards a lower trajectory,"In a rare confidence-building exercise, the Prime Minister on Friday assured Parliament that his government would strictly adhere to pre-stated fiscal consolidation norms and was committed to putting the economy back on “the path of stable, sustainable growth.” The financial markets, which have been under intense pressure, responded positively. Significantly, even the dismal GDP growth figures for the first quarter (April-June) of 2013-14 which were released by the Central Statistics Office on Friday evening have not dented the confidence of the financial markets so far. The only plausible explanation is that the markets have anticipated the slowdown accurately. Most forecasts by analysts put growth in a range of between 4.2 and 4.7 per cent. The true significance of the 4.4 per cent GDP growth rate lies elsewhere. It is the lowest quarterly growth rate in four years, and even more relevantly, reinforces the widely prevalent view of the economy inexorably moving towards a lower growth trajectory. During the last quarter of 2012-13, the growth rate was 4.8 per cent and for the whole year five per cent. The slowdown is all pervasive and is likely to extend to the next quarter as well. The full impact of the rupee depreciation and the collateral damage caused by the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary tightening will be felt during this period.
There is hardly anything suggesting a significantly better tomorrow. Agriculture posted a 2.7 per cent increase and can possibly do better as a bountiful monsoon leaves its impact. But agriculture has a small share in the GDP. By contrast, industry has been in the doldrums, declining by 1.2 per cent over last year. The contraction in manufacturing (-1.2 per cent) and mining and quarrying (-2.8 per cent) have been captured by the monthly industrial output figures. Gross fixed capital formation has gone down by 1.2 per cent while private consumption expenditure increased by a measly 1.6 per cent, thus squeezing the economy from both sides. Services, the traditional growth driver, increased by a modest 6.6 per cent. Among its components, “community, social and personal services,” a proxy for government spending, posted an impressive 9.4 per cent growth. However, government finances are under strain — the fiscal deficit data released on the same day are not at all encouraging — and it is obvious that this sub-segment will not be able to deliver again to the same extent. The most telling commentary on the slowdown is that the Prime Minister’s expectation of a modest 5.5 per cent growth during the current year may not materialise, a far cry from the average eight per cent projected during the 12th Plan (2012-17).",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/towards-a-lower-trajectory/article5086556.ece
3,9,2013,Streamlining building approvals,"A maze of procedures, inconsistent processes and lack of transparency have made the system of building approvals inefficient and corrupt. Many construction projects suffer inordinate delay and cost overruns because of this. It affects individual home builders and large promoters alike. Simplifying approvals without compromising the safety of a structure is a long overdue reform. The expert committee constituted by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (MHUPA) has recently proposed solutions to streamline procedures and fast track construction approvals. Would these recommendations, coming as they do after previous unsuccessful attempts, bring about the much-needed change? A World Bank study in 2012 identified that a building permit in Indian cities on an average involves 34 procedures and takes about 196 days. In contrast, Singapore, which is a world leader in best construction practices, stipulates 11 procedures and takes only 26 days to sanction. Since 2006, various government committees have looked into this issue and recommended improvements, but to no avail.
The expert committee constituted by the MHUPA last year has now come up with three broad categories of reforms. The first set of recommendations concern procedures: government agencies have to lay down clear processes with firm time commitment; develop comprehensive building rules that would remove cumbersome requirements such as obtaining multiple clearances; and reduce the burden on local bodies by permitting qualified personnel to self-certify building plans. The second set of reforms aims at setting up a single window system using information technology for screening building permission applications. The last category is about improving capacities in local bodies. A few cities in India have implemented IT-based automated building approval procedures, but these still do not function as true single window systems as related departments cannot share the information. They also seem rudimentary when compared with intelligent systems used in places such as Singapore, where builders can get clearances from more than 10 departments by filing a single application. An efficient one-stop solution is possible only when e-governance is fully integrated across different government agencies. The emphasis must be on removing various discretionary powers vested with the government. Such provisions not only operate outside the streamlined and automated processes but are also often misused. Self-certification and other recommendations would be meaningful and effective only when there is strong enforcement and zero tolerance of violations. Speedy approval is necessary, but so is organised development.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/streamlining-building-approvals/article5086557.ece
4,9,2013,Fuel for thought,"It really is a no-brainer. India is grappling with a current account deficit (CAD) of $80 billion that is exerting tremendous pressure on the rupee. Controlling imports and reducing the trade balance are obviously one of the key strategies for reining in the CAD. Crude oil is the largest component of India’s import bill, accounting for a third of the total. Any attempt to control the CAD should obviously start with reducing the crude oil import bill. Iran, which is stifled by U.S. financial sanctions, is willing to sell oil to India in exchange for payment in rupees. What should the government do? Grab the offer, obviously. Yet, buckling to unfair pressure from the U.S., the government has been cutting down on imports from Iran over the past three years. As India fell in line with U.S. sanctions, it reduced its oil imports from Iran from 21.2 million tonnes in 2009-10 to 13.2 million tonnes in 2012-13. In the first five months of this fiscal, the country imported just two million tonnes of crude oil from Iran. However, the time has now come for India to unhitch itself from the American bandwagon and step up crude imports from Iran in its own interests.
According to a proposal the Petroleum Ministry has sent to the Prime Minister, the country’s dollar payments for its oil imports can be brought down by $8.5 billion (almost 10 per cent of the CAD) if it imports as much oil from Iran as it did in 2012-13, which is another 11 million tonnes. This newspaper argued even at the time of imposition of sanctions on Iran that succumbing to U.S. pressure would not be in India’s interests. With Iran offering the comfort of rupee payments through a bank account with an Indian bank in Kolkata, India should now push the advantage and maximise its oil purchases from that country. Such a move will ease the pressure not just on the current account but also in the forex market as the oil companies will be buying that many dollars less. Oil companies are big buyers of dollars and have the potential to influence the forex market. Meanwhile, the government’s announcement that fuel conservation measures will be announced soon has raised expectations and anxieties equally. Ideas such as the one to close petrol bunks at night are not just bad but foolish, and Petroleum Minister Veerappa Moily’s suggestion to that effect caused considerable confusion before he clarified the position on Monday. The best way to conserve fuel is to raise prices to market levels, which will hopefully push users to economise on consumption. The downside though is that it will have an adverse impact on inflation. Clearly, the choices are not easy but the government should keep in mind the interests of the common man while framing its strategy for fuel conservation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fuel-for-thought/article5090228.ece
4,9,2013,Enabling judgment,"The case of the 1977-batch Indian Administrative Service officer, whose compulsory retirement on grounds of disability the Supreme Court has overturned, sets a strong precedent on the codification of protections against contingencies that arise during service. A two-judge bench upheld Anil Kumar Mahajan’s appeal against an earlier decision that sought to curtail his tenure by five years. Interpreting the 1995 law on disabilities, the bench ruled that those who acquire an impairment while in service had to be accommodated in a position appropriate to their current condition. Where such adjustment was not available, the government was obliged to retain them in a supernumerary status, pending the identification of one, until the age of superannuation. The message emanating from the judgment is unambiguous, even if only a fraction of the disabled, estimated at nearly 10 per cent of India’s population, is in formal employment. It is relevant no less to the large numbers rendered severely impaired for life on account of the notoriously high rates of road accidents, not to mention industrial mishaps. The verdict also drives home the necessity, both within the administration and beyond, to recognise disability as a dimension of social diversity. To the extent that this is a relatively new reality, reflected in the workplace and several walks of life, public and private institutions would have to become responsive. It is hard to conceive of a more effective advocacy on disability than policies of accommodation that can potentially counter prevailing prejudice and stereotypes.
As regards recruitments under the Union Public Service Commission, a number of persons with different disabilities have begun to join the ranks in recent times. In fact, the question of identification of suitable placements across different services has come into the spotlight, illustrating the need to fashion a comprehensive approach on the absorption of new appointees. The landmark verdict, if anything, underscores yet again the urgent need for Parliament to enact fresh legislation in this area. This is imperative following India’s ratification, way back in 2007, of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It is the way forward on extending legal protection for categories of impairments that are not covered under the current law and give fresh impetus to realise the goals of inclusive education. The newly constituted department of disability affairs in the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment should strive towards bringing the law-making process to fruition at the earliest. For, every single day lost to procedural delays affects the life prospects of millions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/enabling-judgment/article5090227.ece
5,9,2013,Fallen God,"The 10-page resignation letter of suspended Gujarat cadre IPS officer D.G. Vanzara — one among over 30 policemen currently in jail in connection with a chain of post-2002 encounter murders — is so much a case of damning with ‘high’ praise that on a first reading it could be misunderstood as a defence of Narendra Modi and his government. The letter is, indeed, worded in a manner to suggest that the chief recipient of Mr. Vanzara’s ire is Modi-confidant and BJP general secretary Amit Shah who, with his “evil influence,” usurped the Chief Minister’s “eyes and ears.” Mr. Modi himself is described by Mr. Vanzara, who was Deputy Inspector-General of Police until his 2007 arrest, as “a God” whom he adored. The one-time celebrated top cop also fully justifies the liquidation of terror suspects as a necessary outcome of the Gujarat government’s “pro-active policy of zero tolerance for terrorism.” However, the deceptive eulogy is merely a cover for a full-blown attack on Mr. Modi, whom Mr. Vanzara accuses of “marching towards Delhi” without a thought to the jailed police officers who merely followed the Chief Minister’s orders; if anything, Mr, Modi owed a “debt” to the officers whose actions “endowed him with the halo of a brave Chief Minister among a galaxy of other CMs.”
The mocking and sarcasm do not stop here. Arguing that those at the helm of decision-making too needed to be put in jail for pursuing a “conscious” policy of “alleged fake-encounters,” Mr. Vanzara suggests that the Gujarat government shift its offices to the prisons where the arrested policemen languished. So what is the real message in the letter? To start off, it exposes the deep schism between the Modi administration and its own police force. The sense of betrayal so acutely evident in Mr. Vanzara’s long lament comes from the differential treatment given to the police officers and Mr. Shah, who is himself an accused in two cases of encounter killings. The Gujarat government secured the release on bail of Mr. Shah while the officers were left to their own devices. More seriously for the State government, Mr. Vanzara confirms that suspected terrorists were killed under orders from the highest quarters. The accused officer, of course, puts a veneer of patriotism on the murders, insisting that but for the systematic purging of the suspects, Gujarat would have become another Kashmir. But no civilised country can permit the extra-judicial killing of its citizens, which is why Mr. Vanzara is cooling his heels in jail. The desperate police officer’s lament that he was merely following orders will not get him off the hook. But it does leave Mr. Modi and his government with much to answer for.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fallen-god/article5093950.ece
5,9,2013,A profoundly just order,"By recalling its directions and declarations issued a year ago on the appointment of Information Commissioners under the Right to Information Act, the Supreme Court has ensured that there will be no frustrating complications in the working of this path-breaking law. The court’s determination in a review petition that Information Commissions do not exercise judicial powers and in fact discharge administrative functions confirms what the RTI community has emphasised all along — that the elegant law is designed to minimise discretionary interpretation and exempts only a select list of subjects from disclosure. Moreover, the Commissions are not tribunals or bodies to which judicial powers have been transferred. The RTI Act does not, therefore, have to mandate appointment of judicially independent officers such as sitting or former judges, in the interests of separation of powers. This wise judgment has used the opportunity provided by the review petition to correct an error of law. The simplicity of the Act is preserved, and Information Commissions must now dedicate themselves to the task of breaking down barriers erected by vested interests to frustrate RTI applicants.
It is unavoidable that a far-going law such as the RTI Act is frequently subjected to challenge by powerful lobbies. Hearteningly, it has survived largely intact thus far, and draws a groundswell of support every time there is an attempt to dilute it. The proposal to amend it with the sole intention of annulling an order of the Central Information Commission bringing political parties under its ambit has led to significant citizen mobilisation against the move. This is not to say that nothing can be done to improve the Act’s working. As the court has pointed out, there are occasions when the Information Commissions are called upon to decide the limits of transparency and protect the privacy of individuals. This has led to orders that may appear to go beyond the provisions of the law. The only test to be met in such circumstances is that of public interest, and Commissioners with a distinguished record in the social sector would find no difficulty in arriving at a decision. Regrettably, the Centre and the States have not been neutral about choosing people for the job. As the court has pointed out, people from various disciplines such as law, science, social service, journalism, and administration with undisputed eminence must be selected. Naturally, this means widening the gene pool beyond former bureaucrats and establishment loyalists. That the process must be open to scrutiny has been reiterated by the Supreme Court and it will doubtless be closely monitored by a rights-conscious citizenry.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-profoundly-just-order/article5093951.ece
6,9,2013,Governor’s first day,"It isn’t surprising that the markets have reacted favourably to Raghuram Rajan’s first day in office as governor of the Reserve Bank of India. Somewhat uncharitably, the RBI under outgoing governor D. Subbarao was seen as market unfriendly — totally focussed on inflation without heeding growth considerations, besides not being able to contain the rupee’s fall. Thursday’s rise in the value of the Sensex and the rupee suggests market intermediaries expect a change in approach. However, for all the positive vibes the new governor appears to have created, Dr. Rajan is bound to be wary of the reception he has received. True, he does bring impressive credentials to what is arguably one of the toughest jobs in the economic management of the country today. But, as he himself has warned on many occasions, there is no magic wand that can wave away the country’s economic woes. The slowdown in GDP growth, the erosion of business and consumer confidence and above all, the falling rupee, have deeper structural causes that cannot be addressed overnight. Under the circumstances, as any Chicago-trained economist knows only too well, irrational expectations can be counter-productive.
Many analysts have commented favourably on the speed with which Dr. Rajan has got down to work. The agenda he revealed at his first press conference is impressive but the fact is that some of those are incremental steps which would have been taken anyway, probably at a slower pace. For instance, the issuance of new bank licences was already on the cards. Some of the major steps aimed at reorienting the banking structure are already engaging the RBI. These include setting up niche banks for, say, infrastructure, retail and investment banking. CPI-linked inflation bonds as an alternative to gold savings are not a novel idea, but it is good that they figure in the new governor’s short-term agenda. Proposals to deepen financial markets through innovative instruments such as cash-settled 10-year interest rate futures and the dematting of trade receivables are welcome. Small steps such as these can make a big difference. The focus on improving the efficiency of the recovery system and the clear warning to promoters that they cannot use the banking system to recapitalise their failed ventures send a clear signal to deviant corporate borrowers. On the bigger issue of monetary policy objectives, Dr. Rajan has highlighted the importance of inflation targeting: monetary stability and preserving the value of the rupee will be key goals. The emphasis might vary but the overall objectives are the same. The new governor needs to harness his great skills at communication to carry the markets and, equally important, the government.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/governors-first-day/article5097612.ece
6,9,2013,Justice and the juvenile,"Calls to dilute the Juvenile Justice Act in light of what is perceived as lenient punishment to the juvenile offender in the Delhi gang rape case are understandable but misplaced. The crime shook the country’s conscience, brought forth an unprecedented outpouring of anger and triggered collective introspection on the safety of women and girls. But even though there is a view that the young perpetrator has been able to get away lightly, this is not reason enough to question or do away with the principles underlying juvenile justice. Separate legislation has existed in many countries around the world since the early 20th century for the care and protection of children, including child offenders. The present system in India was introduced by a 1986 Act and improved upon in 2000. The JJ Act, 2000, a progressive legislation, replaced the regular judicial process with a reformatory regime, favouring supervised probation or stay in an observation home over imprisonment. The law tries to reform a young offender’s conduct rather than confine him for decades in a prison with adult criminals, which only works to fan recidivist tendencies.
While refusing to allow the Delhi gang rape juvenile offender to be tried as an adult, the Supreme Court pointed out in its order that underage crime still forms only a tiny percentage of the large body of crime in the country. However, merely going through a differential process for juvenile offenders is not enough. It is obvious that the social contract underlying a lenient regime requires equal attention to be paid to the design and implementation of a proper rehabilitation process. Society will only countenance shielding young offenders guilty of great brutality from the rigours of adult justice if it is confident that they will indeed benefit from the rehabilitative approach to juvenile justice. In India, we need to guard against the complacent belief that a stint in a remand home is enough for their rehabilitation. The atmosphere in many such facilities is not conducive for reformation, and in fact may toughen or entrench criminal propensities. The system should not end up creating a new underclass that combines a sense of triumph over avoiding a prison term after committing heinous crimes, with the psychological effects of staying under bleak, hope-denying conditions. Making juvenile correctional facilities more humane is one part of the answer. But to address the need for proportionality — not so much in punishment as in the necessity of socio-psychological repair — when a young offender commits truly heinous crimes, a longer period of sustained counselling and rehabilitation ought to be an essential part of the juvenile justice process even after the maximum period of remand is over.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/justice-and-the-juvenile/article5097614.ece
7,9,2013,Saved for now,"The historic Right to Information Act has once again been saved from going under the politician’s scalpel, proving that the law, designed for common citizens, is now truly owned by them. It was a classic David versus Goliath battle, with an army of ill-equipped RTI stakeholders ranged against the full might of the political class. Barring a handful of honourable exceptions, MPs cutting across party lines had closed ranks to override a decision of the Central Information Commission bringing political parties under the purview of the information law. But the only way to achieve this was to amend the Act, which the RTI community saw as the first, and perhaps not the last, attack on the hard-fought information regime. Under the RTI Act, any organisation that receives substantial government assistance is a public authority. This makes the law applicable not only to the different wings of government but also to all NGOs sustained by government funding. Political parties argued, and with some merit, that they were voluntary associations outside the government and therefore not subject to the same level of public scrutiny.
One genuine area of concern arising from the CIC order related to disclosing internal, strategic decisions of parties. Political parties are peculiar in that they are neither part of government nor are they wholly outside of it, like NGOs. In their private space, parties compete with one another almost like entrepreneurs. This means they must be afforded privacy with regard to decisions that impact their winnability, such as choosing candidates, planning strategies, etc. So far so good, but the problem is the almost Machiavellian manipulation by political parties to stay out of any kind of accountability, including the most critical one of financial accountability, which they evade by reporting all or most donations to be under Rs. 20,000. This subterfuge allows even the mainstream parties to altogether escape scrutiny. The Election Commission’s repeated requests to the Law Ministry to address this serious lacuna have so far gone unheeded. Against this backdrop, the drive to exempt parties from the RTI sends a message that politicians are a law unto themselves. The special status they have sought militates not only against the constitutional vision of equality but undermines democracy itself. If the ultimate objective of any political party is to form a government, it is a strange argument that the government itself should be accountable under the RTI but the party that forms it should not. People vote for political parties and they have a right to know who funds them, especially if big corporates are involved. Over to the Standing Committee, to which the Bill has now been referred.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/saved-for-now/article5101437.ece
7,9,2013,Fig leaf for an illegal war,"Even as United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon calls for fresh talks on Syria, and Russia says it is not blocking the U.N. but wants member states to be “more objective”, Syria’s part in President Barack Obama’s domestic agenda could yet be crucial. In practice, the United States Congress leaves foreign affairs to the President, but the War Powers Resolution of 1973 (the War Powers Act) requires him to consult the legislature before introducing U.S. troops into hostilities or clearly likely hostilities, and limits involvement to 60 days unless Congress has declared war or specifically authorises continuation. Congress has not so far objected when the executive has used troops without consultation so as to evacuate U.S. citizens from combat zones, or in the event of an attack on the country. Nevertheless, the Act, passed after the disastrous U.S. war in Viet Nam and possibly because the U.S. never declared war on the erstwhile Democratic Republic of Viet Nam (North Viet Nam), has never been invoked thus; in 2003, President George W. Bush gained Congressional sanction for the illegal invasion of Iraq, and the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan was approved by the U.N. Security Council.
Mr. Obama, however, is not using the Act solely for constitutional reasons; Syria is an instrument in the bitter struggle, which started the day the President took office, between himself and the Republican faction in Congress. To start with, Mr. Obama is showing a willingness to cooperate with Congress. Secondly, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s 10-7 vote for at least a 60-day intervention shows divisions in both parties, but the Republican split is the more serious. GOP members in favour of an attack on Syria, such as Senator John McCain, see U.S. global standing as being at stake. Those against, like Senator Rand Paul, are mindful of domestic public hostility to any more foreign military adventurism; recent polls show nearly 80 per cent approval for the use of the War Powers Act, but they also show opposition to intervention at 50:42, though 50 per cent would support limited action, such as missile strikes. The Republicans stand to lose far more than the Democrats, as they have blocked or wrecked everything Mr. Obama has tried to do, but now they face cooperating with him or making the U.S. look weak. The intervention issue is, therefore, less about the plight of Syrians than about U.S. domestic politics; that may also explain Washington’s indifference to post-attack developments. The sting in the tail is that intervention would put Washington on the same side as the extreme Sunni rebel group al-Nusra, and thereby the same side as al-Qaeda. Osama bin Laden would have loved it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fig-leaf-for-an-illegal-war/article5101438.ece
9,9,2013,Born to serve,"There is a healthy tradition in cricket and many other sports of the captain or a former captain, with admiration for a young man’s leadership skills, endorsing his name for the hot seat to the administrators and the selectors while simultaneously agreeing to play under the new helmsman. When last asked to lead the Indian team, it was Sachin Tendulkar who suggested Mahendra Singh Dhoni for the job and has since been uncomplainingly playing under him. It is a rare politician who would defer to a subordinate; Sonia Gandhi did that when she nominated Manmohan Singh to be Prime Minister in her place. It is a different matter that in the public perception she is the leader and he is the one being led. Per se, there can be no objections to Manmohan Singh asking to work under Rahul Gandhi, whom he has also held up as the “ >ideal Prime Minister” post-the 2014 general election. If the Prime Minister has indeed expressed this wish in a spirit of sportsmanship, then hats off to his grace and humility. The problem is the blatantly unequal nature of relationship between the Nehru-Gandhis and the phalanx of Congresspersons who by instinct and training are happiest in worship mode.
Not just the Prime Minister, all of the Congress has been clamouring to have Rahul lead the party into the big election. Even in the afterglow of the United Progressive Alliance’s 2009 victory, which the outside world widely and correctly credited to Manmohan Singh’s leadership, there was no dearth of voices within the Congress imploring Rahul to take Dr. Singh’s place unmindful of the insult to a Prime Minister still in office. Congresspersons also neatly skirted questions around Rahul’s fitness and qualifications to lead the country. What complicates matters is the Congress first family’s dichotomous attitude to leadership issues. There is about the clan members a born-to-rule air that has instilled sycophancy and worse among Congresspersons. But equally there seems an unwillingness to lead that is particularly manifest in Rahul. Till date it is not clear what future role he intends to play. Though apparently the second-in-command in the Congress structure, Rahul has managed not to be around at critical times — which is now more than ever considering the monumental nature of problems before the government. These include the worst economic downturn in a decade and unceasing scams and scandals leading to a serious credibility crisis topped by an unhappy prognosis for the election, nationally and in key battleground States like Andhra Pradesh. This is a crisis time equally for the Congress voter: the Prime Minister wants to be led by Rahul who seems least interested in leading. And all this when Narendra Modi is practising hard to be Prime Minister, doing whatever it takes, including declaiming to the nation with a make-believe Red Fort in the background.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/born-to-serve/article5107611.ece
9,9,2013,A marriage of necessity,"The seeds of >Microsoft’s recent acquisition of Nokia’s mobile phone business were probably sown two years ago when the Finnish handset maker jumped aboard the Microsoft train by adopting Windows Mobile as the operating system for its smartphones. Analysts were quibbling even then over whether it was in Nokia’s best interest to do so. It is clear now, however, that the $7.2 billion deal is a marriage born out of necessity; both companies are one-time pioneers that are fighting a losing battle to maintain, let alone grow, their market share in the all-important smartphone market. Yet, it needs to be pointed out that even with the respective combined hardware and software capabilities of the two companies, the deal faces an uncertain future. Between the two, however, Nokia is likely to benefit far more in the long term as the acquisition is in effect a bailout package. Nokia’s liabilities are now Microsoft’s headache. Canadian-born Stephen Elop was appointed, with much fanfare, as the first foreign CEO of Nokia in 2010.Three years later, he’s headed back to Microsoft with half of Nokia in hand and a clear shot at succeeding Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.
However, this is the sort of wheeling and dealing one would expect when a company falls to ruin. Nokia’s share in the handset market has slipped considerably over the past ten years and in the smartphone market, it is in the single digits. At least part of this is due to Nokia’s slow adoption of innovations like the touch-screen. With a fresh infusion of cash and a renewed vision, it is altogether possible that Nokia’s handset business, now under Microsoft’s care, has a shot at reliving its glory days. Microsoft, on the other hand, could do with some risk-taking. The company, which is sitting on a cash mountain in the range of $70 billion, a remnant of its monopoly-driven software days, has struggled to make the transition into the smartphone age. Even with Nokia in hand, Microsoft is treading uncertain waters as it leaps forward without a proven strategy; a risk that seems all the more deadly in light of its poor management succession plan. Its next steps as it looks to take on Apple and Google are bound to have repercussions in India. After all, one of Nokia’s largest plants is in Chennai and if Microsoft chooses to exit the feature handset business, it will have a negative effect on its India employee base and consequent investment. While the deal is a bittersweet ending for Nokia, Microsoft still has a chance at the smartphone crown. After all, the only constant in the world of technology is that landscapes change at the speed of a mouse click.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-marriage-of-necessity/article5107614.ece
10,9,2013,Playing with fire,"Uttar Pradesh has always been vulnerable to communal and caste tensions because of the sizeable presence in the State of three critical demographic segments — Muslims, Dalits and caste Hindus. It takes but a small incident to start a skirmish, which, depending on the extent of political support, either sputters to a swift end or turns into a full-blown conflagration. Prima facie, the mob frenzy in Muzaffarnagar, which has already claimed over two dozen lives and left hundreds homeless, appears to be a textbook case of engineered violence. The pattern is familiar. Ground reports suggest that the current disturbance has its roots in an August 27 Jat-Muslim clash in Kawal village over a spate of killings involving both communities. This spark developed into a fire, thanks to police inaction, political manipulation and a poisonous video calculatedly pressed into circulation by suspected Hindutva elements. Predictably enough, large-scale violence erupted. And equally predictably, the video turned out to be fake: what was circulated as the actual clip of the August 27 killings was most probably footage shot in Pakistan.
But this is exactly how vested interests, and sometimes even mainstream parties, operate. A hate-filled VCD had formed part of the BJP’s official campaign material ahead of the 2007 Assembly election. The disc, which portrayed Muslims as nation-breakers, and implored Hindus to vote the BJP or find themselves sporting beards and wearing burqas, was withdrawn following an FIR registered by the Election Commission. That election was saved by the ECI’s hawk-like watch over communal and caste miscreants, leading to the formation of the first majority government in 16 years by the Bahujan Samaj Party. It is not without significance that peace prevailed until the next election five years later. For all of Mayawati’s faults she ran an efficient administration that acted at the first sign of communal trouble. In the February 2012 Assembly election, fresh hope came in the form of Akhilesh Yadav who seemed sincere enough with his promise to practise principled politics. The promise stands betrayed as can be seen from the Samajwadi Party government’s admission to at least 27 communal incidents since March 2012. The SP is the mirror opposite of the BJP and its larger parivar. For every cynical action of one, there tends to be an equal and opposite reaction from the other, with the competition getting fiercer closer to an election, as is obviously the case now. As 2014 nears, rival political efforts to fuel and play on the insecurity and fears of Muslims and Hindus are likely to be intensified. The good sense of Uttar Pradesh’s people will be severely tested in the months ahead.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/playing-with-fire/article5110169.ece
10,9,2013,"Thumbs up for Tokyo, wrestling","Tokyo won its bid to host the 2020 Olympic Games, its second in 56 years, by a whopping margin of 24 votes at the International Olympic Committee session in Buenos Aires on Saturday. The Japanese capital was the front-runner in a three-way contest, though serious doubts remained because of the situation at the crippled Fukushima nuclear reactor. A last-ditch assurance from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to allay fears about the radioactive water leak from Fukushima apparently succeeded. The IOC members have opted for Japanese efficiency, financial health and technical competence over the perceived risks associated with bids from Istanbul and Madrid. It was also a way of showing solidarity with a nation recovering from the 2011 devastating tsunami. In a way, the IOC took the least troublesome course in voting for Tokyo, steering clear of the political turmoil in Turkey, and the economic crisis in Spain. Japan’s ‘clean’ image in matters of doping compared to the mess in Turkey — with as many as 31 suspensions of athletes in recent weeks — might also have mattered in the final round of voting. That IOC members ignored the cost factor, in preferring the $9.80 billion Tokyo budget to the $5.04 billion budget of Madrid, should, however, come as a surprise given the Olympic body’s avowed keenness to avoid gigantism, especially in the backdrop of the $12 billion ‘economic disaster’ that the 2004 Athens Games proved to be for Greece.
The Buenos Aires meeting also saw wrestling staging a comeback — an expected one — into the Olympic sports programme after having been stunningly knocked out by the IOC Executive Board last February. In yet another three-cornered contest involving a combined baseball-softball bid, apart from one in squash, wrestling took just one round of voting to get back into the 2020 and 2024 Games. It is already part of the 2016 Games. Given its popularity around the world and its legacy from the ancient Olympics, it was clear that the sport would get the nod. International wrestling federation president Nenad Lalovic deserves to be complimented for his efforts in revamping the structure, changing the format to make the sport more appealing, giving more representation to women both in the federation and in the Olympic competition, and galvanising world opinion. The sport had the backing of Russian President Vladimir Putin, among other leaders. India, which has won three medals in wrestling in the last two editions of the Olympics, as well as several other Asian countries, should be pleased with its return to the Games just as they would be in Asia gaining the privilege to host the Games 12 years after Beijing.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/thumbs-up-for-tokyo-wrestling/article5110170.ece
11,9,2013,"Leak less, probe more","The arrest last month of Yasin Bhatkal, the alleged mastermind of several terror attacks in India over the past decade, is an opportunity for the government to set the record straight on the Indian Mujahideen. Bhatkal, who is currently in the custody of the National Investigation Agency, will likely provide investigators with crucial information on the terror operations he purportedly conceived and carried out with the help of others. This will prove useful not only in thwarting future attacks but also in ensuring that the perpetrators of some of the worst bombings of recent years are brought to book. Just as importantly, his testimony could be invaluable in evaluating whether or not some of the many Muslim men currently arraigned for these crimes have been falsely implicated. Simply put, Yasin Bhatkal’s arrest paves the way for the establishment to shine a light on the role and operations of the IM — an outfit he allegedly co-founded — while clearing the names of those who have nothing to do with it. Difficult as it will be to strictly delineate the Indian Mujahideen’s membership and affiliates, the government has a golden chance to prevent the IM from becoming a convenient reason for hauling up innocent persons.
For now, however, intelligence agencies have fallen back on their habit of leaking selective, juicy and unverifiable tidbits from Bhatkal’s interrogation to a waiting media. Within days of his arrest, for example, several newspapers reported how Bhatkal has confessed to his involvement in the bomb blasts at Mecca Masjid (2007), the German Bakery (2010) and Dilsukhnagar (2013). What’s more, he has apparently revealed how many of these attacks were coordinated by Pakistani handlers. The Indian Mujahideen, we are also to believe, now operates from Pokhara in Nepal, after it shut shop in northern Karnataka. The reason behind such leaks is fairly clear: intelligence agencies are under pressure from their political masters to “deliver results.” But unless Bhatkal’s interrogation is corroborated by the testimony of his other alleged accomplices in custody, and supported by material evidence, the government’s case for indicting him — and consequently, the Indian Mujahideen — will fall flat before the courts. Rather than trying to convince the public about how evil the IM is, the NIA and other agencies should focus their attention on gathering the evidence needed to ensure his conviction. The painstaking investigation that helped apprehend Yasin Bhatkal in the first place is an example of what our agencies are capable of. The country is anxious to see justice done for the terrorist attacks that killed and maimed hundreds. What we need is not leaks but more of that sort of meticulous police work.

11,9,2013,"Against Labor, but for what?","The landslide election victory of Australia’s conservative Coalition on September 7 is no surprise, but it leaves the deposed Labor Party in chaos. Voting is compulsory in Australia, and the fully-preferential electoral system used for the federal lower chamber, the 150-seat House of Representatives, has delivered no fewer than 88 seats to Coalition leader Tony Abbott’s grouping, with Labor winning 57; final results under the single transferable vote for the 76-place Senate, where half the seats were available, are still awaited. Labor has only itself to blame for this defeat. Despite a strong economy — the country has seen 22 years of uninterrupted aggregate growth and under Labor has ridden the global crash very well — the party’s bitter infighting, which saw Prime Minister Kevin Rudd ousted by his deputy Julia Gillard in 2010 and then reinstated in a June 2013 counter-coup, was predictably punished by voters. Ms Gillard had more parliamentary Labor support than Mr. Rudd, who rated better among the public, but her U-turn introducing mining and carbon taxes (which may have been intended to preserve her Green-supported minority government) was a political disaster; another right-wing policy of hers included a blanket refusal to let refugees arriving by boat set foot on the Australian mainland.
Mr. Abbott made the most of his opportunity, and with strident Murdoch press support led the polls throughout a campaign sullied by crude sexism, particularly towards Ms Gillard. The incoming Prime Minister aims to abolish the carbon tax, despite doubts about the putative benefits, and to impose austerity measures. Furthermore, he may well try to reverse many of Ms Gillard’s policy improvements for women and for people with disabilities. Indigenous Australians, who in 2008 turned their backs on Mr. Abbott when he spoke during Mr. Rudd’s widely acclaimed national day of apology to them, can expect little; Mr. Abbott also opposes same-sex marriage. The new Coalition government will, however, have to make concessions in the Senate, where other parties including the Greens hold the balance of power. In addition, Mr. Abbott may find his austerity economics less popular than he expects; even the Business Council considers unemployment benefits too low. Internationally, however, little is likely to change despite proposed cuts in foreign aid. Canberra will maintain its strategic collaboration with the United States, and will continue recruiting Indian students while it extends its commitment to the Asian Quadrilateral. Australian voters, nevertheless, may well find that voting against a party is not enough, but at present Labor is in no position to exploit that.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/against-labor-but-for-what/article5113463.ece
12,9,2013,Collusion of the worst kind,"When regulators become violators, who is to regulate them? That perplexing question is what arises from the damning report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee that investigated alleged irregularities in the conduct of the human papilloma virus vaccine trial on nearly 23,500 girls in the 10-14 age group in Vadodara, Gujarat and Khammam, Andhra Pradesh. But more importantly, the report provides a rare glimpse into the murky ways in which certain policy decisions that affect a large number of people are taken by nodal agencies with utter disregard to propriety. The vaccine given to young girls for preventing cervical cancer was approved for use in India in October 2008. But an MoU was signed as early as February 2007 by the Indian Council of Medical Research and an American agency, Programme for Appropriate Technology in Health, wherein the regulator committed itself to “promote the drug [vaccine] for inclusion in the universal immunisation programme” well before the “utility and rationale” of inclusion was studied. Incidentally, the ICMR is not the body that takes a call on introducing a vaccine in the immunisation programme. Thus, by entering into an agreement, the ICMR abdicated its responsibilities of being a watchdog and instead became a “willing facilitator [that] acted at the behest of PATH in promoting the interests of the [vaccine] manufacturer.” The Drug Controller General of India is equally culpable for being a mute spectator when clinical trial rules were “flagrantly violated.”
If the nodal agencies bending over backwards to facilitate the introduction of the vaccine is shocking, the Union Health Ministry’s role in scuttling the truth-seeking process is alarming. The ministry has made a mockery of the trial subjects by choosing people with well-established conflicts of interest to be a part of the inquiry committee to look into the irregularities. The DCGI, on its part, ensured that “no accountability was fixed” on the erring officials and no definite steps were taken to improve the trial process. The collusion of the agencies and the ministry turns the spotlight on the government’s intent in removing the obstacles for multinational drug companies to undertake human clinical trials. The conduct and investigation of one of the country’s notorious trials clearly demonstrates that the government showed no interest in protecting its people, choosing instead to abet the criminal acts of private companies and safeguard itself. If the very design of a trial that involved ICMR could be faulty, one is left wondering what the status of other trials would be. How safe are people who knowingly or unknowingly volunteer for trials in India?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/collusion-of-the-worst-kind/article5117415.ece
12,9,2013,Saluting a triumphant trio,"Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams didn’t need to win the U.S. Open, which concluded on Monday in New York, to join tennis’s pantheon; they have been a prominent part of it for some time now. Nadal had progressed from being a wrinkle in the argument that Roger Federer was the greatest male player of all time to being a contender for the honour himself. Serena, after her first-round defeat at Roland Garros last year, had dominated the women’s tour, winning three of five Grand Slam titles, an Olympic singles gold and causing former players of the stature of John McEnroe, Martina Navratilova, and Chris Evert to suggest that there hadn’t been a better female player. Neither Nadal’s 13th major nor Serena’s 17th were records. Federer (17) and Pete Sampras (14) lead the men’s list while Margaret Court (24), Steffi Graf (22), Helen Wills Moody (19), Evert and Navratilova (18 each) top the women’s. But what Nadal’s second U.S. crown and Serena’s fifth did was advance their cases so strongly that they might not need to break the all-time record to be remembered as the best ever.
Nadal is now just one Australian Open short of becoming the first man since Rod Laver — and only the third ever, Roy Emerson being the other — to win each major at least twice. Consider that the Grand Slams are played on three different surfaces these days as compared to two in Laver and Emerson’s era, factor in Nadal’s winning head-to-head numbers against Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray in a Golden Age of men’s tennis, and his claim to being the greatest ever is as complete as it gets. Serena in her 30s is making up for the time she lost in her 20s when she chose not to commit to a full schedule. Over the last 15 months, she has devoted herself to tennis and bullet-proofed her legacy. Her unbeaten run on clay, which led to her second Roland Garros crown earlier this year, banished doubts anyone might have had about her capability on the surface; her victory over Victoria Azarenka in a rematch from last year’s U.S. Open final showed again that Serena is peerless in big matches. The fact that both Nadal and Serena have returned to such success after career-threatening injuries — the Spaniard earlier this year, the American in 2011 — makes their accomplishments even more impressive. Another remarkable instance of mind over matter was to be found in the continuing success story of Leander Paes (40). Partnering Radek Stepanek, Paes won an eighth Grand Slam men’s doubles title to add to six mixed-doubles crowns. Doubles might not have the competitive depth singles has, but this doesn’t detract from Paes’s achievement. The oldest man to win a Grand Slam in the Open Era deserves his place among the finest doubles practitioners of all time.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/saluting-a-triumphant-trio/article5117416.ece
13,9,2013,Get serious,"After long years of inaction, even a small step forward can appear as a lot. With Parliament passing the >Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Bill, India appears to have at least acknowledged the continued existence of manual scavenging, including within government-run bodies. The law is a vast improvement on the Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act of 1993, which saw no conviction in its 20-year history despite the widespread prevalence of the abominable practice. This time the focus is equally on rehabilitation of manual scavengers as on prohibition of the practice and punishment of the employers. Manual scavenging will continue so long as there are men and women poor and helpless enough to take it up. Without rehabilitation of those engaged in this dehumanising labour, manual scavenging will find ways to hide from the law, no matter how stringent the penal provisions for the employers. The new law recognises the problem as not just one of dry latrines, but as one of dealing with human waste. Irrespective of the nature of the latrines, manual scavengers have to work in extremely unhygienic conditions that put their health at serious risk.
Another improvement in the current legislation is the acknowledgment that local and railway authorities have been employers of manual scavengers. One reason the stringent provisions of the earlier law did not take effect was that the main violators of the law included government authorities. Local bodies trying to clear blocked sewer lines or the railways trying to clean soiled tracks at stations and toilets in trains have done little to introduce mechanisation. The current legislation sees protective gear and safety precautions for the workers as an alternative to mechanisation. For the purposes of the Act, those using protective gear and devices as may be notified by the Central government would not come under the definition of a “manual scavenger”. Verily, this is an escape clause for local and railway authorities to continue to deploy workers in manual scavenging. Even the present legislation would not have come about without the intervention of the judiciary. The Supreme Court has now asked the Centre and the States to provide a detailed list of manual scavengers who have been rehabilitated so far. Actually, funds allotted for their rehabilitation have been mostly unspent. The determination of the Centre and the States to rid India of manual scavenging can be gauged only from the results achieved on the ground, and not from the nature of the laws passed in Parliament.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/get-serious/article5120916.ece
13,9,2013,Protecting forest lands,"The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General underscoring the >blatant violation of conservation laws and Supreme Court orders in the diversion of forests for destructive non-forestry use confirms what former Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh said about the system: it’s a bit of a joke. The compensatory afforestation mechanism instituted to balance the devastating loss of natural forests has failed abysmally. The CAG’s report is proof that India’s environmental health has been in free fall since the dawn of economic reforms. The Union government as well as the States have played an active role in this decline. The Supreme Court’s Central Empowered Committee (CEC) stepped in where governments failed and set up a framework for monetisation of forests. But what was meant to ration the use of forest land has only served to justify its usurpation. With the possible exception of designated protected areas, judicial scrutiny and oversight did not result in an effective regime to either reduce deforestation or to green alternative lands.
Among the major findings of the CAG are the non-receipt of nearly 73 per cent of lands earmarked for reforestation, poor work outcomes, and failure to assess and levy stiff penalties on defaulting companies to whom forest wealth was handed over. The funds collected for transfer of forest land, totalling around Rs 30,000 crore, have been misused, not accounted for or badly managed. The CAG has recorded the arbitrariness in the deployment of funds by the Union government, the States and the CEC. Environment and Forests is in the concurrent list of the Constitution. This was meant to make the States and the Centre co-trustees of natural resources. Instead, it has become an excuse to shun responsibility. As a consequence, monitoring of forests and projects that use forest land has all but collapsed. In more than 1,000 cases that the CAG test-checked, it found projects continued to use forests in violation of regulations and conditions laid down while securing clearances. Today, market forces, and the government, are jointly usurping the forest commons, aided by experts and officers sitting behind closed doors at the Centre, in the States, and in the judiciary. Their private decision-making should not decide the fate of India’s forests and the millions who depend on it for survival. Given the scale of the CAG’s findings, it would be reasonable to call for a moratorium on projects involving diversion of forests. A comprehensive reform of the monitoring mechanism is needed to ensure democracy and transparency.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/protecting-forest-lands/article5120911.ece
14,9,2013,Crimes death can’t wish away,"In 1988, Paramount Pictures released a powerful, moving courtroom drama based on the trial, held five years earlier, for the brutal gang rape of an American woman, Cheryl Araujo. “The first scream was for help. The second is for justice,” went the movie’s tagline. That call for justice was never fully answered in Araujo’s case, since most of the six men initially charged with raping her were either acquitted or served just a few years in prison. But the sheer savagery of the act jolted the United States at a time the country was getting wealthier, and its elites showed little interest in attending to the proliferation of sexual violence, especially among the underclass and the marginalised in society. For people in India, the 2012 Delhi gang rape case has served this purpose, while sparing us the travesty of justice that was the Araujo trial. There is no question we have come a full circle since the gruesome act of rape and murder in December last year shook us to the bone: justice has been done, with all the accused, including the juvenile offender, having been found guilty before a court of law after expeditious trial. In the interim, the laws dealing with sexual crimes have been strengthened, and we have had, and continue to have, a robust national conversation on ways to tackle India’s alarming rates of rape and sexual assault. But amid these progressive efforts, the Sessions Court’s decision to hang all four adult accused to death marks a step back — since it will have the effect of substituting the need for greater social, legal and even political efforts to tackle the epidemic of crimes against women with the false comfort of retribution.
The feeble link between the death penalty and its purported aim of deterrence should serve caution to the many among us who have welcomed the Sessions Court sentence with comfort, even alacrity. Handing down death to the Delhi gang rape accused is not likely to reduce the incidence of sexual crimes in India. In meting out the hangman’s justice — as opposed to putting the four away for life — the Sessions Court has regrettably missed an opportunity to turn the discourse away from retributive punishment to constructive dialogue on policing and legal reforms. How are we going to convince ourselves that this was a criminal act among the “rarest of the rare” when several instances of rape and murder of varying brutality have been reported since December 2012? To hang rapists and suggest they are “exceptional” anti-social elements goes against every effort to spread the message that rape is only too commonplace in India. Tough as it may be to find a solution to this grave problem, death to sexual offenders is not the answer. Appellate courts must now swiftly intervene, reverse the trial court’s judgment and sentence all four convicts in the case to an actual lifetime in prison.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/crimes-death-cant-wish-away/article5125321.ece
14,9,2013,Aided democracy,">Narendra Modi’s elevation to prime ministerial nominee of the Bharatiya Janata Party was a story foretold given that the >Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh would have it no other way. And yet for all the Sangh’s seeming authority, the mission wasn’t easily achieved. If BJP chief Rajnath Singh was hard put to deliver the deal despite spending the better part of two days hopping from one sulking leader to another, Mr. Modi himself had to be content with seeking Lal Krishna Advani’s blessings after the event. The veteran resisted the inevitable exactly as he had done at the June 2013 Goa national executive meet where part-I of Project Modi was put in place. It was an open secret that Mr. Modi’s appointment as the BJP’s campaign committee chief was a precursor to him getting the larger role. It is a measure of the misgivings within the BJP that this clear signal did not ensure automatic cooperation from party seniors such as Sushma Swaraj and Murli Manohar Joshi, not to mention Mr. Advani who till the end refused to budge. There is no doubt that the Gujarat Chief Minister enjoys huge cadre support, the reason why the RSS wanted him named the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate in the first place. However, for the existing party leadership, the biggest concern is its own future under Mr. Modi, who has so far shown himself to be unaccommodating of the smallest dissent.
Ms Swaraj is the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and therefore technically the BJP’s shadow Prime Minister. With Mr. Modi as presumptive Prime Minister, her journey all but comes to an end, and more so because she and the Gujarat Chief Minister are of the same vintage. She knows, as does Mr. Advani, that there is no stopping Mr. Modi’s ascendancy within the parivar. Which is why they wanted his promotion to the next level not to happen until after the November 2013 elections to the State Assemblies of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi and Chhattisgarh. These are not just old BJP strongholds; the Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh run highly rated governments. A BJP victory in these States would unavoidably be attributed to Mr. Modi’s leadership, when in fact the ground work would have been done by Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Raman Singh. The BJP has tried to project the deep differences over Mr. Modi’s appointment as democracy at its vibrant best. But the party has been spoilt by one angry warhorse who refused to attend the parliamentary board meeting and instead circulated a tartly worded letter of dissent, giving the impression that he would prefer the political oblivion which now surely awaits him to accepting Mr. Modi’s leadership.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/aided-democracy/article5125322.ece
16,9,2013,Diplomacy works,"The United States-Russia agreement to provide a “framework” for the inspection, removal and eventual destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons proves diplomacy is not a spent force in international politics: it has been creatively deployed in this case to not only stave off potentially disastrous military intervention, but also break new ground in troubleshooting the Syrian crisis politically. The deal — signed Saturday in Geneva by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his U.S. counterpart John Kerry — requires Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to allow for immediate “on-site inspections of all declared sites” which produce and stockpile chemical munitions. The agreement proposes to “eliminate” all WMD material in Syria within the “first half of 2014.” With Syria having formally acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention, the inspection will be supervised by the treaty’s watchdog, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, as well as the U.N. These remarkable developments, which come barely a week after a West-led attack on Syria seemed all but inevitable, represent a stunning victory for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who urged the U.S. via an op-ed in the New York Times to “stop using the language of force and return to the path of [...] diplomatic settlement.” His attempt marks one of the most politically savvy gestures by a head of state to reach across the aisle to a foreign audience in recent years.
Saturday’s deal is a game-changer in more ways than one. On the one hand, it could prevent further escalation of violence, including the use of WMDs, in Syria. On the other, weapons inspection necessitates a cease-fire agreement between the government and the rebels in many parts of the country, which can only help the case for political dialogue. That said, the power struggle between the U.S. and Russia on this issue will continue unabated. If the West has been saved the blushes of going to war without domestic support, it will now exploit any claim of Syria’s non-compliance to initiate a military strike. Moscow seems amenable to a Chapter VII resolution at the U.N. Security Council to goad Syria into cooperating, but will insist on a tight draft that eschews the use of force against Assad’s regime. Syria’s accession to the CWC leaves Israel and Egypt, staunch American allies, as the only two holdouts in the region to remain outside major treaties banning WMDs. To counter this strategic imbalance, Russia has sought to push the Syrian deal as a precursor to a “WMD-free Middle East”. Laudable though that goal is, this should not deter multilateral efforts to seize the momentum the Geneva deal has offered to nudge the Syrian conflict’s principal actors toward the negotiating table.

16,9,2013,Voyager’s voyage,"On August 25, 2012 and around 18.78 billion km from Earth, the Voyager 1 space probe became the first human-made object to breach the interstellar medium (ISM), the matter that exists between stars in the universe. The primary reason it has taken a year for astrophysicists to deem this event as having happened is that the signs of breaching the ISM were not all detected simultaneously nor have they been understood fully. In fact, as if playing on their confusion, Voyager 1 beamed home a series of signals in October-November, 2012, that have been studied for their meaning since then. In three papers published in Science in June this year, scientists deduced that the probe had stumbled into a region — lying on the cusp of the ISM — astronomers didn’t know existed. Finally, and with the help of a natural disturbance promulgated by our Sun, astronomers from NASA and several universities, led by the University of Iowa, detected signals from Voyager 1 in April, 2013, that implied the incidence of cosmic rays and the density of ionized gas around the probe had increased, and the direction of the magnetic field in the space around the probe had changed: all signs of Voyager 1 becoming humankind’s first eyes and ears in the world between stars.
When the twin Voyager probes were launched in 1977, the space age was only two decades old. Those who built and now operate them, from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, had the audacity to equip the probes to function for almost four decades (Voyager 2 is currently 15.3 billion km from Earth). The durability of the probes and the careful management of resources have awarded us with the chance to directly study the outermost reaches of the Solar System, within which great astronomical observations are being expected. This attitude of careful management has also paid off with other NASA missions, such as the WISE asteroid-hunter and the Spitzer space telescope before, and should once again with the Kepler space telescope. And while nobody is sure of what to expect from Voyager 1, that the probe is now bathed in particles arising from stars other than just the Sun is opportunity enough. Its particles and fields science experiment will function till 2020, until when the small nuclear battery on-board will be able to power them. After that, the Golden Record, a gold-plated disc containing photos of and sounds from Earth, added to the payload just in case other life-forms encounter the probe, will preserve Voyager 1’s ambassadorship. This second Sputnik moment in the history of human exploration has rightly rekindled the awe humans felt when they first looked into the night sky.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/voyagers-voyage/article5131838.ece
17,9,2013,Reality check,"In sharply revising downwards its April growth forecast for the current year (2013-14) by more than one percentage point, the Economic Advisory Council (EAC) to the Prime Minister has not exactly sprung a surprise. According to its recently released flagship publication, Economic Outlook 2013-14, the economy will grow by 5.3 per cent, far below the 6.4 per cent projected earlier. The Reserve Bank of India, which was less ambitious to begin with, had revised its estimate to 5.5 from 5.7 per cent. Almost all private forecasters have been projecting even lower rates of growth ranging from 4 to 4.9 per cent. A sub-5 per cent annual growth trajectory seems well within the realm of probability. Official statistics confirm the downward drift. During the first quarter of this year the economy grew by just 4.4 per cent, even lower than the 4.8 per cent of the previous quarter. With the economy unlikely to do much better in the second quarter (July-September), the EAC as well as the more optimistic government spokespersons hope that the second half of the year will be much better and lift the overall rate of growth to something above 5 per cent.
Agriculture is the only sector that is expected to do well on the back of a good monsoon, with a projected increase of 4.8 per cent as against 1.9 per cent in 2012-13; industry is expected to grow by 2.7 per cent as against last year’s 2.1 per cent, and services by 6.6 per cent, down from 7.1 per cent last year. But the farm sector has only a small share in GDP. Even the relatively low expectation from industry might be misplaced. A critical component — manufacturing — has yet to show signs of revival. Between April and July, it actually declined by 0.2 per cent. Another component, mining, remains in the doldrums. On the positive side, the rupee depreciation has already boosted the performance of a wide range of export industries including textiles and leather. The merchandise trade deficit has been coming down in recent months, also due to lower imports of gold and capital goods. A healthy performance by the IT and IT-es industries could help in containing the current account deficit, which remains a prime concern. The EAC’s projection of a $70 billion deficit (3.8 per cent of GDP) in 2013-14 as against an estimated $88.2 billion (4.8 per cent) seems over-optimistic as of now. Net capital flows are expected to be lower this year and there could be a small drawdown of reserves. Containing the fiscal deficit is another big challenge. During the first four months of the year, it has already reached nearly 63 per cent of the budget. While the EAC has suggested a number of measures to deal with the “twin deficits,” its biggest contribution might well be the realistic GDP growth estimate.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/reality-check/article5135367.ece
17,9,2013,The malady of all emperors,"Once a VIP, always a VIP. Large sections of India’s political class live a life of ill-gotten wealth and undeserved privilege, whether they are in power or not. In the unlikely event of their getting convicted for corruption, they carry their VIP status with them to prison. Last week, the Supreme Court did well to denounce the practice of appellate courts suspending the sentence of VIP convicts on grounds of their health while the appeals of several ordinary convicts against death sentences are still in queue. All prisoners, including convicts, are entitled to medical treatment; but often, such appeals on health grounds are only a backdoor attempt at delaying the serving of a sentence. In the present case, former Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, who was convicted in the teachers’ recruitment scam case earlier this year, was referred by the Delhi High Court to a medical board of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The board, however, found no need to keep him in the hospital. When the High Court, after having shown extraordinary concern for the leader’s health, directed him to surrender by September 17, Mr. Chautala chose to knock at the doors of the Supreme Court. Interestingly, one of the judges had a poser for the VIP politician: “If you come back to power, will you say I don’t want power citing these ailments?” It is amply clear convicted politicians use real or imagined ailments as an excuse to defeat the ends of justice. All that a prisoner can ask for is proper medical assistance in jail, and not permission to serve time in hospital.
Of course, Mr. Chautala is not the first VIP to take recourse to such devices to stay out of jail. Not only VIP convicts, even undertrials and those under arrest for criminal offences feign illness to avoid jail time. If they belong to a party that is ruling the State at the time, then the police too cooperate. In Tamil Nadu, in the 1990s, AIADMK politicians and members of the Sasikala family, considered close to Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, when they were being investigated by Central agencies, preferred the confines of a hospital to the restrictions of a prison cell. More recently, Ramalinga Raju, former chairman of Satyam Computers who is an accused in the multi-crore accounting fraud, used his illness as a reason to stay in hospital till he got bail. Strangely, all of this is in sharp contrast to the ill-treatment of ordinary undertrials and convicts in prisons. Death in custody, whether due to torture or natural causes, is common in India’s prisons. The malaise is systemic, and can only be remedied through strict monitoring of VIP cases by the higher courts.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-malady-of-all-emperors/article5135607.ece
18,9,2013,Ratify this convention,"The entry into force of the landmark global convention that legally recognises domestic work as economically productive activity makes it even harder to countenance the long official neglect of this sector in India. This new standard adopted by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) mandates states to promote the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining between domestic workers and their employers, and the effective abolition of child labour in this sector. But the task of mobilising domestic workers to assert their rights to fair terms of employment is most formidable. The workplace is an extremely amorphous term in this particular context, as it typically connotes more than one household. The isolated and unprotected nature of the activity exposes workers, more than 80 per cent of whom are women, to greater vulnerability. A high rate of attrition is also a factor, as migrant groups constitute the mainstay of domestic labour. Not surprisingly, barely 10 per cent of domestic workers around the world are covered by general labour legislation in comparison with those in other sectors. A 2013 ILO report shows that the Asia-Pacific region has the maximum prevalence of domestic labour, about 41 per cent. But it is the weakest in terms of legal protection — only three per cent of workers are entitled to a weekly day off as compared to the global average of 50 per cent. Just one per cent of the Asia-Pacific domestic workforce is entitled to stipulated maximum hours of work a week. Rights to minimum wages and maternity benefits that are norms in Latin America are a far-cry in Asia.
In India, which has eight per cent of the world’s domestic workers, attempts to extend legal protection to this sector date back to a private member’s bill in Parliament in the 1950s. But the closest any legislature has moved to realise the objective is the recent inclusion of this category in the Tamil Nadu Manual Workers Act, besides legally guaranteed minimum wages in Kerala and Karnataka. Entitlements to a weekly day off, paid leave and other long term benefits are no less legitimate demands and are important steps to augment their social status as workers. The demand for domestic workers is said to be on the increase given the changing profile of the Indian family, the ageing process and urbanisation. The ratification of the ILO convention will be an important step in improving the lot of the millions employed in this sector. But it will also need enabling domestic legislation. As a first, Parliament should consider acting expeditiously on the 2008 draft bill proposed by the National Commission for Women that seeks to regulate working conditions for domestic workers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ratify-this-convention/article5138791.ece
18,9,2013,Needs careful navigation,"The decision by the Civil Aviation Ministry to privatise six major airports in the country comes at a time when the government is facing a massive resource crunch. It is telling that the list includes Chennai and Kolkata airports, where the state-owned Airports Authority of India recently built new terminals. Bids have been invited for the privatisation of Chennai and Lucknow airports in the first instance, with invitations for Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Jaipur and Guwahati to follow. The development and management of these airports will be awarded to private players for a concession period of 30 years. The logic behind including smaller airports in this plan seems to be that a well-resourced private operator would be able to offer better facilities to help airlines enhance connectivity. A praiseworthy feature of the plan is that no bidder is to get more than two of the six airports. Further, applicants will not be eligible for more than one of the three international airports in the list — Chennai, Kolkata, and Ahmedabad. While the government will permit bidders to hold 100 per cent equity in the awarded projects, this will be subject to the regulations in operation by the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority.
Indeed, the role of the regulator is of paramount importance especially as the concessionaire can levy charges on airlines for handling flights, and on passengers in the form of a User Development Fee (UDF). A new Bill to empower the regulator has been cleared by the Cabinet. Developers and operators must come under the regulator for the levy of fees and charges, so that passengers are not fleeced. Similarly, to make the airports attractive for airlines, handling charges must be reasonable, especially in the era of cheap and no-frills airlines. Fearing retrenchment, some employees’ unions have already gone on strike to protest the privatisation move. The onus is squarely on the government to ensure that the services of all existing employees in these airports are protected. Likewise, excess land must not be made a part of the offering unless it is separately priced. India’s experience with new airports has been mixed. On the one hand, at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport, where T-3 was developed and is run by a private investor, the flooding of the terminal in June due to heavy rain exposed the poor planning that has gone into its development. In Chennai and Kolkata, on the other hand, it was the AAI that built new terminals, but the construction leaves a lot to be desired. The terms and conditions for new bidders must factor in these issues. It is time the facilities offered to passengers, airlines and visitors at major airports matched international standards.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/needs-careful-navigation/article5138792.ece
19,9,2013,Bailing out of the system,"For a government dragging its feet on the question of providing universal health cover for all, the Centre has shown great alacrity in deciding that members of the All India Services and their families will be eligible for medical treatment abroad at the taxpayer’s expense. It obviously matters little that even in 1946, the report of the Health Survey and Development Committee headed by Sir Joseph Bhore, on which the national health system was to be built, recommended that “public funds should, as far as they are available, be devoted to the development of the health service.” The Planning Commission’s High Level Expert Group on Universal Health Coverage advocated a similar vision for the ongoing Twelfth Plan and beyond. In the revised guidelines issued by the Department of Personnel and Training, there is, seemingly, a caveat on treatment abroad: that only those cases where facilities are not available in India are to be considered. The intent, however, is not to sanction the exceptional case, but to generally facilitate such treatment for the higher echelons of the bureaucracy. Conveniently, the foreign exchange necessary will be recommended by designated domestic hospitals, in addition to State authorities, which are under bureaucratic control anyway. Such measures can only deal a severe blow to the national health care system when it is in dire need of quantitative expansion, qualitative upgradation and strong regulation.
The ailments for which members of the IAS, IPS or their families are now eligible for treatment abroad are those for which treatments need to be widely available in a country with over 1.2 billion people, but are not. Complex or high risk cardiovascular surgery, bone marrow transplants, treatment for leukemia, neoplastic conditions, microvascular and neurosurgery (and others left unspecified) should be available in the public health system, ideally at the district level. That prospect is now distant, since the people who wield power in everyday decision-making have no incentive to do this: they can get treated abroad, and pass on the cost to the exchequer. It must be pointed out here that to provide even a basic package of free health care to Indians, after co-opting a regulated private sector for the purpose, India needs to double the number of doctors and nurses by 2025. The HLEG assessment shows that the country falls well short of the modest WHO norm of 23 health workers per 10,000 people, with only 19 workers available. It recommends a scaling up of facilities in a decade to provide access to treatment and medicines and cut the dismal levels of out-of-pocket spending. Rather than take up this challenge, it is unfortunate that the Centre has agreed to foot the bill for reverse medical tourism for a select few.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bailing-out-of-the-system/article5142673.ece
19,9,2013,Pigment of our imagination,"When Nina Davuluri was crowned Miss America earlier this week, racists in the United States gave free vent to their prejudice on social media networks like Twitter. Their comments ranged from garden-variety hate against foreigners to deeply Islamophobic bilge. Some called her Miss Al Qaeda, others Miss Terrorist, and still others made offensive remarks about the colour of her skin. Back in India, where few things are more celebrated than an Indian’s success in the United States, whether that’s in San Jose, the spelling bee or a beauty pageant, people are shaking with outrage that Americans should react in this manner to the achievement of a Person of Indian Origin. But before rushing to denounce American attitudes, it would be pertinent to ask if Ms Davuluri would have ever made it past the qualifying rounds of a beauty contest in India. In a country where a multi-crore rupee cosmetic industry thrives on promises of lightening a woman’s skin colour in 10, 20 or 30 days, it is fair to say that the dark complexioned 24-year-old would not have stood a chance. At least multiculturalism is held up enough in the U.S. for the jury to have given her the title, and full marks to America for that. Had she been in India, far from entering a beauty contest, it is more likely that Ms Davuluri would have grown up hearing mostly disparaging remarks about the colour of her skin; she would have been — going by the storyline of most “fairness” cream advertisements — a person with low self-esteem and few friends.
If this sounds like an exaggeration, think back on when was the last time anyone with Ms Davuluri’s skin tone won a beauty crown in India; or the last time anyone saw a matrimonial advertisement seeking “a dark girl” for a handsome boy. Rather, Indians have felt the need to create a new word, ‘wheatish’, to euphemistically describe the melanin in their skin, and this word litters the rows of matrimonial columns apologetically. In the film industry, which also goes by the same beauty standard, the number of dark actors, female or male, can be counted on two hands with fingers to spare. If anything, the situation is getting worse, with the fairness fascists expanding their territory to include men who, like the women victims of such advertising, are promised promotions, social success, and more, as soon as their skin tone becomes a few degrees lighter. Depressing though this may sound, the truth is that the Indian idea of beauty is not very different from the imagined ideal of ‘Ms America’ that those racist hate-tweeters in the U.S hold dear: white or nothing.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pigment-of-our-imagination/article5142670.ece
20,9,2013,Compensating victims,"After appearing to have encroached on matters within the realm of the executive, the Andhra Pradesh High Court did well to recall an earlier order that struck down the award of compensation to 70 Muslim young men who were wrongly arrested in connection with the 2007 Hyderabad Mecca Masjid blast case. The court seems to have realised that such awards are not expressly prohibited by law, and that the government needed no particular “legal basis” for paying compensation to citizens who have been the unfortunate victims of wrongful arrest and torture in criminal cases. Neither the fact of their arrest nor the proof of their innocence was in dispute. The actual perpetrators of the blasts had since been identified and were on trial. The withdrawal of the compensation was thus bad in law and effectively subverted the ends of justice. Admittedly, the court’s initial objection was technical: the victims, it said, were free to file a civil case for compensation. While it is true that mere acquittal or discharge from a case does not entitle an arrested person to compensation, this was not merely a case where the prosecution had failed to prove its charges in a court of law. It was not just that the guilt of the men was not proven, but also that their innocence was now established beyond doubt. When the State is free to compensate victims of accidents and natural calamities, why can it not do the same for those who have suffered injustice at the hands of its own police force? In the past, courts too have intervened to provide compensation to victims of State violence.
But the larger issue of accountability of police officials responsible for the wrongful arrest and torture of the innocent Muslim young men remains. Justice demands that the police officers who unthinkingly put innocent young men through such a harrowing time be made answerable. Torture is illegal and policemen who use cruel and unusual methods of interrogation must be prosecuted. The speed with which the police arrested Muslim men when the perpetrators of the blast were Hindutva sympathisers shows how deeply ingrained the automatic association of Muslims with terrorism is among law-enforcers. The award of compensation was just one small step toward correcting this and sensitising the police force, sections of which are vulnerable to communalisation. Indeed, the National Commission for Minorities had recommended that the compensation amount be recovered from the salaries of the policemen responsible for falsely implicating the young men. The A.P. government’s decision to award compensation must be established as a healthy precedent, and police officers who use torture to extract ‘confessions’ should be made to face civil and criminal liability.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/compensating-victims/article5147176.ece
20,9,2013,Brazil shows the way,"In cancelling her state visit to the United States on account of the National Security Agency’s spying excesses, President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil has taken a principled position that most leaders around the world have shown little appetite for. While every major power affected by the NSA’s intrusive surveillance programme — with the honourable exception of Germany — has gone out of its way to brush U.S. highhandedness under the carpet, Brazil has expressed its displeasure at the highest diplomatic level. Ms Rousseff’s state visit, originally scheduled next month, would have been the first by a Brazilian head of state to Washington, D.C. in nearly two decades. Evidently, the symbolism attached to it meant little for the President in the face of allegations that her office, and other institutions, including Brazil’s largest company Petrobras, had been bugged by the NSA. That these revelations follow the arbitrary detention of David Miranda — the Brazilian partner of journalist Glenn Greenwald who published the NSA leaks — by British authorities at Heathrow has alienated her government further. Former President Lula da Silva suggested in an interview to The Hindu that U.S. President Barack Obama “must apologise” for the NSA’s snooping. The Rousseff administration is even mulling “relocating” to Brazil its citizens’ data hosted by major U.S. companies.
Compare this commendable response to that of India, another emerging power which, like Brazil, has enjoyed cordial ties with the United States. India too was affected by the NSA’s schemes: it is now on record that our embassies, government leaders and ordinary citizens were spied upon. When NSA documents were made public, Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid sought to justify the Agency’s conduct as commonplace. And where Ms Rousseff chose to cancel her visit, there are indications that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh might end up making concessions on a host of issues that are of great concern to American businesses when he meets with President Obama on September 27. The Hindu earlier reported U.S. attempts to get India to phase out refrigerant gases under the Montreal Protocol. Apart from pressing for speedier progress on the purchase of American nuclear reactors, the Obama administration is also likely to demand protection for American patents in the pharmaceutical and renewable energy sectors over and above that required by Indian law. Prime Minister Singh need not call off his visit à la Rousseff; but the least he could do is to publicly register India’s anguish at NSA’s spying, while buffeting U.S. attempts to wrest uneven concessions on the economic front.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/brazil-shows-the-way/article5147637.ece
21,9,2013,Rate helmsman,"The Reserve Bank of India’s new governor, Raghuram Rajan, has upheld two hoary traditions of the central bank in his maiden policy statement — its commitment to combat inflation with an unequivocal focus, and its capacity to surprise the markets. Till Thursday, the expectation was that the RBI would opt for a standstill policy, especially after the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to postpone the tapering off of its easy money policy. But Dr. Rajan caught the market completely off-guard with his decision to raise the policy repo rate by 0.25 percentage points. The shock was immediately felt as stock market indices nosedived and the rupee lost balance. With the rate hike, the governor has signalled that there will be no change in the RBI’s primary objective of reining in inflation, even if this means that growth has to take a backseat in the interim. The policy stance is indeed pragmatic; the central bank was walking a thin line after headline inflation reared its head at 6.1 per cent in August and GDP growth fell to 4.4 per cent in the first quarter. The risk of suppressed inflation from higher energy prices undoing the beneficial impact of a bountiful monsoon was too high to be ignored. If and when the government decides to increase diesel prices, inflation is sure to go further upwards.
Dr. Rajan has balanced his approach on the rate front by loosening up a bit on the liquidity tightening measures that have been in place the last two months. The 0.75 percentage points cut in the marginal standing facility rate — the rate at which banks borrow overnight from the RBI — and the reduction in the minimum daily maintenance of the cash reserve ratio from 99 per cent to 95 per cent will help bring down the interest rate curve at the short end while releasing extra funds for banks to lend. Of course, this may not entirely satisfy banks who have been grumbling about the tight liquidity and high short-term rates. But as Dr. Rajan has pointed out, the risks for the rupee still remain as the Fed has merely postponed the inevitable. Therefore, it is not time yet to unwind the rupee supporting measures that are in place now. In fact, if the environment deteriorates again, it is quite possible that the squeeze will be back. Industry, meanwhile, is disappointed that rates have been raised and says it will affect the recovery process. However, it needs to be pointed out that what caused the slowdown were not high rates but infrastructure bottlenecks, and standstill policymaking. For the growth process to resume, these have to be corrected. And that is the preserve of the government, not the central bank, which meanwhile is continuing to do what it does best — keeping the inflationary demon in check.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rate-helmsman/article5150909.ece
21,9,2013,Heritage at stake,"The Comptroller and Auditor General has indicted the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the premier institute mandated to protect national monuments, for its miserable performance. The evidence of failure revealed is shocking, and the conclusions drawn about the state of conservation are depressing. Instead of seriously reviewing the performance audit findings and implementing corrective measures, the Ministry of Culture is squabbling over a remark on the number of missing monuments. After inspecting about 1655 protected sites, the CAG reported that 92 are missing. The ministry has contested this, stating that only 21 are untraceable. It has speciously argued that another 26 monuments, though submerged under reservoirs, encroached upon and affected by urbanisation, cannot be classified as missing. It is yet to verify the existence of six more monuments, but has nevertheless given an assurance that the remaining ones are physically present. If this claim is correct, then the CAG may have to revise its estimates and categories for the sake of accuracy. But the number of missing monuments is not the only issue. There are other critical shortcomings.
The ASI has not satisfactorily completed the basic and simple task of maintaining an error free inventory of monuments that is fundamental for regular monitoring. There are serious discrepancies between the data available at the circle and sub-circle offices, and the headquarters of the ASI. To sort out such issues and provide a reliable data base, the government created the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquities (NMMA) in 2007. Disappointingly, at the end of its five-year tenure, the NMMA had managed to document only 80,000 of the 5 lakh monuments targeted. The ASI has also not fared well in another core task: excavating potential sites and expanding the horizon of history. Sadly, this premiere institute spends less than one per cent of its total expenditure on this important activity. Even where it has conducted excavations, the ASI has not completed the projects. In 2010, the ministry amended the Ancient Monuments, Sites and Remains Act and promised to regulate development around the monuments better. This has not yet happened. So far, it has drafted site-specific building regulations for only two of the 3678 protected monuments and sites. Earlier committees that reviewed the functioning of the ASI had also pointed out some of these inadequacies. It appears that not much has changed. Unless the government restructures the ASI, improves institutional infrastructure and regularly monitors its performance, India’s priceless heritage will slowly be lost.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/heritage-at-stake/article5150908.ece
23,9,2013,Road to efficiency,"Producing cars and other light duty vehicles with higher fuel efficiency in a major market such as India is an imperative that cannot be delayed. The sharp growth in demand for petrol and diesel, and the rising burden of oil imports make that a priority. Countries with major manufacturing capacities are working to achieve higher average efficiency in their vehicles, with the twin goals of conserving fuel and reducing the emission of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Last year, the U.S. administration presented new average efficiency standards for vehicles that will be sold in 2025, of 54.5 miles per gallon of petrol. That metric would nearly double the efficiency of new vehicles compared to those currently being sold. The European Union also has a target of 4.1 litres of petrol and 3.6 litres of diesel per 100 km for 2020. China has been following a policy of mandated performance levels for each vehicle coming under specific weight classes. India cannot afford to delay its own programme on the wrong premise that it will affect the growth of the automotive industry. If anything, vehicle manufacturers should welcome the Power Ministry’s notification on fuel efficiency norms and its 2017 deadline — already pushed back from 2015 — for compliance, as it enables long-term planning.
China moved to implement new vehicle efficiency standards from 2005 to conserve oil and, in parallel, to encourage the industry to bring in better technologies. As the Global Fuel Economy Initiative of the U.N. Environment Programme points out, a major manufacturing country can afford to set clear standards in advance to facilitate suitable long term investments by industry. Road Transport Minister Oscar Fernandes is therefore wrong to argue for an even longer delay in standard-setting on the ground that the industry is experiencing sluggish growth. As it embarks on the efficiency quest, India should actually look for a leapfrog effect to ensure that only the most efficient vehicles are produced and sold. To address the ‘rebound effect’ — people driving more because cars give better mileage — it must incentivise alternative modes such as inter-city rail services and urban public transport. Also important is to achieve clarity of planning — the responsibility of achieving fuel efficiency should squarely lie with a single Ministry. That would avoid the kind of wrangling witnessed between the Ministries of Power and Road Transport. Given the intense pressure on foreign exchange reserves, India’s nascent efforts at introducing fuel efficiency standards need to be hastened. Globalisation should make it possible for industry to shift better technologies to market quickly and ensure compliance with higher standards even by 2015.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/road-to-efficiency/article5157315.ece
23,9,2013,Wasted food for thought,"That one-third of the food produced annually for human consumption is wasted is in itself unconscionable in a world where 870 million, or one in eight people, go hungry every day. A United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation report now says that this high volume of wastage that occurs right through the food supply chain exerts an adverse impact on land, water, biodiversity and climate change. This impact is in addition to the green house gas emissions that are known to result from current patterns of food production, processing, marketing and consumption associated with global commercial flows. The report focuses on factors that contribute to the decrease in mass and nutritional value of food caused by poor infrastructure, logistics and technology. It also sheds light on multiple costs from food wastage that result from natural disasters, excessive supply, distributional bottlenecks and eating habits of consumers. In Asia, the already high carbon footprint from the cultivation of cereals is compounded by huge volumes of wastage owing to inadequate storage facilities. The carbon footprint of wasted meat in high income regions is to the extent of 67 per cent. Not to mention losses from perishables such as fruit and vegetables. Cumulatively, food ranks as the third emitter after the United States and China. Moreover, food that is produced, but not eaten, occupies close to 30 per cent of the world’s agricultural land, says the report. Such an extremely unproductive use of land is hard even to contemplate given the current scramble for fertile and wet lands in Africa and parts of Asia. Multinational corporations that have resorted to such means to shore up food grain supplies in the aftermath of the global food crisis have encountered hostile resistance from native populations.
Clearly, the judicious use of available food ought to be a critical global priority. This is especially the case since studies have estimated that agricultural output would have to increase by 60 per cent by 2050 to cope with the demands of a growing population. The world is still reeling under the combined impact of the recent rise in food grain prices, commodity speculation and the havoc from freak weather patterns.

24,9,2013,"Testing time for Jaffna, Colombo","Sri Lanka has crossed an important milestone toward national reconciliation with the holding of elections to its Northern provincial council. Held more than four years after the war against the LTTE ended, and for the first time since the 1988 election for the short-lived North-Eastern Provincial Council, the September 21 vote gives the war-ravaged North its first-ever democratic political set up that will share governance with the centre. For the Tamil-majority province that was first under the thumb of the LTTE, then the military, and later run by a governor appointed by Colombo, this is the single biggest step towards a political settlement of the conflict. As expected, the Tamil National Alliance swept the election. It won 30 out of 38 seats in the council, leaving no doubt about who represents the Tamils. Sri Lanka’s ruling United Progressive Front Alliance, which fielded candidates of the Eelam People’s Democratic Party, won only seven seats despite having poured in huge amounts of money into infrastructure building in the North, evidence that the Tamils do not view this development agenda as their own. The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress won a single seat.
The huge turnout conveyed its own message about the importance of this election for the voters. The dire predictions that the Sri Lanka Army would use its overwhelming presence in the province to influence the outcome of the election proved incorrect; senior ministers in President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s cabinet have correctly described the election and the TNA win as a victory for democracy, and expressed their readiness to work with the new set-up in the North. The real test, though, begins now. The government must respect the TNA’s mandate. It should not resist the power-sharing with the Council that is provided under the 13th Amendment, and must begin to seriously consider progressive devolution on police and land. It would also do well to rethink its project on scrapping or diluting the constitutional provision for devolution. For its part, the TNA must avoid the urge to over-interpret its mandate. Steering clear of the extreme nationalist pronouncements by Tamil diaspora organisations, it has made a good start by stating that its victory represents the wish of the people for adequate self-rule within a united and undivided Sri Lanka. The massive preferential mandate for its chief ministerial candidate, C.V. Wigneswaran, who made clear his moderate views and desire for a constructive partnership with Colombo, is a clear sign that the people of Northern Sri Lanka are with him.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/testing-time-for-jaffna-colombo/article5161198.ece
24,9,2013,Welcome on board,"Within months of entering into a three-way joint venture with Air Asia and Telestra Tradeplace Pvt. Ltd. to start a low-cost domestic airline, the Tata group has now joined hands with Singapore Airlines to launch a full-service airline. Back in the late-1990s, a similar deal was almost clinched but the government of the day dithered and both partners bailed out. At a time when competition in the skies has intensified so much, there must be good reason for the two partners to have come together again to launch a new airline. Evidently, they believe there is potential in air traffic in India — both domestic and international. The Tata group has made it clear that its commitment to Air Asia remains and that the latter was aware that it was finalising a new deal. Tatas will hold a 51 per cent stake in the new airline, which will take quite some time to really take off. Considering that the late J.R.D. Tata was the founder of Air India before it became a government-owned undertaking, a return to the aviation sector makes sense and provides an additional dimension to the expanding Tata empire under a new leadership. Similarly, Singapore, which has been looking at India closely since 1991, finally gets its premier airline to partner a trusted ‘friend.’
While the Jet Airways-Etihad deal focuses entirely on West Asia and Europe, the new partnership will most likely turn its attention towards building momentum towards Southeast and East Asia, as well as the west coast of the U.S. Airlines the world over have understood the traffic and tourist potential of India in particular, and Asia in general. Businessmen, tourists, and students from India are exploring farther and newer destinations. For the Tata group, just as the Air Asia venture should give it a firm footing in the domestic sector by reaching out to tier two and tier three towns, the partnership with SIA will help it establish itself as a vital connector between Indian metropolises and major international routes. Given its reach and reputation, Singapore Airlines is sure to bring value to this partnership. In terms of management, expertise, and facilities, both Tata and SIA could and should provide good value for passengers. Whether or not Kingfisher airlines returns to the skies, it looks like its space could very easily be filled by the proposed airline. It would also make sense for Singapore investors to take up two of the six major airports to be privatised in India, including Chennai, which is a gateway to the East.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/welcome-on-board/article5161201.ece
30,9,2013,Voluntarily mandatory,"The Supreme Court’s interim order making it clear that no person should be disadvantaged because she does not possess an ‘Aadhaar’ card may appear to address the basic question in the average citizen’s mind as to whether this card is mandatory or voluntary. In reality, there is no doubt about its voluntary nature. At the same time, registration of citizens is indeed mandatory. It is a sign of the confusion that marks governance in the country that there is lack of conceptual clarity among the people about what Aadhaar is, how it is related to the population register and whether having a number is essential to receive benefits, subsidies and entitlements. To put matters in perspective, Aadhaar is a number, not a card, given by the Unique Identification Authority of India. The long queues that one sees in the neighbourhood for enrolment and capture of photographs and biometric data are meant for the National Population Register administered by the Registrar-General and Census Commissioner of India. The NPR data is sent to the UIDAI for generation of Aadhar numbers, and, if one already has such a number given earlier by UIDAI, it is ‘de-duplicated’. Enrolment in the NPR is mandatory under the Citizenship Act, whereas getting an Aadhaar number is voluntary.
Some authorities have done great mischief by linking delivery of services and transfers to the possession of an Aadhaar number; for example, the subsidy for cooking gas cylinders will be available only to those who have linked their Aadhaar numbers with their bank accounts and gas agencies. This has caused understandable alarm. The issues before the Supreme Court pertain to the UIDAI scheme and not to the NPR, although the legality of taking biometrics, a feature of the Register, is also under challenge. There are serious questions concerning the possible invasion of privacy when one parts with personal information and images of irises and fingerprints, especially in an era of transnational snooping and digital crime. Further, the present legal framework provides only for taking photographs but not biometric data. Linking the Aadhaar number to benefits and services is also causing great hardship. Some contend that unverified allotment of Aadhaar numbers poses a threat to national security, and the Supreme Court now wants to ensure that immigrants lacking proper documents do not get them. But insistence on documentary proof from the poor and homeless may lead to denial of benefits to a significant segment of the population. The ongoing case gives the country an opportunity to revisit its entire policy on identification and registration so that the twin objectives of knowing who a citizen is and ensuring effective delivery of services are not undermined.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/voluntarily-mandatory/article5182756.ece
30,9,2013,Curiosity can’t kill life on Mars,"As if the news on earth weren’t depressing enough, the latest dispatches from Mars are also gloomy. It turns out the red planet doesn’t have any atmospheric methane. Earthlings longing for inter-galactic companionship may have to set their sights elsewhere, for the gas is an important chemical signature of microbial activity. On earth, more than 90 per cent of methane is produced by living organisms. A series of tests conducted by Curiosity, NASA’s rover on Mars, indicates an insignificant amount of methane on the planet: 1.3 parts per billion by volume. This tiny amount — about six times lower than previous estimates — greatly “reduces the probability” of ongoing microbial activity and, possibly, of any microbial life in the past. The results, published in Science, come as a surprise as a series of observations made from satellites and earth-bound telescopes had found evidence of higher amounts of methane. But some of these studies were mired in controversy, and recent measurements had lowered the upper limit. Although most of the studies found seasonal abundance or sudden spikes, it has not been established that the spikes were associated with seasons on a repetitive basis. Also, given that the methane molecule has a lifetime of about 300-600 years in the atmosphere, its near absence is a setback for seekers of life on Mars.
The consolation, however, is that its absence does not automatically rule out the existence of life. Even on earth, not all organisms necessarily produce methane. Unlike the evidence collected earlier, every find of Curiosity has strengthened the possibility that Mars had been a habitable environment in the past. Two definite, separate sources have confirmed the presence of liquid water, the most essential prerequisite for habitability. The presence of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen has further increased the habitability quotient. Going by this, more tests at several other locations need to be undertaken before methane’s absence can be fully confirmed. Aside from further tests by Curiosity, the 2016 launch of the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter by the European Space Agency and Curiosity’s successor in 2020 may possibly settle the matter. The search for life on Mars has been based on our understanding of life as seen on earth. While all life forms on earth are based on carbon, science does not rule out the tantalising possibility of silicon-based organisms in our universe, though the theme has held more attraction for sci-fi writers than scientists. One thing’s for sure: such is our fascination for other forms of life that the search for extraterrestrials will never end. Let’s just call it curiosity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/curiosity-cant-kill-life-on-mars/article5182757.ece
1,10,2013,The ghost returns,"Sixteen years after Lalu Prasad lost his Chief Ministership to the Rs. 950 crore Bihar fodder scam, the ghost has returned to deal him a second staggering blow. Ironically, the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief’s conviction, along with 44 others, in the Chaibasa treasury case, comes at a time when his political career appeared to be on the mend. The Chaibasa case, which is related to the withdrawal from the State treasury of Rs. 37 crore, is one of six fodder-related cases against Mr. Prasad and the first in which the verdict has been pronounced. The fodder scam was of epic scale, with a plot so byzantine that it took investigators years to comprehend the full extent of the loot, how it was executed and how many people participated in it. What started as a minor case of embezzlement in the mid-1970s, grew in size over the next two decades, and finally burst into the open as a huge scandal involving ministers, bureaucrats and even sections of the Opposition. The conviction of 45 persons in just one of the cases is indicative of the size of the theft and its spread.
The tragedy is all the more for the dazzling start to Mr. Prasad’s political career and the promise his advent held to an underclass crushed by the double burden of poverty and upper caste oppression. Such was the hopelessness in which Bihar was caught that Mr. Prasad was able to make a virtue of just the fact that he had given his people swar (voice). Unfortunately for the State he ruled, that was all he did. Bihar became a basket case even as politicians and bureaucrats exploited its wealth to feather their own nests. In the event, his fall was as dramatic as his rise. By May 1997, the CBI had closed in on him, leading to his arrest and removal from office in July of the same year. What followed was the bizarre drama of Mr. Prasad installing his wife Rabri Devi as Chief Minister with her as his proxy. It was against this backdrop that Nitish Kumar finally dethroned the man whom he once mentored. Today, Mr. Kumar himself is in trouble, having exited his successful alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party. For Mr. Prasad, the break-up was just the opportunity he needed to get back into the political reckoning. He would have likely succeeded in the plan had the UPA government pushed through the ordinance aimed at preventing the disqualification of lawmakers. But the past has a way of catching up. With Rahul Gandhi’s public fulminations scuttling the proposed ordinance, Mr. Prasad has been left with no escape but to face up to the reality of the conviction and return to a life of political oblivion.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-ghost-returns/article5186861.ece
1,10,2013,Lessons from the Nairobi attack,"Al-Shabab’s brazen attack on the Westgate mall in Nairobi, which killed at least 62 civilians, reflects poorly on the international community’s efforts to stabilise Somalia. While joining hands to eliminate the Shabab, a terror network that has fed off a failed state, several African nations have invited its wrath home. Shabab has become increasingly desperate, and thus dangerous, in the asymmetric war its diffused cadres have fought since 2008 against the ill-equipped peacekeeping forces of the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM). The al-Qaeda affiliated group’s assault on one of the most affluent and cosmopolitan neighbourhoods in Kenya may seem audacious but is not surprising. The Kenyan Defence Forces have faced regular casualties since launching a bold attack on al-Shabab’s stronghold in southern Somalia a couple years ago. The KDF won a decisive victory in 2012, when it drove the group from its stronghold and financial nerve centre in Kismayo — but in hindsight, the jubilation seems premature. Nairobi should have heeded the lessons Uganda has learnt from its protracted involvement with AMISOM. In 2010, al-Shabab had dispatched suicide bombers to venues in Kampala screening the FIFA World Cup final, killing 74 civilians. Those bombings significantly reduced the Ugandan appetite for keeping the peace in Somalia. Now, the Shabab has turned to Kenya in an effort to intimidate its government and civil society.
President Uhuru Kenyatta, who lost a family member to the attack, has responded sternly and sagaciously, emphasising Kenya will not “retreat into a closed, fearful and fractured” society. Mr. Kenyatta now needs to back his words with action. It is Nairobi’s responsibility to ensure ethnic Somalis in Kenya, who have been subject to attacks in the past, do not suffer reprisals. As a major power that plays host to many international organisations and foreign companies, Kenya must also take steps to ensure the safety of foreign nationals. The Shabab’s latest attack is also a reminder that the gains Kenya has made in Somalia can only be consolidated if it pursues a robust domestic counterterrorism policy. Its border with Somalia, which has also faced its share of Shabab attacks, is extremely porous; Kenya must regulate, but not restrict, trans-border movement through this region. Above all is the imperative to sustain a strong, U.N.-mandated multilateral presence in Somalia till the government in Mogadishu can find its feet. Kenya’s assurance that it will not pull its troops in light of the mall attack is welcome but it must work with the Somali government and respect its sovereign rights. AMISOM’s troop-contributing countries, which do not have the financial wherewithal to sustain an indefinite military presence, must coordinate their domestic and international efforts to neutralise the Shabab’s threat.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lessons-from-the-nairobi-attack/article5186860.ece
2,10,2013,Not by single summits alone,"Looking for a “substantive” outcome from every India-Pakistan meeting has become something of a habit that both sides could well do without. This newspaper has long argued that meetings between the political leaders of the two countries should be held regularly even if nothing comes out of them only for the reason that they convey the leadership’s commitment to peaceful engagement. Over the last nine years, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has regrettably kept putting off visiting Pakistan because it could not be crowned with a momentous announcement. Last week’s meeting between him and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif should have rightfully taken place in Islamabad. Still, it is no small achievement that the Indian side did not back out of the New York talks given the political pressure to do so, and considering that on earlier occasions, it has crumbled under such pressure. Indeed, relations between the two sides are in such an immature phase that it was just as well that this summit ended with the modest agreement to safeguard the ceasefire through increased field level military contacts. It should now be obvious that normalisation is not going to be achieved over a single summit. Even though both sides have leaders with a grand vision of India-Pakistan relations, neither has the courage or the appetite for a grand bargain. But uninterrupted dialogue at high levels might lead to smaller, incremental steps that in turn could result in improvements on the ground. The new ‘liberalised’ visa regime, though still far from liberal or perfect, is the result of such an incremental process.
Such being the reality, it is entirely commendable that the two sides reiterated their commitment to the ceasefire, as even this was in grave doubt just a month ago. Now close to its 10th anniversary, the Line of Control ceasefire has been the most dramatic achievement of India-Pakistan relations in this century. Aside from unsoldierly incidents on the LoC emanating from the Pakistani side, on India’s other concerns — terrorism directed against it from Pakistan, the snail’s pace in prosecuting those involved in the Mumbai attacks — New Delhi must keep the engagement going to ensure Islamabad delivers on its assurances. With the Taliban on the ascendant in north-west Pakistan, Prime Minister Sharif is yet to find his feet in Islamabad. Eventually, the best hope for better relations between South Asia’s two big countries lies in the strengthening of Pakistan’s democracy. Not much is left of his term, but the Indian Prime Minister should keep his hand of friendship toward the democratically elected government in Islamabad firmly extended.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/not-by-single-summits-alone/article5190519.ece
2,10,2013,Backwardness counts,"A panel headed by Raghuram Rajan has recommended a new way of determining the backwardness of States for the purpose of deciding how much each State should receive as its share of Central funds. States constantly vie with each other to get more funds from the Centre by simply claiming that they are more backward than others. The present exercise began in the backdrop of States like Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand arguing that the old ways of determining the share of Central funds were outdated and needed to be reviewed. The Finance Minister had admitted in Parliament that certain categorisations were not so relevant today. For instance, India has historically had special category States, constituted by the backward hill regions, which also shared international borders. These States received higher grants for development from the beginning of the Five Year Plan process. But in recent decades, some of these States like Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and a few in the North-East have done very well for themselves and their per capita incomes are twice that of Bihar and way higher than those of Odisha and Madhya Pradesh. The Rajan Committee was set up to look at a more rational way of determining backwardness. It has proposed an index of backwardness comprising 10 equally-weighted indicators such as monthly per capita expenditure, education, health, poverty rate, female literacy, percentage of SC/ST population and so on. As per this index, the most developed States are Goa, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand and Haryana. The least developed, or most backward, States are Odisha, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.
In between the most developed and the least developed is the middling category where Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat are placed. If the recommendations of this Committee are accepted then the transfer of funds from the Centre to the States will have to follow a new pattern. So far, the Central assistance to State plans has been disbursed according to the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula that gives highest weightage to population and poverty ratio. The transfer of taxes from the Central pool is decided every five years by the Finance Commission based on another set of criteria. Then there is the Backward Region Grant Fund under which special assistance is given to backward areas that are in need of funds. Any new method of disbursing funds would be politically fraught because some States might lose while others gain. So implementing the new formula will require a lot of political will, which the current regime cannot muster. The new government after June 2014 is best placed to examine the implementation of the new recommendations, if at all.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/backwardness-counts/article5190520.ece
3,10,2013,"Not again, Mr. Shinde","Sushil Kumar Shinde would help the cause of Muslims a lot more if he spoke a little less. In February this year, the Union Home Minister declaimed on ‘Hindu terror,’ when the correct expression should have been Hindutva-linked terror. The remarks caused an uproar that needlessly returned attention to ‘Muslim terror,’ a phrase as offensive and inaccurate as ‘Hindu terror.’ There was substance in what Mr. Shinde meant to convey — that a Hindutva connection had surfaced in some terror acts earlier attributed to ‘Muslims.’ But the heat generated by his comments left no room for a realistic evaluation of the state of terror investigation in this country. The minister has now done an encore with his letter to Chief Ministers cautioning them against wrongful detention of innocent Muslim youths in the name of fighting terror. The Bharatiya Janata Party has predictably accused Mr. Shinde of going against the spirit of the Constitution and dividing the country on religious lines. The minister need not have made a case for “innocent Muslims.” The cause for justice would have been fully served even if he had only stressed the need for impartial and thorough investigation leading up to efficient and speedy trials. Because this is the key to ensuring no innocent person is harassed. And this is also the key to preventing vendetta policing and investigation against innocent Muslims.
The unfortunate truth is that Muslims are the first to be picked up in the aftermath of a terrorist strike. Anti-terror squads conduct ‘combing operations’ in Muslim neighbourhoods and what follows is the by-now well- documented nightmare of illegal detention, torture and forced confessions followed by denial of bail and years in prison. Case after case has ended in acquittal because of shoddy investigation, of course, but also often because the terror accused were never involved in the crime in the first place. Over the years, biases have got entrenched in the policing mechanism which can only be corrected by professionalising investigation and incorporating forensics and other scientific tools to minimise error and narrow down suspects. The Supreme Court, in the D.K. Basu case, laid down detailed guidelines for detention procedures to reduce the scope of arbitrary arrests and custodial torture. It should surprise no one that the guidelines are rarely, if at all, observed. The tragedy with Muslims is that the system that treats them as suspects is also conditioned to stymieing measures aimed at their rehabilitation. What Muslim youth need is genuine equality before the law, something that is often denied them. Sadly, Mr. Shinde’s statement makes it sound as if they need to be shown some special favour.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/not-again-mr-shinde/article5193660.ece
3,10,2013,"Don’t hang up on peace, Mr. Obama","A 15-minute telephone call may not seem like much but when this represents the first direct conversation between the Presidents of Iran and the United States in 34 years, the world is bound to sit up and take notice. To get a sense of the historical significance, consider this: the last time the highest political executives from the two countries conversed was in 1979, when Jimmy Carter was U.S. President and the Shah of Iran had not yet been deposed. By all accounts, last week’s chat, which was conducted through an interpreter, was cordial, with Barack Obama reportedly expressing “deep respect” for the people of Iran, and Hassan Rouhani apparently calling the U.S. a “great nation.” While such formal remarks are common in exchanges between heads of state or government, the context makes the discussion a potentially transformative event. The public suspicion and animosity which have obtained between Washington and Tehran for the past three decades have been among the major causes of political deadlock and worse in Central and West Asia, with gross allegations and insults traded to the point where successive U.S. administrations have often seemed to be about to attack Iran. While much is yet to be addressed by both parties — even who called whom appears to be unclear — the very fact that the two Presidents talked with each other must be welcomed.
Both leaders are already facing resistance in their own countries and the path that lies ahead is difficult. President Rouhani has indicated his willingness to meet legitimate western concerns about his country’s nuclear programme but he will not be able to carry his own domestic critics unless Mr. Obama can undo a part of the unilateral sanctions Washington has imposed on Iran. Early indications are not promising. Not only does the U.S. President lack the ability to push Congress, many of whose members remain implacably opposed to any dealing with the Islamic Republic, but he himself seems unconvinced of pursuing such a goal. Indeed, his belief that sanctions have pushed Tehran towards a more open approach is undercutting the very logic of détente before the process has even begun. Secondly, Iran’s greatest regional rival, Saudi Arabia, will be very concerned about the Obama-Rouhani call, as will Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. Israel was informed in advance but Bibi can be counted upon to try and throw a spanner in the works. To be sure, Mr. Rouhani faces his own uncertainties too. Nevertheless, his presidency has created the best chance in decades to start diminishing the mutual bitterness that has soured relations between Iran and the U.S. Having taken a cautious step forward, the U.S. must not waste this chance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dont-hang-up-on-peace-mr-obama/article5193661.ece
4,10,2013,Taking interest in transparency,"The Reserve Bank of India has taken the high moral ground in directing commercial banks to desist from certain “pernicious practices,” which, in its view, “deter consumer protection and accounting integrity.” At the core of its directives is the fairly widespread practice of certain banks which offer retail loans at “zero per cent” interest to purchase high value consumer durables such as LCD TV sets, smart phones, high-end refrigerators and the like. Arguing that there is no such thing as an interest free loan, the RBI has laid down guidelines that will make a large swathe of retail lending by banks more transparent. Lending banks should use their clout with the dealers of consumer durables to get the best possible bargains and, equally importantly, pass on those benefits to their borrowers in a transparent manner. There are special reasons why such seemingly pedestrian advice is warranted. Subvention, a kind of subsidy that manufacturers offer, as well as a moratorium on payment, are fairly common practices to boost sales. There has been a disquieting tendency among banks of not giving their customers information on the full extent of these concessions. Even more unacceptable has been the practice of part-loading these to the interest rate charged to make the latter appear lower. Banks have now been asked to pass on the benefits to their consumers “fully and indiscriminately” without camouflaging them in the form of lower interest rates. Thus a discount on the price should automatically mean a lower quantum of loan. Repayment of the loan should commence only after the moratorium period.
Equally undesirable are the related practices of zero percent EMI schemes on outstanding credit card balances. Here again, zero interest is a misnomer as borrowers are charged a processing fee. Canons of transparency require all such fees — processing as well as others — to be uniform across all products and segments. Finally, no fee should be charged on debit card transactions. The RBI guidelines are welcome and, in many cases especially relating to credit card usage, overdue. Transparency in lending is a welcome trait and the authorities should encourage banks to move towards complete disclosure. The directive could, however, deal a deadly blow to consumer durable sales, which generally peak during the festival season, just round the corner. Yet, from an overall perspective, consumer protection is probably more important than a short-term dip in sales of consumer durables, which will rebound over time anyway. By seeking to make expensive products affordable to even those who cannot really afford it, the “zero-interest” schemes, which were not really that, were drawing consumers into a debt-trap. It is just as well that the RBI stepped in.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/taking-interest-in-transparency/article5197635.ece
4,10,2013,For the next wave,"The importance of maritime transportation to India’s economic development cannot be overstated, given that the country has a coastline exceeding 7,550 km. The government finally seems to be waking up to the potential that water-borne transport holds for domestic cargo movement. The Ministry of Shipping has given a fillip to sea-borne domestic trade by allowing vessels that could hitherto ply only in rivers and other inland waters to operate in waters along the coast, within a baseline and where waves do not rise more than two metres. Coastal shipping offers distinct advantages, which include lower operating costs and less environmental pollution than surface options. The Ministry’s move follows a series of initiatives easing restrictions on the sector. The government had earlier notified all waters within the baseline around the coast as Internal Waters under the Maritime Zones of India Act, in order to streamline and regulate shipping traffic that tended to hug the coast, as also to facilitate the operation of inland vessels along these waters.
Linking inland water trade and sea trade through coastal ships could provide alternative means of unloading and transporting cargo from ships docked at sea, to both inland destinations and to smaller ports. Vessels that are built to meet river-sea requirements need very little depth to sail and dock. Smaller vessels can also be built and operated at lower cost. But such benefits can be reaped only if the government provides logistics support. The development of small ports, warehousing facilities, and container freight infrastructure, as well as inter-modal connectivity, are extremely important for its success. Fleet strengths will need to grow: the Indian shipping industry accounts for just about one per cent of the global fleet. Meanwhile, inland waterways that extend to 14,500 km should be developed. India’s transport infrastructure requires a substantial facelift, considering higher than average traffic growth projected along several industrial corridors. A dynamic system of “sea highways” connecting a network of ports along with a sophisticated inland water transport system could complement the land-bound transport network. A lot of the production and consumption centres being land-locked, road transport will continue to serve a crucial role. But the dependence on road and rail could be reduced by diverting a sizeable chunk of cargo movement to coastal shipping. The government must ponder strategies to effectively develop the coastal shipping industry. A relatively modest investment with appropriate policy changes could bring substantial dividends.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/for-the-next-wave/article5197637.ece
5,10,2013,Looking ahead on Telangana,"With the Union Cabinet clearing the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana is one big step closer to realisation. But like any partition, this too will come with pain, dislocation, anxiety and anger. A new State might not have been the best of solutions to address the inequities of development in the region, but it became politically inevitable after a prolonged, intense agitation by large sections of the people. Not surprisingly, the people of coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema have adopted similar tactics in opposition to the bifurcation, forcing a shutdown of Seemandhra. Though their movement has been peaceful, there is a danger of violence gaining political legitimacy, thanks to the muddled and opportunist thinking of the Congress-led UPA government at the Centre which rushed to put the Cabinet’s seal of approval without bothering to deliberate over proposals to safeguard the legitimate concerns of Seemandhra. Whether it leaned towards granting statehood to Telangana, or stepped back in favour of the status quo, the Centre’s reasoning and actions seemed inspired by petty electoral-political calculations. Depending on the dominant popular mood, the UPA government has swung one way, then another, each time lacking the conviction needed to carry a difficult decision forward.
But now that the creation of Telangana is almost a fait accompli, those opposed to the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh should focus on their specific concerns such as the status of the capital Hyderabad, the sharing of Krishna and Godavari waters, free movement of goods and people between the two States, and the protection of lives and means of livelihood. The political options of those opposed to the new State are rather limited. Given that the powers are concentrated in the hands of the Centre when it comes to creation of new States, much will depend on the attitude of the two national parties, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party. Both are now backing the creation of Telangana. Parties covertly or overtly opposed to Telangana such as the Telugu Desam Party and the YSR Congress might not be able to influence the course of events even if they are elected in large numbers to the State Assembly and the Lok Sabha in 2014. The imperative now is to ensure that the process of bifurcation is smooth, and that the concerns of coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema are taken into account. Besides allowing for Hyderabad as a shared capital for a period of 10 years, the Centre must ensure that this city, which remains the most contentious issue for the two sides, remains accessible to both Telangana and the residuary Andhra Pradesh as a source of employment for their people and revenue generation for their governments. The people of Seemandhra must press ahead with hope, and not look back in anger or regret.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/looking-ahead-on-telangana/article5201720.ece
5,10,2013,"An election, interrupted","After a promising start to the presidential elections in the Maldives, the fledgling democracy is floundering once again. The country’s Supreme Court has put on hold indefinitely a run-off that was scheduled for September 28 as it considers a petition by a candidate eliminated after the first round held earlier in the month. Mohammed Nasheed, who was ousted as President in controversial circumstances in February 2012, and is a candidate of the Maldivian Democratic Party, polled 45.45 per cent of the vote in the first round, while Abdulla Yaameen, a candidate of former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom’s Progressive Party of Maldives, was placed a distant second. Under the Maldivian Constitution, when no candidate wins more than 50 per cent votes, a run-off between the first two candidates must be held within three weeks. All poll processes have to be completed, and a new President named by October 10, one month before the constitutionally mandated day of assuming office, in this case November 11. More than 100 international observers stationed in the Maldives, including three of India’s former Chief Election Commissioners, commended the poll process and declared it to be free and fair. While the Supreme Court must address any grievances over the conduct of the polls, the delay in deciding the complaint of electoral fraud has given rise to speculation, rumours and political tension. It has also given room for doubts about the genuineness of the complaint.
The situation is especially delicate as the Constitution makes no provision for a scenario in which an election is interrupted and the office of the President cannot be filled by the deadline. The incumbent President Mohamed Waheed Hassan can continue in office until then with full powers but there is bound to be uncertainty thereafter. Mr. Nasheed, who is expected to win the run-off if and when it is held, is understandably concerned. The former President believes Mr. Waheed, who was his Vice-President, was in the plot to remove him. The MDP’s other concern is that in these elections Mr. Waheed is on the side of the PPM candidate. Worried about the fall-out of any instability in the Indian Ocean nation, the international community, led by India, has urged that the elections be completed. Unless the Supreme Court quickly disposes of the case before it, resolving the complaint to the satisfaction of all parties to it, and directs the Elections Commission to complete polling in adherence to the provisions of the Constitution, the Maldives appears headed for another spell of instability.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-election-interrupted/article5201788.ece
7,10,2013,Bicycle phobia,"The prohibition imposed on bicycle riding and use of non-motorised transport in 174 designated roads of Kolkata during most hours of the workday or round-the-clock is undemocratic, environmentally retrograde and out of sync with modern urban transport planning. At a time when global cities are thinking beyond the car and popularising shared bicycle systems, the law enforcement machinery in West Bengal’s capital has chosen to go the opposite way, in order to create more space for powered vehicles. The police order on bicycles and non-motorised vehicles has inflicted misery and financial pain on tens of thousands of workers who use this humble mode of transport to go about their job. Many are involved in the delivery of essential articles such as milk, letters and medicines. They do not add to the already unsustainable fuel import bill and cause no pollution. West Bengal has 11.47 million households with bicycles as per Census 2011, second only to Uttar Pradesh, where the figure is nearly double. The impact of the ‘ban’ in Kolkata is therefore bound to be staggering, more so as urban households form almost a fourth of these families. The outrage in the community over the intolerant decision and the protests calling for its revocation are fully justified.
The move to effectively banish the bicycle from large parts of ‘Calcutta’ is particularly ironic, since Asansol was the home of Sen-Raleigh, among the iconic brands of bicycles made in post-independence India. Bicycles as a mainstream transport option are under threat today, as it is difficult and risky to ride them in crowded cities. This is reflected in the dip in the number of urban households that have one by four percentage points, to 41.9 per cent, compared to a decade ago. The National Urban Transport Policy has made little headway in addressing the concerns of cyclists and pedestrians. The urban planning record stands in contrast to what is happening in the developed countries, and even emerging nations in Latin America. Curitiba in Brazil, for instance, is creating a microgrid of roads for bicycle connectivity, to benefit workers. New York, with a history of ‘class conflicts’ in allocation of road space, has struck a blow for cyclists with the launch of a bike-sharing programme. Regrettably, none of these progressive models seems to appeal to Indian policymakers, who promote car use to the exclusion of other modes. Even the settled legal principle of ‘polluter pays’ has been ignored in Kolkata. The Trinamool Congress government must remember that there is powerful symbolism associated with the bicycle worldwide, as a vehicle of freedom from tyranny. It should stop oppressing those who impose no costs on the city and perform an economic function in the greenest manner possible.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bicycle-phobia/article5207431.ece
7,10,2013,Making faith relevant,"Pope Francis may have been an unlikely successor to Pope Benedict XVI, but he is already emerging as a remarkable pontiff, one who has always led a simple life himself, who understands the kinds of lives led by many Roman Catholics, and who also knows the dangers of a remote clergy apparently more concerned with specific forms of orthodoxy than with the mission of providing a spiritual space for all of the faithful in our complex and troubled times. That the Church of Rome faces serious problems is clear, with declining attendance and a shrinking priesthood, especially in developed countries, with widening rifts between followers’ attitudes in the developed and developing worlds, and with terrible scandals of child sex abuse, corruption, and incompetence which would have destroyed many a lesser institution. The Pope’s fellow priests probably know that very well, but the way His Holiness has responded to the situation is making the world sit up and take note.
In an interview with the Italian Jesuit magazine La Civiltà Cattolica, which has been translated and republished in the American Jesuit journal America, the pontiff says the Church is “the community of God’s people.” Therefore, one of its first tasks is to recognise “how human beings understand themselves today.” The Pope had already made waves by replying to a question on gay priests, “Who am I to judge?” but now he has gone further, saying that the Church must not “interfere spiritually” in the lives of gays and lesbians and that priests must not be obsessed with homosexuality, abortion, and contraception to the neglect of their wider mission, which is to proclaim and spread the “saving love of God.” Even the way that is done could be radically reformed; Pope Francis says local doctrinal issues are best addressed by local bishops’ conferences, with the Vatican available for consultation. Furthermore, the pontiff is clear about a stronger role for women: “the feminine genius is needed wherever we make important decisions.” Just as radically, on September 22, the Pope told 20,000 listeners in Sardinia that the world must abandon its “idolatry of greed” and reform the global financial system. Significantly, the Pope has not proposed changing the church’s line on homosexuality, contraception, and abortion — or on women priests — but he has reminded all the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics that if they do not end their obsession with those issues and start acknowledging humanity as it is today, the Church’s moral edifice could fall “like a house of cards.” For Roman Catholicism, His Holiness may well be a truly world-historic figure.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/making-faith-relevant/article5207432.ece
8,10,2013,A general’s move,"There are three ways to interpret General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani’s announcement that he will retire when his extended tenure as Chief of the Pakistan Army ends on November 29. First, that he intends to wield power in some other capacity, such as National Security Adviser. Second, that he is placing the corporate interest of the military — which cannot afford too long a disruption in its natural system of succession — above the personal. Or third, that the civilian government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has made it clear there will be no further extension. Any which way, his exit is set to be the most graceful in Pakistan’s recent history. Six years ago, General Kayani gave himself the task of rebuilding his Army’s image, severely dented by the unpopularity of his predecessor, Pervez Musharraf. He succeeded to a great extent, such that even after Osama bin Laden was killed in a raid by U.S. commandos in Abbottabad, nationally little blame attached to the Pakistan Army for not having discovered the world’s most wanted man earlier. Under him, the military seemingly distanced itself from the U.S., its patron-in-chief, while the 2008-2013 Pakistan People’s Party government was blamed for ‘selling out’ to it. Most of all, General Kayani managed to give the impression of a COAS who, despite the opportunities thrown at him by an inept government, stayed away from the temptation to take charge. The reality, though, is that post-Musharraf, the Army knows it is not easy to run Pakistan, and that on matters close to its heart, power can be wielded from behind the scenes, leaving the civilian rulers to take the blame when things go wrong.
What General Kayani could not accomplish, however, was a course correction in the Pakistan Army’s opportunistic outlook towards terrorism. He said often enough that his country’s main enemies were terrorism and the militancy within, but it is under his watch that the Taliban and Haqqani network have stepped up their murderous campaign in Afghanistan, the ceasefire along the LoC with India has come under strain, and groups like the Jamaat-ud-Dawa continue to thrive. Of course, these squalid tactical pursuits cannot hide General Kayani’s biggest failing: despite its men and establishments coming under repeated attack by jihadi groups, the Pakistan military and its leadership proved incapable of grasping the fundamental reality that there is no good and bad terrorism but a metastasised malignancy that has to be fought regardless of whether its target is Pakistan, the U.S., Afghanistan or India. General Kayani’s decision to retire gracefully is good for democracy and the Pakistan Army. But unless his successor is willing to grasp this nettle, the cancer of terror will continue to destroy Pakistan.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-generals-move/article5211013.ece
8,10,2013,Take child’s play seriously,"After a long and painful period of neglect, India promises to devote attention to the issue of preparing all children for primary schooling. The National Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) policy recently approved by the Union Cabinet aims to end the current laissez faire situation that has led to the mushrooming of expensive crèches, play schools, nursery schools and so on that adhere to no particular standard. On the other hand, there is the major public programme, the Integrated Child Development Services with a national footprint, but patchy outcomes. Policies are only as good as the institutional arrangements they make and the devices that they employ to bring about compliance. The ECCE policy will cover 158.7 million children in the 0 to 6 year age group. The government shall, it says, provide universal access for three sub-stages of childhood between ages 0 and 6 to health, nutrition, age-appropriate care, stimulation and early learning in a protective and enabling environment. There is stated intent to raise funding, set standards and monitor progress. So far, in spite of sustained economic growth, there has been no dramatic change in the proportion of undernourished children. It was the same in 2005-06, as measured by the National Family Health Survey-3, as in 1998-99. It is crucial, therefore, for the new policy to look at the allocation of funds carefully, and prevent profit-seeking actors from skimming off what is meant to create better anganwadi centres, provide standard materials for a play-based curriculum and good nutrition. Reliance on private partners to achieve universal access, equity and inclusion would be misplaced.
Discussions between the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the States on the ECCE policy should continue for its success across public, private and voluntary sectors, and to achieve convergence of multiple policies and schemes. That is also vital for the promised regulatory framework to work smoothly. That there are challenges is evident from the finding of the Comptroller and Auditor General: in 13 States, the performance of the ICDS over a five-year period from 2006 in the delivery of supplementary nutrition and pre-school education — two key goals — was depressingly poor. Infrastructure was so weak that 52 per cent of the anganwadi centres had no toilet and 32 per cent no drinking water. The programme has languished in spite of the Supreme Court’s intervention since 2001 to universalise and upgrade the ICDS, showing deplorable lack of commitment across the political spectrum. There are positive elements to the policy, such as prioritising mother tongue or language spoken at home, followed by exposure to oral English and regional languages. It must work to strengthen the national rights-based discourse on child development.

9,10,2013,The wrong way to fight terror,"Whatever the tactical gains from its recent commando raids on terrorist targets in Libya and Somalia, the United States needs to reflect on the strategic costs that such ‘surgical strikes’ impose on the target countries, the wider region and, ultimately, on itself. That such strikes are sometimes successful — as with the capture of Nazih Abdul-Hamed al Ruqai in Libya — should not lure the U.S. or the international community into believing the war on terror can be won from the skies. Governments in Yemen, Somalia and Libya have been struggling to combat al-Qaeda and its affiliates because they lack the requisite capabilities on the ground — to secure their borders and police their territories. Drone attacks or covert raids by the U.S. that take out a terrorist or two will not stem extremist violence in these countries or make them any less attractive for terrorist groups. On the contrary, they will foment further instability — and if civilian casualties are involved, resentment against the regime — resulting in safe havens for organisations like al-Qaeda. What’s more, such strikes leave local and regional governments to fend against potential retaliation for themselves. U.S. efforts, then, should not be aimed at bypassing these states but at bolstering their counter-terrorism skills.
It is not a coincidence that the U.S. also finds itself on a slippery slope, using methods unconstrained by national law and disrespectful of international law to pursue national security objectives. During his term, President Barack Obama has deployed covert military force with alacrity, whether through drone strikes, cyber-attacks or Navy SEAL raids. For someone whose first campaign promised greater probity in executive action, Mr. Obama has been content to let the end justify his means. No matter the intelligence behind the strikes in Libya, the U.S. ought to have realised the political cost of staging an attack without the consent of its internationally recognised government. Tripoli’s strong protest against the action of American military forces underlines a troubling question. If regime change, Libyan style, has not created a situation in which the U.S. can operate in tandem with the government for a goal that surely both officially subscribe to, surely there is something seriously wrong with the wider American approach to the region. Regardless of his faults, and there were many, the former Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi was at least the master of his territory. By overthrowing him and destroying all institutions of national authority, the U.S. and its allies did al-Qaeda a huge favour. The same mistake is in danger of being repeated in Syria too.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-wrong-way-to-fight-terror/article5214796.ece
9,10,2013,The right to safe abortions,"With the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act coming into effect in 1972, India conveyed a strong message that it cared for the health of pregnant women who wanted to safely terminate their pregnancies. Yet, even four decades later, many women are still unaware that abortion is legal. Even access to safe abortion centres is severely restricted, especially in rural areas. As a result, there is a great mismatch between the number of abortion seekers and MTP-certified providers and centres. According to a 2008 study in Contraception journal, nearly three-quarters of abortion-certified facilities are in the private sector. Add to this the stigma and discrimination that women seeking abortion face, and it is not surprising that a large number of women still turn to unskilled providers to perform abortions using unsafe methods in unsuitable settings. In 2010-11, over six lakh abortions took place in government-approved institutions. The number of unsafe abortions taking place every year is not known. According to a 2008 WHO report, about “two thirds of all abortions” that take place in the country are outside authorised health facilities. As a result, abortions cause an estimated eight per cent of maternal deaths in India — a majority of which are due to unsafe procedures — according to the Registrar General of India’s data.
To complicate the situation further, the Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act, 1994 meant to prevent sex determination to avert female foeticide can work at odds with the MTP Act. It cannot be denied that selective abortion of girls has been increasing in India. As per 2011 census data, the sex ratio of girls per 1,000 boys dropped from 927 to 914 during 2001-2010, and from 945 to 927 during 1991-2000. Yet, a long-lasting solution can be achieved only by bringing about a cultural change and not by clamping down on abortion services and drug availability. A holistic approach is needed that will not lead to more women seeking out unsafe abortion providers, resulting in an increase in maternal deaths. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2013 have also made matters worse for minors seeking abortion services. Even if minors indulge in consensual sex, the resultant pregnancy is presumed to be the result of rape and doctors may feel obliged to inform the authorities. While the 2012 and 2013 Acts have gone to great lengths to protect the interests of women and minors, these laws may unwittingly force minors to seek the services of untrained providers, thus putting their life in jeopardy. Reducing unsafe abortions will remain a distant dream if different Acts work at cross purposes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-right-to-safe-abortions/article5214799.ece
10,10,2013,Trading on hunger,"Roberto Azevêdo’s observation that India’s food security law may violate its commitments to the World Trade Organization should not take New Delhi by surprise. If anything, the government should be thankful the Director-General — who seems apprised of India’s legitimate demand for ensuring food security — has recommended an interim solution until the WTO Ministerial Conference in December deliberates this issue. It was clear from the start that legislating such a mammoth undertaking would involve purchasing food grain from farmers at high prices and selling them through the Public Distribution System at subsidised rates. Not only should the needy be provided access to food but farmers too must be incentivised to produce more grain to reduce reliance on imports. Both actions, it has been argued, constitute a type of price support that the WTO classifies as “amber box measures” – “considered to distort production and trade.” More specifically, India has to comply with its commitments under the “Aggregate Measurement of Support,” which stipulates a ceiling on domestic subsidies. Mr. Azevêdo says the food security law will breach India’s AMS commitments. For now, the government has sought an “interim” concession from the WTO to ensure India is not subject to legal action from other members, especially the United States and the European Union.
But this is no sustainable solution, and the future of India’s food security law may well hinge on the outcome of the WTO ministerial meet in Bali in December. The G33 group of developing countries — with India as a prominent member — has proposed exempting price support measures aimed at furthering food security from the purview of their AMS commitments. This argument, however, has cut no ice at the WTO. In fact, the West has seized upon the G33’s vulnerability, tying its proposal to the larger, deadlocked discussion on “trade facilitation” under the Doha Development Round. At the Bali Conference, it is likely the U.S. and EU will push for a grand bargain: lesser import restrictions and open markets in developing countries for exemptions on procuring subsidised food grain. With no wiggle room to negotiate, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh signalled India’s readiness to strike this bargain during his recent visit to Washington. In an election year, with the Food Security Act touted as a jewel in its crown, the United Progressive Alliance cannot afford to be complacent. To protect its food security law — and the promise of adequate nutrition for the poor it is supposed to deliver — the government must go into a diplomatic overdrive. The aim is to secure an exemption from AMS limits without conceding too much ground to the West, which is more interested in penetrating the Indian market.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/trading-on-hunger/article5218375.ece
10,10,2013,Don’t ignore the children,"After years of neglect, childhood tuberculosis — which accounts for over six per cent of the global TB burden — is finally getting due attention. WHO recently published its first-ever targeted road map outlining the steps needed to move towards zero childhood TB deaths. The report comes close on the heels of the organisation including for the first time the estimates of the global TB burden in children below 15 years in its 2012 global tuberculosis report. Last year also saw childhood TB getting special focus in the World TB Day theme. Though over half-a-million new cases are reported every year from across the world in those who are HIV negative, the actual TB burden must be much higher. The reasons are pretty obvious. Most of what is reported are only the cases of sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB. However, sputum smear-negative disease is most frequent even in pulmonary TB. Most often, all cases of extra-pulmonary TB go unreported even though this category of TB accounts for “approximately 20-30 per cent.” Unlike adolescents, children under five may not produce sputum for examination. In the absence of sputum samples, there is no highly reliable and easily usable diagnostic tool to confirm the disease, especially in developing countries where TB is endemic and malnourishment is high. Hence, developing reliable and affordable tests has become a great research priority.
As a result, high burden countries like India, where 10-20 per cent of all TB occurs in children, need to find alternative strategies to target vulnerable children who are more prone to becoming infected and diseased. Implementing the WHO’s close contact screening of children under five from households where an adult has been newly diagnosed with sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB would go a long way in achieving the desired results. Adults would have spread the infection to children in the same household before seeking treatment. A clinical examination of children combined with laboratory confirmation in suspicious cases would go a long way in revealing their TB status. This approach has twin advantages. While the diseased would be put on treatment without delay, the asymptomatic children would end up getting a preventive therapy. A prophylactic treatment using a single drug — isoniazid — once daily for six months would cut down the number of young ones who may become diseased. It would reduce the TB load and the mortality rate. Yet, in India’s TB control programme, contact screening is way down in the priority list. There are challenges, but training health workers and adopting minor changes to the existing system alone can yield good results. What’s the government waiting for?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dont-ignore-the-children/article5218376.ece
16,10,2013,Levelling the playing field,"The latest Supreme Court ruling on the rights of persons with disabilities has struck down an arbitrary proviso in current government policy that had become an impediment in the mandatory reservation of three per cent of jobs for this important section of the population. In disposing of an appeal from the Union of India, the court has pronounced that the quota should be computed uniformly across all grades of employment, thereby removing a discrepancy in the 2005 government order. That order restricted reservation in A and B category posts only to those that have already been identified as appropriate for the disabled. The question of identification of jobs has for some time remained a grey area: whether governments should first ascertain the type of work the disabled can take up and then enforce reservation. The controversy was settled earlier when the Court ruled that failure in relation to the former was not a justification for inaction with respect to the latter. Currently, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment undertakes the exercise of job identification every three years, without restricting the freedom of establishments to recruit disabled persons to work in areas they deem fit.
The other important question in the instant case was whether quotas should be computed against vacancies that arise from time to time, or with respect to the total strength of the cadre. Significantly, the Supreme Court has interpreted the relevant provision in the 1995 Persons with Disabilities Act as pertaining only to the filling up of vacancies, whereas the Delhi High Court had earlier opined that the quota should be computed for the total strength of the cadre. Going beyond the current ruling, it is essential that the legal and administrative approach to disability in India be brought in line with enlightened global norms. The principles of non-discrimination and equality of opportunities should be codified unambiguously and implemented as part of official policy, thereby setting an example for the private sector. The expansion of employment prospects for the disabled is closely linked to the spread of educational opportunities and the removal of physical and attitudinal barriers that prevent the disabled from realising their potential. The impediments to secure employment for the disabled are not vastly different from those that hamper the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. The one area that is perhaps the most critical to the advancement of the disabled is improvements in access to the built-environment, public transport and pedestrian pathways. The notorious inaction on the part of governments is due in no small measure to the absence of penal provisions for non-implementation of the 1995 law.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/levelling-the-playing-field/article5237767.ece
16,10,2013,Wholesale divorce,"There is little to be surprised about in the parting of ways between the Bharti group and Walmart from their joint venture. Walmart was increasingly chafing over the mandatory local sourcing norms for retailers which it said were impractical and impossible to meet. The joint venture for cash-and-carry wholesale business with Bharti was going nowhere with just 20 stores operational even as Bharti raced away setting up over 200 ‘Easyday’ retail stores independently. Not helping matters was the allegation of bribery and lobbying against Walmart, which is now under investigation. With the raison d’etre of the joint venture — setting up retail branded stores — falling through, the marriage was headed one way only: divorce. In the event, the separation seems to be in their best mutual interests. Walmart, which seems to have placed its retail ambitions in deep freeze, will now take control of the ‘BestPrice Modern’ wholesale cash-and-carry business where 100 per cent FDI is allowed, while Bharti is free to focus on its own retail business and possibly even look for other partners. With elections round the corner and the issue of FDI in retail being a contentious one, Walmart appears to have realised that the local sourcing norms are unlikely to be relaxed any time soon. And with the FDI norms allowing it full ownership of the wholesale business, it has chosen the next best option.
The Bharti-Walmart split is yet another example in a laundry-list of high-profile joint ventures that fell apart simply because the binding force was nothing more than mere expediency. In post-liberalisation India, local partners were sought out by foreign companies as ‘escorts’ to guide them through the maze of rules and regulations governing business in this country. With minor equity stakes in the joint ventures, the Indian partners got little in return, thus making the ventures unbalanced from the start. The one joint venture that was different was the one between the Hero group and Honda, which proved to be very successful but even this partnership split over conflicting ambitions of the partners. In the equal joint venture Bharti-Walmart, the Bharti group’s utility was in pushing through regulatory approvals, installing the back-end infrastructure including finalising store locations and in studying the market. These are not small competencies for a partner to bring to the table. Foreign companies seeking to do business in India, however, see these as necessary only till the business is established after which the partners are considered dispensable. The only way for Indian companies to combat this is to insist on technology transfer to the joint venture which will result in creation of intellectual capital within the country.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/wholesale-divorce/article5237769.ece
17,10,2013,Slum-free cities,"Recently released census figures on urban slums reveal two distressing facts. First, that Indian cities are amongst the most unequal and least inclusive in the world. Second, the enumeration of the urban poor and their places of habitation are grossly incomplete and thus inaccurate. Data from 2,613 of the 4,041 statutory towns show that the population living in slums has increased by 25 per cent in the last decade, reaching 65.4 million in 2011. The figures would have been much higher — and the disparity would have appeared even wider — had the enumeration been diligent and complete. Other estimates place the population living in slums at over 90 million. It would be incorrect to attribute migration as the principal reason for the increase in slums. As the expert group on urban poverty and slums for the formulation of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan has clearly stated, their proliferation is a result of the failure of housing policies. For instance, the interest subsidy scheme, which is meant to provide financial assistance to lower income groups to secure housing and enable construction of three lakh units, has so far reached only 13,485 beneficiaries. Similarly, many State governments have failed to implement the National Urban Housing and Habitat Policy’s recommendation to allocate 15 per cent of land in residential projects for housing the poor.
The census also discloses another disquieting fact. Though there are more than 13.7 million households living in abysmal conditions, States have formally notified only about a third of them as slums. This leaves a large number of others in a more vulnerable condition: health and sanitation facilities hardly reach non-notified slums, and they are prone to forced eviction. In situ rehabilitation of existing slums without any discrimination is imperative. Following the failure of many earlier schemes, the government launched a new one entitled Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY) in 2011. RAY has promised slum free cities in future, and commits to rehabilitate existing slum dwellers in the same place where they are living, provide secure tenure and improve access to services and sanitation. The State governments should implement this ambitious scheme across cities without delay and dilution. The key challenge is to provide serviced land for social housing. Realising this, the National Advisory Council, in its suggestion to improve RAY, has recommended that cities should earmark about 25 to 40 per cent of land in their development plans for social housing. Without this important measure, it would be difficult to prevent the formation of new slums. Sustainable and equitable urban development is possible only when our cities adequately address the issue of housing the poor.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/slumfree-cities/article5241153.ece
17,10,2013,A prize for weighty prose,"The decision to award this year’s Man Booker Prize to the virtually unknown 28-year-old New Zealand writer Eleanor Catton for her door-stopper of a novel, The Luminaries, is as much a recognition of a new voice as proof that the Booker judges’ capacity to surprise remains undiminished. In a year when the critics and bookies were rooting for one of the shortest novels in contention — the British writer Jim Grace’s Harvest — they went and chose the longest (The Luminaries clocks in at 832 pages) and the most formally structured contender. Yet in the past they have gone for novels that were so brief (Ian McEwan’s Amsterdam and Julian Barnes’s The Sense of an Ending) that many questioned whether they could be considered as novels at all. Two years ago, there was a huge row when one of the judges suggested that for him a book needed to “zip along” to pass the selection test, prompting criticism that the prize had dumbed down with “readability” taking precedence over “artistic achievement.” This year’s choice is a riposte to critics on both counts. Good literature transcends considerations of structure and size. Robert Macfarlane, chairman of the judges, described The Luminaries as a “dazzling book, vast without being sprawling.” Hailed as a “compelling’’ thriller, it is set against the background of the 19th century New Zealand gold rush. The story is told through a complicated plot structure divided into 12 zodiac-themed chapters, each decreasing in length in conjunction with the lunar cycle. Judges acknowledged that readers needed to make a “huge investment” in getting to grips with it, but the effort was worth it.
At 28, Catton is the youngest ever writer to win the Booker, beating Ben Okri, who was 32 when he won it for The Famished Road in 1991. It is after 28 years that a New Zealander has won the prize since Keri Hulme got it for The Bone People in 1985. That was a controversial choice, still cited after so many years as an example of the Booker’s “eccentric’’ ways. Perhaps no other literary prize is scrutinised as closely as Booker amid persistent rumours about its imminent death. Consistently, however, it has always proved its critics wrong, demonstrating that even after 45 years, there is still life left in the old beast. In India, there will be disappointment that Jhumpa Lahiri’s The Lowland missed out and elsewhere too, critics will carp that their favourite was ignored. But that’s the beauty of Booker — its unpredictability. From next year, the prize will be open to American and other writers with British publishers, making the competition tougher — and adding to the drama that has become so much a part of one of the English-speaking world’s most storied prizes for writing.

18,10,2013,Healthcare for India’s workers,"The Union Ministry of Labour has done well to raise the salary cap for availing Employees’ State Insurance (ESI) to Rs.25,000. While the move is expected to expand coverage to an additional five million workers and their dependents, this is still small comfort in a country where barely three per cent of the workforce enjoys any social protection. The evolution of ESI has been characterised by an accent on widening its reach across various categories of industry and geographic regions. For instance, the relevant 1948 Factories Act originally applied to non-seasonal factories that employed 10 or more persons. Over the years, transport undertakings, hospitals, newspapers, the hospitality industry and educational institutions have been brought within its ambit. The 2010 amendments raised the age ceiling for dependents of employees to 25 years. They even envisage the provision of medical benefits under the ESI to workers in the informal sector — that is, those outside the current employer/employee contributory system. The need to enlarge the scope of medical services can hardly be overstated in an economy where the overwhelming proportion of the workforce remains outside the formal sector. Moreover, out of pocket expenditure on health, at 67 per cent of India’s total spending on health as per the Planning Commission figures, is the highest in the world. Critics of the latest revision of eligibility for ESI cover must appreciate that any reduction in medical expenses is a potential boost for consumer spending.
Of course, any contributory provisioning of medical treatment is at best a short-term solution in a largely poor country. The Union government has already committed to enhancing its plan and non-plan expenditure on health to 2.5 per cent of GDP. Moving quickly from this, India must adopt a system of universal health coverage that is entirely tax-funded and cashless at delivery, as recommended by the Planning Commission’s High Level Expert Group. Its watershed 2011 report advocates a comprehensive approach to health care that transcends conventional forms of illness response and insurance schemes that divert huge resources into expensive hospitalised treatment. The emphasis is instead on prevention, primary care and augmenting the social determinants of health such as basic sanitation, clean drinking water, minimum wages and primary education. Significant among the HLEG’s recommendations are the merger of the National Rural Health Mission and the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana into the UHC to better advance their social objectives. A healthy population is critical to realise the collective dream of making India an economic power-house. UHC is much more than a means to that end.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Healthcare-for-India%E2%80%99s-workers/article11807658.ece
18,10,2013,A dangerous precedent,"The latest standoff between the British Parliament and the press goes to the heart of what democracy means. On October 11, the David Cameron government published a revised version of a draft royal charter that would create a press regulator; the move was prompted partly by Lord Justice Leveson’s November 2012 recommendation, following a two-year inquiry into press methods, of an independent regulator. The proposal also arose in part from the fact that sections of the press had used hacking and even bribery in pursuit of stories. In addition, the existing body, the Press Complaints Commission, had failed to restrain the worst excesses or to give satisfactory redress to victims of press wrongs. Public suspicion, provoked by the revelation that journalists had hacked the mobile telephone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler and left messages to suggest that she was still alive, deepened further as the closeness of editors and owners to senior politicians emerged.
In response, many newspaper groups have proposed their own draft charter, involving an Independent Press Standards Organisation. There would be no lay membership and no compulsory arbitration; mass complaints would be accepted only over any “substantial” public interest; the regulator could not direct apologies or remedies. Amendments would require not a two-thirds majority in Parliament but a unanimous vote among the members of a recognition panel, the regulatory board, and the boards of all the trade associations. The Guardian and the Independent have so far not signed up to either proposal, and there is some animosity among media bodies themselves. The Daily Mail and the Murdoch-owned Sun, interpreting a recent speech by the MI5 director-general, Andrew Parker, have attacked the Guardian for publishing the U.S. whistleblower Edward Snowden’s revelations, that may be a form of retaliation because the Guardian broke the phone-hacking story, which caused the closure of the News of the World. Furthermore, some papers may bring cases in the European Court of Human Rights over parts of the parliamentary draft. Crucially, the press is not rejecting regulation; negotiations continue. In many other countries, including the U.S. and India, such state-driven regulation of the media would be considered a gross violation of democratic principles, not to speak of being unconstitutional. Taking advantage of the unscrupulous and even illegal conduct of a section of the press, the Cameron government has brought all British newspapers to the edge of a dangerous precipice. If they go down, the domino effect can only be imagined as other states seek to impose their own versions of a “regulated” press.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-dangerous-precedent/article5244688.ece
19,10,2013,Brinkmanship doesn’t pay,"Hours before a seismic payments-default emanating from the United States was about to rock global financial markets, the small coterie of ultra-conservatives in the House of Representatives holding America hostage to debt-ceiling negotiations blinked. The eleventh-hour Republican surrender on Wednesday night may have saved Washington from the ugly economic backlash of national insolvency, but it came too late for nearly 800,000 furloughed workers who forfeited their pay for the previous 16 days of unavoidable federal government shutdown. It was also too late for the limping, post-recession economy, which took a $24 billion-hit and had its annualised GDP trimmed by as much as one percentage point. A fuming President Barack Obama, who refused to reprise his 2011 approach of yielding concessions in exchange for a debt-ceiling hike, described the Republican blockade as “ransom demands” and “extortion.” He is right to do so. Underscoring their credentials for reckless adventurism, the anti-Obamacare crusaders in the House failed to win all but a single minor amendment to the game-changing healthcare reform policy of 2010, an anti-fraud measure requiring stricter vetting of income qualifications for those participating in the insurance “exchanges” established under the Affordable Care Act.
However for the people of the United States, there can be only one thing worse than a crisis of this magnitude — a second such crisis four months down the road. There is indeed a serious risk of the same events recurring on January 15, when funding for the government will again dry up, and it could reach its climax by February 7, when the U.S. Treasury's borrowing authority will expire. Facing mid-term elections next November, will the Tea Party and far-right conservatives in the House push this country to the brink again? While the passage of time will make it harder to derail Mr. Obama’s consolidation of his second-term legacy, the countervailing force is the philosophical metamorphosis of the Republican Party, a steady drift to the right. Exacerbating this trend is the steady loss of mainstream Republican control over the extremist insurrection within their ranks, a phenomenon plainly demonstrated by their inability to end the shutdown sooner. Although Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell poetically assured his constituents that his party wouldn’t go in for an encore performance next year because there is “no education in the second kick of a mule,” his words must sound hollow to millions of middle class families in the country who felt the pinch of Washington’s paralysis and certainly to an incredulous world audience that was readying itself for another made-in-America economic debacle.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/brinkmanship-doesnt-pay/article5248716.ece
19,10,2013,Beleaguered bustards,"The declining fortunes of many bird species in India, and the likelihood that some of the critically endangered ones would barely exist in a small part of their historical range in coming years call for a serious review of conservation efforts. There are 145 avian species in the country facing various levels of threat according to a list compiled for the current year by IUCN, an international conservation organisation. Among the birds that face a bleak future is the great Indian bustard. By some estimates, less than 250 representatives of this heavy, terrestrial species survive today. Research insight points to the peculiarities of its grassland habitat, growing pressures from cattle grazing and expanding farming activity as significant causes for its depletion. The Bombay Natural History Society, after a lot of study, has expressed worry at the lack of a comprehensive approach to conservation. A comeback for the great Indian bustard, as well as the lesser florican and Bengal florican belonging to the same family, will now depend on a conservation programme that is based in science and quickly builds community support. Rajasthan has the largest known population of the great Indian bustard and has done well to allocate resources to aid a dedicated effort.
The priorities for the handful of States where the species still exists are clear. Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh have to contend with the fact that the great Indian bustard does not confine itself to a protected area, and often flies into community lands. Competition from cattle for the grasses here brings the bird in conflict with humans, often with tragic results. A fodder supply scheme to spare the grassland and thus aid the bustard will go a long way in the restoration of bird populations and insect diversity, which are inter-linked. Forest officials in Karnataka and elsewhere have also unwisely changed the open landscape into plantations of exotic tree species, dealing a blow to the bird. The mistake has been realised in Nannaj sanctuary of Maharashtra, and bustards have reappeared in areas where the trees have been removed; unregulated tourism, however, continues to be an impediment here. There is apprehension that the new law on land acquisition may work against grassland birds, since cultivated lands are eligible for higher compensation, and farmers may remove grasses. This is not an insurmountable obstacle, and those areas hosting the great Indian bustard and other wildlife can be classified separately, and farmers compensated through alternative mechanisms. Ultimately, a landscape approach to conservation is what can save India’s critically endangered wildlife.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/beleaguered-bustards/article5248714.ece
21,10,2013,"Out of the darkness, light","The Prime Minister has stepped into the firing line by coming out in support of former Union Coal Secretary P.C. Parakh — named by the Central Bureau of Investigation in an FIR which hints at possible illegality in the way a coal mine share was allotted to the private firm Hindalco — but he has done so fully confident that nothing criminal will emerge about the 2005 allotment made when he was heading the Coal Ministry. The CBI filed the FIR because it is suspicious of the manner in which the decision of a screening committee to reject Hindalco’s request for the Talabira II mine in Odhisa was later reversed. While it is unwise to prejudge the merits of a case that the Supreme Court will no doubt closely monitor, the system of allotment that the Prime Minister presided over for years surely cannot escape indictment. Indeed, if one carefully studies the sequence of events — first a categorical rejection, then re-examination after the Odisha Chief Minister pleads Hindalco’s case, leading to clearance of the coal mine share — what becomes apparent is that there was really no rule-based allocation policy.
The entire coal allocation process was mired in arbitrariness on the part of both the Central and State governments. Since mining is a State subject, States would send a list of recommendations to the Centre to be examined by the screening committee set up by the Coal Ministry. The ministry in turn would send the final list of allottees back to the State government concerned for signing mining lease agreements. This arbitrary procedure seems tailor-made for rent seekers, many of whom had never seen a coal mine in their lives but who bought blocks only to sell them at high premia. In short, the political class at the Centre and the States colluded with private businesses to parcel out a scarce resource with scant regard for revenue and equity. Allotments depended simply on a company’s ability to have its letters read and acted upon. The Prime Minister may feel confident about defending the specific allocation to Hindalco, whose promoter, Kumar Mangalam Birla, has also been named in the FIR, but he and the Chief Ministers of coal-rich States like Odhisa, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh will have nowhere to hide if all the arbitrariness and rent-seeking spawned by this irrational coal allocation policy were to be comprehensively documented. It is this callous, and indeed cynical, approach to policymaking which mars the investment climate much more than the mention of Mr. Birla’s name in a CBI complaint. There are interesting parallels between the allocation of spectrum and coal, where the complicity of the political class and businesses was total. In this respect, one finds the collective outrage expressed by the business community over one of its own being named in an FIR somewhat misplaced. Big business too needs to look at the ugliness within.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/out-of-the-darkness-light/article5254784.ece
21,10,2013,Rarest of rare opportunities,"Beginning next week, the Supreme Court is expected to consider the pleas of 18 prisoners on death row, whose mercy petitions have all been rejected by the President of India. The Court has assigned itself a limited mandate: the cases will be reviewed primarily on the basis of Rashtrapati Bhavan’s delay in acting on the clemency pleas. At the heart of the matter is a classic tussle between the executive and the judiciary. The Supreme Court, by commuting the death sentence in some or all cases, will send a strong signal to the government that its errant treatment of mercy petitions can no longer continue. Already, the Court has expressed its displeasure at the hasty manner in which Afzal Guru was executed, without providing his “relatives an opportunity to meet [him] for one last time.” The government in turn will argue the presidential power of pardon — sanctioned by Article 72 of the Constitution — is beyond the Court’s scrutiny. The stakes are high: how the Court disposes of these pleas could well determine the fate of A.G. Perarivalan and two others convicted in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. The trio were made to wait for a staggering 11 years before their clemency pleas were considered — and rejected — by then President Pratibha Patil.
If it institutes a larger bench to hear these pleas, the Supreme Court will embark on an unprecedented exercise that will reinvigorate the national debate on the death penalty. Chief Justice P. Sathasivam must be commended for following through on his call for “authoritative pronouncements” on hangings and mercy petitions. Beyond the issue of delay, human rights advocates will doubtless use this platform to highlight how clemency pleas have been turned down without due consideration. The Court itself has opened the door for this argument through its decision in Sushil Sharma v. State of N.C.T. of Delhi. If, as the Court has held, the possibility of reformation is indeed a criterion to determine if a case falls within the “rarest of the rare” category, is it not the government’s imperative to consider the conduct of death row prisoners? Nothing can make for a more powerful case to abolish the retributive practice of death sentences than the reformation of individuals convicted of heinous crimes. Our prison system is notorious for spawning recidivism. If prisoners can not only survive a tortuous wait on death row — thanks to government indecisiveness — but are found to have emerged the better, the Supreme Court should not hesitate to commute their sentences.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rarest-of-rare-opportunities/article5254779.ece
22,10,2013,A golden dream,"Archaeologists and treasure hunters go back a long way. Both in real life and in popular culture, they have often been inseparable, if not one and the same. >Heinrich Schliemann, who dug up “ >Priam’s treasure” in the 19th century, loved gold as much as he did excavation. Action film hero Indiana Jones, in movies set in the first half of the 20th century, was both a professor in archaeology and an adventurer in search of lost relics. Last week, the Archaeological Survey of India gave cause for much mirth and some puzzlement as it began excavation work in >search of gold at the ruins of a fort of Raja Ram Baksh Singh in the Buxar area after the head priest of the Shobhan Temple in Unnao, Shobhan Sarkar, claimed he was informed in his dream of a treasure of gold at the site by the Raja. Folklore, maps, diaries, and fragments of documents have all triggered treasure hunts in real life and in novels and movies, but the dreams of a sadhu have never been known to form the stuff of archaeological activities. After criticism from allies and Opposition parties for ordering excavation work on the basis of such intangibles, and for encouraging superstition and undermining science, the Central government seems to have persuaded the ASI to issue a rejoinder. ASI officials now claim the excavation is being undertaken on the basis of scientific reports and the historical importance of the site. Apparently, preliminary investigations of the Geological Survey of India indicated the presence of non-conducting metals or alloys at the site.
But, the clarification raises more questions than it answers. Whether or not the digging was based on unverifiable dreams or on measurable scientific data, the excavation at the fort site was given extraordinary priority by the ASI, acting on the orders of the Union Culture Ministry. Actually, matters gathered pace after Union Minister of State for Food Processing Charan Das Mahant met the sadhu. Mr. Mahant was reported as saying that the sadhu had told him that the gold reserves were so huge that they could come in handy at a time when there is a “crisis with the rupee.” The Union Minister said he had written about this to the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister, the Home Minister, the Mines Minister and to the ASI and the GSI. He had also informed Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. That the preliminary findings of the GSI could raise the interest levels of the ASI in this manner is rather surprising. Surely, the sadhu and Mr. Mahant will be feted and felicitated for their efforts if gold is indeed found at the fort site. But if the gold hunt turns out to be futile and the dig unearths little of archaeological significance, the ASI’s credibility will stand greatly eroded.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-golden-dream/article5258281.ece
22,10,2013,Troubling times in Maldives,"In forcing the >cancellation of the presidential polls a second time, the Maldives government has proved to be at best an inept bystander and at worst a willing collaborator. The Waheed administration has not only prevented the Maldivian people from exercising their franchise, but also stands in direct contempt of the original Supreme Court order that required elections to be held before October 20. Strangely, even the Court did not deem it fit to take cognisance of the blatant flouting of its order by the executive, the very arm tasked with administering the polls. It is impossible to miss the pattern: there were no major complaints of voter list tampering till the results came out on the night of September 7; the first complainant who approached the Court was a trailing candidate Qasim Ibrahim, who is a member of the powerful Judicial Services Commission. Based on questionable evidence, the Supreme Court annulled the polls and ordered fresh elections. It also set clear guidelines, one of which related to approval of electoral rolls by the candidates. This effectively gave candidates the right to veto the polls. President Mohamed Waheed — sworn in under controversial circumstances after Mohamed Nasheed resigned on February 7, 2012 — cannot abdicate responsibility for the Maldivian Police Service forcibly blocking Election Commission personnel from moving out poll-related material on the morning of October 19, when the elections were scheduled. Surely, Dr. Waheed, a career diplomat who retired from the United Nations, should be aware of the dangerous consequences of one arm of the state acting unilaterally and unconstitutionally.
The Maldives, which elected its first President in a multi-party election in 2008, has been at a standstill ever since Mr. >Nasheed resigned. The country appears too polarised to be able to complete the poll process ahead of November 11, the constitutionally mandated date for a new President to be sworn in. The completion of the poll process is especially important to India, which has longstanding ties with the Maldives. What’s more, New Delhi attributes great strategic importance to the archipelago of about 1200 islands that straddles the eastern shipping routes. In the words of India’s Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh, “what affects Maldives affects us.” >President Waheed’s assertions that he will endeavour to hold polls within the stipulated date has cut no ice with anyone. With a leader who has lost credibility, and two candidates — Gasim Ibrahim and Abdulla Yameen — who appear bent on subverting the democratic process, the Maldives needs the support and guidance of the international community.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/troubling-times-in-maldives/article5258282.ece
23,10,2013,Sorting out nuclear liability,"Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s unsuccessful efforts at finalising the agreement for reactors 3 and 4 of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant with Russia underscore an important lesson: foreign policy begins at home. While Dr. Singh would have liked to ink the agreement during his Moscow visit, the fact remains concerns regarding supplier’s liability are nowhere close to being sorted out. India’s civil nuclear liability law — which bears the right of recourse against suppliers — has weighed heavily on the negotiations. The Russians want the original Intergovernmental Agreement regarding Units 1 and 2 “grandfathered” into the new one. This would render the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL) liable for damage resulting from an accident. Although India initially insisted — rightly in our opinion — that the domestic liability regime govern the new agreement, subsequent signals emanating from New Delhi have been confusing. Last year, the Department of Atomic Energy suggested that rules regarding suppliers’ liability will not apply to the agreement for reactors 3 and 4. The DAE’s remarks invited the attention of the Prime Minister himself, who sought to clarify its position. The PM intervened knowing full well that any concessional treatment to Russia on this count would trigger similar demands from France and the United States. Under the circumstances, Moscow will likely raise the reactor prices.
Meanwhile, both governments have held up Unit 1’s synchronisation with the regional power grid as testimony to their robust strategic relationship. Dr. Singh’s assurance that negotiations will be completed within the earliest possible timeframe is welcome. But to arrive at a deal that assuages Russia’s concerns on suppliers’ liability, the government needs to foster greater domestic dialogue on the intrinsically connected issue of safety. The Supreme Court’s green signal earlier this year to commissioning KKNP came with several caveats. Periodic safety reviews, as the Court mandated, can only be effective if the regulatory body that oversees the process is independent. Given the concerns expressed about the Atomic Energy Regulatory Body’s functioning, it is unrealistic to expect a groundswell of support for the Prime Minister’s vision for Kudankulam. The Public Accounts Committee has gone so far as to say the AERB has “remained […] a mere subordinate authority with powers delegated to it by the Central government.” If the government wishes to seal the deal for Units 3 and 4, it needs to take the public and the government of Tamil Nadu into confidence. As he nears the end of his second, and probably last, term as PM, Dr. Singh’s foreign policy legacy will be conditioned by domestic support, not by his personal equations with foreign leaders.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sorting-out-nuclear-liability/article5262002.ece
23,10,2013,Tread with caution,"The passage of the long-pending Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) Bill confers several benefits to the organised pension sector. In a country with very few social security schemes for senior citizens, there has been a pressing need to introduce new pension schemes as well as expand the coverage of existing ones. An empowered PFRDA — it did not have a statutory status when it was set up in August 2003 through an executive order — can more effectively regulate the nascent industry, protect its subscribers, attract investors including from abroad, improve data collection and dissemination through the central record keeping agency (CRA) and, in general, help grow the industry. The National Pension System (NPS), which was rolled out in 2004 by the newly set up PFRDA, has emerged as the only significant pension scheme outside those operated by the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO). Despite a record of reasonable success, it is in for a major overhaul. Beginning 2004, the NPS was first thrown open to new government employees. Many State governments have since come on board, clearly motivated by the fact that the NPS operates on the basis of a defined contribution by its members as opposed to defined benefits under the EPFO. For cash strapped governments, the fiscal benefits of migrating to the new scheme are huge. The NPS covers employees of public sector undertakings, private firms and even those in the unorganised sector.
With a large captive clientele in the region of 50 lakh subscribers and a corpus of Rs.35,000 crore that doubles itself every year, the NPS should have made a more significant impact on the pension and related sectors than it has. Part of the reason might lie in its near monopoly status which did not encourage innovation and marketing. The PFRDA, now with a legal status, is in a much better position to encourage new schemes tailored to suit specific requirements. The new legislation will facilitate foreign direct investment in the pension sector. The extent of such investment will be aligned to those obtaining in the insurance sector. Even before the new legislation, a few leading global pension funds had set up shop in India and in a regulated environment their numbers will increase. However, very different from insurance, the pension sector does not require large investments from abroad. More than a word of caution is necessary in propagating market based schemes involving equity investment. It is prudent to peg the limit on equity investment to the existing not more than 50% of the corpus of any fund. Where allowed, prospective subscribers must be warned of the risks through a comprehensive education programme.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tread-with-caution/article5262003.ece
24,10,2013,Choosing image over alliance,"That the Congress and one of its potential allies, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, were among the first to see their members disqualified from Parliament following conviction in corruption cases is only incidental. After the Supreme Court struck down Section 8(4) of the Representation of the People Act which gave convicted sitting Members of Parliament protection from immediate disqualification, the real surprise was the disintegration of an emerging consensus among the political class against the judgment. As public opinion seemed to weigh against politicians seeking the cover and comfort of legal delays, the main opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party, broke ranks. And soon enough, not to be left behind, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi came out and rubbished the “nonsense ordinance” that sought to allow convicted persons to continue as MPs or legislators if their sentence was stayed by an appellate court within 90 days. From then on, the race was for reclaiming the high moral ground. With its image at stake, there was little chance of Rashid Masood and RJD chief Lalu Prasad figuring in the political calculations of the Congress. The withdrawal of the ordinance might indeed have worsened the ties with the RJD, but the Congress was certainly looking at the bigger picture, and not just Bihar. Winning voter goodwill, even if only to a limited extent, was more important than stitching together an alliance with one party. Instead of having to be defensive on what could have turned out to be an important electoral issue, the Congress was hoping to project Mr. Gandhi as a representative of the youth who could feel the pulse of the people very well. That the Manmohan Singh government was made to look silly for having tried to push through an ordinance of this nature seemed a small price to pay in the face of potential gains for the Congress as a party.
In any case, the failure of the UPA government to come to the aid of Lalu Prasad need not foreclose all possibility of a Congress-RJD tie-up. After all, electoral strategies are not based on personal likes or dislikes. What matters is whether the two parties need each other in Bihar. At the moment, the alliance options of the Congress seem to be wider than that of the RJD. With the break-up of the alliance between the Janata Dal (United) and the BJP, the JD (U) too is looking for friends to make up for the shortfall. Even if there is some public sympathy for a former chief minister going to jail, this is unlikely to be a major electoral factor. The Congress did well in backing itself, and not a discredited ally. For the party, a lot was gained in withdrawing the hurriedly-framed ordinance, and little seems to have been lost in Bihar.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/choosing-image-over-alliance/article5265652.ece
24,10,2013,Realpolitik plus principle,"Talks between Iran and the G6 countries — the United States, Russia, China, Germany, France, and Britain — in Geneva on October 15 and 16 concluded, as expected, with no clear breakthrough but with another Geneva meeting scheduled for November 7 and 8. The delegations, respectively led by European Union Foreign Affairs chief Catherine Ashton and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, issued a joint statement that an Iranian plan for negotiation was followed by “in-depth” bilateral and joint consultations. The reasons for this cautious optimism are largely but not solely instrumental. Western sanctions have hit Iran hard, and many other countries have imposed their own under threat of U.S. sanctions against themselves. On the western side, President Barack Obama needs a foreign policy success, for which Iran offers better prospects than do Israel-Palestine, Syria, or Egypt. Both Iran and the G6 are offering various inducements, with Iran reportedly willing to accept stronger inspection powers for the International Atomic Energy Authority, to suspend production of 20 per cent enriched uranium, and to negotiate on the number of centrifuges it uses for enrichment. The U.S. can offer to unblock tens of billions of dollars Iran has in accounts around the world; in September the European Court of Justice ruled several EU-based freezes illegal, and the West could lift sanctions on medical supplies, aircraft spare parts, and travel by Iranian citizens.
The West, however, faces greater obstacles than Iran does. President Hassan Rouhani is facing some domestic opposition to better relations with the West but seems to have the support of the country’s spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, while the Obama administration has to surmount U.S. Congress hostility to Iran; Zionist influence on the legislature is so strong that Mr. Obama could lose control over this area of foreign policy. Worse still, many Gulf states and Israel will do all they can to wreck a Tehran-G6 deal. Wikileaked cables quote Arab leaders as saying Iran’s nuclear programme must be stopped by “all means available” and describing Iranian leaders in highly abusive terms. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for his part, calls Mr. Rouhani a “wolf in sheep’s clothing” and demands “paralysing” sanctions, which he thinks will fail without a serious U.S. threat of attack. According to an Israeli official, Gulf states even send Washington messages through Israel. Mr. Obama, however, has at least partly moved from armed intervention towards diplomacy, and Iran has openly rejected nuclear weapons since 2005. Whatever the pressures on them, neither the U.S. nor Iran must abandon these principles.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/realpolitik-plus-principle/article5265650.ece
25,10,2013,Beyond the border,"The Border Defence Cooperation Agreement signed during Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s visit to China is without doubt a constructive step towards resolving the boundary dispute. The BDCA itself is not a game-changer: it simply reinforces the basic international norm that countries ought to settle differences through peaceful means. Specifically, the Agreement adds to the existing layer of confidence-building measures through flag meetings, joint military patrols, and periodic high-level interaction. The BDCA nevertheless indicates both New Delhi and Beijing have accorded high priority to preventing hostile incidents along the Line of Actual Control. That Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Dr. Singh have exchanged visits within six months of the incident reflects this fact. The Chinese intrusion and subsequent withdrawal from the Depsang plain earlier this year provided the impetus to BDCA negotiations, and prompted serious introspection on the effectiveness of the Working Mechanism on Border Affairs. By opting for a tempered Agreement though, Dr. Singh has chosen to play his hand cautiously in an election year. The BJP, which facetiously claimed the government has ceded territory to China, would do well to acknowledge the spirit with which former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee established the Special Representative mechanism on border talks during his 2003 Beijing visit.
The ultimate objective of finalising an LAC acceptable to both countries is still some distance away. With no clear understanding of how the other perceives the Line, and China preferring “status quo” along the boundary, the onus will be on India to seize the initiative. Preparing the framework for a lasting settlement is important: that said, India-China ties cannot be hostage to the boundary dispute. It is unfortunate — but entirely predictable — that plans to usher in a liberal visa regime were shelved owing to the controversy over China handing out stapled visas to two athletes from Arunachal Pradesh. The stapled visa issue has assumed dangerous proportions. It cannot be allowed to eclipse the need for greater cooperation, particularly in the fields of trade and tourism. While making the case for robust engagement at the Strategic Economic Dialogue scheduled for next month, India must also ensure our exporters gain a stronger foothold in the Chinese market. Whether it is on the strategic or the commercial side, both governments can only reap the benefits of cooperation through constant dialogue. In snuffing out “old theories of alliance and containment,” Dr. Singh has rightly emphasised a workmanlike approach to dealing with this important relationship.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/beyond-the-border/article5269171.ece
25,10,2013,Cutting pollution and cancer,"The International Agency for Research on Cancer, a specialised arm of the World Health Organisation, has sounded an alert for policymakers with its conclusion that there is sufficient evidence now on outdoor air pollution as a cause of lung cancer. A separate evaluation of particulate matter in the air has led to its classification also as a ‘Group 1’ pollutant, indicating firm evidence of cancer-causing properties. Given that rapidly industrialising countries including India have significant levels of air pollution, the conclusions of the IARC call for close study and an effective response. The burden of cancers, including lung cancer, in the country is staggering. In April, the Union Health and Family Welfare Ministry said the number of people living with cancer in India stood at 28,20,179 during 2012, and 4,89,875 people died of the disease. Any reduction in the incidence of cancer will therefore have substantial benefits, avoiding staggering costs both to the citizen and the economy. Thus far, air pollution has been known to have a definite impact on respiratory and heart disease, but its link to cancer has now been evaluated through research across continents.
Mitigation of air pollution from key sources such as transport, coal-based power generation, industrial emissions, and cooking using biomass needs sustained policy action. As scientific publications from IARC point out, developing countries are encountering increasing vehicular traffic, which is concentrated in urban areas. This has led to higher exposure to large particulates and sulphur dioxide for millions. It would help clean up the air if taxation policies make it easier to maintain vehicles better, and strict enforcement of pollution control ensures that emissions are well under check. A replacement policy for older vehicles that includes incentives will go a long way in curbing pollution, as will the expansion of public transport and options such as cycling. It is also worth pointing out that the IARC recently referred to the paucity of data on smaller particulates in the air, which is hampering the study of their impact on health. Considering its importance, the programme to assess the threat from particulates in select cities should be intensified and expanded to all towns with a million-plus population. On the question of reducing the harm caused by open burning of biomass for cooking, the Centre has a plan to distribute improved cookstoves during the Twelfth Plan. The latest evidence on the pollution-cancer link should encourage the government to widely license the production of these stoves, and make them affordable enough for all families in need.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/cutting-pollution-and-cancer/article5269862.ece
26,10,2013,Engaging for a fair settlement,"In calling for a “complete boycott” of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Colombo next month, the Tamil Nadu government has lost a great opportunity to help calibrate India’s Sri Lanka policy. For starters, it seems unlikely that New Delhi will stay away from CHOGM: with President Mahinda Rajapaksa finally coming through on his promise to hold the Northern Provincial Council elections, it would be unwise for India to disengage with his government at this critical juncture. The NPC election was a legitimate exercise that saw the Tamil National Alliance emerge victorious. India should now insist on Colombo devolving power to the Council in line with the 13th Amendment. Given the Rajapaksa regime’s reluctance to hand over policing and land acquisition powers to the NPC, the devolution process is going to be difficult and protracted. Rather than boycotting CHOGM — and thus giving Colombo a big stick to beat down the legitimate aspirations of Sri Lankan Tamils — India must continue to channel its diplomatic energies towards a constitutional settlement. The Tamil Nadu government and Legislative Assembly should have encouraged the Centre to facilitate such an outcome.
With each passing episode that requires it to take a tough decision on Sri Lanka — be it attending CHOGM or voting against the regime at the U.N. Human Rights Council — New Delhi must wonder why it has been drawn to a corner. The United Progressive Alliance has itself to blame after it sheltered the Rajapaksa government through the final stages of its war against the LTTE and immediately thereafter, without demanding any responsibility for post-war reconstruction in return. With the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam as a key coalition ally then, the Congress could well have foreseen the perils of dancing dangerously close to Colombo. Now the government finds itself battered by populism in Tamil Nadu ahead of the general election, with little wiggle room for constructive diplomacy. CHOGM will not be the last balancing act that the UPA will have to pull before heading to the polls — in March next year, the UNHRC will likely discuss and vote on Sri Lanka’s dismal human rights record, drawing attention to India’s policies again. For now, the Centre has no option but to bite the bullet. Whether political parties in India and Sri Lanka want it to stay away from the Commonwealth summit, New Delhi should be aware that its continued engagement with Colombo is indispensable to a sustainable and fair settlement of the Tamil question.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/engaging-for-a-fair-settlement/article5272986.ece
26,10,2013,Slipping on onion prices,"The humble onion is in the news yet again. Prices of the staple vegetable have been rising in recent days across the country, especially in Delhi where it touched Rs.100 a kg on Wednesday. It was only two months ago, in August, that onion prices shot past the Rs.60 a kg mark, forcing the government to take steps to discourage exports while simultaneously arranging to import the bulb from Egypt and China. The government raised the minimum export price first to $650 a tonne and later to $900 a tonne in September when prevailing global prices were less than $500 a tonne, making it virtually impossible for traders to export. That calmed prices down a bit, but they have now rebounded and this is attributed to lower-than-expected harvest due to an extended monsoon that damaged crops in the main producing region in Maharashtra. The State accounts for 30 per cent of onion production in the country. Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma is on record as saying that hoarding by traders is a major reason for the sudden spike in prices. Indeed, it is the price of not just onion but also other staple vegetables such as potato and tomato that has been rising in recent days. Interestingly, the price rise has been the highest in the national capital where elections are just round the corner, bringing back memories of 1998 when the BJP government in Delhi lost power on the issue of rising onion prices.
Going by the large differential between wholesale and retail prices — the latter is at least 50 per cent more than the former — there appears to be some merit in the hoarding argument though the original shortage might have been set off by a genuine fall in harvest. Reform of procurement practices and agricultural marketing is long overdue. Given that it is a State subject, the Centre circulated a model of amendments to the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act a decade ago, but only a few States have amended the Act — Delhi is not one of them. Among other things, these amendments aimed at reducing the dominance of the wholesaler in the marketing chain. The government needs to act quickly to rein in the price spike in the three staple vegetables, not just because its electoral fortunes are at stake but also because of the negative impact it will have on food inflation. High onion prices were a prime factor in pushing food inflation to 18.4 per cent in September, and going by current indications, the picture may not be very different when the October data come in. The Reserve Bank of India will be watching the trends closely. Given the inflation scenario, it is quite likely that the central bank will be forced to hike rates again, which is not good news for borrowers and the larger economy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/slipping-on-onion-prices/article5272988.ece
2,11,2013,Unshackling the bureaucracy,"The image of an honest civil servant subjected to arbitrary transfer or suspension by the political executive at the behest of vested interests is etched in the public consciousness as a key archetype of the Indian bureaucracy. The rising public awareness of the importance of the bureaucracy in the delivery of basic services to citizens has received a welcome boost from the Supreme Court’s reformative verdict on insulating officers from political interference. Three significant administrative reforms arise out of the court’s verdict on a petition by more than 80 former bureaucrats: a fixed tenure for civil servants so that they are not transferred at the whims and fancies of the political executive; and a stipulation that all instructions by superiors be in writing, to protect officers from wrongful pressure from their superiors, political masters and vested interests. To prevent arbitrary transfers, the court has directed that the Centre and the States establish Civil Service Boards (CSB) comprising serving officers to advise the political executive on transfers, postings and disciplinary action, until Parliament enacts a law in this regard. These directions are meant to “ensure good governance, transparency and accountability” in governmental functions, the court has said.
A question that might be raised is whether the Supreme Court was overstepping its ambit by directing the constitution of a mechanism to regulate transfers and postings, especially when draft Bills are in circulation on such reforms. But it is evident that the court has taken judicial note of the various official reports and studies in this regard. It quotes extensively from past exercises — the reports of the K. Santhanam Committee on prevention of corruption, the Hota Committee and the Second Administrative Reforms Commission — that addressed these questions. These reports had recommended fixed tenures, insulation from political interference, avoidance of oral instructions, and a statutory board to decide on transfers. But these were not taken forward. The failure of the executive to frame a legislative framework to address these key concerns has forced the court to step in. The reality is that the phenomenon of the ‘politician-bureaucrat-industrialist’ nexus is so entrenched that it requires a sustained systemic effort to cleanse the administrative system. The real gain for citizens is that the Supreme Court judgment has raised the bar for good governance in this country by providing a framework to insulate bureaucrats from the pressures of a clutch of vested interests which act through the political system. Public confidence in governance is bound to rise as a result of this landmark verdict.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unshackling-the-bureaucracy/article5305810.ece
2,11,2013,Disquiet in West Asia,"The September 27 United Nations Security Council vote which ended any foreseeable prospect of military intervention in Syria, and the subsequent telephone conversation between President Barack Obama and Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani, have caused such alarm in West Asia that the region’s political map is changing rapidly. Saudi Arabia has expressed obvious anger over these events and over Mr. Obama’s suspension of arms aid to Egypt after the military coup which overthrew the elected President, Mohamed Morsy, in July. Riyadh has threatened to reduce its collaboration with Washington and has taken the unprecedented step of refusing an elected seat on the Security Council, saying the world has failed to act effectively on Syria. Israel is said to have been acting for some time as a conduit for Arab leaders’ messages to Washington, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now claims the Arab world recognises that Israel is not “the enemy of Arabs”. His claim would be reinforced if Tel Aviv’s neighbours were to invite him to the Manama dialogue in December. In addition, Turkey, an associate member of Nato and generally on good terms with Israel, is well aware that Iran is its single largest neighbour, with a significant Kurdish minority whose kinfolk across the Turkish border have long struggled for an independent Kurdistan.
These are all high-risk strategies, particularly for Saudi Arabia and Israel. The former bought U.S. arms worth $33.4 billion in 2012 and could put pressure on Mr. Obama with the threat of even a partial boycott of U.S. arms manufacturers, but could thereby end up feeling less well defended against its regional arch-rival, Iran. Secondly, its oil is not the weapon it once was, as the U.S. now imports under 6 per cent of its oil from Saudi Arabia. Iran has some of the world’s largest oil and gas reserves and U.S. oil majors would no doubt be very keen to resume working there. Further, Iran might then have an interest in influencing the Shia Alawite government in Syria to reach a peaceful deal and in persuading Hezbollah to engage openly in political processes. As for Israel, Mr. Netanyahu knows that he cannot control a U.S. president whose mind is made up. Détente between Washington and Tehran could make his country less important to U.S. interests, which in turn would inevitably give Mr. Obama more weight in his efforts towards an Israeli-Palestinian settlement. All in all, some of the world’s most dangerous tensions could be greatly reduced; Mr. Obama and Mr. Rouhani must therefore do all they can to reach a lasting agreement.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/disquiet-in-west-asia/article5305811.ece
4,11,2013,How real is the rally?,"On Friday, November 1, the benchmark stock index, the Sensex, scaled a new high in early- morning trade, bettering its previous record set in January 2008. At one level — admittedly a superficial one — the record-breaking performance of the index is to be seen as a spectacular recovery for the country’s equity market after the economic crisis impacted adversely on corporate balance sheets, leading to a steep fall in their earnings. By the middle of the year the rupee had started declining rapidly, investor confidence was ebbing, and leading brokerages were threatening to downgrade India’s stock markets. Since then confidence might have returned to the markets, but it is by no means clear whether the rally in stocks has any deeper significance than what is apparent. After all, the largely liquidity fuelled rally cannot last indefinitely, dependent as it is on large and sustained buying by foreign institutional investors and portfolio managers. The decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to continue with its ultra-soft monetary policy has certainly helped for now. A mere hint of winding down the stimulus in May caused a massive flight of dollars back to the U.S. from emerging markets including India. The rally has puffed up the valuations of some shares, but a larger number have lagged behind. Skewed stock indices do not give a correct picture of the stock markets, leave alone the broader economy.
There are other aberrations. Shares of medium-sized companies have not participated in the rally so far. Retail investors who are the backbone of stock markets continue to stay away. Other spin-off benefits from a rising market have not materialised. The government is unable to push through with its disinvestment programme. There is no logical reason why certain sectoral stocks should rise so spectacularly. Bank stocks, especially of public sector banks, have risen, brushing aside the serious problems they face, such as a high level of non-performing assets (NPAs). Finally, the disconnect between the financial sector and the real economy has been spectacularly demonstrated and growth remains subdued. The government optimistically hopes for a growth rate of around 5.5 per cent this year, which will be a dramatic improvement over the 4.4 per cent in the first quarter. There has been some good news recently. As the Finance Minister has emphasised, the current account deficit has become eminently manageable, agriculture is in for a revival as monsoons may be favourable, and there is some hope that the industrial sector will turn around. Welcome as these signs are, they do not indicate an imminent revival to old levels, and certainly do not justify the massive stock market valuations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/how-real-is-the-rally/article5309933.ece
4,11,2013,Feeding on fires,"What distinguishes negligence or lapses in administration from gross negligence or disregard of legal duty is a failure of the government or its law enforcing machinery to take swift action in the face of warnings and forebodings. After the communal riots in Muzaffarnagar in August and September, the Uttar Pradesh police had every reason to take extra care against any fresh eruption of violence, especially in the areas where relief camps for the original victims were in operation. Scores of people had died in riots that lasted for weeks. Indeed, the atmosphere in and around Muzaffarnagar had remained surcharged with tension when the latest round of violence was set off last week with the killing of three youths who were staying in relief camps. The Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police, Devraj Nagar, has admitted to “lapses” on the part of the police but there cannot be any reasonable explanation for these lapses, other than gross negligence or wanton misconduct. That some persons could imagine they could get away with murder in such a tense atmosphere speaks poorly of the police force, and the law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh. Not surprisingly, the Supreme Court went so far as to say that it would send an independent fact-finding team to assess the situation if the response of the U.P. government was not satisfactory.
Thanks to the manipulative politics of politicians and parties, primarily the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Samajwadi Party, Uttar Pradesh remains a tinderbox. As elections approach, the State has become a battleground for clashes between castes and communities. A rumour or even an ordinary incident of law and order trouble can quickly assume communal overtones, heightening communal and caste tensions. Incidents that in other places might be dismissed as petty often gather momentum, and spread like wildfire in the State. Although the State government sees the latest violence as a “law and order” issue and not “communal” in nature, the truth is that it takes little to turn an ordinary law and order incident into a flashpoint for incendiary communal attacks. Political parties dependent on communal vote-banks, whether of Hindus or Muslims, have a lot to gain from these flare-ups. If Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav does not act firmly and decisively, he will be leaving the door open for a hitherto unprecedented monitoring of the law and order situation by the Supreme Court, or a more active engagement and even interference by the Congress-led Central government. The sooner the BJP and the SP recognise the limitations of a politics based on communal identities, the better it would be for them, and for Uttar Pradesh and India as a whole.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/feeding-on-fires/article5309934.ece
5,11,2013,A flawed and unwarranted move,"The Election Commission might be well-intentioned in seeking to ban opinion polls in the run-up to an election, but the move does not seem to be sound in law, and is certainly not desirable in practice. The reasoning for a ban is that opinion polls influence voters prior to polling, and therefore the results of such polls should be withheld until after the end of voting. Needless to say, this is a flawed argument, and a ban, while imposing needless restrictions, will not in any way enhance the purity of elections. Whether opinion polls influence voting is debatable, but even if they do, that is no reason to ban them. Election campaigning ends only 48 hours before polling closes, and political parties and their supporters are free to indulge in propaganda to influence voters till then. If parties and candidates are allowed to try and influence voters during the campaign period, why cannot the media or others publish poll findings that may or may not influence voter behaviour? Even if some of the surveys are not scientific, and some others are fraudulent — just as some election manifestoes may include tall promises — a ban cannot be the solution. Opinion polls that are not transparent and are carried out unscientifically, quickly lose credibility. In any case, the voters must be allowed to judge for themselves the extent of reliability of the innumerable opinion polls and exit polls.
Actually, any ban on opinion polls runs counter to Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution that provides all citizens the right to freedom of speech and expression. Of course, this freedom is subject to reasonable restrictions listed in Article 19(2): in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency or morality, or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence. Any hypothetical influence on voters does not figure in this list. Any ban would therefore contravene the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution, and belittle the intelligence of voters. Already, by a 2009 amendment to the Representation of the People Act, restrictions have been placed on the publication of results of exit polls from the beginning of polling on the first day in a multi-phase election till half an hour after the close of polling in all States. The rationale behind the restrictions on exit polls is their claim to greater credibility, and therefore, their greater ability to influence voters. The distinction between opinion polls and exit polls on this basis is surely untenable, but what needs to be done is the removal of restrictions on the publication of exit poll findings, not the placing of similar restrictions on opinion polls.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-flawed-and-unwarranted-move/article5314468.ece
5,11,2013,Staying on the rails,"The move by the Indian Railways to privatise a section of passenger traffic, and the launch by Minister Mallikarjun Kharge of the High Speed Rail Corporation, at this juncture, need to be very closely evaluated. The talk of privatisation in the Railways has gone on for long, though not many efforts had borne fruit in the past. There needs to be some clarity and a clear policy on privatisation in India’s biggest monolithic public sector undertaking. It must be remembered that only the Railways have an annual budget of their own, outside the general budget. So long as this route and the Public-Private Partnership model were looked at from the commercial or goods movement angle, or even for the production of coaches and locomotives, there was no problem. Obviously, the Railways cannot keep on investing in new production units. These efforts have succeeded only to a limited extent. Is that why the Railways have now turned to opening up a segment of passenger traffic to the private sector? When they speak of high speed corridors and the need to run trains at 160 kmph or even 200 kmph, it naturally means creating new infrastructure that calls for massive investment — which the Indian Railways cannot afford now.
But the decision to offer seven identified high-density traffic corridors to this model is fraught with danger. Take the Mumbai-Ahmedabad or Chennai-Bangalore sectors, for instance. Any number of trains or flights on these routes are bound to be full. Of course, the rail routes have reached a saturation point and there is need to go in for dedicated, perhaps elevated, high speed corridors. The country’s experience with the private sector in the transport field has not been too good. Air India remains a standing example of how the public sector was made to lose out to private airlines. Private bus transport stumped the nationalised road transport corporations for a variety of reasons. The seven corridors likely to be offered in PPP mode can surely generate enough profits for the private investor. What do the Railways get from it? Where is the regulator to look at traffic, tariff, and safety on the rails? The Commissioner of Railway Safety can handle only the track, and nothing more. There needs to be a larger debate on this proposal and this government, which is nearing the end of its current innings, should not be taking such a major plunge. Having delayed this concept for so many years, nothing will be lost if all these issues are discussed threadbare, and the new government next year can take the right decision with all the inputs. Meanwhile, it would do well to focus on the many major infrastructure projects that are waiting to be implemented.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/staying-on-the-rails/article5314474.ece
6,11,2013,India’s voyage to Mars,"India’s first interplanetary probe, the Mars Orbiter Mission, has left home on the first leg of a voyage of scientific discovery. Once again, the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation performed its task with impeccable ease. A long and difficult trek now lies ahead of the spacecraft. It will circle Earth for the rest of this month, repeatedly firing an onboard liquid-propellant engine to gain velocity. Shortly after midnight on November 30, the engine will fire again to put it on course for the Red Planet, a journey of 680 million kilometres that will take almost 300 days to complete. Such deep space missions have inherent risks, especially for a country attempting one for the very first time, and failures litter the history of Mars exploration. Only the Soviet Union, the U.S. and Europe have succeeded in getting spacecraft to the fourth planet from the Sun. Japan, a nation whose space programme began well before India’s and which has rich experience in a variety of space missions, ran into problems that ultimately crippled its maiden Martian venture launched in 1998. The Nozomi spacecraft’s propulsion system malfunctioned and then powerful solar flares seriously damaged key components. The probe ended up shooting past Mars, instead of going into orbit around it. China tried to hitch a ride for its Yinghuo-1 spacecraft on Russia’s Phobos-Grunt. But the latter was unable to leave Earth orbit and burnt up as it fell to the ground early last year.
If India does triumph with its Mars mission, it will have stolen a march on its Asian rivals. But it will not mean that this country has pulled ahead of Japan or China, which have far more advanced capabilities in many areas of space technology. However, with efforts like the Chandrayaan-1 lunar probe launched five years back, the present Mars mission, and Chandrayaan-2, which will attempt to put a lander and rover on the Moon in a few years’ time, ISRO is unmistakably signalling its intention of being a significant player in space exploration. Should money be spent on such ventures? Questions about the worthwhileness of the space programme are nothing new. Studies have, however, shown that the country has more than recouped the money it invested in space. But those returns were not immediate and took many years, even decades, to materialise. It is difficult to predict all the benefits that might accrue from something like the Mars mission, some of which may be intangible but nevertheless vital for the country in the long run. The most important of such benefits could well be to fire the imagination of young minds in this country, getting them to dream about possibilities for tomorrow.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/indias-voyage-to-mars/article5317915.ece
6,11,2013,In support of patient rights,"The Supreme Court’s award of a record compensation of Rs.5.9 crore in a case of medical negligence is in continuation of its well-considered stance of balancing the rights of patients with the legitimate protection of doctors when they are on call. The significance of such an approach cannot be overstated in the specific context of India, where the health care system — in the public and the private sector — functions under sub-optimal conditions; while the entire medical profession operates within the purview of the Consumer Protection Act. Through successive judgments, the court has sought to address the question of criminal culpability of medical practitioners. It has insisted that the police cannot be allowed to proceed against doctors for negligence, unless authorised by expert medical opinion. An important parallel to this line of reasoning is also the legal protection guaranteed to doctors to facilitate instantaneous and cashless treatment of victims of road accidents. In the instant case involving a private hospital in Kolkata, the apex court maintained in its 2009 verdict that for negligence to amount to an offence, criminal intent on the part of medical practitioners would have to be established. It thus upheld the Calcutta High Court’s acquittal of two of the doctors, even as it affixed civil liability.
In fact, weighing all the relevant facts of the case, the highest court has more or less tripled the amount of compensation originally determined by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. To that extent, it may be said to have struck a reasonable balance between the irreversibility of the loss of a precious human life and holding the medical fraternity to account for dereliction of duty. Governments must draw important lessons from the culmination of the 15-year long judicial battle. There is, above all, a need for mandatory accreditation of all medical facilities in the public and private sectors and an independent evaluation of their performance. This is a key recommendation in the report of the High Level Expert Group on Universal Health Coverage of the Planning Commission. A health regulatory authority to develop legal, financial and regulatory norms is the other proposal in the report. The implications of these should be self-evident in the current scenario of for-profit model of providing health care. India’s doctor-to-population ratio is well below the World Health Organisation stipulation of one per one thousand and calls for urgent corrective intervention. The mission of a medical professional is to heal the sick and, arguably, to create a disease-free environment for healthy living. While fixing accountability is important, a concerted all-round effort is needed to realise that objective.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/in-support-of-patient-rights/article5317919.ece
7,11,2013,Pakistan’s telling reflexes,"The killing of Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone attack has set off depressingly familiar reactions that are telling about the state of play within Pakistan, and its relations with the United States. In a replay of what followed Osama bin Laden’s killing in 2011, the killing of Mehsud has set off more condemnation of the American violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity than an honest assessment of who he was and how he had brought the country to its knees. As the leader of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, Mehsud was the mastermind of scores of terrorist attacks that killed innocent Pakistanis by the hundreds in mosques, markets, hospitals; the TTP took on the Pakistan Army, ambushing, kidnapping and beheading soldiers, acts for which it readily took responsibility, so much so that in popular Pakistani narrative, it was even suspected of being a proxy group of India. It was behind the attempted killing of the teenager Malala Yusufzai for standing up for girls’ education. It killed anti-polio workers suspecting them to be American spies and holding the immunisation programme as a conspiracy against Islam. The TTP also played a dark role in the elections earlier this year with a bloody campaign targeting candidates of the “secular” Pakistan People’s Party and Awami National Party. Mehsud formed alliances with other militant groups across Pakistan, building a country-wide terror network. Yet, he is being hailed by a broad spectrum of Pakistani politicians as a Taliban leader who wanted to make peace with the government. Some have even described him as a martyr.
After a surge in terror attacks, the government — armed with a mandate from an all parties’ conference — had been trying to start a dialogue with the TTP, and views the killing as a setback to this process. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has said the efforts would continue, and a senior cabinet minister has demanded a review of ties with the U.S. Considering the Taliban have only contempt for Pakistan’s Constitution and other aspects of the modern democratic nation state, the question has always been if this is a peace process or a surrender by the government. It is true that the war by drones has repeatedly violated Pakistan’s sovereignty. Even if the Pakistani military and civilian leadership are not complicit in it as the U.S. has repeatedly claimed, it is hard not to concede that Mehsud’s elimination must have unnerved the TTP, at least for now, and given the Sharif government an invaluable opportunity to forge a new, more visionary political consensus on how to deal with the terrorism, extremism and militancy eating at the country’s vitals. Unfortunately, all signs are that Pakistan will choose not to take it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pakistans-telling-reflexes/article5322487.ece
7,11,2013,Missing TB cases,"Although tuberculosis killed 1.3 million people across the globe in 2012 and nearly 8.6 million developed the disease, the world is on track to reach some important targets of the 2015 Millennium Development Goals. According to WHO’s global tuberculosis report 2013 released recently, the incidence rate has been falling, and the mortality rate since 1990 has been reduced by 45 per cent. Yet, at 37 per cent, the reduction in prevalence during the same period is far below the half-way goal. In all likelihood, India may be responsible for the slow reduction in global TB prevalence. At 2.8 million (26 per cent), the country has the highest caseload. But the true incidence and prevalence would be higher if those approaching the private sector and remain unreported are also taken into account. The government’s landmark decision last year to make TB a notifiable disease by the public and private sectors was meant to correct this anomaly. If implemented in earnest, every case detected would get reported and the actual extent of the disease will become known. Unfortunately, very little has been done to ensure that the private sector complies with the requirement. The government reluctantly made TB a notifiable disease, and has shown little interest in implementing the order.
WHO has taken special note of these missed out people. Globally, three million people who developed TB last year have been missed out by the national notification systems, it notes. If detecting and notifying all adult TB cases is found wanting in India, it is far worse in the case of children below 15 years. WHO has estimated that TB incidence among children is over half a million across the world. But its recently released road map for childhood tuberculosis clearly indicated that the actual burden would be higher. WHO’s 2006 guidance on TB management in children indicated that about one million TB cases the world over occur in children. Though children can contract TB at any age, those under five are especially vulnerable, particularly those from households where an adult has been recently diagnosed with active pulmonary TB. Young children are more susceptible to getting infected and face an increased risk of progression to disease; they also acquire the more severe forms of the disease. It is for these reasons that WHO had recommended contact tracing. Though India’s Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) has also approved contact tracing of young children from such families, its implementation is at best sub-optimal. Thus, while RNTCP estimates children with TB to be 10.2 per cent of the total TB caseload, only seven per cent of the cases were registered in 2011.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/missing-tb-cases/article5322489.ece
8,11,2013,A battle of generations,"A global audience running to tens of millions awaits the start of the world chess championship title clash between champion Viswanathan Anand and Norwegian prodigy Magnus Carlsen, the highest ranked player in chess history, in Chennai starting on November 9. Anand, once known as the Lightning Kid for the speed at which he annihilated opponents on the board, is now aged 43; he is a five-time winner who has overpowered three seasoned challengers since 2008. Believe it or not, Anand first made it into the top 10 in world rankings in July 1991, when Carlsen’s first birthday was still four months away. This battle of generations involves players of conflicting styles. They have perfected the art using the best tools of their era. What Anand learnt from his deep study and understanding of chess classics, Carlsen gained using software. Going by present form, Carlsen is tipped to win. His rating of 2870 is 95 points higher than Anand, who is currently ranked eighth in the world. The young challenger has won six of his last nine tournaments and in the others, stayed half a point behind the winner. Anand triumphed once this year to end a title-drought that began in 2008. But remarkably, during this period, Anand retained the world title all three times. In the event, Anand’s experience and success in match-play is being seen as his biggest asset. In Chennai, more than Anand taking advantage of home conditions, it will be interesting to see how Carlsen, a citizen of one of the coldest and least populated nations, deals with the situation.
Anand has to make things happen instead of playing the waiting game against Carlsen. The Norwegian is not known to accept quick draws. He capitalises on his energy to tire out his rivals. He excels in drab and listless positions where most players find it difficult to concentrate for long. Expecting long battles, Anand is learnt to have worked a lot on his fitness and shed a few kilograms as part of his preparation. Head-to-head, Anand has six victories to three by Carlsen who is, however, the winner of their last two decisive encounters. In fact, in their last game this summer, Carlsen handed out Anand his worst defeat. No wonder, the chess world expects a change of guard in Chennai. But knowing Anand’s tenacity and motivation, it will be naïve to rule out his chances. As former champion Garry Kasparov, who trained the young Norwegian in 2009, said, “Vishy [Anand] will be quite happy that he is the underdog. He’s got huge experience.

8,11,2013,Trouble in tourist paradise,"The murder of Nigerian national Obodo Uzoma Simon at Parra village in north Goa, and the unusual street protest by the small community from the African nation that followed, have brought under focus the seamier side of the tourist paradise. While the crime itself may have been the fallout of what the police believe is a turf war between local and international gangs in the narcotics trade, the knee-jerk reaction of the authorities in beginning an eviction drive against Nigerians was unwise. By the time Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar came out with an explanation that the drive was against all foreign nationals staying on without valid documents and was not limited to Nigerians, wrong signals had gone out. The African country intervened diplomatically to seek a reassurance that its nationals are not unfairly treated and demand that the culprits involved in the murder be apprehended. It issued a note verbale to India, and the Indian emissary in Abuja had to explain the situation to the Nigerian foreign office. India imports oil in considerable quantity from Nigeria, which is one of its major trading partners. There is a sizeable Indian community in Nigeria. It would make little sense to resort to actions against Nigerians that may invite retaliation there. Nigerian diplomats did mention the possibility of retaliatory action.
The Goa police have made some progress in the investigation, arresting one Goan suspect and identifying a few more. It appears that there is considerable local resentment against the activities of some foreign nationals, especially after the police struggled to control the protest by the Nigerian community, but this should not be an excuse to crack down on foreign nationals indiscriminately. Prejudices and perceptions often come together to put communities to disadvantage, especially in the backdrop of unsavoury incidents. Goa’s reputation as a haven for the fun-loving tourist is matched only by the popular perception that gangs belonging to various nationalities operate there with impunity. Crime statistics, however, do not bear out the theory: there is no unusual spike in recent years in the number of foreign nationals arrested for such offences. And it is now no secret — after a committee of the Goa Assembly highlighted last month the nexus between the authorities and drug dealers — that the trade is more than a mere shadowy activity catering to addicts. While dealing with such cartels, the State government should focus on any criminal activity, rather than the nationalities of those involved. At any cost, it should not allow the perception to gain ground that a crackdown on organised crime has racial overtones.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/trouble-in-tourist-paradise/article5326487.ece
9,11,2013,The fight for Chhattisgarh,"It is not often that the main opposition party is forced on the defensive in an election. In Chhattisgarh, voter fatigue and the anti-incumbency sentiment seem to be a bigger drag on the Congress, which heads the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre, than on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. With the Lok Sabha election only a few months away, the Congress is finding it difficult to keep the focus on issues relevant to the State Assembly election during the campaign. The BJP is seeking a third term in Chhattisgarh, but it is the Congress that is on the back foot fending off attacks on the Manmohan Singh government’s governance record at the Centre. Narendra Modi, the prime ministerial candidate of the BJP, divides his campaign time between attacking the failures of the Congress at the Centre and praising the achievements of the Raman Singh government in the last ten years. As the campaign hots up in Chhattisgarh, Mr. Modi, who sees Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi as his principal rival, is setting the campaign agenda in the tribal-dominated State. Issues relating to land acquisition, jobs and development remain central to Chhattisgarh, but these seem to have been crowded out by the bigger picture of the Lok Sabha election.
Chhattisgarh is one of the States most affected by Maoist violence, but Mr. Modi would rather harp on the bomb blasts at the venue of his rally in Patna than on the failure of Chief Minister Raman Singh to contain the threat from Naxalites. Although leaders of the Congress were the victims of a brutal attack by Maoist elements in Darbha, the party seems unable to politically capitalise on the failures of the BJP government on the law and order front. If the Congress is to recover lost ground in the battle for Chhattisgarh, the party’s leaders need to re-focus on the development agenda, addressing the livelihood concerns of the people. Although Raman Singh initiated a hugely successful food security programme involving distribution of heavily subsidised rice to poor households, under his chief ministership employment opportunities have been lacking for the State’s youth. Government jobs, especially in schools, remain the only escape route for the people in the tribal areas, but recruitment in these areas does not match the available unemployed and underemployed workforce. The Congress needs to tap into this underlying resentment if it is to unseat the BJP in Chhattisgarh. Opinion polls show the BJP ahead, but this is a close fight, and the Congress might still be able to turn things around with a more aggressive campaign studded with promises of jobs and development.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-fight-for-chhattisgarh/article5330431.ece
9,11,2013,Assad’s gambit,"The destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons production and mixing equipment may have been completed ahead of schedule but its problems remain far from resolved. The U.S.-Russia deal struck in Geneva earlier this year — paving the way for international inspection of Syria’s toxic munitions — has delivered its first tangible result. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has kept alive the spirit of the Geneva communiqué, and with it the chances of international mediation. However, the principal actors in Syria’s conflict seem to remain unconvinced of the need for dialogue. In extending his cooperation to the OPCW – which has until June 2014 to oversee the elimination of Syria’s chemical stockpile – President Bashar al-Assad has signalled his indispensability to a diplomatic settlement. Mr. Assad has underlined that not only is he in control but he is also willing to make tactical concessions. The odds are now stacked heavily against the Syrian rebels. After the United States shelved its plan to intervene militarily, opposition groups have had to reconcile themselves to the option of sharing power with Damascus. That al-Qaeda and other terror outfits have infiltrated the rebels’ ranks has also substantially diminished the support they initially received from the West. Not surprisingly, many of the rebel factions have expressed their reluctance to participate in the “Geneva 2” diplomatic conference scheduled for later this year. Mr. Assad, on the other hand, has made the Syrian government’s participation contingent on his being allowed to complete a full term in office.
Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis in Syria continues unabated. Refugee influx into neighbouring countries like Lebanon and Turkey has reached massive proportions. The World Health Organisation recently confirmed an outbreak of polio in the country with aid groups finding it difficult to deliver food and medicines in war-affected districts. A ceasefire between the government and the rebels has simply not materialised. The Syrian conflict continues to be manipulated by regional actors. Amidst opposition to Iran’s participation in the conference, U.N. and Arab League Envoy for Syria Lakdhar Brahimi has rightly suggested that Tehran’s presence is “natural and necessary.” It seems probable Syria will soon be free from the scourge of Weapons of Mass Destruction. But the OPCW’s commendable work is only a means to an end – if within the next few months, the international community is not able to bring the country’s warring parties before the negotiating table, the chances of a political solution will diminish considerably. This can only happen if external actors stop aiding the militarisation of this conflict.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/assads-gambit/article5330432.ece
16,11,2013,For light-touch monitoring,"When it is not seen as toothless, the Election Commission of India is seen as overzealous and authoritarian. To be both tough and fair, then, is the true challenge for the EC. While chiding Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi for making speeches that were “not in consonance” with the letter and spirit of the Model Code of Conduct, and serving notice to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi for his barbs about the election symbol of the Congress, the hand, the EC seems to have been overly conscious of this need to not only crack the whip against politicians, but also seem even-handed between the ruling coalition and the main opposition party in its monitoring of the elections and electioneering. The MCC not only prohibits speeches or statements that tend to aggravate differences between religious communities, but also bars criticism of other political parties on the basis of unverified allegations. While Mr. Gandhi fell foul of the MCC on both counts, Mr. Modi faces mainly the charge of criticising a political party beyond its policies and programmes and past record and work. Although it does not have statutory force, in the hands of a vigilant Election Commission the MCC is a safeguard against political parties lowering the discourse to levels of pettiness and crassness. Thus, in reprimanding Mr. Gandhi and serving notice on Mr. Modi, the EC went strictly by the code, presenting itself early in the campaign as an alert arbiter determined to keep the debate within reasonable bounds.
But while political parties must be made to realise the importance of a campaign that is reasoned and illuminative, and not abusive and noisy, the truth is that electioneering is impossible to monitor with any level of efficacy. Certainly, the EC does not have the manpower or the resources to keep tabs on the heat and dust during the daily campaign at the level of constituencies. The EC’s interventions, even now, are on the basis of complaints from rival parties, and not direct monitoring of the campaign. However, the question to ask is whether the MCC, if implemented in letter and in spirit to the last detail, would dampen India’s lively and colourful electioneering and the robustness of democratic debate. The EC’s disciplinarian approach is essential to make elections free and fair, but the activism should not go to the extent of robbing the election of all character. Surely, the EC can find a way of being firm without being overbearing, and of showing understanding without being lax. The EC and its model code would only gain greater moral authority in this process. The code is in no need of any change, but sometimes a light touch would do.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/for-lighttouch-monitoring/article5355242.ece
16,11,2013,A road map for foreign banks,"The long-awaited policy framework for foreign banks to operate more freely in India was released by the Reserve Bank of India recently. At the core of the new policy is the preferred organisational structure for them. They will be encouraged to opt for the wholly owned subsidiary (WOS) model and be incorporated in India. In return, the WOS is promised near national treatment — being able to open branches anywhere on a par with Indian banks and participate in the development of the Indian financial sector. Foreign banks that have been operating branches in India for long are encouraged to switch to the WOS model. The principle of reciprocity will guide the RBI. A minimum capital of Rs.500 crore has been fixed for each wholly owned subsidiary of a foreign bank. For the RBI, regulation of foreign banks, especially from the perspective of financial stability, will become easier. To forestall the possibility of foreign banks dominating the Indian financial sector, certain restrictions are being placed if they grow above a certain size, They will adopt corporate governance norms, which are generally in line with what are applicable to the Indian corporate sector, except that there will be a compulsion to appoint Indian nationals on their boards of directors up to a certain proportion. The WOS will have to meet the priority sector lending requirement of 40 per cent on a par with domestic banks.
The government and the RBI envisage a productive role for foreign banks in India subject to their following certain prescribed norms. It is no coincidence that the RBI has stipulated similar requirements, such as in capital adequacy, for the new private banks that are to be licensed shortly. However, while the imminent entry of new banks, especially those promoted by large corporate houses, has been highly controversial, the expansion of foreign banks’ footprint in the country is likely to be more subdued. After the road map was unveiled, leading banks of the world are adopting a wait-and-watch attitude. A few of the big ones who have had branches in the country for more than 100 years are reportedly reluctant to convert to the WOS model given all the restructuring it entails. That is not surprising, given that the ethos of the foreign banks was not oriented towards activities such as lending to small and medium enterprises and agriculture. Over their long years in India most of them have grown at a snail’s pace. Regulatory restrictions have often been given out as the excuse. Finally, as with new private banks, expectations from the foreign banks — in the evolution of India’s financial sector and in financial inclusion — are highly exaggerated.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-road-map-for-foreign-banks/article5355244.ece
18,11,2013,Commonwealth games,"It was only as recently as December 2012 that the Commonwealth framed a Charter to bring together and reaffirm all that it stands for in a changing world. It contains an unequivocal recommitment to human rights, democracy, good governance, rule of law and freedom of expression among others as ‘the core values and principles’ of this group of nations. It is thus not extraordinary that CHOGM 2013 in Sri Lanka should have been upstaged almost entirely by allegations of grave human rights violations committed by the Sri Lankan military against Tamil civilians in 2009 during the last battles against the LTTE. That the Colombo Declaration focussed on fostering sustainable, inclusive and equitable development in Commonwealth nations and kept away from all mention of human rights — the final communiqué too contained no adverse mention of Sri Lanka — can only be small consolation to the host. The Rajapaksa government had hoped that the summit would help in restoring its international credibility. Exactly the opposite has happened. There is a harsher spotlight on the country’s rights record, new allegations have been levelled even while old ones refuse to go away. Colombo’s troubles can only be partly blamed on the domestic politics in countries where this edition of CHOGM was vociferously opposed, prompting some heads of government to stay away, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. There would have been little space for such opposition if only Sri Lanka had moved quickly to implement the recommendations of its Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission.
This year’s CHOGM cruelly showed up New Delhi’s inadequacies in dealing with an important neighbour, hostage as Sri Lanka policy has become to the short-sighted vision of Tamil Nadu’s political parties. Manmohan Singh’s decision not to attend the summit has brought no political or diplomatic advantage. By comparison, British Prime Minister David Cameron showed far more nous. He silenced political opposition to his participation by using the occasion to publicly criticise Sri Lanka’s rights record, issuing an ultimatum to President Rajapaksa to institute by March a credible inquiry into allegations of rights violations. How useful such ultimatums are as a diplomatic strategy is questionable going by the Sri Lankan leader’s defiant stance, but the British Prime Minister achieved his stated aim of “focus[ing] the eyes of the world on Sri Lanka”. He also did what the Indian Prime Minister should have done — visited Jaffna, connecting with the Tamil people and their problems first-hand. New Delhi will face its next Sri Lanka test in March 2014 at the U.N. Human Rights Council, but its timing right before the elections means it may blunder through again.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/commonwealth-games/article5361110.ece
18,11,2013,Challenge to artistic expression,"The Madhya Pradesh High Court’s directive to change the title of Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s movie Ram Leela, is only the latest setback to artistic and creative expression in India. The High Court’s order underlines the urgent need to reconsider the film certification process, and indeed, the archaic Cinematograph Act of 1952. Mr. Bhansali’s offering was cleared by the Central Board of Film Certification, a statutory body entrusted with vetting all aspects of a movie, including its title. If a High Court judge could overrule the CBFC in response to a petition that claimed the title Ram Leela offended religious sentiments, the Board’s mandate is in serious jeopardy. Presumably, neither the judge nor the petitioners had a chance to evaluate the movie ahead of its release. The Madhya Pradesh High Court could have simply issued notice to the movie’s producers while refusing to comment on the petition’s merits, as the Bombay High Court had done. The Delhi High Court had gone further, imposing a fine on an NGO that preferred a similar, vexatious complaint against the movie. The Madhya Pradesh High Court’s order has opened the door for mischievous attempts to curb free speech and rendered the movie vulnerable to attacks elsewhere.
Ram Leela may not have met the fate of movies like Vishwaroopam and Madras Café, banned altogether by the Tamil Nadu government. But in all three cases, film-makers were in no position to contest any violation of their freedoms. The exigency of ensuring a timely release in a competitive market has left them at the mercy of fringe elements who twist the law to meet their ends. Those aggrieved by the CBFC’s decision to clear the title Ram Leela could well have approached the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal. The rationale behind a dedicated certification process is laid to waste if producers are not offered an opportunity to present their case. Summary decisions by courts, as with that issued by the Madhya Pradesh High Court, often come at the cost of due process. The Justice Mukul Mudgal Committee, constituted to formulate a model Cinematograph Act, had recommended that the FCAT’s scope be enlarged so as to make it the primary venue for such litigation. The draft Bill mooted by the Committee suggests that movies be evaluated in the “context […] and people to which the film relates.” Whether Ram Leela slights the traditional enactment of the Ramayana or is merely a reference to the movie’s protagonists is best decided by the FCAT. Lawmakers must take up the Mudgal Committee's recommendations in earnest to avoid such scenarios as the one created by the Madhya Pradesh High Court’s order.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/challenge-to-artistic-expression/article5361109.ece
19,11,2013,An Indian honour,"Sachin Tendulkar is not the first of India’s sporting heroes: there were several before him, and even some after 1989, the year he made his international debut. That he became a nonpareil sporting icon is not only due to his feats on the cricket field, which were without doubt many, but also because of the times he lived in. Tendulkar’s rise as an unprecedented nationwide hero-phenomenon coincided with India’s growth into a major economy, a period when the country’s rapidly growing middle class followed the game on television and drew in advertisers and sponsors. The master-blaster gave ordinary Indians a chance to think of themselves as world-beaters, even if not in a truly global sport. For them, Tendulkar filled a void larger than the hole in the Indian team’s middle-order. For a generation starved of heroes, and short on confidence, he served as a source of inspiration and motivation. Even when Indian cricket got mired in charges of fixing and bribery, Tendulkar was left untouched. And in the eyes of his fans, he could do no wrong, whether on or off the field. The extraordinary outpouring of emotions at his farewell match on his home ground in Mumbai was thus not unexpected. Indian cricket is now on a high, and he might not leave as big a hole as the one he filled 24 years ago, but for India’s cricket fans the game would not be the same anymore.
Given his popularity and iconic status, the Central government obviously did not want to lose even a day in honouring him with the Bharat Ratna. For some years now, the cricketer’s fans in high places have been quite vocal in demanding a Bharat Ratna for him. Indeed, the rules governing eligibility for the highest civilian award were modified two years ago apparently to keep the doors open for Tendulkar to receive the honour on his retirement. As per the revised criteria, it can be awarded for exceptional performance in any field of human endeavour. After having nominated him to Parliament last year, there was little doubt that the Congress-led government would take the first opportunity to honour him. And that opportunity came the day the Mumbai Test, Tendulkar’s 200th, ended. To be conferred the award is one thing; to force a change in the eligibility criteria for the award is quite another. It was almost as if the award would lose some of its sheen if Tendulkar were not among the recipients. At 40, the cricket icon is the youngest ever to receive the award. Unlike many others who have received the honour in the last six decades, he did not have to wait for the award; the award waited for him. The honour was India’s, as much as Tendulkar’s.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-indian-honour/article5364837.ece
19,11,2013,Tasks for Mr. Yaameen,"The Maldives has finally elected a President, but the acrimony that preceded the November 16 verdict leaves Abdullah Yaameen Abdul Gayoom without the luxury of the usual honeymoon period. That he won with barely more than the mandated 50 per cent plus one vote is proof enough that nearly half the country trusts someone else: Mohammed Nasheed, who stepped down as President in February 2012 in highly controversial circumstances after winning the tiny island nation’s first multiparty election in 2008. The new President is the half-brother of former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ruled the country with an iron hand for about three decades. Mr. Yaameen has to first assure his deeply divided country that he will not go down the path that Mr. Gayoom strode for decades — locking up detractors and quelling dissent with a heavy hand. Speaking for his party, the Progressive Party of Maldives, Mr. Gayoom has set the right tone of engagement, saying that neither Mr. Nasheed nor his party, the Maldivian Democratic Party, will be harmed. This will address only a part of the challenges before the new President.
In the year and a half since Mr. Nasheed was forced out of office, the country had come to a virtual standstill. The electoral process had stuttered along, interrupted repeatedly by the Supreme Court, the very institution tasked with upholding the rule of law. From September 7, when the first round of polls was held, only to be annulled by the Supreme Court, to the final round on November 16, the Maldives had witnessed a clash of the institutions that form the backbone of any democracy. The police had, on one occasion, prevented election officials from moving out of their premises, and, on another, the Supreme Court had, contravening the Constitution, extended the term of President Mohamed Waheed. Mr. Waheed, an international diplomat, who was Mr. Nasheed’s Vice President, had been elevated in February 2012 under a constitutional provision, a day after Mr. Nasheed resigned. India, the Maldives’ closest friend and neighbour, adopted a mature approach, which could form the template for its engagement with other neighbours too. Though there were calls — often from more than one player in the Maldives — for Indian intervention to ‘set right’ democracy, New Delhi showed restraint to guard against any charge of dabbling in the internal affairs of the nation. Mr. Yaameen’s first priority will be to fix the economic mess the country is in. Despite the antipathy towards India among a large section of his party — his Vice-President, Mohamed Jameel, is a known India-baiter — it will serve Mr. Yaameen well to have a good working relationship with India. The two nations have much to gain from fostering closer, friendly ties.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tasks-for-mr-yaameen/article5364842.ece
20,11,2013,Rationales for separation,"Telangana is almost a fait accompli now, but both pro-Telangana activists and anti-bifurcation protesters know there is still a lot to fight for: the status of Hyderabad, the demarcation of boundaries, the sharing of water resources, and the reallocation of government personnel. With the Group of Ministers looking into issues relating to the bifurcation completing its consultations on Monday, the focus is now on the details of the bifurcation, and not the creation of Telangana itself. The violent agitations leading to and following the Cabinet approval for Telangana were in part engendered by the indecisiveness of the government at the Centre, and the absence of any structured dialogue among the various stakeholders on the bifurcation. The Centre heard views from all sides, but could not force anyone to consider compromises or scale down from maximalist positions. The discussions so far have been random exercises held in the hope that a consensus would magically emerge. But now that these efforts have predictably failed, they are shown up as justification for a hurried, unilateral approach by the Centre. No resolution on the Telangana issue was introduced in the Andhra Pradesh Assembly. While this is not mandated by the Constitution, the bypassing of the Assembly is certainly a departure from the precedents in the bifurcation of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh in 2000. Of course, in these instances the creation of the new States — Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh — were not as contentious as the carving out of Telangana from Andhra Pradesh is. Telangana remains an instance of how not to go about creating new States.
Almost inevitably, the Cabinet approval for Telangana has revived demands for new states in eastern India, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. Clearly, the Telangana tangle has reinforced the need for setting up another States Reorganisation Commission to examine various demands for new states and lay down broad principles and guidelines in deciding new boundaries. At present, many of the demands are based on loose, largely imagined, identities. The struggle for Telangana was based on its political past, and not linguistic or ethnic identity. Without some rational, practical basis for the creation of new states, statehood demands would be conceded as the Centre seems politically expedient. Governance issues and administrative convenience should also be among the decisive factors in the creation of new states. Otherwise, statehood demands would be sustained by narrow, sectarian agendas that ignore the larger interests of the community. The end result of such demands can only be internal displacement of people.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rationales-for-separation/article5368611.ece
20,11,2013,Crippling deadlock,"Bangladesh’s political impasse appears all set to worsen in the coming weeks unless the two main political parties, the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, demonstrate maturity of a high order. The BNP has opposed the “all party government” formed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to oversee national elections due in January 2014 and threatened to take to the streets. As a result, only parties in the Awami League-led ruling coalition are represented in the set-up. The roots of the present crisis go back to 2011, when the Hasina government amended the Constitution to abolish the caretaker system of government, which had been introduced in the mid-1990s to provide a non-partisan overseer for elections. The decision to do away with it was born out of first-hand experience of the perils of the caretaker system when a government of technocrats appointed for three months in 2006 stayed on for over two years with military backing. The abolition was opposed by the BNP, which also boycotted the vote on the amendment in Parliament, seeing it as a self-serving move by the Awami League. Since then, the country has moved from crisis to crisis, each segueing into the other, including massive violence that attended the trials to punish those who had cooperated with the Pakistan Army against the liberation of Bangladesh. Through all this, if BNP leader Khaleda Zia has been confrontationist, Prime Minister Hasina has hardly been reconciliatory. The ban imposed earlier this year on the Jamaat-e-Islami, a crucial ally of the BNP, did nothing to enhance the Awami League leadership’s democratic credentials, coming as it did shortly after the opposition combine convincingly won a clutch of municipal elections in the midst of the war crimes trials.
What is required now is for both parties to acknowledge that they need to engage with each other constructively to ensure a peaceful democratic transition. An election boycott by the BNP, as the party has threatened, is no solution. As for the Awami League, victory in an election that is not contested by the main opposition party would be hollow. It will set the country on a fresh path of political confrontation. With the security situation in the entire region uncertain, several countries are now engaged in efforts to break the political deadlock in Dhaka. Already seen as pro-Hasina, New Delhi must do nothing that appears partial to any party. It is true that Sheikh Hasina has been a good friend of India, but New Delhi’s inability to reciprocate with a settlement on the Teesta river water dispute or on the land boundary issue has given the BNP a stick to beat the government with. It is in India’s interests to encourage the two main parties to find a way out of this impasse themselves, without taking sides.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/crippling-deadlock/article5368613.ece
21,11,2013,The promise of Vikramaditya,"India’s naval doctrine professes a three-carrier force: one each on either flank, with a third one remaining on periodic maintenance at any given time. Having envisaged a naval force built around a carrier battle group to retain control over the expansive seas under its sphere of geostrategic interest, India acquired its first carrier, INS Vikrant, as early as 1961 and operated it till the late 1990s alongside another British-origin carrier, INS Viraat, which was inducted in 1987. Aircraft carrier Vikramaditya has now been inducted into the Indian Navy as a work-in-progress. It is meant to bridge the operational gap between the retirement of Viraat, already a spent force and on its last lap, and the induction of the indigenous carrier, Vikrant, to be ready hopefully by 2018. During the interregnum, the Navy could not have afforded to waste its five-decade experience and skills in operating carriers. The strategic value of an aircraft carrier is apparent also from China’s acquisition of a resurrected Soviet carrier.
The debate may continue on the strategic utility of sea control when stealthy underwater platforms are part of the strategic deterrence. Yet, the significance of carriers in implementing India’s quest to exert a benign influence over the volatile Indo-Pacific cannot be overstated. Strengthening its expensive carrier-centric surface fleet should not of course be at the expense of critical sea denial capability achieved through a strategic submarine force. The two can indeed be complementary. Carriers demonstrate ‘intent’, but a potent undersea fleet, which is less costly to build and maintain and relatively less vulnerable to attacks, would be increasingly vital to attaining credible strategic deterrence. The induction of Vikramaditya has hopefully ended any debates over its usefulness. The age of the hull, the quality of work done at the Russian submarine yard of Sevmash where it was rebuilt, and price renegotiations, were part of this debate in the past. The Navy should now focus its energies on integrating it into the fleet. It should train and qualify its fighter pilots on the Vikramaditya’s deck. It should negotiate with Russia on the maintenance of the platform so as to operate the systems smoothly and efficiently through its life-cycle of 25 years. Concurrently, an Indian yard should be qualified to carry out minor refits. Weaponising the carrier will pose the next major challenge. It will be in the interest of the Indian Navy to zero in on and integrate without delay effective and key defence systems such as surface-to-air missiles on the platform to fast-track its operationalisation. After inducting the Vikramaditya, the Navy would be looking to commissioning the indigenous aircraft carrier, INS Vikrant.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-promise-of-vikramaditya/article5372635.ece
21,11,2013,Sudan’s tribal smokescreen,"As if being the victims of the Sudanese government’s genocidal onslaught – which killed over 480,000 people and displaced 2.8 million – from 2003 onwards were not enough, the peoples of the country’s Darfur province are now suffering yet again, in what looks like tribal warfare. Since January, ferocious fighting between rebel tribes and government-backed forces has killed 800 people and displaced 460,000. In central Darfur, the joint African Union-United Nations Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) has mediated between the Salamat and Misseriya tribes; international NGOs continue to work in the area, but UNAMID has expressed grave concern about civilians’ safety, and 12 of its own troops have been killed since July 13. Secondly, in the El Sereif area of northern Darfur, the Rizeigat tribe has been battling another Arab tribe, Beni Hussein, around Jebel Amir. According to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the death toll is twice that for all fighting in Darfur in the whole of 2012; Sudan’s Defence Minister Abdelrahim Mohammed Hussein says tribal violence has replaced rebellion as the main threat to national security.
That, however, is only part of the story. The genocide was in part driven by the Omar al Bashir regime’s racist hatred of the non-Arab Fur and Zaghawa peoples, and the current fighting is not primarily tribal. The Beni Hussein sultan had earlier granted over 3,000 licences for artisanal gold-mining in less than three square kilometres around Jebel Amir, but a quarter of the 70 kg annual output was being smuggled westwards into Chad and on to international markets, with India and China among the eventual destinations. Khartoum seems to have disregarded this until the secession of South Sudan in July 2011 deprived the regime of control over oil, its single most valuable export. With gold being the obvious replacement, the government has clearly decided to end losses estimated at $700 million a year and to take control of the gold fields by force. Following a blockade and attacks by the Abbala tribe on the Bani Hussein, the Rizeigat launched their offensive, using army-issued weapons and laying landmines; many are wearing border-guard uniforms after being inducted into serving the state. The Rizeigat, as proxies for the regime, are repeating their conduct from the time of the genocide, and a major problem is that traditional tribal peacemaking methods have broken down. Meanwhile Mr. al Bashir, wanted by the International Criminal Court for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, remains in office. The U.N.

The two dental surgeons have been sentenced to life terms for murdering their 14-year-old daughter Aarushi, and domestic worker Hemraj, in May 2008 after detecting a sexual liaison between the girl and the live-in help. And, according to the verdict, they hid the servant’s body on the terrace, dressed up the crime scene, secreted the weapons used — a golf club and a surgical scalpel that surfaced long after the probe began — and misled the police by giving a complaint that Hemraj was missing and was therefore the culprit. The investigation begun by the local police was widely seen as a botch-up: it took them a whole day to come to know that the body of the ‘suspect’, Hemraj, had been lying on the terrace all along; the crime scene was largely unprotected. The judgment caps a see-saw investigation in which more than one theory was probed and none could be confirmed with cogent evidence. At one stage, the Central Bureau of Investigation, which took over the probe from the Noida police, gave other suspects a clean chit and said the Talwars were indeed involved, but it had no prosecutable evidence against them. It filed a closure report, but the court rejected it and went ahead with the trial based on available circumstantial evidence.
The defence raised several doubts about the prosecution version, including the absence of a motive, and claimed that alternative possibilities were ruled out without adequate investigation. Ultimately, the court went by the fact that they had no explanation for the “incriminating circumstances” in which they found themselves. They were the only ones in the house at the relevant time, as the two remaining occupants were dead. And there was no sign of a forced entry. The trial court’s conclusions will be tested in the High Court on appeal. Like other sensational cases — a term that invariably refers to ones on which the media bestow extra attention — this case too saw the mainstream and social media resorting to wild speculation and heated discussions. Normally, trial court judgments are expected to give a quietus to all doubts about the guilt or innocence of suspects, but given the media frenzy, it is doubtful whether the outcome turns only on evidence in such cases. Alternative theories abound in the public domain, making it difficult for investigators and judges to go solely by the quality and adequacy of the evidence, and not be influenced by public opinion. They have a duty to convince the public at the end of the trial that they have allayed all reasonable doubts.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-talwar-tragedy/article5394493.ece
27,11,2013,Safety in regional airlines,"The sudden crash of a >Boeing 737 airliner at the Kazan airport in Tatarstan on November 17, 2013 has turned the focus back on air safety and the need to create awareness among the smaller, regional airlines about ensuring that international standards are followed in aircraft maintenance. That all 44 passengers and six members of the crew died in the crash makes it all the more tragic. The flight from Moscow reportedly made a second attempt to land at the capital of Tatarstan, after apparently trying to abort a landing, and the aircraft exploded as it hit the runway. Eyewitnesses have said that the plane “just fell” and vertically hit the runway, with the fuel tank exploding immediately. Initial reports pointed to bad weather conditions that prevailed at Kazan, but in this winter, the airline and its crew should have factored that in. This was a regional Tatarstan airline. Incidentally, Kazan will be one of the venues for the 2018 World Cup football tournament to be hosted by Russia. Such tragedies involving aircraft raise a number of questions — of airworthiness, the training and capacity of pilots, the conditions at the airport to make such a landing during bad weather, and also the facilities available at the airport to handle emergencies. Above all, the track record of the airline and the importance it attaches to aircraft maintenance make a huge difference. Similarly, the quality and training for pilots becomes critical.
Some of the basic questions that call for answers are whether the aircraft was airworthy; if there was a caution on the weather and if the pilots prepared for a rough landing; if the airport had the equipment to guide flights to a safe landing during inclement weather; if the pilots were trained or equipped to handle the flight during such weather conditions. Every country that owns or licenses airlines must compulsorily set up an independent regulator to monitor the functioning of airlines. At another level, the International Civil Aviation Organization should keep an eye on the smaller and regional airlines to ensure that they follow global norms in safety and security of both aircraft and passengers. The unplanned growth of the aviation industry over the past two decades has given rise to a range of safety concerns that need to be clearly addressed. Some airlines acquire their aircraft, while others lease them for immediate operations. It is up to the aircraft manufacturers to keep track of the maintenance and repair of all aircraft produced by them. They must realise that whenever one of their aircraft meets with a tragic accident, their reputation is also on the line.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/safety-in-regional-airlines/article5394494.ece
28,11,2013,A complete vindication,"When one of the nation’s best known religious leaders is arrested for allegedly ordering the murder of a detractor, and the police claim they have “clinching evidence”, one would have thought that the state would be reasonably sure of its case. Claims of eyewitness accounts, incriminating circumstances and a palpable motive in the brutal killing of A. Sankararaman, manager of the Varadarajaperumal Temple at Kancheepuram, in September 2004 were put together to build what was claimed to be a solid case against the accused, the foremost among them being the Kanchi Shankaracharya, Sri Jayendra Saraswathi. In the event, what took place in a Sessions Court in Puducherry was a sorry spectacle, as witness after witness turned hostile and sent the trial hurtling towards en masse acquittal. The theory that Sri Jayendra Saraswathi, and his junior, Sri Vijayendra Saraswathi, hatched a conspiracy to silence Sankararaman who was making accusations about purported misdeeds, collapsed with astonishing ease. Witnesses failed to identify the assailants in court. Nothing came of claims that Sri Jayendra had arranged for money to carry out contract killings, that five fake suspects were made to surrender in court to throw the police off the track, and the inadmissible but widely publicised claim that the Acharya himself had made a videographed “confession.” His arrest, incarceration and interrogation led to much divisive debate, with supporters claiming it was a plot to revile the Hindu community, and detractors showing undisguised glee.
In hindsight, the Acharya’s dramatic late-night arrest at Mahabubnagar in Andhra Pradesh amidst Deepavali celebrations in 2004 was perhaps more sensational than Sankararaman’s murder itself. The investigation team headed by the late K. Prem Kumar, a Superintendent of Police, seemed to be hunting more for proof for dubious theories of financial misdeeds, moral turpitude and outright sleaze. The police were possibly hoping that if the allegations made by Sankararaman, often pseudonymously in numerous letters, were found true, the motive will be established. They reacted angrily to any criticism and even summoned such critics for ancillary probes. The Mutt’s administrator and the junior pontiff’s younger brother, both accused in the case, were detained under the Goondas Act. The trial judge has noted the “undue interest” shown by Prem Kumar in pursuing the investigation in a particular direction. As the investigation turned aggressive, the Kanchi Acharya approached the Supreme Court to get the trial transferred to Puducherry. As the investigators seemed intent on pursuing only the Acharya, the question of who ordered the fatal attack on Sankararaman remains unanswered.
Correction
>>A sentence in the Editorial, “A complete vindication” (Nov. 28, 2013), read: “As the investigation turned aggressive, the Kanchi Acharya approached the Supreme Court to get the trial transferred to Puducherry.” Actually, the Kanchi Acharya had approached the Supreme Court to get the trial transferred out of Tamil Nadu.

28,11,2013,Sahara’s legal battles,"The Supreme Court has once again come down heavily on the ‘Sahara Pariwar,’ as the group likes to be called. On November 20, the group’s promoter, Subrato Roy, and a few other directors were restrained from leaving the country or selling any of its immovable properties without the court’s permission until they complied with the court's earlier order to deposit with the capital market regulator, SEBI, title deeds of properties of a market value of about Rs.20,000 crore. That is approximately the amount that Sahara has been ordered to return to a very large number of investors in its controversial issue of optionally fully convertible debentures (OFCDs),which it claimed to have mopped up through the private placement route. In 2011, SEBI ruled the debenture issue illegal, after which the Sahara group has gone on a spree of litigation at different forums, basically challenging the capital market regulator’s jurisdiction. Successive failures — at the Allahabad High Court and the Securities Appellate Tribunal — have not deterred the group from prolonging the legal battle. A landmark Supreme Court judgment of August 31, 2012 comprehensively upheld SEBI’s stand and directed the Sahara group to furnish information on the OFCD and repay depositors within stiff deadlines, but it has found ways to dodge the order. The group seems to have an endless supply of money for publicity and has prolonged its case, which in terms of mere common sense, should have been closed a long time ago. It remains to be seen if the severe restraints that the Supreme Court has placed on Mr. Roy and the Pariwar very recently may be enough to ensure compliance.
The strong language used by the Supreme Court to admonish the group is not likely to have the desired effect. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court chastised Sahara and its lawyers for “making a mockery of our order” and “playing hide and seek” with the highest court. Sahara had deposited photocopies of title deeds instead of the originals. A few properties in Mumbai have been found to have a significantly lower value than was claimed. Such acts of brazenness have characterised Sahara’s defiance right from the beginning. In response to the Supreme Court’s order, it sent to SEBI’s office in Mumbai truckloads of what proved to be mostly useless information on OFCD investors. Sahara’s much-touted political connections — which run across the spectrum — have helped, and will obviously come in handy in an election year. Not surprisingly, none of the political leaders, whether from the ruling alliance or outside, has had anything adverse to say on this extremely opaque group.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/saharas-legal-battles/article5398211.ece
29,11,2013,A fresh opportunity in Nepal,"The results of the elections to Nepal’s second Constituent Assembly are yet to fully come out but there is little doubt that the Nepali Congress is set to become the single largest party, followed by the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist). The Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), which won a majority of the seats in the 2008 election, has been routed and is expected to win fewer than a hundred places in the 601-seat House. The first Constituent Assembly had to be dissolved after it failed in its task of framing a Constitution even after its tenure was extended four times. Last week’s election was originally scheduled for November 2012 but was postponed repeatedly. The instability in Nepal belied the promise of the peace process that ended the Maoist insurgency and brought the rebels into the political mainstream. The Maoists have blamed their defeat in the election on electoral fraud and have demanded a probe. But the extent of the rout shows that it is more likely an expression of popular disillusionment and anger against the former rebels. Seen as the establishment of the past five years, they took the brunt of the blame for the dismal governance and inability to deliver a Constitution to the people, even though this was a collective failure of all parties. Nepali voters had rewarded the Maoists in 2008 because they were unhappy with the nepotism, opportunism and corruption of the traditional forces. With the Maoists copying the worst of these tendencies, voters saw no reason to give them another chance. The 2012 split in the party also cost the Maoists heavily.
The challenge for Nepal’s fractious political forces now is to make the fresh start provided by the election work. It is encouraging that after an initial threat to boycott the new Assembly, the Maoists have been more conciliatory; the victorious NC and the CPN (UML) have enough seats between them for government formation but they have expressed the readiness to consider the Maoist demand for a “government of consensus”. If Nepal is to go down this route again, the power sharing negotiations will hopefully avoid last time’s pitfalls. A national unity government will certainly help the Assembly’s main task of Constitution making, which Nepal’s political forces have agreed must be based on consensus. The last Assembly unravelled over the Maoist proposal, supported by Madhesi parties but opposed by the NC and the CPN(UML), to divide Nepal into identity-based federal units. This time, the parties have promised that they will ready a Constitution within a year. This can be achieved only through mutual accommodation. If there is a role for India, it should be to counsel the victors against triumphalism and the losers against playing the spoiler.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-fresh-opportunity-in-nepal/article5401836.ece
29,11,2013,Beyond the here and now,"The note of caution from the Oxford Martin Commission for Future Generations on the risks of a short-term approach to global governance merits consideration. Of paramount importance is the call in its report, “Now for The Future,” to build global institutions fit to purpose for the 21st century. Currently, countries with a diminishing stake retain disproportionate power, while four times as many states, not to mention civil society groups, sit around decision-making fora, it points out. Drawn from leading figures in politics, business and academia, the authors of the report cite approvingly the Group of 20 countries as a contemporary model of inclusive multilateral cooperation. Accounting for 80 per cent of the world’s gross domestic product, a two-thirds of the global population and 80 per cent of world trade, the G20 countries demonstrated their collective influence during the Asian and global financial crises. The 1989 Montreal Protocol, which led to a complete phase-out of chlorofluorocarbon production and contained ozone depletion, is the other example of realising shared interests. Global leadership in the public health arena was demonstrable also in the 2003 ratification of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.
The unprecedented achievements of the previous century could increase global uncertainty and systemic risk in the absence of a comprehensive and broad vision for the future. For instance, frequent opinion polls, longer election campaigns, and pressures from vocal lobbies are constraining governments in terms of thinking and articulating a vision beyond the electoral term. A focus on current stock prices rather than value creation over the longer term, quarterly earnings targets and the perverse system that rewards short-term investors are also equally instances of the preoccupation with the immediate and the here and now. To address the gap between available knowledge and possible action on critical global challenges, the Commission has recommended the creation of a 20-30-40 coalition to counteract climate change and to break the gridlock on multilateral negotiations. Besides the G20 nations, the coalition should comprise the 30 cities affiliated to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the existing C40 Cities initiative. CyberEx, an early warning platform to understand common threats to data security, to benefit governments, businesses and individuals, is the other. The scepticism articulated in the report over the capacity of existing institutional arrangements to deliver results for the future is perhaps warranted. That should be read in the right spirit by all nations, particularly those that wield influence in shaping the global architecture.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/beyond-the-here-and-now/article5401837.ece
30,11,2013,Competing promises,"In Rajasthan, the land of the kings, regaining power seems to be easier than retaining power. The last three Assembly elections have gone decisively against the incumbent, with both the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress relying on a strong negative vote to get their turn in government. As Congress Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and BJP leader Vasundhara Raje prepare for a face-off in the December 1 election, the odds are clearly against Mr. Gehlot. Despite initiating some social welfare schemes in the last five years, the Chief Minister knows he will also be judged by what his opponents propose to do in the next five. Not surprisingly, both parties have come up with competing populist election manifestos promising many things to most people. The Congress manifesto promises five lakh jobs in the next five years. Whether this would find favour with the electorate is another question since the hard reality is that only one lakh youth found jobs in the last five years of the party’s rule. Gujjars, who have been demanding separate reservation, have now been promised five per cent reservation by the Congress. Special Backward Class communities such as Raika, Banjara and Gaadiya Lohar have also been chosen for the promise of reservation benefits. But some of these might only remain promises if they run into legal hurdles. Given that there was very little forward movement in granting these reservation benefits during the last five years, many in these communities might not take these promises of the ruling party seriously.
At the present political moment, the promises of the main opposition appear to carry more weight than the ruling party. Thus, the BJP’s assurance of removing all constitutional impediments in extending reservation as Special Backward Classes to Gujjars and other tribes seems to hold more meaning for the voters. In terms of numbers too, the BJP outdid the Congress by holding out a promise of 15 lakh jobs. In the 2008 election, one of the highlights of the Congress manifesto was a promise to improve the dismal power situation. It is no credit to the five-year-rule of the Congress that the BJP could find resonance with the voters by promising 24-hour power supply to domestic consumers. The Gehlot government’s performance thus pales in comparison to the BJP’s promises. With the voters having to choose between the Congress and the BJP, dissatisfaction with the Gehlot government automatically translates into votes for the BJP. Only good governance and strong social welfare schemes could have countered the lure of the BJP’s promise. But the Congress’s performance seems to have fallen short when measured against the BJP’s promise.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/competing-promises/article5405658.ece
30,11,2013,Mobility matters,"The global report on human settlements, recently published by UN-HABITAT, is a timely pointer to what is wrong with current transport planning in India. Despite investing heavily in infrastructure projects, the cities have not resolved traffic issues efficiently. After reviewing various policies across the world, this report, with a special focus on planning for sustainable urban mobility, has rightly concluded that unless transport projects and urban planning are integrated, congestion on roads, inefficient use of infrastructure, and sprawling cities would persist. The working group on urban transport for the Twelfth Five-Year Plan has cautioned that in another two decades the average journey speed of vehicles on the major city roads would come down drastically from 26 to 17 km an hour to 8 to 6 km an hour. Along with it, the trip lengths and number of trips made within cities would also double. This would lead to inefficient use of fuel, inordinate wastage of time and more pollution. To address this problem, the Ministry of Urban Development has proposed an investment of Rs.23 lakh crore to build more roads and rail networks by 2031. The hard reality is that even this colossal infrastructure would not guarantee better mobility.
The main problem with Indian cities is the disconnect between growth and transportation grids. Unlike cities such as Curitiba in Brazil, public transport does not guide their growth. Real estate forces shape them. As a result, the suburbs either lie scattered or grow linearly. The distances between them, the core-city and places where jobs are concentrated increases. Developing a fast lane road network alone cannot change the inefficient travel pattern. What are required are compact neighbourhoods built around mass transport links. To achieve this, the National Mission on Sustainable Habitat recommended that new developments should not be encouraged unless local-street grids are developed, and they must abut existing developed areas with a minimum density of 175 inhabitants a hectare. These recommendations have remained only on paper. Where public transport exists, lack of last mile connectivity between residential neighbourhoods and station points in the form of pedestrian pathways and bicycle tracks has impeded their use. Cities have not innovated institutionally too. Only a few have created the Unified Metropolitan Transport Authorities to integrate different modes of transport and connect them with urban planning. Where present, UMTA is besieged with problems. For instance, in Chennai, the government is yet to notify the UMTA Act that gives it the legal backing. Comprehensive planning alone can relieve our choking cities.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mobility-matters/article11761831.ece
2,12,2013,The challenge of 5 per cent growth,"India’s GDP grew at 4.8 per cent for the second quarter of the current year, July-September 2013. The data, released by the Central Statistics Office on Friday, are entirely in line with expectations. Together with the 4.4 per cent clocked in the first quarter, which marked a four-year low, economic growth during the first half of the year has been a meagre 4.6 per cent. Policymakers are banking on much higher growth rates — in the vicinity of 5.5 per cent — during each of the remaining quarters to pull the economy out of the sub-5 per cent growth trajectory. In 2012-13, the economy grew by 5 per cent, the lowest annual rate of growth in a decade. Companies shelved their investment plans in an uncertain and often adverse policy environment, while consumers cut back on spending in the face of high borrowing costs. The challenge has been to revive investment demand and spur consumer spending. There are no easy answers. Great significance is attached to the clearance of stalled and new projects by a special cabinet committee. However, it is too early to measure outcomes. Persistently high inflation and well-entrenched inflation expectations have dragged consumption down.
A more optimistic view is that the economy has seen its worst, and from now on a recovery is quite possible. Supporting this view is the mild upturn in industry and a sharp pick-up in agriculture. Industry rose by 2.4 per cent in the second quarter from a meagre 0.2 per cent in the previous quarter, on the back of improvement in the core sectors of mining, utilities and construction. The revival in exports has certainly helped in achieving a turnaround in manufacturing. It grew by 1 per cent in the second quarter compared to a decline by an identical margin in the first. Yet, too much should not be read at this stage into the improvement in this critical sector. However, agricultural growth — at 4.6 per cent compared to 2.7 per cent in the April-June quarter — might well be sustained and in fact spearhead overall recovery in the latter part of the year. The biggest dampener, however, is likely to be in one important sub-sector of services — community, social and personal services. Often considered to be a proxy for government spending, its growth rate has slumped to 4.2 per cent from 9.4 per cent in the first quarter. The government has the unenviable task of reining in fiscal deficits to within 4.8 per cent without drastically cutting down on essential government spending. Without this, a growth rate of 5 per cent or more will be unattainable.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-challenge-of-5-per-cent-growth/article5411215.ece
2,12,2013,Iran and West Asian tensions,"The November 24 deal reached in Geneva by Iran and what has come to be called the P5+1 group of nations - the U.S., the U.K., Russia, China, France and Germany plus Iran, may have settled one question over Iran’s temporary curb on part of its nuclear programme in return for a partial removal of Western sanctions, but it has opened up several issues of the greatest significance to West Asia. For example, Iran is now a potentially valuable partner for the United States as Washington prepares to withdraw most of its troops from Afghanistan in 2014. Tehran can help stabilise the country and deter the Taliban; in fact, Iranian troops briefly assisted the U.S. there in 2001. Secondly, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani could help effect a settlement in Syria, where the Shia President, Bashar al Assad’s bitter obduracy has prevented a settlement and caused over 100,000 deaths in a terrible civil war, over which Western public opinion is strongly opposed to military intervention. Thirdly, Tehran already has considerable influence over Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki in Iraq, where the illegal 2003 U.S-led invasion provided space for revived Sunni-Shia tensions which still cause thousands of deaths every year. Furthermore, Kurdish and even Sunni political groups have for some time now drawn on Iranian advice in forming Iraqi provincial coalition governments and resolving disputes.
Needless to say, the Geneva deal has shocked most West Asian leaders. Saudi Arabia, which sees Iran as its greatest theological rival, has openly expressed its disquiet, but West Asian Arab countries made no attempt to participate at Geneva; indeed since 2008, proposals by Bahrain, by Iran itself, and by the former Arab League head Amr Moussa for regional security talks have come to nothing. In addition, Riyadh’s attempts to undermine Mr. Assad in Damascus and Mr. al Maliki in Baghdad have both failed. The standard responses to perceived security threats, such as using oil wealth to buy more weapons, even possibly including a nuclear umbrella, will not help the Arab leaders, because Iran is already cooperating with the G6, and increased weapons purchases would worsen a destabilising arms race. As for Israel, which shares many of the Arab countries’ interests, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is prepared to do ‘anything necessary’ to defend his country, and continues to approve settlements in the occupied territories. But the Arab leaders and Israel now face a radically altered political grammar, which they are struggling to understand. Above all, Mr. Rouhani has unquestionable democratic legitimacy, and even if justice for the Palestinians and democratic reforms in West Asia seem remote at present, it may not be long before those two issues are rightly at the top of the agenda again.

3,12,2013,Traditional rivals discomfited,"As the national capital, Delhi has always attracted interest disproportionate to its size. Even so, there is more than the usual excitement around the Assembly elections this time, because of the entry of a feisty newcomer, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) led by Arvind Kejriwal. The new party’s chutzpah and daring are evident enough. Indeed, Mr. Kejriwal has already announced that he will be forming the next government, much to the annoyance of the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party, which find themselves suddenly having to deal with an unforeseen rival. Delhi had its first full-fledged Assembly election as recently as 1993, following the upgradation of its territorial status, with its own Legislative Assembly and Council of Ministers. Though the BJP pulled off a sensational first victory in 1993, it has since been in the wilderness, having lost to the Congress three consecutive elections. The BJP’s failure was at least in part due to its inability to produce a leader capable of taking on the redoubtable Sheila Dikshit. Under Chief Minister Dikshit, Delhi has been transformed from an urban village to a sprawling, glitzy metropolis boasting a fine network of roads and flyovers, not to mention a metro rail service that has become the lifeline of the city.
In the last 15 years, an entire generation has grown up that has no personal knowledge of the power outages and traffic congestion that once defined Delhi. Yet it is entirely the fault of the Congress that today there are few takers for Delhi’s fantastic growth story. Instead, the most compelling election issues are corruption and inflation, which are seen as the primary legacy of a government increasingly viewed as self-serving and arrogant, with little interest in the welfare of the people. In 1998, the BJP lost to the Congress because of runaway onion prices. In 2013, it is the Congress’s turn to feel the heat on high food inflation. But just when it seemed that the BJP will finally have its revenge on the Congress, entered the untested AAP with its claim to root out money power and deliver clean and efficient governance. Sceptics have naturally questioned the AAP’s bagful of promises which include 700 litres of free water for every household, reduction of power tariffs by half, and decentralisation by devolving power to mohalla sabhas or local neighbourhoods. But more than all this, what explains the visible voter interest in the AAP is its idealism, which is in fact its USP. Whatever the ultimate fate of the new entity, it has undoubtedly livened up the election run-up — and queered the pitch for the Congress and the BJP.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/traditional-rivals-discomfited/article5415020.ece
3,12,2013,Look Northeast,"It came a little late, but New Delhi’s realisation that its long neglect of the northeastern States had proved costly both for nation-building and India’s strategic interests has led to a more proactive approach to the region in the last decade. These efforts, though, are still nowhere near what they should be. During his three-day tour of Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland, President Pranab Mukherjee rightly underlined the shortcomings, urging political leaders, policymakers and administrators to give “the utmost importance and attention” to the region. Connected to India only by a narrow corridor, and sharing borders with five of India’s neighbours — Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Myanmar and Nepal — the Northeast has potential that is far from being realised. Though it has been repeatedly held up as the gateway for India’s Look East policy, the country’s growth story has left the region behind. While the Northeast itself aspires to take advantage of India’s increasing ties with East Asia, it is hardly in a position to do so. While some social indicators for the northeastern States, such as health and literacy, are far better than in other Indian States, they lag behind in many others. Infrastructure development — roads, railway lines and air links, and power generation — is woefully inadequate. A study published earlier this year by the Indian Chamber of Commerce estimated that between 2011 and 2021 the region would create a mere 2.6 million jobs, while the number of job-seekers is likely to be eight times that number.
In his address to mark the 50th anniversary of the creation of Nagaland, President Mukherjee spoke about the role of the people of the State in “establishing and maintaining a peaceful environment” so that it could prosper — an allusion to the Naga separatist insurgency, which has given way to a ceasefire and peace talks but no settlement yet. It is significant that the President appealed to both the Centre and State governments in the region to ensure that the people of the Northeast can take their due place in India. In Arunachal Pradesh, his reiteration of the State as an “integral and important part of the North East region”, in an address to the Legislative Assembly, was predictably followed by a statement by China that its position on the “disputed area ... is consistent and clear-cut.” Reflecting the recent improvement in ties, the reaction was not as sharp as in 2009, when Beijing said it was “deeply upset” by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s visit to the State. The problem will not go away soon. The challenge for New Delhi is to shore up its territorial claims with speedy efforts to ensure that the State is developed, and better integrated, and connected, with the rest of the region and the country.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/look-northeast/article5415021.ece
4,12,2013,Dangerous opportunism,"Telangana is now close to statehood on the strength of an untiring, intense mass struggle that had its basis in the assertion of historical political identities. To allow electoral calculations to decide the contours of the new state is to undermine the legitimacy of the aspirations that fuelled the original demand for statehood. Nothing but sheer political opportunism explains the new proposal to enlarge the proposed state by adding two districts of the Rayalaseema region, Kurnool and Anantapur, to create what in popular parlance has come to be known as Rayala-Telangana. This idea that has sprung out of cynical political calculations is ill-conceived, militating as it does against considered rationale for state formation. The proposal for Telangana in its original form includes only ten districts of Andhra Pradesh. That there is no popular underpinning for this concept either from the Telangana movement or the two districts shows that it is a politically-driven calculation. To think such a forced political union could solve some of the difficulties in sharing water resources post-bifurcation is naïve. If anything, the merger would add to the existing difficulties arising out of the bifurcation.
Although the backwardness of the Telangana region and the perceived political neglect were among the reasons that sustained the statehood demand, the redress sought by the Telangana movement was political, and not economic. Both Kurnool and Anantapur are backward like most of Telangana, but this is no reason for the people of the two districts to share any regional affinity with those in the proposed state. The people of Telangana insist on the implementation of the Mulki rules that specify domicile conditions for recruitment in government services. The differentiation between Mulkis (locals) and non-Mulkis is deep-rooted in Telangana. Thus, the forced union of the two districts with the new state of Telangana can only leave the peoples of both regions unhappy. While fast-tracking the creation of Telangana, the Central government seems to have placed a heavy emphasis on the interests of the Congress as a party. The proposal for Rayala-Telangana is evidently meant to help the Congress make gains in the next election by undercutting the popular support of its main rivals, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi and the YSR Congress. Indeed, the Cabinet cleared the statehood demand only after the Congress Working Committee passed a resolution favouring Telangana. The government is tailing the party. Rank political opportunism and sordid electoral calculations must not be allowed to undermine the serious institutional process of state formation, and put in jeopardy the lives and security of the people.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dangerous-opportunism/article5418658.ece
4,12,2013,Transforming bilateral ties,"Through the last decade, India and Japan have made determined efforts to transform their bilateral ties. The week-long two-city state visit to India by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko is evidence that those efforts have been successful. The Japanese emperor strictly stays away from politics, but his visits abroad are high in symbolism, usually signifying an important juncture in Japan’s relations with that country. After hitting a low in 1998 when Japanese sanctions against India for the Pokharan nuclear tests left relations crippled for more than two years, bilateral ties have grown rapidly within a short time to embrace a strategic partnership and defence links. Constant high-level interaction — the annual India-Japan summit, the regular exchanges between the two defence ministers, a “two plus two” dialogue involving the foreign and defence secretaries, a dialogue on maritime security, and a trilateral dialogue that includes the United States — has kept up the momentum. The two countries are also part of the G4 nations that recently intensified efforts towards text-based negotiations on the expansion of the U.N. Security Council. The Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement has boosted trade ties, though the movement of professionals it was meant to facilitate is yet to take off. Japan has been generous with financial assistance for infrastructure projects such as the Delhi Metro and the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor. Emperor Akihito’s visit to Chennai testifies to the significant Japanese investment in Indian industry, especially automobiles, a dominant sector in Tamil Nadu.
What has remained elusive though is a civilian nuclear agreement. At their last summit in May 2013, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe directed their officials to “accelerate” negotiations towards this. But it will not be easy. Tokyo is interested, and so are Japanese vendors looking for markets abroad after Japan’s decision to cut down dependence on nuclear energy post-Fukushima. The two sides will take it up when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visits New Delhi next month, but the domestic opposition to any such deal is bound to weigh on his mind. The healthy state of India-Japan relations is best seen in its own terms rather than as a result of a shared wariness of China. New Delhi and Beijing are engaged in improving relations at various levels, while China-Japan relations are a separate category. For all the sparring, their bilateral trade exceeds $300 billion, and contacts between the two countries exist at many levels. It would be absurd to construe Emperor Akihito’s India visit, planned many months ago, as a move to counter China against the backdrop of new tensions in the East China Sea.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/transforming-bilateral-ties/article5418659.ece
5,12,2013,Sharpen the focus,"With its long history of communal violence, India certainly needs a specific law with a strong focus on preventing clashes between the majority community and minorities and providing reparations to the victims of such violence. The present revised draft of the Prevention of Communal Violence (Access to Justice and Reparations) Bill seeks to address some of the problems associated with communal violence in India, and put in place an institutional mechanism for redress. Whatever the immediate trigger for communal clashes, they are engineered and sustained by chauvinist and anti-social elements in both the majority and minority communities. Communal clashes by definition are starkly different from ordinary law and order disturbances. That there is an institutional bias against minorities and oppressed sections has been shown up repeatedly during times of communal violence. A special legislation that takes into account the specific character and circumstances of communal violence is therefore vital and unquestionable.
But vitiating the earnestness of purpose in the enactment of this legislation is the fact that some of the provisions of the bill are too sweeping to address the real concerns that it intends to address. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa has pointed out that many of the provisions are worded vaguely, open to wide subjective interpretation, and hence misuse. Instead of a sharp focus on communal violence, the bill proposes to target “hate propaganda” too. Thus, anyone who disseminates any information “that could reasonably be construed to demonstrate an intention to promote or incite hatred” could attract the penal provisions of this law. Preventing communal violence requires better policing and administrative precautions rather than just prosecuting people who indulge in propaganda with the “intention” to promote hatred. In the absence of specific phrasing, there is scope for misuse by subordinate law enforcers. In its present form, the draft bill also encroaches on the rights of the States, given that law and order is a State subject. The proposed legislation gives ample room for intervention by the Centre in an area falling under the jurisdiction of the States. While there is no denying that India needs special legislation to deal with communal violence, the draft bill currently being circulated is unlikely to serve the purpose. It is important that the bill is redrafted to ensure a sharper focus on the specific issues of prevention of communal violence and reparation. The failure to eliminate the contentious provisions that are in any case too general and sweeping could endanger the passage of a potentially historic piece of legislation which in effect institutionalises a commitment on the part of government to the preservation of national harmony.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sharpen-the-focus/article5422338.ece
5,12,2013,New bird flu strains,"If the bird flu strain H7N9 emerged in China in March this year, causing infections in about 134 people and killing 43, another novel bird flu strain, H6N1, emerged this May in Taiwan. Unlike the H7N9 strain, the latest one has infected just one person, a 20-year-old woman who presented with typical influenza-like symptoms. What is puzzling is that she had not come in contact with poultry and did not travel outside the country for up to three months prior to infection. This leaves the transmission pathway inconclusive. Yet, there are indications that the source could be poultry as the H6N1 strain has been endemic in poultry in Taiwan since 1972. Strengthening the possibility of the source is the prevalence of the virus with the same mutation (G228S substitution in the haemagglutinin) in poultry as the one isolated from the woman. If the H6N1 virus with the particular mutation was found in a few chicken in Taiwan since 2000, it became widely prevalent since 2005. As in the case of other bird flu strains, the mutation that gave H6N1 the ability to infect humans originated from a reassortment, possibly of the H5N2 and H6N1 viruses. Besides the unknown transmission pathway, the concern is the unknown causal factor that made the six close contacts of the woman develop a respiratory-tract infection or fever.
The fact that there is only one case of confirmed infection and that the woman has responded well to treatment indicate the strain has not yet acquired transmissibility and lacks the lethality required to cause a pandemic. Yet, H6N1 underlines the inevitability of strains emerging and acquiring the ability to jump from its animal host to humans. The Taiwan virus turns the spotlight on the need for laboratory studies to assess the virulence and transmissibility of possible influenza viruses that may emerge through reassortment. The controversial research earlier by two groups of scientists who undertook experiments to create H5N1 mutant viruses in the lab very nearly divided the scientific community in 2011. The experiments were undertaken to understand possible ways in which the H5N1 virus might mutate and spread in humans. Such experiments were opposed on biosafety and biosecurity considerations. But these concerns have been allayed, with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services introducing a review process before funding any such research. While it is currently reviewing experiments on H7N9, H6N1 may possibly be the next candidate.

6,12,2013,Posturing over airspace,"China’s move to implement an Air Defence Identification Zone in the East China Sea has sparked concern among its eastern neighbours and the United States. That the ADIZ so marked includes the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands — whose ownership is contested by China and Japan — has riled Japan and the U.S., prompting Washington to send B-52 bombers over the Zone. China admittedly is well within its rights to demarcate such an ADIZ. Air defence identification zones serve as buffer airspace for countries, extending in some cases beyond territorial waters. It is the prerogative of littoral states to determine how they should respond to civilian or military aircraft entering an ADIZ. The U.S. and Canada have identified air defence zones that cover hundreds of miles beyond their territorial seas — the U.S., however, maintains that only military aircraft are required to inform the authorities while crossing this space and that too if they intend to fly towards the mainland. India has marked six such zones hugging its coastline, with stringent clearance requirements for all aircraft entering them. Whether China has unilaterally implemented an ADIZ is inconsequential and it is conceivable that air defence zones of neighbouring countries may overlap. Japan, for instance, identified an ADIZ bordering Taiwan earlier this year without consulting Taipei, stoking a controversy.
The question, then, is not one of legality but propriety. Some directives contained in China’s ADIZ announcement were rather alarming. China’s announcement that its “armed forces would adopt defensive emergency measures” — presumably going well beyond identification or interception — against non-cooperating aircraft, was problematic especially in the light of a standing dispute over some territories in the Zone. The Chinese government may have intended to remind the U.S. that it is the dominant power in the region. Yet ironically, this episode has brought the U.S. and its allies together in a huddle. Beijing must also now contend with its increasingly vocal nationalist constituency that has been demanding “countermeasures” against violating aircraft. The U.S. too must desist from creating further friction in the region. After an initial display of bravado in sending bomber planes over the ADIZ, the U.S. has asked its commercial aircraft to “operate consistent with notices to airmen issued by foreign countries.” China should now respond in kind and assuage the legitimate concerns of its Asian neighbours. The Chinese Defence Ministry’s clarification that the “Zone does not aim at any specific country or target, nor does it constitute a threat to any country or region,” is a welcome measure.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/posturing-over-airspace/article5426471.ece
6,12,2013,Persisting challenges,"On the face of it, the improvement in the balance of payments data during the second quarter of this year compared to earlier reporting periods looks nothing less than spectacular. According to the RBI, India’s current account deficit (CAD) narrowed sharply to $5.2 billion (1.2 per cent of GDP) in the second quarter from $21 billion (5.0 per cent) during the corresponding period last year. It was also much lower than the 4.9 per cent in the first quarter. The sharp fall is attributed to a contraction in the trade deficit to $33.3 billion from $47.8 billion a year ago. Merchandise exports picked up while imports, especially of gold, moderated. Exports increased by 11.9 per cent to $81.2 billion on the back of significant growth in leather and textile exports. On the other hand merchandise imports at $114.5 billion recorded a steeper decline of 4.8 per cent on a year on year basis. Gold imports fell steeply to $3.9 billion compared to $16.4 billion in the preceding quarter and $11.1 billion a year ago.
Indisputably, some deft policy moves aided by some fortuitous circumstances have made the external economy look much stronger than it was barely three months ago. The gyrations in the rupee-dollar exchange rate say it all. The free fall of the rupee in August was both the cause and the consequence of prevailing macroeconomic uncertainty. It exposed in no uncertain terms the perils of overdependence on short-term capital flows to fund the current account. This is amply reflected in the latest BOP data: net portfolio investment outflows were of the order of $6.6 billion, almost matching the inflows under foreign direct investment. Altogether in the first half of the year, reserves were down by more than $10 billion despite the vast improvement in the CAD. The rupee’s path towards relative stability since then reflects, above all, a considerable improvement in the external economy. The RBI’s unconventional measures to shore up the rupee, such as through opening a separate window for oil companies, have also helped. Exports have received a major fillip in the wake of the rupee’s depreciation. But the narrowing of the CAD is also due to continued weakness in non-gold, non-oil imports. Any acceleration in growth will push up the import bill of these items. Finally, government policies might have sharply curtailed gold imports but the underlying demand for gold remains, and indications are that it will be met through smuggling. The battle for securing the current account on a more permanent basis is far from over.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/persisting-challenges/article5426472.ece
7,12,2013,Nelson Mandela,"The world has lost one of the greatest figures of the 20th century in the passing of Nelson Mandela, iconic revolutionary who ended apartheid in South Africa. Africa’s last great statesman, Mandela presided over a largely peaceful political transition and stepped aside after only one term in power. He was the >first black President of South Africa and under his aegis, the country dismantled the institutional legacy of apartheid and racism. He remained the country’s moral compass in the silence of his twilight in much the same way he served as the liberation movement’s rallying cry through 27 years of incarceration. He appointed a Truth and Reconciliation Commission that might have fallen short of conclusively addressing apartheid-era atrocities but saved the nation from a descent into bloodshed. The former President is being mourned across the nation. His loss is most acutely felt at the headquarters of the African National Congress (ANC), the party he joined in 1943 and subsequently led to electoral victory in 1994. In a manner reminiscent of the Indian National Congress (INC) in post-Independence India, the ANC has long used Mandela’s name and liberation credentials to cement its position as the natural party of government. The prolonged and often acrimonious squabbling between the government, his heirs and sections of the party about his hospitalisation, burial site and memorial foundation underscored his continued importance to the ANC’s project of political hegemony long after his retirement.
>Mandela’s death comes at the time when the ANC is preparing for an election that may see its share of the vote fall below 60 per cent, illustrating creeping voter discontent. Moving forward, the ANC’s greatest challenge is likely to be the “born frees”, a generation of South Africans born after the collapse of the hated colonial regime, who are less susceptible to the party’s emotive message of liberation. For these young citizens, the most poignant reminder of oppression is the one that Mr. Mandela did not address — land, natural resources and the ownership of Africa’s richest economy. Rather than democratising the economy, Mr. Mandela’s successors have used so-called black empowerment programmes to enrich a tiny elite, creating space for a mass politics as espoused by Julius Malema, a firebrand former ANC Youth League leader who has launched his own political front, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). Mr. Malema is himself facing charges of corruption, suggesting the EFF may not be the ANC’s most potent foe. Statesmen are forged and ultimately limited by the circumstances of their struggles. By leading his country out of the horrors of racial segregation, Mr. Mandela has won his place in history. His successors must now seek their own.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/nelson-mandela/article5430668.ece
7,12,2013,Shameful neglect,"If the central message of the need for more toilets to stop >open defecation in India got lost in the “more toilets than temples” controversy last year, the > joint estimate for the year 2011 by the World Health Organization and UNICEF of the number of people who defecate in the open is yet another reminder of why the country has to address this issue on a war-footing. In the absence of toilets, more than 620 million people, or over half of India’s population, are forced to practise open defecation. This is yet another development index where India’s extremely poor performance has ‘helped’ it retain the dubious distinction of having the most people in the world defecating in the open. That Bihar alone has a higher rate than any other country in the world to continue this practice speaks volumes of how much the country lags behind. While the government’s mission to rid the country of this practice by 2022 and 50 per cent of all gram panchayats by 2017 is laudable, it is an ambitious goal. For instance, if nearly 74 per cent did not have access to toilets in 1990, the figure declined to only about 50 per cent in 2011. Besides other countries, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal have achieved the most improvement during 1990-2011. By reducing it from 32 per cent to 4 per cent during 1990-2011, Bangladesh has fared extremely well. The reduction has been about 50 per cent in the case of Nepal (84 to 43 per cent) and Pakistan (52 to 23 per cent) during the same period. But the rate of decline may accelerate in the years to come with the government increasing last year the amount to be spent for household toilets in rural areas from Rs.4,600 to Rs.10,000.
Financial incentives alone cannot end or drastically reduce the percentage of people continuing with this practice. If other countries have achieved it, there is no reason why India cannot do it. The need to aggressively address the issue cannot be overemphasised as open defecation affects children, especially those below five, the most. This practice causes diarrhoea, one of the most common communicable diseases in India and a number one killer of young children. Frequent diarrhoeal events result in under-nutrition. That explains why nearly 50 per cent of under-five children in rural areas are stunted, wasted and underweight. Children weakened by this disease are in turn more prone to opportunistic infections such as pneumonia. Now, a World Bank report released recently goes beyond the well known physical impact. It found a link between open defecation and reduced cognitive achievements.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/shameful-neglect/article5430669.ece
9,12,2013,The rout of the Congress,"For the Congress, the humiliation in Delhi was more crushing than the defeats elsewhere. More ignominious than the failure to win Madhya Pradesh after two successive defeats and the fall of the Congress government in Rajasthan was the party’s miserable third-place finish in Delhi. The Congress trailed way behind the Aam Aadmi Party led by Arvind Kejriwal, which has made a sparkling debut. The close finish in Chhattisgarh was poor compensation for the total rout in the other three States. The party was left grappling with the long-term implications of having lost so much ground to the AAP in Delhi. The extraordinary rise of the AAP testified to the success of the team of activists led by Mr. Kejriwal in drawing new volunteers outside of the traditional political class who effectively channelled the sense of public disgust with mainstream parties. The four States together send 72 members to the Lok Sabha, and the Congress would now have to acknowledge that its principal rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party, is the front runner for the bigger battle in 2014. Yet, given that these four States were primarily sites of bipolar contests between the BJP and the Congress, this verdict cannot be construed as a “semi-final”, as some analysts are inclined to argue. First, the 2014 general election will take place on a larger canvas with more leading players such as the regional parties, and the verdict will reflect this complex interplay. This said, there is no denying that in the race to be the single largest party in the next Lok Sabha, the BJP is surely ahead. To attract potential allies, especially from among fence-sitting regional players and to forge seat-sharing agreements before the next election, it is essential to be seen as the party most likely to head the next government at the Centre.
While the results certainly boost the BJP’s chances in 2014, it would be premature to read these as an unqualified endorsement of the party’s Hindutva brand of politics. For instance, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the star performer of the party and a charismatic leader in his own right, has led the BJP to victory in Madhya Pradesh for the second time. He sought a renewed mandate on the basis of his development schemes and welfare projects and has evidently succeeded. Likewise, in Chhattisgarh, the BJP under Raman Singh banked on food subsidies to win votes. In Rajasthan, the BJP rode on the strong anti-incumbency sentiment, bringing Vasundhara Raje back to another term in office. The Congress government under Ashok Gehlot failed miserably to make an impact; the development work in the State was uneven, and some of the populist schemes did not reach all the intended beneficiaries. In Delhi, the AAP ran a high-voltage campaign against corruption and the established political class, but the principal beneficiary of the anti-Congress wave was the BJP, which too kept the focus on corruption and rising prices. If the BJP is seeking to sharpen the ideological divide over secularism by nominating Narendra Modi as its prime ministerial candidate ahead of the Assembly elections, there is little evidence from this round of elections that such a strategy will deliver guaranteed victories on the ground. Mr. Modi was omnipresent as the BJP’s face, yet the campaign stars were clearly the local leaders, and the issues dominant in the election discourse were livelihood and social security concerns.
There is no denying that Mr. Modi has injected some vigour into the BJP’s election strategy with his aggressive campaign style. The Gujarat strongman has expanded his sphere of influence well beyond his home State in the months since he was elevated to the national stage as the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate. Even among those who disagree with his polarising politics are those who appreciate his decisiveness, and his pro-growth measures and relatively corruption-free governance in Gujarat. If anything, Mr. Modi has also been under pressure to reinvent himself as a mass leader showcasing a development-oriented agenda. Given the apparent ineffectiveness of an enfeebled Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the Gujarat Chief Minister has managed to present himself as a national alternative who can carry his party with him on all important issues. There is as yet no exact measure of the Modi effect in the Assembly elections. What is certain is that the new political energy that Mr. Modi has brought into the BJP’s national election campaign would be a consolidating factor at the national level.
In sum, while the four States are not representative of the rest of India, they offer strong indications of the trend of public opinion in major States of the Hindi heartland. In some of the other States, the Congress is pitted against regional or Left parties, and not directly against the BJP. In some others, the regional parties are the main players with little or no role for either the Congress or the BJP. After two terms in government, and a series of scams that led to the resignation of Ministers, the Congress-led UPA is likely to lose seats to the BJP and other parties in the next election. Just as the BJP could not have gained critical mass by relying on Hindutva alone, the Congress cannot hope to continue to win votes by merely targeting the BJP’s communally divisive agenda. Building election planks on scare scenarios too can offer only limited purchase. Whether it is the Congress or the BJP, the message that the voters appear to be sending to the political class is that the party which does not have a credible agenda for governance and development, is likely to perish. The rise of the Aam Aadmi party also signals public alienation from traditional political parties which appear increasingly disconnected from people’s aspirations and expectations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-rout-of-the-congress/article5437120.ece
16,12,2013,The Afghan challenge ahead,"President Hamid Karzai’s visit to India, possibly his last before elections scheduled for April 2014, marks a critical moment in the development of the relationship between India and the new Afghanistan born amid the bloodshed of 9/11. India has been a partner in the process, but Mr. Karzai came asking how much more it might be willing to do. In the spring, the International Security Assistance Force which has provided the backbone of the state since 2001 will begin to return home. Although there are substantial international aid commitments in place, Mr. Karzai has been seeking a reassurance that the country’s most trusted partners will stand by it if things go wrong. He received some comfort from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Following more than a year of deliberation, India has finally committed to providing Afghanistan with the military assistance it seeks under the Strategic Partnership Agreement binding the two allies. The assistance will, for now, be modest. Indian-made light helicopters will join Afghanistan’s fledgling air fleet, while its army will receive transport and logistics equipment. This comes on top of a substantial programme of civilian assistance. Indian engineers have, despite credible Taliban threats, brought the Salma hydro-electric dam near Herat to within a year of completion. Indian experts have been involved in setting up an agricultural university at Kandahar, which Afghans hope will prove an incubator to rebuild livelihoods across the troubled south. India provides over a thousand scholarships every year to Afghan university students, and is building its new Parliament building. Preliminary plans exist for iron ore mining at Hajigak.
India’s investments, measured against overall international aid, are not huge. However, the reservoir of goodwill the assistance has generated is illustrated by the fact that all the competing presidential candidates in 2014 are vocal in their support for a deeper relationship. The reasons are rooted in history. Before 9/11, India, along with Iran and Russia, was at the heart of the small coalition of states which nurtured the struggle against the Pakistan-backed Taliban and al-Qaeda. India provided aid to the resistance. India has clear interests in helping build a democratic Afghanistan. The alternative is the empowerment of jihadist organisations which threaten peace and stability in the region. For a decade now, India’s low-key partnership has piggy-backed on the western presence in Afghanistan. The day may not be far, though, when India, with others, finds itself called on to do more. New Delhi must start considering the challenges that lie ahead.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-afghan-challenge-ahead/article5463120.ece
16,12,2013,A troubling practice,"Nationalistic outrage aside, the arrest of an Indian diplomat in New York for giving false information to obtain a visa for her domestic worker, and paying her less than the local minimum wage, has shone well-deserved light on a troubling practice that many Indians unfortunately think is normal. Devyani Khobragade is not the first Foreign Service officer caught on the wrong end of the law in the host country on charges relating to treatment of a domestic employee. The human aspect of the controversy and the seriousness of the visa fraud charge are at times lost through the shift of focus to technical and procedural issues, relevant as they are. While it is for the courts to pronounce on Ms. Khobragade’s conduct, there is no moral high ground to be claimed on this issue. It is well known that exploitative practices against domestic workers are rampant in India. With unskilled labour plentiful, and domestic labour comprising the lowest section in this category, there is no minimum or maximum age of employment, no fixed work hours, and certainly no minimum wage. Indians posted abroad are loathe to hire locals to do household work, especially in the West, as minimum wages are fixed, and translate into much more than what they would pay back home; the terms and conditions of employment too are not malleable, with specified holiday and leave requirements. Uncaring about violating local laws, they end up taking “the help” with them on Indian wages, sometimes even showing her as a member of the family for visa purposes. Ms. Khobragade was only hewing close to type, going by the charges against her, even though as a senior government official, she should have known better. The Ministry of External Affairs should put an end to the practice of its officials taking domestic staff with them abroad.
As a consular official, Ms. Khobragade does not have the same extent of immunity under the Vienna conventions as a diplomat in an embassy. In the United States, consular officials can be arrested for a serious crime on the basis of a warrant. It is of course debatable if the offence she is charged with falls in the category of felony, particularly as she was released on bail within a few hours. The dramatic manner of the arrest, which included handcuffing, is unusual treatment for any person, even if one were to disregard her consular status. Also, there is nothing to suggest she was about to flee the country. Sensibly, New Delhi made no claim of immunity for the official. While standing in solidarity with the official against the manner of her arrest, the government has also rightly made it clear that she will be available for the court proceedings against her.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-troubling-practice/article5463124.ece
17,12,2013,A law long overdue,"When a bill that has eluded a political consensus for decades comes close to actual enactment, cynicism must give way to pragmatism and hope. The Lokpal Bill, passed in the Lok Sabha in an earlier form two years ago but now amended on the basis of the report of a Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha, is likely to be approved soon by the Upper House and sent back to the lower chamber for fresh passage. The Union government has dropped the provisions relating to establishing Lok Ayuktas at the State level. Instead, the Bill says States should put in place their own institutions within one year. A composite law may be preferable from the people’s point of view, but the concession is in deference to the need to federalise the anti-corruption domain. Contrary to what its critics say, the bill cannot be dismissed as weak; nor can it be seriously contended that the Lokpal does not have an independent investigative mechanism. The Central Bureau of Investigation has been placed at the disposal of the Lokpal, which will have superintendence over that agency in cases under its consideration. The need for sanction from the respective governments to initiate prosecution has been waived for cases cleared by the Lokpal. The CBI Director’s appointment will be on the basis of a statutory process, and the Lokpal will have its own inquiry and prosecution wings.
A significant factor that informs the urgency shown by the political class in putting in place the anti-graft institution is the perception highlighted by the results of the Delhi Assembly election that large sections of society are disillusioned with mainstream parties that are seen as tolerant of corruption. The crusade for such a law initiated by Anna Hazare, along with the success of the Aam Aadmi Party based on the campaign for a Lokpal, has made fresh legislation unavoidable. The development is unlikely to end the debate over the adequacy, independence and effectiveness of the anti-graft institution the new law will put in place, but it will certainly be a milestone in the quest for an institutional mechanism to combat corruption. Voices of criticism on the inadequacies of the new law, some of them suspiciously raised on the eve of its passage, should not deter the two major political parties from closing ranks to get the Lokpal Bill passed in both Houses. However, the mere enactment of this Bill is not enough. The amendment to the Constitution needed to confer constitutional status to the Lokpal and Lok Ayuktas also needs to be passed. And so does the proposed law on the right of citizens to time-bound delivery of goods and services and to have their grievances redressed. Only this will fulfil the need for a strong institutional framework to curb corruption.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-law-long-overdue/article5466470.ece
17,12,2013,A prisoner of his principles,"If politics is the art of the possible, as Otto von Bismarck argued, then Arvind Kejriwal would do well to explore the next best options in Delhi in a situation where his principles do not allow him to either accept the support of other parties or offer his support to them. As the second largest party in a hung Assembly, the Aam Aadmi Party is in a real dilemma. After having grown without the traditional building blocks of caste and communal vote banks, and won support in the election on the basis of a campaign against both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party, the AAP is quite rightly wary of being seen as politically opportunistic in the changed post-election situation. With the BJP expressing its inability to form a government, it is the turn of the AAP to explore the possibilities of giving Delhi a government with a difference. Mr. Kejriwal is justified in wanting to keep a distance from both the BJP and the Congress. But the principled opposition to the traditional political class should not be a handicap in giving the people of Delhi a government in which the AAP can carry through its programme. Instead of ending up as a prisoner of his principles, Mr. Kejriwal should seize the opportunity to provide a government that is in line with his stated principles, free of corruption, and driven solely by the livelihood needs and concerns of the people.
Surely, there is no harm in accepting the support of other parties so long as the agenda is the AAP’s own. Of course, no matter how it is described — conditional or otherwise — support from other parties who have no stake in the government cannot be taken for granted. But such support, as long as it is available, can be put to good use. True, the AAP looked opportunistic and eager to compromise when soon after the elections senior leader Prashant Bhushan offered conditional support to the BJP. The AAP needed to demonstrate it was different from other parties. Also, for a party whose principal founder was initially reluctant to enter electoral politics and wanted to push the people’s agenda for change through mass mobilisation, it would have been unwise to hurriedly grab at the offer of support from the Congress. After meeting Lt. Governor Najeeb Jung, Mr. Kejriwal sought ten days’ time, and quite rightly noted that there was no such thing as “unconditional support” in politics. But by shooting off letters to the Congress and the BJP taking the high moral ground, Mr. Kejriwal ended up appearing too demanding and not very intent on forming a government. The AAP leader seems bent on seeking a fresh mandate without trying his best to make the present mandate work. This all-or-nothing attitude will do little good to either his party or the people of Delhi.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-prisoner-of-his-principles/article5466472.ece
18,12,2013,Unfinished reform,"A year after the brutal Delhi gang rape, institutional responses to sexual violence against women have failed to keep pace with robust efforts by civil society to sensitise the public. In its immediate aftermath, popular, city-based movements rallied around the episode to help victims shed the stigma associated with such crimes. This heightened level of awareness and community support, aided by a vigilant media, contributed to an increase in reporting on sex crimes. The ‘Nirbhaya’ movement also brought to bear on the government enormous pressure to respond strongly against sexual offenders through tougher legislation. Although the United Progressive Alliance did well to incorporate the Justice Verma Committee’s recommendation to amend the Indian Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, it has come up woefully short in implementing the new laws. The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, passed by Parliament in February this year, was notified and given effect to only a week ago. The Ministry of Women and Child Development is yet to formulate a concrete plan to utilise the Rs.1000-crore Nirbhaya Fund that was integrated into the Union Budget this year. On the other hand, State governments are yet to pull up their socks on police reform, especially on the issue of including more women in the force. Without improved policing, it is difficult to see how States can rein in gender-based violence.
The UPA is also yet to act on the Verma Committee’s recommendation to penalise marital rape under criminal law. Further, there has been no debate on the Committee’s recommendation to strip armed forces personnel of the immunity granted under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, 1958 while investigating sexual offences. The Union government has not been the lone culprit. Despite formulating the Vishaka guidelines on sexual harassment at the workplace 16 years ago, the Supreme Court — and numerous High Courts — did not set up their own internal complaints committees until recently. The apex court recently confirmed that its former judge, Asok Kumar Ganguly, had harassed an intern, and thus abused his fiduciary position — the episode has cast the male-dominated higher judiciary in poor light. The media too have been engulfed by the scandal surrounding Tarun Tejpal, who while serving as editor-in-chief of Tehelka is alleged to have raped a journalist working for the magazine. That the guardians of democracy have come up short in their efforts to tackle sexual harassment internally is a grim reminder that the roots of this malaise run deep. The government must sustain the momentum against gender-based violence that the 2012 gang rape provoked to offer better policing and legal protection for women.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unfinished-reform/article5470769.ece
18,12,2013,Ending an uneasy partnership,"With not much to gain and a lot to lose in being seen in the company of the Congress, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam has adopted the only course open to it now: it has ruled out an alliance with the Congress for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The Congress is reeling under an anti-incumbency mood, as is evident from the outcome of Assembly elections in four States. In Tamil Nadu, the national party’s stock is not exactly high, with the Sri Lankan issue adding to its woes. DMK president M. Karunanidhi has also ruled out any tie-up with the Bharatiya Janata Party, arguing that the BJP can no more be the friend it was under Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The DMK’s decision on steering clear of the Congress is consistent with the position it took in March 2013, when it walked out of the United Progressive Alliance. But its detractors will surely remember that it subsequently approached the Congress for support to get its candidate elected to the Rajya Sabha. Both sides must have harboured hopes of a revival of ties, as the Congress high command asked its five legislators to vote for DMK candidate Kanimozhi. It is clear that Mr. Karunanidhi was waiting to know the results of the Assembly elections before spelling out his stand. As the BJP of the Modi era may not be attractive to the DMK, which has been a part of major coalition regimes at the Centre since 1989, Mr. Karunanidhi will have to recalibrate his position as a player in the national scene at the time of the Lok Sabha elections.
However, much depends on how well-equipped he is to take on the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, which has also said it will go it alone. Tamil Nadu may see both the main adversaries entering the electoral fray without one of the principal national parties in alliance, something rare in this multi-party domain. Both the Congress and the BJP may now seek to join hands with the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam led by actor-politician Vijayakanth, but he may not have forgotten that the Congress had initially hinted at backing the DMDK candidate in the Rajya Sabha polls before its MLAs voted in favour of the DMK nominee. The Pattali Makkal Katchi, which wanted to lead a front of minor caste-backed outfits based on a common agenda of diluting laws favouring the Scheduled Castes, may now alter its course and seek some company. The colourful political terrain that is Tamil Nadu may now see a multi-cornered contest for seats that may play a significant role in government-formation at the Centre next year. With the parties other than the Congress, the BJP and the Left uncommitted to any firm ideology beyond their regional interests, their seats may float towards any combine during government formation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ending-an-uneasy-partnership/article5470770.ece
19,12,2013,Outrage and overreaction,"It is not surprising that the details of the treatment to which Devyani Khobragade, the Indian deputy-consul in New York, was subjected after her roadside arrest on charges of fudging her domestic help’s visa forms and underpaying her have caused an uproar. A strip search, examination of body cavities and the possible use of restraints other than handcuffs such as waist chains and shackles, are grossly over-the-top steps to use against any detained person. These are automatic, non-discriminatory and legal post-arrest procedures, but that does not make them any better. Ms. Khobragade, even under her limited consular immunity, was entitled to be treated with dignity. Angered, New Delhi has retaliated by withdrawing certain privileges for United States diplomats based in India. While some of this outrage is justified and rightly seeks to establish that the international diplomatic community lives and works in a world of reciprocal terms and conditions, in the current atmosphere of nationalist fury, it is all too easy to take it too far. The government should take no steps that compromise the security of the U.S. Embassy in Delhi. It must be remembered that under the same Vienna Convention, the host state is under “a special duty” to protect embassy and consular premises.
Never known for taking on the U.S on substantive policy issues, the government’s unusually aggressive reactions — and those of political parties too — on behalf of a diplomat, smell of political considerations ahead of an election. From the Prime Minister and Ministers of Home and External Affairs to the Bahujan Samaj Party leader, everyone has weighed in on her side. In the furore, it has been all but forgotten that there are serious charges against the diplomat, and that the domestic worker is also an Indian. It is certainly odd that the domestic worker’s family was able to obtain visas to travel to the U.S even while Ms. Khobragade’s request to have her traced remained pending. Despite Indian diplomats being embroiled in similar cases in the past, each time blaming the domestic worker’s motives — in all previous cases, the complainant got long-term residency in the U.S — the government has only now started giving serious thought to managing the practice of officials taking domestic staff along on postings abroad. Both sides could have found a mutually acceptable way to defuse the controversy — often in such cases, the issue is closed by withdrawing the diplomat. That the government chose instead to transfer Ms. Khobragade to India’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York, with a view to enhancing her immunity, is questionable and casts India’s claim of a nation ruled by law in poor light.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/outrage-and-overreaction/article5474979.ece
19,12,2013,A wait-and-watch policy,"In a move that has surprised everyone, the Reserve Bank of India in its mid-quarter monetary policy review has not changed either the policy repo rate or the cash reserve ratio (CRR). The repo rate remains at 7.75 per cent and the CRR at 4 per cent. On the eve of the policy statement there was an almost universal expectation that given the levels of inflation the RBI would most certainly hike the interest rate — signalling policy repo rate by at least 0.25 percentage points. Some also expected a change in the CRR. Liquidity levels in the system are comfortable. The extraordinary liquidity tightening measures that were introduced to support the rupee are being wound down. Liquidity conditions have also improved due to higher capital inflows from abroad in the wake of special facilities for banking capital and for non-resident Indians. With all other rates — the reverse repo, the marginal standing facility rate and the bank rate — being pegged to the repo rate and therefore remaining unchanged, the RBI has decisively opted for a status quo in its monetary and liquidity measures. The rest of the policy statement is an elaboration of this stance, which is based on the belief that monetary policy should not always be reactive.
Inflation is no doubt a serious problem: CPI inflation stood at 11.24 per cent in November, its highest level since the new composite index was introduced. Headline WPI inflation at 7.52 per cent has been moving up and is well above the RBI’s comfort level. Underpinning both are high food, especially vegetable, prices. The traditional belief that monetary policy will have little influence over supply side factors has been proved wrong, and irrespective of where inflationary pressures originate they need to be countered with all available policy measures. Persistent inflation reinforces inflation expectations. While maintaining that there is no room for complacency, the RBI feels it has enough reasons to wait and watch. For one thing, there is evidence that vegetable prices have started coming down. Second, the disinflationary impact of stable exchange rates will ease the pressure on prices. Finally, the lagged effects of monetary tightening since July should help. The decision not to raise the rates is obviously a debatable one. There is no room whatsoever for complacency. Should the moderation in prices not pan out as expected, the Reserve Bank says it will take action even outside the policy dates. The traditional policy dilemma of growth versus price stability remains. The latest policy statement reveals a more contemporary dilemma of whether to act immediately against inflation or wait for some time in the expectation of prices moderating. Timing is critical, and the RBI can be expected to remain vigilant.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-waitandwatch-policy/article5474948.ece
20,12,2013,Drowning out reason,"That the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Bill, 2013, to create a new state of Telangana would force a sharp regional divide in the Assembly and the Legislative Council was predictable and understandable. But nothing could reasonably have explained the din and disturbance in the two Houses after the Bill to bifurcate Andhra Pradesh was introduced on the recommendation of the President. The very purpose of the section under Article 3 of the Constitution that mandates a reference to the State is to allow the legislature of the State whose boundaries are being redrawn to express its views on the issue. But instead of a debate, the Houses have only witnessed uproar, with some members tearing up copies of the Bill and some others burning copies. By not allowing a discussion, members belonging to the Seemandhra region who are votaries of a united Andhra Pradesh did their own case no favour. The surest way of making their views heard would be to participate in the discussion on the Bill, and to vote against it — not to prevent any discussion on it. If anti-Telangana members are convinced that they have the numbers to prevent the passage of a resolution approving the Bill, as they claim, then they should not shy away from a debate. Other than making a political point, nothing is to be gained by turning the Assembly and the Council into forums for protest. The place for agitations and protest rallies are outside, on the streets; the legislature is the place for reasoned arguments and purposive voting.
Of course, one reason why the members who are against the Bill want to make just noise without debating and voting against it is that they see a vote against the Bill as having no more than symbolic value. While a Bill on the formation of new states has to necessarily be referred to the legislature of the State whose area or boundary is affected by the Bill, the vote of the legislature is not binding on Parliament. Even so, a vote against the Bill would give those opposed to the creation of Telangana greater moral authority and confidence to carry forward their agitation. Surely, a decisive vote against the Bill after a reasoned debate would better serve the cause of those who stand for a united Andhra Pradesh than a prolonged and unproductive session without any decision on the Bill. The Centre too would be informed of the sense of the House before pushing through a constitutional amendment to facilitate the creation of Telangana. The introduction of the Bill should be an opportunity for pause and reflection, and reasoned and frank debate. Both those who are for the Bill and those who are against it should not allow reason to be drowned out by the din.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/drowning-out-reason/article5479319.ece
20,12,2013,Waking up to human problems,"Amid the furore caused by the arrest of Indian diplomat >Devyani Khobragade in the United States, the release on Thursday of Indian sailors >Sunil James and Vijayan by the authorities in Togo could easily have gone unnoticed. Both sailors were arrested in July this year — by all accounts, they had simply disembarked in Togo to report a pirate attack on their oil tanker. In an apparent instance of confusion, the Togo police charged them with the grave offence of aiding piracy. Criminal proceedings were initiated against both, and their families reliably informed that the trial would go on for an extended period of time. They were released after the Indian High Commissioner in neighbouring Ghana met the President of Togo to present their case. Given that the health of Mr. James and Mr. Vijayan had deteriorated, this diplomatic intervention by Indian and Togolese officials came not a moment too soon. Meanwhile, Mr. James’s son, all of 11 months old, died of illness earlier this month. By securing his release, the Indian government has ensured that the sailor gets to attend his son’s funeral. But it needs mention that the plight of the jailed men was taken up in earnest only after the death of Mr. James’s son came to the attention of the media and public.
In this respect, a common thread runs through the arrests of Ms. Khobragade and the two sailors. Both cases indicate that Indian diplomacy has been too slow to respond to crises that were long in the making. Ms. Khobragade’s harsh treatment at the hands of U.S. authorities is a by-product of India’s inability to tackle a serious legal and humanitarian issue through diplomatic channels. If there was a chance to negotiate a mutually accepted understanding of how U.S. visa rules and minimum wage laws would apply to domestic help employed by Indian diplomats in the country, New Delhi did not exercise it. Similarly, Mr. James and Mr. Vijayan were languishing in a Togo jail for six months before South Block took up their cases. The alacrity with which the Ministry of External Affairs has intervened in Ms. Khobragade’s case sits uncomfortably with its lax attempts to resolve the open-and-shut case involving the sailors. India’s diplomatic establishment needs to formulate a policy that deals with the concerns of Indians abroad — not just of diplomats but of sailors, businesspersons, fishermen and others. As the global and business profile of India increases, it is only natural that more Indians find themselves in legal and diplomatic crosshairs around the world. Resolving their concerns effectively while deferring to the national laws of other states should be accorded a higher priority than has been in evidence.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/waking-up-to-human-problems/article5479316.ece
21,12,2013,Unwise intransigence,"Justice A.K. Ganguly’s holding on to his position as the Chairperson of the West Bengal State Human Rights Commission after being accused by a law intern of improper sexual advances may indicate a justified concern about his hard-earned reputation. Yet, it is clear he has also displayed a petulant unwillingness to recognise that his continuance does great damage to the institutional integrity of his office. After a three-member committee of the Supreme Court said it was of the considered view that the intern’s statement prima facie disclosed “unwelcome verbal/non-verbal conduct of sexual nature” on his part, the honourable thing for him to do must have been to stay away from public office. Yet, even after the gist of the committee’s report was made public by the Chief Justice of India, and after the intern’s affidavit was out in the public domain, presenting in embarrassing detail what had transpired in a hotel in New Delhi on December 24, 2012, Mr. Ganguly has been refusing to quit. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has written to President Pranab Mukherjee seeking his removal from the post and the Attorney General is preparing the terms for a reference to the Supreme Court, as is required for the removal of the chairperson of a State human rights commission.
Mr. Ganguly will indeed get an opportunity to contest the allegation, but the process may lead to the appointment of an enquiry committee. He has to ask himself whether he wants to go through a formal inquiry at all. One would have thought he would spare himself such ignominy. It has now come to light that even before the three-member panel, while denying the allegations, he advanced a technical defence, saying the current sexual harassment law had been enacted only after the incident, and his alleged conduct did not constitute an offence at that time. When Chief Justice P. Sathasivam decided that no further follow-up action was required by the Supreme Court on the intern’s allegation, after finding that she was not on its rolls and the Judge concerned had retired before the incident, there was an impression that there would be no resolute action to pursue the case. The Supreme Court committee’s finding was in itself a clear moral indictment of Justice Ganguly and makes his continuation in the post untenable. The Chief Justice also made it clear that Justice Ganguly had no special immunity from normal investigative processes. The Supreme Court’s decision to disclose the preliminary finding, embarrassing as it might have been to Justice Ganguly, was a welcome instance of transparency in its functioning. One hopes that Justice Ganguly will not be so unwise as to invite by his intransigence a formal order dismissing him for proven misconduct.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unwise-intransigence/article5483538.ece
21,12,2013,Counting tigers more accurately,"When the Ministry of Environment and Forests assessed the status of tigers, other predators and prey in India in 2006 and 2009, it wanted the exercise to become a robust baseline for future conservation programmes. The results published in 2010 claimed an improvement in estimated tiger numbers, at 1,706 individuals compared to 1,411 in 2006. Yet, there appeared to be a contradiction in this, as the geographical area occupied by the charismatic cat was reported to have decreased in some ranges, notably in some Central Indian States and parts of the Western Ghats. A fresh exercise to count the country’s tigers led by the National Tiger Conservation Authority has now been launched. This is an important project, given that India hosts the most number of tigers in the wild. What is interesting is that a mere 10 per cent of the habitat today hosts 90 per cent of the reproducing populations of the big cat. It is this area that needs rigorous monitoring on an annual basis, and not a general count once in four years. Also, the methods used should be open to independent scientific scrutiny, perhaps by a consortium of scientific institutions. Conservation science has come up with credible ways to estimate the density and occupancy of tigers and needs to be used rigorously. The NTCA already has access to research strategies formulated by leading tiger scientists for a focussed monitoring protocol to track source populations of tigers — those that are crucial for the survival of the species. It should employ them fully.
One of the criticisms of the scheme to sample tiger densities — which cost about Rs.12 crore in 2006 according to published accounts — is that it is likely to ignore sharp and rapid declines in populations. The methodology being used since 2006, including camera traps is, of course, an improvement over the unscientific analysis of pugmarks employed for nearly three decades. But the monitoring should be a targeted annual exercise that yields good data to inform policy. At present, although a lot of information is generated for the entire tiger habitat, it does not yield insight into areas of high density. A scientific consortium approach may therefore prove rewarding. Karnataka, for instance, has benefited from involving top scientists in conservation. Given the limited scientific resources at the disposal of the Environment Ministry, and the large external pool of science-based conservation organisations, there should be no hesitation to broaden the scope of monitoring. It is equally important to involve local communities, choosing volunteers who can be trained and deployed along with scientific personnel.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/counting-tigers-more-accurately/article5483539.ece
23,12,2013,Political arrogance on display,"The Maharashtra government’s decision to reject the findings of a judicial commission that has indicted four former Chief Ministers and a dozen civil servants for extending illegal patronage to the controversial Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society constitutes a brazen display of political arrogance. It is in line with its propensity to cover up scandals and question even credible findings. What comes out in the report is the sordid story of political patronage, misuse of power and subversion of law in the perpetration of the Adarsh fraud. The project involved erecting a multi-storeyed residential complex on public property, ostensibly for defence personnel. Yet, beginning with the housing society’s membership, every norm was violated, and every rule in the book either twisted or violated to favour a few. The original list of 40 members had no one from outside the services, but it was soon expanded to cover bureaucrats, politicians, their relatives and army bigwigs. By the time the apartment complex was completed in 2010, the list of beneficiaries had swollen to 102, of which only 37 were related to the defence department. Politicians and bureaucrats connived with the housing society to circumvent development control rules and get a completion certificate, overlooking the need for mandatory environment clearance.
The commission, comprising retired judge J.A. Patil and former Chief Secretary P. Subrahmanyam, has come to the same conclusion as the Comptroller and Auditor General did in a report two years ago. If the audit found that those holding fiduciary responsibility had betrayed it for personal aggrandisement, the commission says the entire issue “smacks of undue haste and [a] desire to bestow benefit on the society”. The government’s rejection of the report came a few days after Maharashtra Governor K. Sankaranarayanan refused sanction to prosecute former Chief Minister Ashok Chavan, who had quit in the aftermath of the controversy. The Governor’s stand that there is insufficient evidence flies in the face of the judicial panel’s finding that there was “a nexus” between Mr. Chavan’s actions and “the benefit derived by his close relatives”. The need for such sanction for offences under the Indian Penal Code is itself legally questionable, as the Supreme Court ruled in 2006 that prosecution for cheating and conspiracy required no prior sanction. And Mr. Chavan is no more in office, obviating the need for sanction under the Prevention of Corruption Act. On the political front, what is inexplicable is that at a time when the national mood is one of disgust at pervasive corruption and when the Congress is seeking credit for the passage of the Lokpal Bill, a government led by the party should brazen it out in the face of a fierce indictment.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/political-arrogance-on-display/article5490110.ece
23,12,2013,The beginning of taper,"It was supposed to be the Damocles’s sword hanging over global markets, including that of India’s, over the last few months. Ultimately, when the U.S. Federal Reserve did announce the start of a tapering of its $85 billion monthly bond-buying programme on December 18, the event set off nothing more than minor ripples across global equity and currency markets. Does the credit go to the Fed for preparing the markets for the winding down of quantitative easing? Probably yes, because it has been talking about the tapering process for the last six months. Yet, the absence of turbulence can be attributed to two main reasons. One, of course, is that the markets had already discounted the fact that a wind-down of the bond-purchase programme was imminent and factored that into their valuations. Second, and more important, is that the start of the tapering process is a clear signal that the health of the U.S. economy, which is the global economic engine, is getting closer to normal. To be sure, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who is retiring next month, has started with a modest $10 billion scale-back in bond purchases and has resolved to maintain short-term interest rates at near-zero levels to stimulate growth. His clear guidance that the stimulus will be gradually wound down over the next one year has also been a factor in calming the markets.
The Indian markets reacted to the news with minor turbulence on December 19. The Sensex declined and the rupee wobbled a bit but they both regained their balance on December 20. This is in sharp contrast to the turmoil that they experienced when the T-word was first mentioned by Mr. Bernanke in May. That is because the intervening period has seen a smart turnaround in India’s external account. The current account deficit fell to 1.2 per cent of GDP in the second quarter from a high of 4.9 per cent in the first; it is projected to be 3 per cent or less for fiscal 2013-14, which is a vast improvement over the last year. GDP growth has rebounded in the second quarter to 4.8 per cent, though the growth impulse continues to be weak. Foreign currency reserves have also been augmented through a series of measures initiated by the RBI. While these explain the equanimity in the markets, the fact is that the clouds have not lifted entirely yet. As the tapering process gathers steam over the next few months, there is bound to be both a pull-out of capital from India and reduced allocations for fresh investment as funds chase rising rates in the U.S. This means the current account deficit has to be managed by pushing exports more, especially to a resurgent U.S., and by taking steps to attract fresh foreign direct investment. Policymakers, including in the RBI, need to address these challenges.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-beginning-of-taper/article5490111.ece
24,12,2013,Transformational politics,"The Aam Aadmi Party’s journey from mass movement to political office in just one year is without a parallel in Indian electoral history, reflecting as it does a popular yearning for change from the models of governance on offer today. A disenchanted electorate is clearly behind the resounding mandate to the Arvind Kejriwal-led party which made an ambitious leap from the anti-corruption movement of Anna Hazare. Yet, history has been made and the AAP is now poised to form a government in Delhi with Mr. Kejriwal as Chief Minister. The Bharatiya Janata Party, which was ahead of the AAP by three seats, wisely decided not to form a government through horse-trading and the Congress did not have the numbers. Given the high moral ground on which the AAP had placed the game of government formation, the BJP could not afford to be seen as any less righteous than the AAP. Yet, the AAP itself was caught in a quandary having declared in the electoral run-up that it would not seek or offer support to the Congress and the BJP. But going back to the voters for a fresh mandate was not an option because that would have been a betrayal of the faith the voters had reposed in the AAP — a first-time party that had come within a whisker of power because of the hope it offered for political renewal and transformation.
The situation actually offered Mr. Kejriwal the opportunity to put in practice a major manifesto promise: to get the people’s feedback on issues of importance. With the message from the Jan Sabhas a resounding ‘yes’ for government formation, the next step was for Mr. Kejriwal to offer to form a government with outside support from the Congress. The idea of a referendum itself was refreshing as a method of seeking the people’s endorsement of the way forward in this complex situation. It is also a vital instrument of verifying public opinion that is missing from today’s democratic political practice in India. Mainstream parties seem to be increasingly out of sync with the dramatic changes on the ground that indicates the soaring aspirations of new social groups. The AAP has correctly gauged the potential and power of this transformative energy and indeed, sees itself as giving political expression to it. Mr. Kejriwal is admittedly hamstrung by having to take support from the Congress, which the AAP had denounced as irredeemably corrupt. However, even with this constraint, he can bring about substantive changes in governance, starting with putting an end to the much-detested VIP culture. While the first breakthrough is definitely the passing of the Lokpal law, there are still several promises that the AAP must keep. The real test of the AAP’s commitment to clean politics and transparent governance begins now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/transformational-politics/article5494313.ece
24,12,2013,Flawed preference,"Among the many manifestations of gender discrimination in India, arguably the most premeditated action involves the so-called boy-preference — the systematic elimination of female foetuses. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) report, Laws and Son Preference in India: A Reality Check, could not be more timely. It says the 1994 ban on sex-selective abortions, in order to be more effective, must be backed by comprehensive legal, judicial and police reforms targeting violence against girls and women. That the prohibition has failed is borne out by data from successive population census. The child-sex ratios in the 2011 enumeration stood at 919 girls for every 1,000 boys (in the 0-6 age-group). Between 1981 and 2001, the numbers were 962, 945 and 927 respectively. Clearly, the historical practice of female foeticide is no longer limited to mere acts of individual criminality. Thanks to access to ultrasound technologies, it has now risen to proportions that distort the nation’s demographic profile. Disturbingly, the UNFPA report cites the Goa law that permits polygamous marriages when a man’s first wife has not borne him a male heir. Meanwhile, the law that forbids sex-selections suffers from a lack of mandatory bodies to regulate the use of ultrasound technologies and monitor prenatal diagnostic clinics that offer clandestine services.
China’s recent decision to loosen the single-child norm could strengthen opinion in India that has been consistently critical of the deployment of coercive means to control population. The prevailing restriction in some states that disallows members of families with more than two children the right to contest to local representative bodies is a highly arbitrary and undemocratic provision. South Korea has recently witnessed improvements in child-sex ratios, influenced by the waning appeal of sex-selection techniques. The country’s experience should lead to a more discriminating and humane use of scientific knowledge and strengthen a positive attitude on gender in the region. The prevalence of child marriages among as much as 30 per cent of girls aged between 15 and 19 years, compared to 5 per cent among boys, is a matter of some concern. The proportion among rural girls is 56 per cent compared to 29 per cent in urban areas, according to the UNFPA report. The brutal murders of young women who dared to break loose from narrow caste and community ties are chilling reminders of an outright suppression of consensual relationships. This is another area where domestic laws do not reflect the spirit of global conventions on the rights of the child and the elimination of discrimination against women.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/flawed-preference/article5494314.ece

25,12,2013,No respite for Muzaffarnagar,"Even going by Uttar Pradesh’s history of susceptibility to communal violence, the horror that has unfolded in the Muzaffarnagar-Shamli region will rank as extraordinary with deaths and displacement on a scale unmatched in recent times. Four months after a local skirmish escalated into a Hindu Jat-Muslim clash leading to deaths on both sides, there is no sign that tensions have abated and much less that the mostly Muslim victims have found the courage to return to their homes in the villages. The administration had admitted to an initial Muslim displacement figure of 51,000, the highest for any communal disturbance in the State. The actual numbers today might be less overwhelming, but by the government’s own account — described as a gross underestimation by some social activists — nearly 5,000 people are still living as refugees in relief camps in the two regions. The government’s acknowledgement that over 1,500 families have refused to return home fearing reprisals, is a commentary in itself and suggests that a good many victims may have left the relief camps only to take refuge in the homes of relatives. Of the conditions in the camps and elsewhere, the less said the better, with winter bringing more hardship to the inmates and reports coming in of infant deaths caused by exposure to the cold.
The Akhilesh Yadav government has been tragically remiss in addressing the situation. Indeed, the official abdication has led to the vacuum being filled by Muslim religious groups resulting in communal tensions being kept alive. In late-October, the State government ordered payment of relief at Rs.5 lakh each to about 900 affected families on condition that they sign away their rights to their property in the villages. This is nothing but official sanctification of the communal divide that has been the most worrisome outcome of the violence. Ground reports suggest that Muslim families are investing the money in building ghettos for themselves in rural areas, which have thus far been symbols of harmony. The coming general elections look certain to further vitiate the atmosphere, with the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Samajwadi Party engaged in the politics of polarisation. The BJP recently feted two MLAs accused in the violence on the specious reasoning that nothing had been proved against them. The SP ought to have shown a greater sense of responsibility, if for no reason other than to safeguard a community the party counts among its voters. Sadly, the Manmohan Singh government too has once again let go of the opportunity — in the winter session — to enact an acceptable Communal Violence Bill focussed on the provision of adequate relief and rehabilitation of victims.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-respite-for-muzaffarnagar/article5497971.ece
25,12,2013,Restructuring a savings scheme,"Though designed with plenty of good intentions, the new series of consumer price index-linked savings bonds is unlikely to enthuse most of the individuals for whom it is intended. The Inflation Indexed National Savings Securities-Cumulative (IINSS-C) launched by the Reserve Bank of India opened for subscription on December 23 and will close a week thereafter. The bonds have been designed to give investors a return that is 1.5 per cent above the reference consumer price index calculated according to a set formula. Thus there are two components of interest — a fixed 1.5 per cent and a variable return based on the CPI. The IINSS-C with these two return enhancing features, it is hoped, will be a big draw for ordinary persons as well as high net worth individuals. Most of the available savings channels do not give returns that offset inflation. The prospect of getting a negative real return is forcing investors away from conventional financial savings instruments such as bank fixed deposits, to gold, real estate and other physical assets. The country needs to boost its financial savings especially from households to step up the overall investment rate. Besides, the seemingly insatiable demand for gold — from investors and from the jewellery industry — has very recently created serious macroeconomic problems in the form of high current account deficits. Although the threat of an imbalance has receded somewhat, ongoing attempts to channel the demand into productive channels need to be encouraged.
An earlier attempt to protect savers by offering an instrument that pegged return above wholesale price index (WPI) inflation was not really for ordinary individuals. The new series, though offering inflation-beating returns, might still falter for a variety of reasons. Their complexity — a 10-year tenure, lock-in periods of one year for senior citizens and three years for others, compounding of interest every six months but paid only after the full tenure — might drive away many would-be investors. The penalty for foreclosure — 50 per cent of the interest earned in the year before — is stiff. For senior citizens — only those above 65 years qualify for this scheme — as well as the retired, the new bonds are not particularly attractive. Unlike some bank deposit schemes, there is no provision for quarterly or even annual interest payment. For them, getting their principal and compounded interest back after 10 years might make no sense. There are no special tax benefits for investing in the new bonds either. The well-off might find the investment cap at Rs.5 lakh a year too restrictive. It is hoped that the authorities learn by experience and refashion the inflation-linked bonds to give them a wider appeal.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/restructuring-a-savings-scheme/article5497970.ece
1,1,2014,Uncertainty in Bangladesh,"There seems little chance of any understanding between Bangladesh’s two main political forces emerging ahead of the scheduled January 5 elections. The ruling Awami League is locked in a fierce confrontation with the Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party on the streets, with ugly clashes erupting in Dhaka and elsewhere. The BNP’s call for an indefinite blockade of roads, railways and waterways from January 1 is only likely to trigger more street violence. At the heart of the confrontation is the election itself. The BNP, along with its allies, is boycotting the election because it wants a neutral caretaker government to oversee the process. Doing away with the constitutional provision for a transitional caretaker was among the earliest of the changes that the Awami League government brought in, with a Supreme Court ruling providing the basis for that move. What Prime Minister Hasina offered instead was a national government, which too was rejected by the BNP. Its leader Khaleda Zia is virtually under house arrest. Another political figure, the former military ruler H.M. Ershad, who heads the Jatiyo Party, the second largest in the ruling coalition, was taken to a military hospital by police commandos after he announced that he too was boycotting the polls. As a result, the Awami League is the only big party that remains in the elections, the Jamat-i-Islami having been banned in 2013. The ruling party is certain to win at least half the 300 seats that are going uncontested. But in such a moth-eaten election, a victory will have nowhere near the kind of legitimacy that it enjoyed when it won in 2008.
The crisis poses a serious challenge for India’s policy on Bangladesh. It is no secret that New Delhi’s relations with Dhaka have been best with the Awami League in power. From the point of view of India’s foreign policy, and more particularly national security objectives, ties have never been better than in the last five years. Prime Minister Hasina cracked down on Islamist extremism, and on safe havens for militants from the northeastern States. Yet, this very equation has set off an incredible amount of anti-India feeling within Bangladesh, especially as New Delhi was seen as not reciprocating Dhaka’s “concessions” in equal measure — the non-implementation of the Teesta Accord is one sore point. India could have helped at least by counselling Prime Minister Hasina to take less reckless positions against her opponents, but it is too late for that now. Post-election, Bangladesh appears headed for more volatility, and New Delhi’s relations with a government that comes to power through a problematic process will only get more complicated.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/uncertainty-in-bangladesh/article5523650.ece
1,1,2014,Counting conundrum,"The government, it appears, has persistent difficulties in getting the enumeration of the urban poor right. Despite many surveys and countless reviews, departments involved in gathering data on urban slums do not yet have reliable estimates. The latest counting conundrum has emerged from a survey conducted by the >National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). Based on a survey of 881 slums, the NSSO has estimated that about 8.8 million households are in slums. This count differs vastly from Census 2011 figures, which estimates that 13.9 million households are in slums. In terms of number of people, this difference amounts to about 24 million. Census figures themselves tend to be underestimations since only 2,613 of the 4,041 statutory towns reported the presence of slums. To add to the confusion, three years ago, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (MHUPA), after reviewing various estimates, had concluded that the population living in slums would reach about 93 million (19.8 million households) by 2011. Which among the three is an accurate estimation? Strangely, the NSSO survey remains silent about these differences. All it does is to admit that the method used in its previous surveys on slums had been incorrect, and that it had revised the approach this time.
The vast difference between the various estimates raises serious doubts about the soundness of policies that are formulated based on them since enumeration is a critical step for devising slum improvement schemes, fixing priorities and allocating funds. Underestimation poses the real danger of excluding a large number of the urban poor from welfare projects. For instance, when Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission funds were allocated, States such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh received less for slum improvement because of incorrect estimation. Each department adopts different definitions of slums and often goes ahead with projecting the final count despite inadequate data. To correct this, the committee on slum statistics constituted by the MHUPA in 2008 suggested that all government agencies should adopt common parameters. It also discussed the need to use innovative mapping tools to correlate data with ground conditions. It looks like the departments have not adopted these suggestions. The NSSO survey, even in its present form, does not portray much improvement in slum conditions. It shows that only 24 per cent of the total number of slums had benefited from improvement schemes, and one third of slums do not have access to toilet and drainage facilities. It is imperative that the government reviews the methods of gathering data on slums without further delay and significantly retool its development schemes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/counting-conundrum/article5523651.ece
2,1,2014,A merger of necessity,"It is never easy to bargain hard from a position of weakness. Former Karnataka Chief Minister >B.S. Yeddyurappa is returning to the Bharatiya Janata Party, but with nothing to show for the year he spent as the leader of the breakaway party, the Karnataka Janata Paksha. All that he could manage with the KJP was to ensure that the BJP slumped to a huge defeat in the Assembly election in 2013. Mr. Yeddyurappa, whose tenure as Chief Minister was marked by charges of corruption and nepotism, is not going to have a grand homecoming. The merger will be unconditional, and he will have to work his way back to the top all over again. Indeed, none of the factors that led to his exit from the party seems to have gone away. His political rivals within the BJP continue to wield considerable power in the organisation, and there are sections within the national leadership which think he is more of a liability than an asset. But the former Chief Minister must have made his own calculations. The only political space that the KJP could have occupied was as a junior ally of the BJP. Ideologically, there was little to distinguish the two parties, other than the KJP’s regional and casteist appeal for Lingayats, a dominant group. The 2013 Assembly election showed that the fledgling party could never hope to challenge the Congress or replace the BJP. Not surprisingly, in the last few months the KJP has been broadly supportive of the BJP.
The merger suggested itself, and so did the timing. This is a phase when the BJP’s stock is high in northern India, but quite low in Karnataka, and Mr. Yeddyurappa realised he would have some room for manoeuvre in the State unit of the national party ahead of the Lok Sabha election. For a long time, the Lingayat leader was the principal player for the BJP in Karnataka, and he must be hoping to regain at least some of his old clout. However, the national leadership knows very well that he was not only instrumental in organising the party in the State and leading it to victory in the 2008 Assembly election, but he was also the wrecker-in-chief in the run-up to the election, making a puppet of the BJP Chief Ministers who succeeded him after he was forced to step down as he faced arrest in a corruption case. While the merger is certain to help it in some ways, the BJP leadership is conscious of the fact that Mr. Yeddyurappa is not the force he was five years ago. But the party needs all the help it can get in Karnataka, and even a scam-tainted strongman is a welcome addition in a three-way fight with the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) in the 2014 election. Both Mr. Yeddyurappa and his rivals within the BJP must be hoping that the sight of a common enemy would help them forget their differences.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-merger-of-necessity/article5526994.ece
2,1,2014,The redline on fiscal deficit,"The latest data on the >fiscal situation released by the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) on Tuesday does not portend well for the government’s stated objective of holding the fiscal deficit within reasonable limits. For most of the past two years the macroeconomy has been beset with twin deficits — the fiscal deficit and the current account deficit. During the first half of the year the current account deficit (CAD) appeared to be spinning out of control with all projections going awry. The deleterious consequences were felt across the macroeconomy. The rupee declined and inflation remained persistently high. However, a surprisingly strong rebound in exports and some innovative government measures to shore up the external account, along with tariff and non-tariff measures to restrict gold imports, have helped narrow down the CAD within reasonable limits, The expectation is that by March 31 the CAD will be well below 3 per cent of GDP, a figure which even the most optimistic forecasters would not have imagined just a few months ago. While the threat from a burgeoning CAD might have receded — though by no means has it been eliminated — the government’s fiscal problems have come to the fore.
The challenge of containing the fiscal deficit has persisted with successive governments. No Finance Minister, however, has articulated the problems arising from runaway fiscal deficit as strongly as P. Chidambaram. He has often said that the “red line” for the fiscal deficit, which he set at containing it within 4.8 per cent of GDP, will not be breached. That is going to be a particularly daunting task in the light of the latest CGA data, according to which the fiscal deficit in the first eight months of the current fiscal year (April-November) at 94 per cent was already close to breaching the full year’s target. Total expenditure during the first eight months was at 61.3 per cent of the whole year’s budget, higher than the 58.2 per cent in the previous year. Revenue collections have remained constant at a little over 47 per cent. The urgent task therefore is to prune expenditure while trying to boost government revenues, especially tax revenues. Expenditure control, always a tough task, is even tougher in an election year. The axe is bound to fall on Plan expenditure and that in turn will have a negative impact on the growth momentum. Tax revenues are directly dependent on GDP growth. There again, with the economy unlikely to grow much above 5 per cent during the current year, the outlook for higher tax collections and hence a lower deficit is by no means positive.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-redline-on-fiscal-deficit/article5526992.ece
3,1,2014,Bribes don’t pay,"New Delhi’s decision to >cancel its contract for the purchase of AgustaWestland AW101 helicopters has sent out a much-needed message to companies seeking a share of India’s growing defence market: bribing their way past the door does not pay. The AW101 deal involves some of the most serious allegations of corruption since the Bofors scandal, with allegations being levelled against former Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi and his relatives. In a First Information Report filed last year, the Central Bureau of Investigation had alleged that middleman Guido Haschke used a Tunisian front company to route kickbacks to Air Chief Marshal Tyagi’s relatives to help tweak technical specifications that allowed the AW101 into the race. Mr. Tyagi denied wrongdoing, saying he had no role in the decision-making process. The CBI, however, wants to move forward on filing charges after a Ministry of Defence team now in Italy questions Mr. Haschke. New Delhi has agreed to arbitration demands by AgustaWestland, which may be a protracted and unpredictable process. It is probable, though, that the Central government felt the need to send out a strong message ahead of the general elections later this year. The fact that AgustaWestland’s parent firm, Finmeccanica, is Italian was certain to have been used by the Opposition to embarrass Congress president Sonia Gandhi.
Though the government’s commitment to eradicating corruption in defence purchases is welcome, the AgustaWestland case raises difficult questions on how best to address a problem that has dogged the country for decades. India has now blacklisted at least 15 firms on corruption-related charges, in the process delaying critical acquisitions. From artillery to electronics, contract after contract has come under suspicion, making officials wary of expeditiously processing even legitimate projects. In this case, the technical qualities of the AW101 are not in doubt: the helicopter won the approval of not just the Air Force, but also the Special Protection Group. The equipment now being used by the Prime Minister is obsolescent. In 2012, the Naresh Chandra Committee on defence reforms had suggested alternative measures to punish firms indicted for corruption, including harsh financial penalties. The government, though, has not shown much interest in institutionalising these alternatives. Nor has it moved to streamline the defence procurement procedure, which would allow for alternatives to be rapidly selected when one vendor is hit by scandal. Having taken a demonstrative stand against corruption, it is imperative that the government also makes sure legitimate defence needs are met.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bribes-dont-pay/article5530818.ece
3,1,2014,Mr. Yameen in India,"Maldivian President Abdulla Yameen's first visit to New Delhi as head of state comes at a time when India-Maldives ties are showing signs of improvement. After being sworn in on November 17 last year, Mr. Yameen’s initial actions show that he is moving to establish himself as a leader not overly weighed down by the compulsions of the powerful partners who propelled him to office. His visit comes after Maldivian Defence Minister Mohamed Nazim met Defence Minister A.K. Antony and National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon in New Delhi. The Maldives has special concerns relating to disasters arising out of climate change, apart from routine security issues such as aviation security and border control. It was clear that Mr. Nazim’s visit was successful: at the end of the visit, the Maldives was gifted a second twin-engine helicopter. Also, India is pushing ahead with maritime domain security awareness in the region, in which the Maldives and Sri Lanka are the other partners. The crux of the exercise — Mr. Nazim was in New Delhi ahead of a meeting involving the three nations — is to put in place a security architecture which will be independent of individuals in positions of power. Thus, in some ways, Mr. Nazim’s trip set the tone for the visit, but the issues to be addressed at the highest level are many.
Topping the list of Maldivian concerns are the visa restrictions that India had imposed following a souring of relationship with former President Mohamed Waheed, the ban on export from India of certain types of construction material, and the lack of adequate trained health services personnel. In return, India wants a definitive set of rules that will guarantee Indian investments in the Maldives, apart from cooperation on security related matters. President Yameen’s visit, which was postponed once, has already made some headway with the signing of three agreements on January 2, of which two relate to the health sector. Since India had announced ahead of the much-delayed presidential polls that it would do business with anyone who was elected to the post, Mr. Yameen’s Delhi visit is expected to be a win-win for both sides. It will be in the interest of both countries to amicably settle the issue relating to throwing out GMR, the Indian operator of the Ibrahim Nasir airport in Male. However much Mr. Yameen may argue that this was a company-to-company matter, the fact remains that it was the Maldivian government that threw out GMR. It will not be business as usual unless this issue is settled to the satisfaction of all parties to the dispute.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mr-yameen-in-india/article5531075.ece
4,1,2014,Dr. Singh clears the decks,"Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s >media conference on Friday — just his third in India, in ten years in office — was directed at his place in history as much as the looming general elections. The top line of Dr. Singh’s interaction was, of course, election-related: he announced that he would “hand over the baton” after the elections, a declaration that will open the way for the Congress to name party vice-president Rahul Gandhi its prime ministerial candidate. Mr. Gandhi, he said, had “outstanding credentials” for the job, adding that he had earlier requested him to join the government. Top Congress leaders have gone on record in recent days asserting that Mr. Gandhi’s nomination will be key to the party’s prospects. Dr. Singh clearly concurs. Earlier, some within the Congress had argued that it would be inappropriate to name Mr. Gandhi the party’s candidate when Dr. Singh was at the helm; the Prime Minister has now cleared the decks. The generally soft-spoken Dr. Singh also had unusually strong words of criticism for the man Mr. Gandhi will be taking on — Bharatiya Janata Party’s prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi. Pointing to Mr. Modi’s stewardship of Gujarat during the 2002 communal pogrom, Dr. Singh said it would be “disastrous” for India to have him as Prime Minister — a frontal attack of the kind many within the Congress had long waited for him to mount.
The Prime Minister also invoked history frequently in his interaction with the media, suggesting he is concerned that his legacy threatens to be washed over by a rising tide of corruption scandals. While describing the India-U.S. nuclear deal as his “best moment”, Dr. Singh drew satisfaction from the point that India’s economy grew faster on average during his time in office than ever before in recorded history in spite of a hostile international economic environment. Dr. Singh argued that at least some of the problems which cost the Congress heavily in the just-concluded elections, notably inflation, are enmeshed in global economic circumstances no national government could have fully addressed. It was clearly Dr. Singh’s attempt to regain the high ground as his government is perceived to be coming increasingly under siege. However, glaringly evident was the Prime Minister’s refusal to acknowledge the UPA’s singular moral culpability for the mega-scandals involving spectrum allocation and coal block allotments. He went on to make the indefensible argument that being elected a second time absolved the UPA from its responsibility to face the corruption charges. Dr. Singh’s complacent recounting of the UPA’s achievements wore thin in the face of the clear dodging of accountability in this regard. The political costs of the UPA’s continuing state of denial are bound to be high.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dr-singh-clears-the-decks/article5535185.ece
4,1,2014,Time for a change,"The New Year’s Day assertion by Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi that his State would >re-set its clocks to introduce a local time zone that would be at least 60 minutes ahead of Indian Standard Time, has rekindled an old debate. The idea is to optimise daylight hours in the region where the sun rises around 4 a.m. in summer and it gets dark before 4 p.m., while at the western tip of Gujarat, about 2,900 km away, the same phenomena occur some two hours later. Since IST corresponds to 82.5 East longitude where Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh is located, the region east of the line has fewer daylight hours than in the west. Mr. Gogoi is seeking to resurrect the daylight saving schedule of ‘chaibagaan’ that was introduced by the British rulers more than 150 years ago for tea plantations — which still follow that practice. He has pointed out that the shift would help save energy and increase productivity.
While there is merit in the argument, the potentially adverse consequences of introducing a new time zone within the country are many. Not forgetting the fact that a country like Russia has as many as nine time zones across contiguous territory, having to cope with the zones and to be forced to reset the watch each time you need to cross a domestic line could be complicated. Transport and trade schedules could take a hit, for instance. Railway services could face the risk of accidents. Also, why is it only for Assam, and not for the rest of the northeast? And, even if the whole region makes the change, will it not intensify the sense of distance that northeastern India already has in relation to the rest of India? Given all these factors, it is not surprising that despite such demands having been made periodically, the Central government has appeared reluctant to proceed in this regard, presumably mindful of the administrative challenges. It is now time to initiate a process of consultation to consider all sides of the question afresh. What might be seriously examined is a proposal of some researchers, including those from the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bangalore, to set the IST forward by half an hour so that it is six hours ahead of Universal Coordinated Time. This will mean advancing the point of reckoning at 82.5 degree East to 90 degree East, which will fall at a longitude along the West Bengal-Assam border. That should go some way in meeting Assam’s demand, and help avoid potential grievances from northwestern India about corresponding inconveniences that an advancing by one full hour could entail for it in terms of late sunrise time.

6,1,2014,"One nation, one grid","The integration of the southern power grid with the national grid fulfils a long-felt need of consumers and state electricity utilities in the South. The integration was achieved when the Power Grid Corporation of India commissioned a 765-kilovolt transmission line between Raichur and Solapur on New Year’s Day, five months ahead of schedule. The southern grid is the third largest in terms of power consumption amongst the five regional grids and is perennially starved of power. With a base energy deficit of 7.7 per cent that shoots up to 12.5 per cent during peak hours (as per latest data from the Central Electricity Authority), the southern grid has been hamstrung by inadequate generation capacity. The absence of synchronous connectivity with the national grid meant that the southern states could not take advantage of surplus power available in other regions. Currently, the southern grid has asynchronous connections with the other grids that enable transmission of high voltage direct current. But this is a cumbersome and inefficient way to transmit power and the capacity is limited. The completion of the commissioning process of the Raichur-Solapur line will synchronise the southern grid with the others in a single frequency and allow seamless transmission across the country; it will be a truly ‘one-nation-one-grid’ that will have 232 giga watts of installed capacity at its disposal.
To be sure, there are still technical procedures to be completed before the line becomes operational in the next few months but there is little doubt that it will help balance the power situation across the country. The southern states can now purchase power from the other regions to manage their deficit, but more important is the nationwide electricity market that will now come into being. There is a large disparity in traded short-term electricity prices between the south and the other regions due to the absence of transmission links. During the summer, for instance, traded electricity prices in the South are typically twice or even thrice the levels that prevail in the other regions. Hopefully, such disparities will now be a thing of the past. The responsibilities of the regulators and grid managers are now that much higher with the entire country united in a single grid. Lapses such as those that caused the western and northern grids to collapse on two consecutive days in July 2012 can lead to disastrous consequences in a unified grid. The regulators also need to keep an eye out on power exchanges and traders as their market expands with the entry of the southern grid and its eternally power-starved utilities. If integrating the country into a single grid was a challenge, then that will be rivalled by the task of efficiently managing it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/one-nation-one-grid/article5542124.ece
6,1,2014,Long journey to the sky,"It has been 30 years in the making, has cost Rs.172.69 billion, and will easily take another year if not more to clear the last lap. Tejas, the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd-manufactured Light Combat Aircraft that received its second “initial operational clearance” — it got the first IOC in January 2011 — and was inducted into the Indian Air Force last month, is meant to replace the ageing fleet of MiG21s and MiG27s. But that goal is still some years away. First, the aircraft needs to get its Final Operational Clearance. The IOC certifies that the aircraft can fly, the FOC that it can fight. In order to be certified as an operational fighter, the LCA, developed by the Aeronautical Development Agency, must undergo intensive trials of its weapons systems; the Air Force also wants it to be fitted with air-to-air refuelling capability. Going by the track record of the LCA project, all this could take the deadline for the FOC from December 2014 to mid-2015. Then too, the payload and agility of the Tejas will not match the IAF’s expectations. The supersonic LCA’s General Electric F404 engine — an indigenously developed engine did not quite cut it — will allow only short-range missiles and laser-guided 500-kg bombs, less weaponry than was originally budgeted for. The limited thrust of the engine will also curtail its agility. The IAF will have two squadrons of the LCA, that is, 40 planes including eight trainer craft. HAL hopes to roll them out fast enough for the first squadron to be in place by 2016. But what the IAF is waiting for is Tejas Mark II, which is to be equipped with the more powerful GE 414 engine. For that, however, the aircraft may need to be re-engineered, and the process could well take another 10 years or more.
Defence Minister A.K. Antony has said that India could eventually have 200 Tejas aircraft, mostly for the Air Force and some for the Navy. At nine tons, it is said to be the lightest in its category of fighter planes. The ADA says the Tejas Mark 1 is better than its contemporaries, such as the French Mirage 2000, the U.S. F-16 and the Swedish Gripen. Moreover, it has not met with a single accident during trials. But perhaps its greatest advantage is that at Rs.180 crore apiece, its cost is just one third that of similar aircraft even though more than a third of its parts, including the engine, are imported. Its operational costs too will be lower. Tejas is also a brave effort to break the monopoly of a select few in making fighter jets. It travels at least part of the way towards the goal of indigenisation of military hardware, and has provided India with valuable experience, that can be put to good use for the development of the planned fifth generation fighter aircraft and the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/long-journey-to-the-sky/article5542125.ece
7,1,2014,Resilience pays off,"The Indian Space Research Organisation is adding feather after feather to its cap. Just recently, it sent off the country’s first effort at planetary exploration, the Mars Orbiter Mission. On Sunday, the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), equipped with an indigenous cryogenic engine, put the GSAT-14 communication satellite into orbit with effortless ease. It was an unequivocal demonstration of the space agency’s mastery of cryogenic technology, a key element in building more powerful launch vehicles. While its older sibling, the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), can accommodate communication satellites weighing about 1,200 kg, the GSLV will be able to carry spacecraft that are heavier by around 1,000 kg. Sunday's triumph might well have come much earlier had the space agency pursued indigenous development immediately after an internal study team in December 1983 submitted a detailed report, which laid out how this could be accomplished. It reverted to the indigenous route after a 1991 deal to import the technology from the Soviet Union — and subsequently Russia — fell apart in the face of U.S. embargoes. Although the technology transfer was aborted, the indigenous cryogenic engine and stage are based on the Russian design, which is complicated and difficult to turn into flightworthy hardware. When the indigenous stage flew for the first time on the GSLV in April 2010, it spluttered to life just briefly and then died away. On Sunday, however, 20 years of painstaking effort culminated in the cryogenic stage performing flawlessly.
More satellite launches have been lined up for the GSLV. The rocket will also be required for Chandrayaan-2, which is expected to put an Indian lander and rover on the moon in a few years’ time. Nonetheless, the fact remains that ISRO’s launch requirements go beyond the GSLV’s capabilities. The space agency has already sent several communication satellites on Europe’s Ariane rockets. Just recently, Arianespace got the contract to carry two more Indian communication satellites, each weighing around 3,150 kg. Such foreign launches are expensive. The cost of last year’s launch of Insat-3D, an advanced weather satellite, on Ariane came to about Rs. 490 crore. ISRO is working on a more powerful rocket, the GSLV Mark III, which can take four-tonne communication satellites. The giant solid propellant booster for this rocket as well as its big liquid propellant core stage has already been tested on the ground. But a completely different cryogenic engine and stage must be got ready for it. The plan is to have the first developmental flight of the full rocket in two to three years’ time. A lot more of hard work lies ahead for ISRO’s scientists and engineers in order to meet that ambitious target.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/resilience-pays-off/article5546015.ece
7,1,2014,A credible probe required,"The latest charges against Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh could not have come at a worse time for the Congress. Electoral defeats in four States and the shadow cast on the way the Congress-led government in Maharashtra handled an enquiry report on the Adarsh Housing Society scam have put the party on the defensive. Its attempts to retrieve the moral high ground — withdrawing the ordinance to prevent disqualification of convicted legislators, enacting the Lokpal Bill and forcing an official rethink on the Adarsh Society issue — have had only limited success. These steps came after political pressure on Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi to walk the talk on his high-decibel advocacy of public probity. The impression that denial and reflexive support to those facing corruption charges mark the Congress party’s initial response cannot be easily erased. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s remark that he had not had the time to apply his mind to the allegations against Mr. Virbhadra Singh contained in a letter to him by Bharatiya Janata Party leader Arun Jaitley, indicates that the party is buying time. For the present, it seems to be backing his claim that Mr. Jaitley’s charge pertaining to the Himachal Pradesh government giving a 10-month extension to a power project is politically motivated.
Media reports suggest that the Income Tax department is already on Mr. Singh’s case. The Central Bureau of Investigation is also examining a diary recovered by tax officials during a raid on a steel company, in which there were entries indicating payment to someone referred to as ‘VBS’. Mr. Virbhadra Singh was Union Steel Minister during the relevant period. Corruption charges have dogged him in the past too. He was forced to quit after a court framed charges in a case dating back to 1989. However, he was acquitted on the eve of his taking charge as Chief Minister for a sixth time in December 2012. The present situation poses a moral and political dilemma for the Congress leadership. On the one hand the party has to maintain that it stands for credible measures against corruption, but on the other it has to assess the political costs of acting against its key regional leaders. Mr. Singh has offered to face a probe by the State Lokayukta, a position now held by a retired Supreme Court judge; the BJP has, however, begun a campaign for Mr. Singh's ouster. Demands for his resignation may be premature now as there is no formal indictment yet. But a full and credible probe is certainly called for.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-credible-probe-required/article5546008.ece
8,1,2014,"Belated, but right decision","Justice (retd.) A.K. Ganguly has done the right thing by resigning from his position as chairperson of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission. Although belated, his resignation will help preserve the dignity of his office, which was seriously undermined after he was accused by a law intern of making improper sexual advances. It will also protect the dignity of the Supreme Court, of which he was a respected judge for some years, and hopefully reassure the country that the judicial fraternity does not consider itself above the moral imperative of upholding ethics and necessary propriety. It was a month ago that it was disclosed officially that a three-judge committee rendered a preliminary finding that there was “unwelcome verbal/non-verbal conduct of [a] sexual nature” on his part. This rendered his continuance in office untenable, and resignation was the only rational course of action. Yet, displaying an unconscionable intransigence, Mr. Ganguly chose to stay on in office and insinuated that there was a political conspiracy to tarnish his image. The West Bengal Chief Minister wrote to the President demanding action against him, Members of Parliament asked for his resignation, and excerpts from the intern’s affidavit were made public, but none of this had a chastening effect on him. Ultimately, the Union Cabinet’s decision approving the terms of a Presidential Reference to the Supreme Court, preparatory to his formal removal from office, got him to quit. It should help him avoid further embarrassment when the court starts formal hearing on the reference.
By instituting an inquiry as soon as the allegation surfaced and by disclosing the panel’s findings, the Supreme Court showed welcome sensitivity and transparency in its functioning. While routine legal processes may be required for determining guilt or innocence, or for removing someone from office, the preservation of institutional integrity must be achieved through quick decisions based on moral principles. The judiciary must set higher standards for itself and not seem to take shelter behind protracted probes; nor should it give the impression that it is letting matters drift when it comes to dealing with its own members. One question remains: whether the lawyer who accused Mr. Ganguly of misconduct will pursue the matter to its logical conclusion through an appropriate legal process. Her view that she has the autonomy to decide on it at an appropriate time deserves respect. But by going public with her experience, she has ensured that it is possible to pursue and ensure accountability, regardless of the status and position of those facing such charges. That is at least one positive result of an otherwise sordid and unfortunate episode.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/belated-but-right-decision/article5550031.ece
8,1,2014,Riga’s new currency,"Latvia’s entry this month as the Eurozone’s 18th member-state, a decade after Riga’s accession to the European Union (EU), leaves Lithuania as the lone Baltic nation still outside the currency bloc. Not surprisingly, strong nationalist overtones have reverberated in the rival stances in the population of two million on the adoption of the beleaguered euro. For, as many as five countries sharing the common currency including Spain, the group’s fourth largest economy, had to be bailed out in the wake of the credit, banking and housing crises. Bemoaning the country’s third currency change-over in nearly 25 years, after the lats and the rouble earlier, the no-euro camp has characterised euro-entry as another sacrifice of national sovereignty. Conversely, the champions of Riga’s Eurozone entry view membership as symbolic of the assertion of the country’s European identity.
For the leadership of the crisis-ridden European Union, meanwhile, Riga’s entry is a rare opportunity to tout the appeal of the euro. Brussels remembers that neither the economic climate nor the political reception was very different when Estonia adopted the euro in 2011, in the previous expansion of the currency union. Latvia’s spectacular recovery from the ravages of the 2008 banking collapse and the ‘virtues’ of economic austerity is the dominant narrative. The run-up to the so-called Baltic Tiger’s euro entry had raised concerns about the country’s large foreign bank deposits sourced from Russia, especially after the huge run on Cypriot banks last April. Although foreign money accounts for 50 per cent of Latvian bank deposits, the size of the banking sector is small relative to the overall economy, according to the European Commission. Save in Lithuania, which is expected to join in 2015, the prospect of expansion of the Eurozone into the rest of the bloc of 28 countries is extremely remote, both in the states of the former Eastern Europe as well as in Britain, Denmark and Sweden. The reasons for this have to do largely with the rise of strong Eurosceptic parties in some countries. In others, apprehensions about the implications of joining a monetary union that is still dithering on the question of forging economic integration are among the factors. But the reality in the medium term of a two-speed Europe of euro ins and outs could take a toll on the overall process of deeper and closer European integration. The EU will no doubt continue to muddle through. Its leaders have to strive hard to deepen the democratic legitimacy of its institutions to their own people. That would be in the interest of the world’s single largest trading bloc, as well as the rest of the world.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rigas-new-currency/article5550032.ece
9,1,2014,No real winners in Bangladesh,"The elections in Bangladesh went off predictably — amid a boycott by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its 18 smaller allies, lots of violence, loss of life and property, and a victory for the Awami League. As many as 30 people died on the election weekend, and on voting day activists and supporters of the boycotting parties went about burning polling booths. The Election Commission says the turnout was just less than 40 per cent, a figure hotly contested by the Opposition which put it at a quarter of that. In any case it was nowhere close to the nearly 80 per cent turnout in 2008 — the highest in Bangladesh — that gave Sheikh Hasina a landslide victory. This time, the Awami League was assured of victory even before a single vote was cast — it faced no contest in half of the 300 parliamentary seats due to the boycott. In the remaining ones, the party faced opposition from its own dissidents, and won 110, thus obtaining an absolute majority. Although Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has declared her satisfaction with the turnout, and asked law enforcing authorities to quell the continuing unrest with an “iron hand”, she must know that questions about the credibility of this election will not easily vanish. In a nation that has worked hard to build some of the best social indicators in South Asia — Bangladesh has cut ahead of India on reducing poverty and malnutrition, infant and maternal mortality rates and gender disparities — such unending political and civil strife can only undermine the gains of the last few years.
The Bangladesh Prime Minister has rejected calls, including by the United States, for dialogue with the Opposition and fresh elections. She has declared that talks with the Opposition can be held only when the BNP ends “violence and terrorism” and severs its alliance with the banned Jamaat-e-Islami. But a mid-term election may become a necessity if the political chaos does not abate. It is time the Awami League realised that while its fight against Islamism is a good fight, it simply cannot be won by polarising the nation politically. It will take two, though. BNP leader Khaleda Zia needs to discover better alternatives to expressing political differences than holding the country ransom to street violence and thuggery. As for her dalliance with Islamism, she has Pakistan’s example to see what opportunistic alliances with religious extremism can do to a country. New Delhi’s description of the elections as a “constitutional requirement” that Prime Minister Hasina has fulfilled, is too nuanced to serve any useful purpose; in fact, it only makes it seem partisan. If India really wants to help progressive and liberal forces in Bangladesh, it must use its cordial ties with the Awami League to work at breaking the deadlock.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-real-winners-in-bangladesh/article5554435.ece
9,1,2014,Moneybags and vote banks,"Indians living abroad are unlikely to vote in a general election, but they can help a political party in many other ways. Although they are stereotypically seen as moneybags with an ultra-nationalistic spirit who hope to make a difference from a distance, in the age of the social media they can also serve as a vital cog in the propaganda machine of parties. The Bharatiya Janata Party, touted as the party with a difference, was the original favourite of the most vocal sections of non-resident Indians, but the party appears to be losing some ground to the new star on the firmament, the Aam Aadmi Party. Arvind Kejriwal and the AAP, now seen as the harbingers of change, have captured the imagination of many NRIs as also some of their money — about Rs. 6 crore came from overseas contributions. The BJP has sensed this shift as well as anyone else. The Overseas Friends of BJP, an organisation of non-resident Indians and persons of Indian origin who back the BJP and seek investment opportunities in India in return, is now being roped in for resources other than financial. The AAP benefited hugely from the buzz created by the middle class on the social media, and not just financially.
Funds are not exactly a problem for the BJP; as the front-runner in this year’s Lok Sabha election the party can tap its domestic reservoirs easily enough. However, the party could not but have been envious of the manner in which the AAP built up its credibility and social acceptance through its supporters on Twitter and Facebook. The AAP is a new-age party in every sense: in terms of organisation, funding, and propaganda. With its origins in an anti-corruption movement that is only a few years old, the party captured the feelings of a rising middle class directed at the entire political class. The so-called referendum on whether to form a government in Delhi with the support of the Congress — which was conducted through its website, SMS messages and phone calls — might have appeared to some political analysts as an outlandish method of decision-making, but the AAP clearly wanted to emphasise that it was a supporter-driven party, and not a hierarchical organisation. A vast majority of India’s poor might still have no access to laptops and phones, but by demonstrating a willingness to listen, the AAP managed to expand its constituency not only among netizens, but among wider sections of the Indian public too. What the BJP and other parties can really learn from the AAP is not some novel way of reaching new voters, but the old value of democratic decision-making.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/moneybags-and-vote-banks/article5554438.ece
10,1,2014,A cowardly act,"Tuesday’s attack on the Aam Aadmi Party headquarters, attributed to a fringe Hindu right-wing group, is the clearest sign yet that the AAP is being viewed as a political phenomenon to watch out for in the upcoming general election. Indeed, it seems no more than an excuse that the vandalism was in response to AAP member Prashant Bhushan’s comments on Kashmir. Mr. Bhushan had clarified well before the attack that his advocacy of a “referendum” was restricted to the deployment of internal security in the Valley. In any case, it is unlikely that the AAP office would be vandalised for a personal opinion long held by one of its members. That the positive buzz around the Arvind Kejriwal–led debutant party has left the mainstream parties feeling out of their depths is apparent. Since entering the Delhi electoral fray with its promise of systemic overhaul and transformative politics, the AAP has moved at a frenetic pace, forming a government in the National Capital Territory and beginning to act on its various pledges.
Undeniably, the appeal of the AAP phenomenon is expanding beyond the borders of Delhi, capturing the imagination of a wider audience across the country. The evidence is there in the rush of eminent people signing up to join the party, suggesting a freshness of political appeal that is clearly disconcerting to the mainstream parties. Encouraged by this, the AAP has unfurled an ambitious plan to contest over 300 Lok Sabha seats and announced its intention to take on Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi in their constituencies. The AAP’s arrival has queered the pitch for both the Congress and the BJP, but perhaps more for the latter in view of its hopes to be the main gainer of whatever existing anti-incumbency sentiment. The BJP which has Mr. Modi as its prime ministerial candidate certainly has the edge, having made a near clean sweep of the recent Assembly elections. The BJP has been pitching Mr. Modi as a dynamic and efficient leader who can infuse fresh energy into the economy, perceived to be caught in a policy paralysis thanks to the UPA. Today that imagery is challenged by the arrival of Mr. Kejriwal and the AAP. The AAP has caused an upset in the dynamics of the national political arena by its shrewd utilisation of the strong public sentiment of disenchantment with the mainstream parties. In the Delhi elections, the AAP reduced the Congress to third place and stopped the BJP’s march to power. As a game-changer, the AAP has the potential to play spoiler to the chances of the major political forces in the general elections a few months away. What is clear though is that the spunky new party will not be cowed down by threats and violence.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-cowardly-act/article5558659.ece
10,1,2014,Mission to cut neonatal deaths,"Goa and Manipur may have knocked Kerala off the pedestal, but at 12 deaths among children less than one year of age per 1,000 live births, Kerala still has an enviably low infant mortality rate (IMR); it is far below India’s average of 42. Yet, for years, the southern State has been unable to reduce the mortality rate further to a single-digit figure to become comparable with the developed countries. Kerala has always been at the forefront in setting the benchmark for almost all the health indices. It therefore comes as no surprise that the State has initiated steps to further beat down IMR. A survey done by the National Rural Health Mission and the Indian Academy of Paediatrics found that about 75 per cent of infant deaths occurred during the first four weeks of birth (or neonatal deaths). The first week alone accounted for 59 per cent of the total neonatal deaths. Hence a pilot project is set to begin in 25 hospitals, including five private hospitals, to lower the neonatal mortality rate by 30 per cent in 24 months. It is planning a targeted approach to tackle the four major causal factors — prematurity, congenital anomalies, sepsis and birth asphyxia — for neonatal deaths.
Pre-term births (between 24 and 37 weeks of gestation) combined with low birth weight account for the lion’s share of about 35 per cent of neonatal mortality in Kerala. India has the highest number — 3.5 million — of pre-term births in the world, according to a June 2012 paper in The Lancet. Though the causes for pre-term births cannot be ascertained in a vast majority of cases, it is still possible to identify using techniques like ultrasound a certain percentage of mothers who are very likely to deliver such babies. Aside from improving the nutritional status of pregnant mothers, and keeping their blood pressure and diabetes under check, delaying pre-term labour through medical intervention and administration of two doses of steroid before delivery greatly improve neonatal survival. The steroid improves the three major parameters that are essential for survival — lung maturity, preventing haemorrhage of brain blood vessels and avoiding intestinal problems due to immaturity. While sterile hospital conditions can prevent sepsis (9.3 per cent), the importance of the mothers’ genital hygiene is often missed or overlooked. Vaginal and urinary tract infections are quite likely to cause pre-term labour and sepsis. Mortality due to birth asphyxia in Kerala is 8 per cent. Improving the quality of care during the delivery process, including by preventing prolonged labour, can further cut birth asphyxia mortality.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mission-to-cut-neonatal-deaths/article5558669.ece
11,1,2014,Little to celebrate,"Devyani Khobragade’s return to India without having to go through a trial and possible imprisonment in the United States is a relief as it brings to an end an episode that threatened to engulf the entire spectrum of bilateral relations. But to cast it as a victory of Indian diplomacy and sovereignty or as a triumph of David over Goliath is to cover it with undeserving gloss. Both the diplomat and the Indian government have asserted that the charges against her, of giving false information to obtain a visa for her housekeeper and underpaying her, were untrue. The proper way to establish this should have been in court. Instead, what the world saw was Indian diplomacy at its shabbiest. In order to give Ms. Khobragade the cover of full immunity which she did not have as a consul, New Delhi transferred her from the Indian Consulate-General in New York to its mission at the United Nations; within hours of her new diplomatic status being granted by the U.S. State Department to which the UN had forwarded the request, she flew out of the country. Of course, there was plenty of behind-the-scenes bargaining which allowed her to leave. But not before she was indicted in a court. As with expulsions, it has also been made clear that the diplomat, who is married to a U.S. national and has left her children behind, will not be given a visa or allowed to enter the country again. India has retaliated by expelling an American official.
India-U.S. relations will take some time to recover from this month-long saga, which saw New Delhi withdrawing special privileges to U.S. diplomats based in this country, and the postponement of a visit by the U.S. Energy Secretary. Washington needs to introspect if it could have handled the issue differently, starting from the time that Ms. Khobragade brought to the State Department’s notice last year that her domestic employee had gone missing. Clearly, the U.S. side underestimated the Indian response to the arrest. Washington failed to anticipate that the incident would become fixated in the Indian public imagination as an issue of national pride. Considering that the U.S. and India have acknowledged that both have high stakes in strong ties, the sensible course would have been to enable a situation in which the diplomat was allowed to leave the country before charges were pressed against her. Whether or not the row was a manifestation of the drift in ties being felt on both sides long before this, it will need deft diplomatic footwork to restore a degree of calm and trust to bilateral relations. If there is one silver lining in this dismal episode, it is that the two sides now perhaps have a better measure of each other.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/little-to-celebrate/article5563230.ece
11,1,2014,Containing the Maoist threat,"When the state responds to political violence in an indiscriminately heavy-handed manner, members of extremist groups will only harden their positions and hesitate to join the democratic mainstream. Whether the surrender of Maoist leader G. Venkatakrishna Prasad alias Gudsa Usendi, and his wife Santhoshi Markom, marks the beginning of a welcome new trend or is just a one-off event depends a lot on the rehabilitation of the couple who have been active with the Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee of the CPI-Maoist. Mr. Prasad, who was the spokesperson for the Maoists in Chhattisgarh, was wanted by the police for his direct involvement in major acts of violence, including the killing of Congress leaders in Bastar last year. Whether it was ill-health or disgust with the politics of violence that prompted him to surrender before the police in Andhra Pradesh, Mr. Prasad is entitled to the rehabilitation scheme already in place for reformed Naxalites. Governments are wont to seek the media spotlight and a bit of political triumphalism is inevitable when Maoists surrender, given the deadly and inherently anti-social nature of their activities. It is important to ensure that the reformative approach to these former extremists succeeds in transforming their mindset. Some of the Maoists return to collaborating with the extremist group, and some others spend the rest of their life in penury. A few are even hunted down by their former colleagues for being police informers and betrayers of the movement. The safety of these persons who have chosen to step out of the shadow of extremist politics must be guaranteed by governments.
There are many Maoists who feel trapped in the movement and the cycle of attacks and reprisals, but who are unable to gather the courage to make the transition from the fringe to the mainstream. However, rehabilitation of lapsed militants can only be a small part of the larger strategy of containing extremist violence. The administrative response of deploying specially trained security personnel in the violence-affected areas should be accompanied by a developmental strategy to enhance livelihood opportunities in tribal and forest regions. When rural wages remain low, the youth in India’s deprived interior areas can easily be lured into believing that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun. If it is not to be an isolated instance, the surrender should not be projected as a vindication of harsh measures in the face of extremist threat but should prompt a reworking of the strategy of countering political violence, and the putting in place of a comprehensive, equitable development programme for India’s tribal areas.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/containing-the-maoist-threat/article5563232.ece
13,1,2014,Scrap the allocations,"The government’s admission before the Supreme Court that something went wrong with the allocation of coal blocks should be followed by the next logical step: cancelling the allocations illegally made to private entities. About 40 blocks have already been ‘de-allocated’, and the court has raised the question why allocations involving blocks that do not have forest and environmental clearances cannot be cancelled too. The Central Bureau of Investigation has registered over a dozen cases. Even in the absence of evidence of criminal culpability, there are other reasons for revisiting the entire process: the absence of competitive bidding, and the lack of transparency in the functioning of the screening committee that made the allotments. The investigation process has been beset with controversies, with files going missing and questions being raised on the role of the Prime Minister himself, as he held the coal portfolio during the relevant period. The Law Minister had to quit after it transpired that he had compromised the ambit of the CBI probe. In addition, the Coal Ministry has issued notices to companies that have failed to record any progress in developing the mines. During his recent media conference, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh admitted that some irregularities did take place, but his defence was that they dated back to the first United Progressive Alliance regime. The government has also been dismissive of the Comptroller and Auditor General’s estimate of the loss sustained in coal block allotments. A performance audit report said in 2012 the benefit to private allottees could have been as high as Rs. 1.86 lakh crore. In similar circumstances, the Supreme Court had scrapped 122 telecom licences.
There is an impression that cancelling coal block allocations at this stage may jeopardise future investment. Industry bodies feel the companies involved cannot be blamed for delays in the grant of approvals by the Central and State governments, or for delays in developing these mines due to lack of timely clearances. It is true that there are genuine companies eager to develop captive coal mines for their power and steel projects. Many banks also have substantial exposure to this sector and are likely to be alarmed by any abrupt cancellation. However, as one of the judges hearing the case observed, investments made without the requisite clearances cannot be cited as a reason for upholding such allocations. A pragmatic solution would be to discover the appropriate price for a coal block through auction and ask the allottees to pay up; alternatively, successful bidders at the auction could take over the debt owed to banks. In any case, none should be allowed to reap the benefit of illegal allocations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/scrap-the-allocations/article5570708.ece
13,1,2014,Upbeat global sentiment,"At the start of the New Year, global economic sentiment appears to be more upbeat than at any time after the financial crisis of 2008. Even taking note of the pitfalls of a hasty generalisation, it is possible to discern a mood of optimism among policymakers and financial markets around the world. Policymakers in the advanced economies of the U.S., the European Union and Japan — though these countries are in varying stages of recovery — have special reasons for cheer. In the early days after the crisis, they lagged behind the developing economies led by China, India and others, in what the Ineternational Monetary Fund called a multi-speed global recovery. The roles are now reversed, with the developed countries providing the momentum. Leading the pack is the U.S., which is once again driving global economic growth. In a recent major policy speech — possibly the last before he hands over the reins of the Federal Reserve at the end of this month — outgoing Chairman Ben Bernanke examined recent U.S. economic performance from the perspective of global economic growth and found enough reasons to be “cautiously optimistic” about both the developed and emerging market economies. In the last reporting quarter, U.S. economic growth has been higher than expected. Improved economic prospects have induced the Fed to reduce, or taper, the scale of asset purchases it has used to prop up the U.S. economy.
That decision has had varied meanings for the rest of the world. India and certain other countries feared an imminent withdrawal of capital flows which have helped bridge the deficit in its current account. However, they have come to realise that the decision to gradually reverse its ultra-soft monetary stance has been based on an improving domestic economy, and what is good for the U.S. will be good for other economies as well. For instance, more spending by American firms and households will in turn buoy demand for goods and services from across the world. That development has already benefited India, whose exports have picked up smartly since May. To be sure, the U.S. still has its share of problems. Unemployment remains high. But the risks to the world’s largest economy emanating from other areas such as a housing market slump, fiscal dysfunction and the eurozone crisis have clearly abated. One potential area of concern, however, has been the unbridled growth of its financial sector and the failure of regulators to put in place checks and balances. In India the stock markets are running ahead of the real economy, which after a dismal run might have bottomed out and can now only move up.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/upbeat-global-sentiment/article5570709.ece
14,1,2014,Environment and development,"The decision of the Ministry of Environment and Forests to revalidate the environmental clearance issued to South Korean steelmaker Posco for the proposed steel plant in Odisha is based on a piecemeal approach, rather than a comprehensive and cumulative assessment of all parts of the project. It cannot claim to rely on sound judgment. What distinguishes the proposal from the welter of projects before the Ministry is its major Foreign Direct Investment potential, estimated at more than Rs.50,000 crore. There is little doubt that it will take massive investments to pull the masses out of deep poverty, and new industries are vital to achieving this goal. Significant expansion of the economy has taken place over the past two decades, creating much wealth. Unfortunately, this has also coincided with grossly uneven distribution of negative externalities. In the case of Posco, the acquisition of land has been a contentious issue, evoking strong protest from local communities which remain unconvinced about the benefits. Evidently, neither the project proponent nor the Odisha government has come up with persuasive arguments over the past eight years on why villagers should part with their land when their livelihood is linked to it. Moreover, there is no effort to reach a consensus on the renewal of environmental clearance, now for a production capacity of eight million tonnes per annum, even with conditionalities that include spending on ‘social commitments’ by Posco.
Grant of environmental clearance for the steel plant addresses only one of many components of the Posco project — mines, a port, railway lines and a housing facility that are integral to the functioning of the steel plant have been delinked. That point has already been made by the National Green Tribunal, which had recommended to the Centre that it consider the cumulative impact, and the concerns expressed by review committees set up to evaluate it. If the Ministry’s decisions must carry credibility, it must provide a detailed report on how these suggestions have been complied with. In the case of the equally high-profile Vedanta bauxite mining project in Niyamgiri in Odisha, the Ministry has deferred to the sentiments of the tribal residents and rejected the bid. Appropriating natural resources for development remains a contentious issue in a populous country where land is scarce and rehabilitation systems are weak. It has to be done selectively, and only after careful study of the impacts by credentialled specialists. There is little scope in a democracy to override public opinion, and impose unpopular decisions. It is also misleading to cast environmental safeguards and development as conflicting imperatives when they are vitally interlinked.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/environment-and-development/article5574305.ece
14,1,2014,The medium and the context,"The recently concluded annual music festival in Chennai, an event that makes the city unique, again highlights the unprecedented reach and recognition the arena of the arts and letters has acquired in recent years. Not only does India play host to innumerable literary, film and art festivals; the sub-continent is also the leitmotif in many such international events. Little wonder then that even the diplomatic community increasingly emphasises the need for India’s leadership to leverage the country’s soft power on the global stage. The influence of a free and open economic environment at home and the spectacular contribution of the diaspora in different parts of the world to promote and propagate the India story also cannot be over-emphasised. It cannot, however, be gainsaid that an atmosphere of greater tolerance of cultural diversity and a healthy respect for the expression of dissent are prerequisites for artistic and intellectual freedom to thrive. The continuing problems in these areas do not particularly dovetail with our overall record of mutual respect and accommodation.
The practitioners of Carnatic classical music enjoy pride of place as the nation’s cultural ambassadors. This has been in evidence for some decades now, with a large number of expatriate and second-generation Indians from Europe and North America thronging concerts. Their participation may have been limited to that of a discerning audience until some years ago. But today their contribution is far more substantial, as performers at various sabhas as lead and accompanying artistes — even an exclusive platform created for Non-Resident Indians by one sabha. All of this is a tribute to the average middle class family’s tenacity and dedication to go the extra mile to inculcate among the younger generations a taste for, and sensitivity towards, the fine arts. This aspect tends to be overlooked given the growing concerns over thinning attendance at concerts. But the real reasons for this situation perhaps have to do with the scheduling of events within the space of a few weeks. For centuries, music has been an integral aspect of social life in southern India, especially in Tamil Nadu, which continues to remain a bastion of the arts. If classical music is to continue to prove attractive as a career option, compliance with copyright protection is essential. Chief Justice of India P. Sathasivam had underscored the economic implications of copyright infringement for the culture industry in his inaugural address at the 87th annual conference of The Music Academy last month.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-medium-and-the-context/article5574294.ece
16,1,2014,The judges’ dilemma,"The Supreme Court faces an extraordinary dilemma. By ordering an internal probe into the allegations made by a former law intern against Justice (retd.) A.K. Ganguly, it had shown alacrity in protecting the image of the judiciary and responsiveness towards the plight of an aggrieved woman. The disclosure of the preliminary finding of a three-judge panel, that the former judge had indulged in an act of “unwelcome behaviour” towards the intern, led to Mr. Ganguly’s resignation from the post of Chairperson of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission. The court now has to contend with yet another challenge to its image and credibility in the form of a complaint by another former intern who has alleged she suffered an unsavoury experience at the hands of Justice Swatanter Kumar, when he was a Supreme Court judge. Mr. Kumar, who is now Chairperson of the National Green Tribunal, has denied the allegations. The former intern has now approached the court with a petition seeking a permanent mechanism to deal with sexual harassment in judicial bodies. She has also challenged the December 5, 2013, resolution of the Full Court that no more representations against former judges would be entertained. There can be no doubt that had a proper institutional mechanism been put in place a few years ago, both the aggrieved interns would have been better placed to seek redress. In its absence, the systemic imbalance of power between a judge and an intern deterred them from doing so.
In August 2013, the Supreme Court notified its regulations on gender sensitisation and sexual harassment of women on its precincts, and in November, its composition. A question that arises now is whether this mechanism is enough to adjudicate complaints of harassment and whether it can cover former judges. One dilemma for the judiciary is whether it should leave complaints against members of the superior judiciary to routine judicial processes such as a criminal complaint, or render a finding by its own judicial or administrative mechanism. There is a moral dilemma created by complaints that can be described as belated, going by the lapse of time, or timely, if one considers the present atmosphere as one that is more conducive to ensuring gender justice. It is whether the court is inadvertently creating a mode of removing or disabling or at least disparaging judges and heads of tribunals by encouraging such complaints. The question also arises if, going by the legal maxim that ‘a crime never dies’, it should not pursue the truth regardless of when it took place and where it leads to. There cannot be a perfect answer to the multiple dilemmas, but the court will hopefully put in place a mechanism that is seen as credible and fair while averting damage to the judiciary.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-judges-dilemma/article5579346.ece
16,1,2014,Testing the limits,"The Supreme Court has once again admonished the Sahara Pariwar, as the group likes to be called, for its endless machinations aimed at flouting its orders. Seeking to send a clear message to the Pariwar, the court said it was not “helpless” in taking further action and might ask the CBI and the Registrar of Companies to probe the sources of funds. An earlier order barring the promoter Subroto Roy and a few of his associates from leaving the country will remain. The specific issue now has been Sahara’s continued stonewalling of the court’s order to disclose the source of the nearly Rs. 23,000 crore with which it had claimed to have made refunds to a very large number of investors in its controversial optionally fully convertible debentures (OFCD). In 2011, the capital market regulator, SEBI, ruled the debenture illegal, after which the group launched a spate of legal proceedings at different forums, basically challenging the capital market regulator’s jurisdiction. Repeated rebuffs, at the Allahabad High Court and the Securities Appellate Tribunal, did not detract Sahara from the legal battles. A landmark Supreme Court judgment of August 31, 2012, comprehensively upheld SEBI’s stand and directed Sahara to furnish information on the OFCDs and repay depositors within strict timelines but it has found ways to dodge the order. In November, the Supreme Court, while dealing with yet another default, chastised the group “for making a mockery of our order” and for “playing hide and seek” with the highest judiciary. Those words were strong enough to shame anybody, but Sahara remains unfazed.
Having failed in its attempts to shop around for a favourable regulatory jurisdiction for its OFCDs — the Ministry of Corporate Affairs is seen to be more lenient than SEBI — Sahara is facing a more basic problem of preserving its extremely opaque functioning. The controversial debenture issue is to be seen as another attempt to conceal the true ownership of large sums of money. It is also another instance of its frequent brush with financial sector regulators. SEBI, which has pursued the case doggedly, should continue to be firm and withstand political pressures. Politicians, particularly in the Opposition, who are quick to seize issues such as this, have been strangely silent on the Sahara issue. The Finance Ministry has remained silent. As for the Supreme Court, neither its strong language nor indeed its repeated warnings are likely to faze the Pariwar. As a consequence, the credibility of the entire financial regulatory system, and indeed the rule of law itself, stands diminished.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/testing-the-limits/article5579347.ece
17,1,2014,Easing tensions in the Palk Bay,"The agreement between India and Sri Lanka to empty their jails of each other’s fishermen is an encouraging sign that both sides have the will to resolve a long-standing irritant in bilateral ties. At Wednesday’s meeting between Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar and Sri Lankan Fisheries and Aquatic Minister Rajitha Senaratne, both sides agreed to release all fishermen in their custody except those who face charges other than crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line. With this confidence building measure, both sides must now sit down to the challenge of finding a long-term solution to the problems of the fishing communities in the region. Over the years, Tamil Nadu fishermen have with increasing stridency made the demand for the right to fish in the entire Palk Bay, describing it as their “traditional fishing grounds”. It is no longer just about fishing rights around Kachchatheevu. The reason is that the catch is better on the Sri Lankan side. This is no accident. Bad practices such as the indiscriminate use of trawlers that dredge right down to the sea bed have depleted the resources along the Tamil Nadu coast. On the other side, the long years of conflict during which fishermen in Northeast Sri Lanka were barely allowed by the Sri Lankan Navy to put their boats out a few hundred metres into the sea has ensured that fish and other marine resources are still plentiful. Now that there are no military restrictions on fishing off Northeast Sri Lanka, Tamil fishermen there who are still struggling to rebuild their lives find themselves in daily competition with Tamil Nadu fishermen for what they claim is rightfully theirs. Worse, the fishermen from the Indian side, better organised and equipped with bigger boats and better nets, use the same practices that ravaged their side of the bay.
It is no surprise that an agreement — finalised in 2008 when the Sri Lankan military operations against the LTTE were intensifying — that was favourable to Indian fishermen is now seen by the Sri Lankan side as requiring re-negotiation. The solution to the problem may well come from the fishermen themselves. With the backing of the two capitals, they are to hold a meeting of their representatives on January 20 and may explore options such as licensing and placing restrictions on the number of fishing days. Ultimately, however, the real solution for both, especially on the Indian side, lies in preserving what is left by moving away from coastal to deep sea fishing. The State government and the Centre must also encourage fishermen to diversify into related activities such as deep-freezing, preserving and canning. That could even pave the way for collaboration between Indian and Sri Lankan fishing communities. The way forward is to find ways to complement each other’s livelihoods, instead of just competing over scarce resources.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/easing-tensions-in-the-palk-bay/article5583217.ece
17,1,2014,A new paradigm for inclusion,"The report of an RBI-appointed committee on financial inclusion and financial deepening has stimulated a wide-ranging debate on these crucial areas. However, policy measures initiated by the government and the RBI while adding to the numbers of new bank branches, new accounts and so on did not really enhance the quality of such inclusive practices. In September last year, the RBI asked the committee chaired by Nachiket Mor to prepare “a clear and detailed vision document” to lay down a set of “design principles” to guide national frameworks and regulation and to review existing strategies and institutions with a view to removing barriers to inclusion and to the deepening of the financial sector. The report, submitted in just over four months, is rich in detail, but its core agenda is to be seen in a few specific action points. Every Indian above 18 will have to be provided with a universal electronic bank account by January 2016, less than two years from now. Aadhaar will be the basis to open bank accounts. A vertically differentiated banking system with payments banks for deposits and payments and wholesale banks for credit outreach will come up, with few entry barriers.
No one can fault the committee for the lack of ambition or a sense of urgency. It has underlined the urgency by stipulating a distance rule — no one need walk for more than 15 minutes to reach a point of contact to avail a financial service. That has been one of the major areas of dissent within the committee, with two of its members seeking a more realistic timeframe. The committee might have glossed over the huge costs that will have to be incurred in terms of physical infrastructure and human resources. No matter how important technology will be in the emerging financial scene, the role of human resources cannot be discounted. The idea of setting up differentiated banks is not new. Regional rural banks and local area banks which fall in this category did not measure up despite being theoretically sound. Their cost structure moved up in line with those of commercial banks, making them unviable. Despite a much lower capital requirement being stipulated for these banks, there may not be many takers for them. The assumption that Aadhaar will roll out across the country by the end of next year might be an optimistic one. Despite such doubts, the Nachiket Mor report is a truly visionary document that should help the Reserve Bank and the government to initiate specific moves towards complete financial inclusion.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-new-paradigm-for-inclusion/article5583237.ece
18,1,2014,Safeguarding ancient treasures,"The return of three 1,000-year-old stone idols to India from the U.S. kindles the hope of recovering many more such stolen antiquities. Impressive detective work and persistent efforts by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations deserve commendation for this. The restitution of the three idols is a part of ICE’s ongoing efforts, and has less to do with assuaging feathers ruffled by the recent diplomatic row. In the last seven years, ICE, which was set up as a principal investigation arm of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003, has recovered more than 7,150 objects belonging to 26 countries. India benefited even on an earlier occasion. In 2006, ICE recovered a 9th century idol, which was stolen from a temple in Madhya Pradesh. To its credit, ICE in the recent case traced the trail of the stolen idols that spanned three continents and seized them when traffickers tried to move them across U.S. borders.
In contrast, the vigil for cultural objects that are moved across the Indian borders has been slack. For instance, container scanners are hardly available in Indian seaports. This has helped smugglers mix stolen idols with newly made look-alikes and ship them as handicrafts in large containers undetected. Another reason for ICE’s success is its training. Agents participate in workshops organised by the Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute and familiarise themselves with specificities of the illicit antiquities trade, and methods to investigate and store antiquities. Such a focussed approach is unheard of among Indian State and Central government agencies. Another critical shortcoming is the lack of documentation. Indian authorities realised the importance of documentation in the recent episode. The Archaeological Survey of India had details of two of the three idols and alerted the Interpol in time. Unfortunately, such thoughtful actions are few and far between. The sad truth is that many antiquities remain undocumented. In 2007, the Ministry of Culture launched the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquities to complete documentation of seven million antiquities by 2010. Until 2012, it had documented only 800,000 artefacts. Worse, the NMMA put details of only 2,823 objects on its website. Since 1987, the Central government has been promising to amend the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, which mandates registration of old artefacts and prohibits their export, but it has not done much on that front. An important lesson from the return of the three idols is that unless India vastly improves protective measures and investigative infrastructure, it can neither control trafficking nor recover lost antiquities.

18,1,2014,Scoring over polio,"On January 13, 2011, an 18-month-old infant in Howrah district of West Bengal was found to have been crippled by a naturally occurring wild strain of the polio-causing virus. However, no more children fell victim to such viruses over the next one year and India was then removed from the list of countries where polio is endemic. India has remained free of polio, and analysis of sewage samples have not turned up any signs of the virus lurking silently in the environment. Once final tests confirm that the wild virus has not been seen here for the last three years, the World Health Organisation’s 11-nation South-East Asia Region (of which India is a part) can be formally certified as polio-free. This region will then join the three that already enjoy this status — the Americas, Western Pacific and Europe. For India, this is an enormous public health achievement. Not so long ago experts believed that India, with its huge population, many poor and living in squalor, would be the very last to eradicate polio, a disease that once struck 50,000 to 100,000 Indian children annually. Even in 2009, nearly half of the world’s polio cases were occurring here. Yet, through determined efforts and systems to ensure that no child was missed during immunisation drives, transmission of the wild virus has been halted. Each national immunisation campaign is a mammoth operation, with 2.4 million vaccinators reaching oral vaccine drops to some 170 million children.
But the job is not over yet. Although no child in India has been paralysed by wild polio viruses over the last three years, several have been affected during the period when live but weakened strains of the virus used in the oral polio vaccine turned virulent again. Such vaccine-derived viruses can also spread like wild ones and be just as dangerous. In order to safely withdraw oral vaccines, all countries that rely on them have been asked to introduce at least one dose of an injectable polio vaccine based on killed viruses into their routine childhood immunisation. In India, steps are being taken to strengthen the way such immunisation is provided, particularly in States where vaccination levels are low, by incorporating lessons from the polio campaign for reaching every child and gaining community acceptance. Moreover, polio is still endemic in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria, and in the past year the viruses have spread from there to other countries. There is therefore the risk that the virus might be imported into India too. As long as it continues to circulate in the world, India and other countries that are polio-free must keep their guard up.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/scoring-over-polio/article5587292.ece
20,1,2014,A leader steps forward,"In a thoughtful and combative speech delivered at Saturday’s session of the All-India Congress Committee, Rahul Gandhi combined vision with heart, seeking to enthuse the cadre at a time of debilitating crisis in his party. Mr. Gandhi’s address was remarkable for seamlessly connecting many strands of thought, but above all, for trying to establish the Congress as an idea indistinguishable from the idea of India. The Congress leader, so far viewed as an unwilling recruit to power politics, showcased his feisty and combative side, thereby not merely surprising pundits and political opponents, but enthusing a cadre disillusioned by the party’s recent record of inaction. The AICC session was scheduled in the backdrop of growing internal disquiet over the party’s seeming surrender before far more aggressive and focussed rivals. It was not so much the party’s dipping electoral fortunes that bothered the workers as much as perceived abdication by the leadership. In the event, and perhaps for the first time, the Congress vice-president placed himself in command, telling party foot-soldiers that he was ready to lead.
Mr. Gandhi gently but surely signalled to the old guard that the baton must pass on to the next generation; that a demographically young India deserved an aspirationally driven leadership. At the same time, he placed the Congress in a historical continuum, sketching its journey from pre-Independence struggles through milestones achieved in social reform while in governance, to its embrace of technology in the modern era. In doing so, he drew a distinction between the Congress and its rivals whom he lampooned for being all about form and no substance. The Congress had a constitutional vision, it straddled history and modernity with equal ease, and importantly, it was a party of ideas, Mr. Gandhi said. The Congress vice-president did not name the Aam Aadmi Party or the Bharatiya Janata Party but insinuated that while one practised ad hoc street politics disconnected from due process, the other was driven by the personality cult. The constitutional context came up yet again in Mr. Gandhi’s explanation for why he could not run for prime ministership: the Parliamentary Party leader had necessarily to be elected by the MPs. That the prognosis for the Congress is none too good in the upcoming general election is not hidden from anyone. The message Mr. Gandhi conveyed was that he will be there for his party through thick and thin, through any adversity. Not just this. He turned the corruption argument on its head by positioning the Congress as the party that enabled corruption to be exposed through empowering tools such as the Right to Information Act and the Lokpal Act. Mr. Gandhi has given the average Congress worker reason for hope at a time when there is very little going for her.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-leader-steps-forward/article5594128.ece
20,1,2014,Some cheer on the economy,"For a government facing criticism for not doing enough for the economy, some indicators have brought cheer. Until now, nearly all crucial data on the macroeconomy seemed to portray the UPA-II government’s recent economic performance in a negative light. Not long ago, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh more or less admitted his government’s failure to get a grip on inflation. High prices were a major campaign issue in the recent State elections and are certain to figure prominently in the coming national elections as well. Failure to push up GDP growth to levels seen just a few years ago is another negative factor. In the first half of the current year (2013-14), the economy grew by barely 4.6 per cent and it may not be able to match the CSO’s estimate of 5 per cent for last year, the lowest in a decade.
The overall macroeconomic scene has not been encouraging for the ruling coalition, but bits of good news that have started trickling in can partially lift the gloom. Arguably, the most satisfying news in the recent period has been the sharp fall in inflation, both headline and retail, in December. The former moderated significantly to a five-month low of 6.16 per cent from a 14-month high of 7.52 per cent in November. Retail inflation too fell from 11.6 to 9.87 per cent in the same period. A sharp fall in the prices of vegetables, especially onions, was responsible for the moderation. Inflation affects the common man and the vulnerable much more in the immediate term than any other variable including growth rates. However, while decline in inflation is welcome, it must be noted that the moderation has not been across all categories. Even within the food basket, prices of dairy products and eggs remain stubbornly high. For the RBI, which will review the credit policy at the end of this month, the decline in inflation would be welcome but not good enough to cut rates. Core inflation, a widely watched measure that excludes food and fuel prices. has been climbing. The other important piece of good news has to do with a possible revision by the CSO of its growth estimates of some previous years. The estimate for 2011-12 will be revised upwards from 6.2 per cent to between 7 and 7.75 per cent and for last year from 5 per cent to 5.5 per cent and above. Revisions in data are not uncommon, but its magnitude this time certainly is. The CSO should back its revisions with a solid explanation to uphold the integrity of official statistics. Whether the improvement in economic indicators will be sustained over the next few months is a moot question.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/some-cheer-on-the-economy/article5594129.ece
21,1,2014,From Hindutva to development,"Narendra Modi would like to appeal to different people in different ways. After the initial consolidation phase, when he was seen solely as a Hindutva proponent, Mr. Modi is now in the expansion phase, trying to reach out to people who have not traditionally voted for his Bharatiya Janata Party. The BJP’s prime ministerial candidate wants to be Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani rolled into one, a Loh Purush and a Vikas Purush. The Gujarat strongman will have few rivals within or outside his party for the “man-of-steel” title with his carefully-cultivated image of political decisiveness and administrative firmness. After having outdone Mr. Advani as Loh Purush, Mr. Modi needed to extend his support beyond the core constituency of the Hindutva brand of politics. The “development” or Vikas Purush tag, which comes with holding up Gujarat as a model State for growth and development, is a more recent acquisition, but not any the less important for that reason. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Modi’s articulation of his idea of India at Sunday’s national meet of the BJP was important both for what it highlighted and what it left out. There was no space for controversial issues such as minority rights and the building of a Ram temple at Ayodhya, the trump cards of the BJP whenever it is in retreat. Instead, Mr. Modi came up with a “rainbow strategy” of strengthening cultural and familial values, agricultural-rural development, women’s empowerment and security, environmental protection, youth power, democracy, and knowledge and skill development.
Had the same strategy been spelt out by the Congress’s Rahul Gandhi, no one would have batted an eyelid. Mr. Modi might not think much of the leaders of the Congress, but he appears very intent on wooing sections considered as the traditional support base of that party. As evident from the results of the Assembly elections late last year, Mr. Modi was able to reinvigorate the cadres and support bases of the BJP. But, 2013 showed that he was not politically acceptable to many of the BJP’s former allies, such as the Janata Dal (United) and the Biju Janata Dal. Without toning down the Hindutva rhetoric, and without placing governance in the forefront, Mr. Modi realises, he would not be able to bridge the seats deficit after the Lok Sabha election. Mission 272+ is easier said than done, and the BJP cannot wish away its dependence on other parties if it is to form the next government. With the growth and development mantra, Mr. Modi is not exactly engaged in an image makeover, but he is certainly showing a readiness to appear to move away from a divisive communal politics that characterised his emergence as a politician in the initial years.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/from-hindutva-to-development/article5597915.ece
21,1,2014,The diaspora’s dark side,"From caste discrimination through forced marriages to sex-selective abortions, entrenched practices among sections of the British South Asian diaspora pose continuing challenges. Caste discrimination is common enough; the European Parliament passed a resolution in 2013 calling for EU institutions to include procedures against it in their dealings with caste-affected countries. As for forced marriages among South Asian and other British ethnic minorities, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has a section specifically to help victims. Sex-selective abortions, on the other hand, have only recently attracted attention, following a series of reports in the Independent, which commissioned Imperial College London to analyse the 2011 census. The paper concludes that the number of female births in the relevant communities is below the expected figure by between 1,400 and 4,700 in England and Wales. This contradicts junior Minister Earl Howe’s 2013 statement — after a sting operation by the Daily Telegraph identified two doctors ready to perform sex-selective terminations — that there was no evidence of the practice in the U.K.
Campaigning groups, individuals, and the media have nevertheless confirmed that there are social and cultural pressures on South Asian British women to abort female foetuses. The Abortion Act 1967 does not expressly ban abortion on gender grounds, but it would require two doctors to conclude that the mother faces health risks which outweigh those of termination, and it would be difficult to prove that the doctors had not investigated the mother’s health properly. Many National Health Service hospitals do not state the sex of unborn babies until after the 24-week abortion deadline, but families can use private services instead. Technical developments, such as sperm washing to ensure conception of male foetuses, complicate the picture; the claim has even been made that a woman has a right to choose the sex of her child. In addition, some South Asian British families take women carrying female foetuses to parts of South Asia where the law is not rigorously enforced; a profitable trade in sex-selective terminations has arisen. The U.K. law can be tightened, but the key problems lie in social attitudes. One response would be for the U.K. to crack down harder on racial discrimination, which blocks many ethnic-minority communities from full access to British life and isolates the women; another would be closer cooperation between the affected countries. As what has been called a global war on girls spreads, all governments involved must move to end sex-selective abortion.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-diasporas-dark-side/article5597913.ece
22,1,2014,The antics of a Chief Minister,"Until reason prevailed, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was not merely sitting in dharna in Delhi, he was also toying with the people’s trust and endangering their hopes for an alternative form of politics and administration. By holding the city to ransom until he called it off last evening, he was violating the mandate of those who voted for his party in the belief that he would place the public interest above political posturing. And by making the patently unjustified demand that police officers who refused to comply with his Minister’s illegal orders be suspended, he was undermining the rule of law. It is strange that he should be defending vigilantism by his Ministers. The drama began last week when Ministers in the AAP government embarked on law enforcement, in a fit of self-righteousness, against purported prostitution and drug-peddling. In one instance, their target was a group of Ugandan women, who were detained, vilified and forced to give urine samples, with groups of vigilantes hovering nearby. Forgotten here was the fact that Indian law does not permit arbitrary search and seizure, especially involving women in the dead of the night. Delhi’s Law Minister Somnath Bharti demonstrated astonishing ignorance of the fact that the law on immoral trafficking aims to rescue and protect victims of trafficking, and not to capture them. The External Affairs Ministry had to assure diplomats from African countries that the incident was an aberration, and not to be viewed as an instance of how the country treats African nationals. Surprisingly, the police are yet to proceed against Mr. Bharti; nor has Mr. Kejriwal thought it fit to drop him from his Cabinet.
Mr. Kejriwal sought to give a veneer of political legitimacy to his absurd drama by raising the larger demand that the Delhi Police, now under the Union Home Ministry, be made accountable to the Delhi government, as he wants to ensure better security for the people of Delhi. There is nothing new in this demand and it is hardly the kind of issue for which the Chief Minister should plunge the city into anarchy. Bringing the Delhi Police under the State government involves amendments to the law and a process of calm negotiation. If at all there is a political explanation for his actions, it is that Mr. Kejriwal wants to invite the dismissal of his government, or at least withdrawal of support by the Congress, so that he can face the Lok Sabha election in the garb of a martyr. It was time he put his party and his government on a proper course and called off the unseemly agitation. A certain directness, simplicity and a move away from the VIP culture did mark a welcome change, but Mr. Kejriwal should guard against the new style degenerating into antics.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-antics-of-a-chief-minister/article5602605.ece
22,1,2014,A patchy record,"Even as the prevalence of daily smoking among men in India has come down from about 34 to 23 per cent between 1980 and 2012, the absolute number of smokers has risen — from about 69 million in 1980 to 98 million in 2012. In the case of women, while the prevalence has increased only marginally from 3 per cent in 1980 to 3.2 per cent in 2012, the number of smokers has more than doubled — from 5.3 million to 12.1 million during the same period. The increase in the absolute number of smokers is due to the growth in population outpacing the percentage reduction in prevalence. These are some of the findings of a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The only silver lining is the reduction in the mean daily consumption of cigarettes and bidis per smoker — from 11.6 to 8.2 between 1980 and 2012. All these clearly illustrate why tobacco use (smoking and chewing) kills nearly a million people annually in India. Large-scale studies undertaken in a few countries, India included, have found that mortality among middle-aged people who smoked was two to three times more than those who have never smoked. Thus, on an average, the life span of smokers is reduced by 10 years. The prevalence of smoking reaches its peak at 45 per cent in the 45 to 49 age group, and then falls.
Except for facilitating individual States to ban chewing tobacco under the Food Safety and Standards Regulation Act 2011, most of the measures to rein in tobacco use have not been implemented in earnest. It is shocking that there is near-absolute apathy on the part of the government despite the huge health implications and economic costs of tobacco use. According to the Ministry of Health’s own admission before the Supreme Court in October last year, the total economic cost of tobacco use is over Rs.10,500 crore ($1.7 billion). The 2013 WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic reveals India’s shortcomings in implementing key tobacco control policies aimed at cutting consumption. For instance, it has achieved just 50 per cent compliance in banning all forms of direct and indirect advertising. Not surprisingly, it has got a dismal rating of two on a five-point scale for the small health warning on cigarette packages. Besides violating the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, to which India is a signatory, by deciding to rotate pictorial warnings only once every two years instead of every year, it is yet to change even the ineffective ones first introduced in 2009. Thousands of deaths that take place every year represent the huge and tragic cost of deferring to the interests of the tobacco industry and tobacco growers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-patchy-record/article5602594.ece
23,1,2014,The injustice of delay,"Acountry that retains the death penalty needs constantly to fine-tune its clemency jurisprudence as the second best option. The Supreme Court’s latest verdict on death row convicts is a thoughtful exposition of the law in this regard. Commuting the death sentences of 15 convicts to life sentences, a three-judge Bench, headed by Chief Justice P. Sathasivam, has significantly expanded the scope for judicial intervention to save the lives of convicts after the rejection of their mercy petitions. As the scope for judicial review in such cases is limited, the court has sought to protect the rights of condemned prisoners arising from supervening circumstances after their cases have attained judicial finality. The court has laid down fresh rules to humanise the treatment of those facing the gallows, right up to the moment of their execution and even after that. The breadth of this ruling is impressive: it removes all lingering doubts about the rule against undue delay; it overturns the exception carved out in Devendar Pal Singh Bhullar (2013) for offences involving terrorism; it reminds jail authorities of the bar on keeping death row convicts in solitary confinement before the rejection of their mercy pleas; it lists mental illnesses and solitary confinement as new grounds for commutation. It further mandates legal aid for convicts in drafting mercy petitions and exploring judicial remedies.
Apparently taking note of the secret execution of Afzal Guru, the court has crafted a new rule that families of convicts ought to be informed in writing as soon as their mercy petitions are rejected. It bars execution for the next 14 days so that they have the consolation of a final reunion. Speaking with moral clarity, the court has gathered the best of its extant jurisprudence on the subject and added nuggets of humaneness to elevate the existing body of law, as it were, to a higher humanitarian plane. That those who benefit from this judgment are guilty of heinous offences should not cast a shadow on the moral foundation on which the verdict stands. The principle that is reaffirmed is that be they terrorists or murderers, their fundamental rights are not extinguished upon conviction. The message that the executive should deal expeditiously with mercy petitions should, however, not propel authorities to the other extreme — making hasty decisions without considering relevant factors just to quicken the process. Constitutional functionaries face a dilemma in considering clemency for convicts who have caused multiple deaths or displayed great cruelty. Judicial guidance will humanise the process, but the real solution lies in abolishing the cruel and inhuman penalty of death.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-injustice-of-delay/article5606434.ece
23,1,2014,Oil exploration and security,"First it was telecom a couple of years ago and now it is oil and gas exploration. It looks like the Chinese ghost will not go away. The Union Home Ministry has advised the Petroleum Ministry against considering Chinese firms for the award of exploration rights in oil and gas blocks due to “security reasons”. The on-land blocks in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Punjab proposed for auction are located close to the border with Pakistan where apparently China is engaged in different projects. The blocks in the northeast and offshore ones in the Mahanadi basin, says the Home Ministry, are “close to sensitive defence installations and strategic assets”. In its view, these blocks should therefore be given only to Indian public sector companies for exploration. The Home Ministry also wants its advice to be kept in mind while finalising sub-contracts for services such as equipment procurement, consultancy and maintenance. Truth to tell, it is not as if too many foreign companies are lining up to invest in the country’s oil and gas exploration sector, not to talk of Chinese ones. The auctioning of oil exploration blocks under the New Exploration Licensing Policy has attracted but tepid attention from foreign bidders in the last couple of rounds, and the story is likely to be the same in the upcoming one as well.
Yet, the bogey of threat from Chinese companies needs to be busted. For all its exertions in recent years, the government has not provided concrete evidence of any wrongdoing by Chinese companies in the telecom and IT sectors. Its warnings have been based on mere suspicion — which is not enough grounds to keep out a foreign investor, especially in these difficult times for the economy. On the other hand, it was Facebook, Google and Twitter, companies that are headquartered in what is supposed to be a friendly country, which were in the eye of a storm over sharing data from their servers, including that of Indians, with the U.S. National Security Agency. This proves companies from friendly countries are as capable of aiding espionage as those from not-so-friendly ones. And the answer is not to ban or show the door to all multinationals but to put in place protective systems to safeguard the country’s interests and assets. In the case of the oil blocks there is indeed a problem as these are located in strategic or sensitive parts of the country. Instead of trying to keep out companies from one country or the other, the government would do well to create a reporting and monitoring system that will enable security agencies to keep an eye on the activities of these companies, especially when it comes to blocks located close to defence installations. That is the way to handle security threats.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/oil-exploration-and-security/article5606430.ece
24,1,2014,New notes for old,"The move by the Reserve Bank of India to withdraw from circulation all currency notes issued prior to 2005 is interesting indeed. These notes will be legal tender until March 31, and from April 1 holders will have to exchange them with banks for new ones. Two months thereon — that is, from July 1 — those wanting to exchange more than 10 such notes of Rs.500 or Rs.1,000 denomination will have to provide proof of identity and residence if they go to a bank where they do not regularly transact. In the interim period, it is not known if banks have to note down details of those exchanging such notes and pass them on to relevant authorities. But obviously they will have to do so if the objective of the RBI move is what it is widely believed to be: to flush out unaccounted money and either bring it back into the system or strip it of its value. Those who are hoarding currency notes issued before 2005 right now will have to get it out into the open either to transact until March 31 or to exchange with banks. It will not be easy to get large volumes of currency into the system unnoticed in such a short period. Even if some of it does get exchanged, the RBI will not mind that as it would have achieved the objective of getting such money into the legal system.
The RBI move will also help eliminate counterfeit notes from the system. Notes issued after 2005 have security features built into them that are absent in counterfeit currency. As of December 31, 2004, the value of notes issued and in circulation was Rs.3,43,658 crore as per RBI data. That is approximately the amount of older currency that will need to be exchanged before the RBI closes the window. As of now it has not specified any time limit for the exchange. To be sure, some part of that would have been already replaced in the normal course by the RBI. But it will be safe to assume that a good part is still in the system given that the value of notes in circulation has shot up to Rs.11,40,621 crore as per latest available data (January 11, 2013). Sceptics can still point out that not all black money is held as cash and not all unaccounted cash will be in the form of notes issued prior to 2005. While that may be true, the fact remains that the RBI’s move will make life difficult for those who have hoarded currency notes. The timing of the move, just ahead of general elections, is also interesting. It is no secret that unaccounted money plays a major role in funding elections in this country, and in recent times to even buy votes through cash inducements. The RBI’s move may or may not dent the finances of the politicians, but one thing is clear: it is a good step to get at least a part of the stock of unaccounted cash back into the system.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/new-notes-for-old/article5610257.ece
24,1,2014,An ominous situation,"That the medicine chest is bereft of effective new drugs to fight the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) strain has once again become frighteningly clear. According to a study published recently in The Lancet, while only 16 per cent (17 of the 107) of a South African patient cohort had either treatment cure or completion at the end of two years of follow-up, as many as 49 patients died and 25 failed treatment. With the strain remaining resistant to at least four of the most potent anti-TB drugs available today, XDR-TB patients have virtually exhausted all treatment options. Hence, despite long, complicated and prohibitively expensive treatment using toxic drugs, the outcome is at best poor. The dire urgency to bring immediate focus on the discovery of efficacious anti-TB drugs to treat all forms of drug-resistant strains becomes clear as hospitals in South Africa, for want of beds, are being forced to discharge XDR-TB patients who are yet to be cured. This is particularly ominous as they can spread the disease with equal ease as those with drug-sensitive TB. With the median survival period from the time of discharge being nearly 20 months, the threat of the dangerous form of TB spiralling out of control is real as many patients are culture-positive and about a third are smear-positive at the time of discharge; smear-positive patients have a higher bacterial load and hence a greater potential for spreading the disease. If this situation is allowed to continue for a few more years, the XDR-TB strain would spread to all countries.
There is also an immediate and pressing need for the high-burden countries to increase the number of beds for treating drug-resistant cases. It is time to come up with acceptable and workable solutions to isolate XDR-TB treatment failure or incurable cases to cut the transmission chain. Reducing the reservoir of TB-infected people through a simple, cheap and effective isoniazid preventive therapy in children under five years of age exposed to adults with pulmonary TB, will pay significant dividends in the long run. Next in priority should be ensuring that most drug-sensitive patients are diagnosed early, treatment using the correct drug regimen is initiated without delay, and the default rate is greatly reduced. This would automatically prevent the emergence of drug-resistant forms. The importance of this becomes all the more clear as all the parameters that go into the successful completion of drug-resistant TB treatment are fraught with problems. India, which is now expanding and equipping MDR-TB diagnostic centres with GeneXpert, has already detected 64,000 cases, the highest in the world.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-ominous-situation/article5610282.ece
25,1,2014,Stamp out kangaroo courts,"The incident in Subalpur village in West Bengal’s Birbhum district, in which a 20-year-old tribal woman was gang-raped by a dozen men as punishment for alleged immoral conduct, is shocking in its unimaginable brutality and points to a larger malaise. The order by a kangaroo court led by a village headman is proof that a section of rural India is outside the pale of the country’s constitutional values and judicial system. Ill-informed men with medieval social attitudes and patriarchal prejudices are allowed to adjudicate on the conduct and morality of women and pass unconscionable forms of punishment, such as social ostracism, payment of arbitrary fines and, as in this case, sexual violence in lieu of monetary penalty. The Supreme Court and the National Commission for Women have taken suo motu cognisance of the incident, which has caused widespread outrage and revulsion. The West Bengal government, which has been sharply criticised in recent times for callousness and insensitivity towards crimes against women, has seen to it that the village headman and the 12 men who raped the hapless woman for a whole night have been arrested. And Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, upset that the police did not seek custody of the accused for questioning and allowed them to be sent to prison directly, has ordered the suspension of the Superintendent of Police. It is disturbing that the entire village, including women, backed the kangaroo court by whose verdict the man could get away with a fine, but the woman was punished for not having the means to do so.
Outposts of feudalism still thrive in vast swathes of rural India, ranging from khap panchayats in the north to caste-based gatherings of village elders in the south. In 2011, the Supreme Court wanted illegal khap panchayats that encourage ‘honour killings’ or other institutionalised atrocities to be stamped out ruthlessly. Over a year has elapsed since the country voiced its anger against sexual violence targeted at women and seemed to take a collective vow to ensure the protection of all women. The penal law on sexual violence and harassment has been strengthened significantly since then. Yet, India’s cities and villages continue to be unsafe for women. The locus of sexual violence is everywhere: in public spaces and private homes, under the cloak of darkness and in the open, and perpetrated by well-acquainted persons as also as by strangers. The Birbhum incident is a chilling reminder that legal processes, security measures and stringent laws are not enough. Social attitudes need to change, reflecting liberal and humane values, if the country is to ensure gender equality and protection for all its women.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/stamp-out-kangaroo-courts/article5614885.ece
25,1,2014,Towards a rules-based policy,"A Reserve Bank-appointed committee headed by Deputy Governor Urjit Patel was asked to revise and strengthen the monetary policy framework in India. In its core recommendations it wants monetary policy to formally move towards using headline CPI (Consumer Price Index) as its nominal anchor. Communicating the nominal anchor without any ambiguity will be a key task. The objective is to ensure a monetary policy regime shift away from the current approach, which has multiple objectives, to one that is centred on the target CPI. However, taking into account the current macroeconomic scenario, the committee has conceded the need for flexibility in inflation-targeting to enable the central bank to deal with other objectives in the short run. The ultimate goal is to contain CPI inflation within a target band of 4 per cent plus or minus 2 per cent. A smooth two-year transition is envisaged. From the current 10 per cent levels, CPI inflation is to be brought down to 8 per cent in 12 months and to 6 per cent in 24 months. Monetary policy will henceforth be conducted by a new Monetary Policy Committee which will have the Governor as its head and three senior officers of the RBI as its members. In addition, two outside experts will be nominated. All members will vote on the policy at meetings every two months. The MPC will be accountable for any failure to achieve the inflation target.
The committee has suggested crucial changes in the operating framework and instruments in the conduct of monetary policy. Its report has generally been received well by banks and financial markets. It enables policy formulation in a phased and transparent manner using a real policy rate as reference. Over the medium term, the recommendations will help develop a term money market, reduce fluctuations in market liquidity and remove distortions in interest rates. Its unrelenting focus on inflation is justified on several counts — India has the highest rate of inflation among G-20 countries. Inflation expectations are deeply entrenched and inflation at current levels is inimical to medium-term growth and macroeconomic stability. Understandably, Finance Ministry officials are not happy with proposals that would strengthen the central bank’s case for complete autonomy in matters of monetary policy. The fact that monetary policy has very little influence over high food inflation that has pushed up the CPI, could limit the efficacy of the new approach. All these do not detract from the fact that a shift to a rules-based policy framework recommended will replace the purely discretionary approach the RBI has followed so far, and is therefore to be welcomed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/towards-a-rulesbased-policy/article5614887.ece
27,1,2014,Reopen the Pathribal case,"The Indian Army has not covered itself with glory by closing the cases against the officers involved in the infamous Pathribal fake encounter in Jammu and Kashmir in which five civilians were killed. Taking over the investigation of the case after an uproar over the 2000 incident, the Central Bureau of Investigation concluded that a Brigadier, a Lieutenant Colonel, two Majors, and a Subedar of 7 Rashtriya Rifles had staged the encounter, picking up civilians from the Anantnag area and killing them in cold blood. They lied to the police that the five were foreign militants who had carried out the massacre of Sikhs in Chattisinghpora a few days earlier. Backed by the Ministry of Defence and the Army top brass, the officers named contested the CBI charge sheet, making the argument that under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, prior sanction was required to prosecute them. When the legal battle reached its portals, the Supreme Court upheld the officers’ case. It also directed the Army to either sanction the prosecution of the officers or court-martial them. The Army was offered the same options back in 2001, but chose to prolong the legal battle. This time, its back to the wall, it chose the latter option. The Army court has egregiously concluded that “the evidence recorded could not establish a prima facie case against any of the accused.” The finding flies in the face of the CBI investigation, but that was only to be expected. The last hope the families of the dead had that justice might be done, lies buried.
It was only in December 2013 that the Army was patting itself on the back for ordering the court martial of three officers involved in the Machchil fake encounter case, citing that as evidence of its willingness to improve its human rights record. But the Pathribal case, through all its legal twists and turns, ending in the exoneration of the accused officers, sends exactly the opposite message. It is a textbook illustration of why the AFSPA is flawed, and strengthens the case to do away with the provision that requires “previous sanction” from the Central government for prosecution, if not to repeal the law itself. The Army’s whitewash job can only increase resentment against the military in Kashmir, and feed into the sense of alienation. Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, who understands this well, has rightly said Pathribal “can’t be closed or wished away”. The leader of the National Conference, already criticised as a Congress “stooge”, will have to face the political backlash from the exoneration. If the Centre is serious about winning hearts and minds in Kashmir, it should step in to undo the damage, and find a legal way to reopen the case and pave the way for a civilian trial.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/reopen-the-pathribal-case/article5620678.ece
27,1,2014,DMK’s intractable problem,"The suspension of M.K. Alagiri from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam is a short-term remedy for what is clearly a deeper, longstanding problem for the party. Mr. Alagiri, the elder son of party patriarch M. Karunanidhi, has an infinite capacity to create trouble in the organisation if only because he is a member of the party’s first family. This is the latest of several situations over the last few years in which he has fallen out of favour with the leadership. In 2000, the DMK leadership asked partymen not to have any links with him in view of his anti-party activities. At the time, Mr. Alagiri managed to leverage his familial connections to return to a truly powerful role in the DMK. For this very reason, his close supporters and loyalists are unlikely to desert him in this time of crisis. But with the Lok Sabha election only months away, DMK president Mr. Karunanidhi and his likely successor, the younger son M.K. Stalin, could not afford to remain silent in the wake of a series of provocative actions by Mr. Alagiri. Besides declaring that he would not accept Mr. Stalin as party leader, Mr. Alagiri attacked the actor-politician Vijayakanth, leader of the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam, one of the potential allies of the DMK. After Mr. Alagiri stayed away from the general council meeting of the party, his faction came out with posters announcing another “general council” meeting of the party on January 30 without any authorisation, a move that was seen by Mr. Karunanidhi and Mr. Stalin as political mischief. Any further delay in taking action would only have emboldened Mr. Alagiri’s loyalists in Madurai and other southern districts. The factionalism gained a new edge with some of the Alagiri faction members filing cases against supporters of Mr. Stalin under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The party was already split for all practical purposes, and the general election would have witnessed further confusion among its workers and supporters.
While the suspension sends a strong signal to the party that Mr. Alagiri’s behaviour was clearly out of line, it cannot counter the potential of the rebel faction to create divisions . However, little else could have been done at this moment. In the ongoing struggle between the two brothers for political power, there can be only one winner. At present Mr. Stalin clearly enjoys the support of the vast majority in the organisation, but Mr. Alagiri is unwilling to play second fiddle. There are no obvious paths to a compromise in such a situation. Far from ending the DMK’s troubles stemming from this unhealthy sibling rivalry, the suspension merely marks a new phase in a high-stakes fight.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dmks-intractable-problem/article5620676.ece
28,1,2014,Decoding the President’s address,"In his address to the nation on the eve of Republic Day, President Pranab Mukherjee seemed intent on tempering hope with caution and idealism with pragmatism. But what caught everyone’s attention was the political undertone of what he himself noted was his last address before the next government takes office. For someone who made a smooth transition from being a Cabinet Minister to becoming the President, Mr. Mukherjee was surprisingly forthright in his warning to the political class. Justifying people’s anger at the weakening of democratic institutions, he said: “If we hear sometimes an anthem of despair from the street, it is because people feel that a sacred trust is being violated.” For those looking for a warning to the Congress, Mr. Mukherjee had more than a few words on corruption. If Indians are enraged, he said, it is because they are witnessing corruption and waste of national resources. “If governments do not remove these flaws, voters will remove governments.” But the veiled attack on the Aam Aadmi Party, the reference to “populist anarchy”, now associated with its leader Arvind Kejriwal, captured more mind space. Arguing that populist anarchy cannot be a substitute for governance, the President said: “False promises lead to disillusionment, which gives birth to rage, and that rage has one legitimate target: those in power.” If the reference to communal forces is taken as thumbs down to the Bharatiya Janata Party, Mr. Mukherjee appears to have spared none in his address.
Whether read as notes of caution to the Congress, or as articulation of dissatisfaction with the ways of the AAP or the BJP, these remarks assume added importance in the current political context. President Mukherjee clearly wants it to be known that he is on the side of the people and democratic institutions, not blindly supportive of governments and certainly not sympathetic to those in power. Curiously, Mr. Mukherjee also wanted the people to vote in a stable government. True, as he noted, a fractured government, “hostage to whimsical opportunists,” would be an unhappy electoral outcome. But to ask the people to vote for a stable government can mean little more than to ask them to vote for a party widely seen as the front-runner. Whether this could be taken as an endorsement of the BJP in the current context is debatable, but it could lend itself to interpretation. So far, Mr. Mukherjee has played by the book in what he has done and what he has not, as President. The political sub-text of his lines and their varying interpretations notwithstanding, the address provides no indication that he is about to change his approach as the President of the Republic.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/decoding-the-presidents-address/article5623820.ece
28,1,2014,Outsiders seize the moment,"This was the year of the outsider at the Australian Open. Few would have picked Stanislas Wawrinka and Li Na as champions ahead of the fortnight in Melbourne. But the outcome was a reminder that the only certainty in sport is its inherent uncertainty. Wawrinka and Li took contrasting routes to victory: the 28-year-old Swiss became only the ninth man in the Open Era and the first in 21 years to beat both the No.1 and No.2 seeds to triumph; the 31-year-old Chinese woman, the first Asian to win ‘The Grand Slam of the Asia/Pacific’, made capital of a draw that opened up after the exit of favourites Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova, and Victoria Azarenka. But this is not to say one achievement was any less than the other. For Wawrinka and Li’s underdog stories are uplifting — seven matches in 14 days against the best in the world ensure that only the truly deserving survives.
Wawrinka said he could not imagine winning a major and it is not hard to see why. It has been incredibly difficult to break through in this era of men’s tennis. Only on one other occasion in the last nine years has there been a Grand Slam champion outside the Big Four of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Andy Murray — Juan Martin del Potro at the 2009 U.S. Open. In emerging from compatriot Federer’s giant shadow and defeating Djokovic and Nadal, Wawrinka proved that he deserves a chair at the top table. The difference in Wawrinka has been his recognition of failure’s transformative potential. He has tattooed on his left arm, Samuel Beckett’s words, “Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.” It helps that he is an incredibly talented shot-maker with reserves of easy power. “God, his backhand, I wish I had that thing,” said the great Pete Sampras, who presented him the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup. Wawrinka earned it the hard way. He steeled himself to beat Djokovic in the quarterfinals, after two heart-breaking five-set defeats to the Serb in 2013. He then betrayed no nerves in his first-ever Grand Slam final, outplaying Nadal for a set and a bit with tactically sharp tennis that was as ruthless as it was dazzling. Things became messy with Nadal’s injury — Wawrinka’s focus wavered, the enormity of victory began to weigh heavy; all the while the great Spaniard refused to lose. But Wawrinka recovered his composure — much as Li had done the previous day in a tight first set in the women’s final — to embrace victory. Li’s triumph, after a year during which she contemplated retirement, showed how quickly matters can change in sport; it merely requires the will to seize the moment. Few have done it to such popular acclaim as Wawrinka and Li.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/outsiders-seize-the-moment/article5623825.ece
29,1,2014,A strengthening relationship,"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit to India as chief guest at the Republic Day parade, and the clutch of agreements signed between the two countries during the 36 hours he spent in the country, add more cement to a relationship that has been growing steadily since 2005 and is valued by both sides. As Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said, there are no two opinions in India on the importance of building ties with Japan; the country is at the heart of New Delhi’s Look East Policy. The strategic component of the relationship has increased dramatically over the last four years. Besides an annual summit, an institutionalised multi-layered strategic dialogue at several levels — between the Defence Ministers, a “two plus two” among the Foreign Secretaries and Defence Secretaries of both sides, one on maritime security, and a trilateral between India, U.S. and Japan — has kept up the momentum. In addition, as announced significantly during Mr. Abe’s visit, the head of Japan’s recently set up National Security Council and India’s National Security Adviser are to hold regular consultations. The Indian Navy and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF), as the country’s navy is called, held a joint maritime exercise off Chennai in December 2013. According to the joint statement issued after talks between Prime Minister Abe and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, both “reaffirmed the importance of such exercises, and renewed their resolution to continue to conduct them on a regular basis with increased frequency.” India is also in negotiations with Japan to buy its amphibious aircraft, Utility Seaplane-2, used by the Japanese Navy. Even as both sides deepen their strategic partnership, they should be clear that their shared wariness of China cannot be the basis for healthy ties.
Indeed, Mr. Abe’s arrival in India along with a huge business delegation was a reminder that there is a significant economic dimension to the relationship, even though this is its underperforming side. Japan-India bilateral trade, which was $18.61 billion in 2012-13, is only around 1 per cent of Japan’s total foreign trade, while it is about 2.2 to 2.5 per cent of India’s total foreign trade, despite a comprehensive free trade agreement, implemented in 2011. Tokyo has generously helped fund India’s infrastructure development, including the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, and is also interested in a similar project in the Chennai-Bangalore belt. Discussions on a civilian nuclear deal continue, despite opposition to nuclear energy within Japan, and in particular to a deal with a country that is a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty holdout. An agreement, if and when it comes through, will be the icing on the cake of India-Japan ties.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-strengthening-relationship/article5627516.ece
29,1,2014,No lessons learnt,"Boat tragedies are undoubtedly common in India, given the limited awareness about safety norms among both providers and users of poorly organised ferry services. However, there can be no excuse for the occurrence of boat mishaps even in well-known tourist destinations where norms and regulations ought to be in place and strictly enforced. The latest disaster that has left 21 tourists dead, most of them from Tamil Nadu, has occurred in the sea off Port Blair, and appears to have every ingredient that is typically found in such tragedies: absence of life-jackets or any other life-saving equipment, accommodation of passengers beyond capacity and the lack of enough rescuers on board. It did not help matters that official rescue efforts took well over an hour to reach those holding on to pieces of wood from the boat that sank within 10 minutes after springing a leak. That 29 people could be rescued is indeed a silver lining, but even more could have been saved as the site was not far from the coast, according to the survivors. It is clear that no lessons have been learnt from recent accidents. In September 2009, 45 people drowned in the tourist resort of Thekkady in Kerala after a double-decker boat run by the State Tourism Development Corporation capsized. More than 200 people died in one of the worst-ever boat tragedies that took place in the Brahmaputra in Assam in 2012. The Pulicat lake in Tamil Nadu has seen a couple of tragedies – the drowning of 29 students in May 1994 and of 22 people on Christmas day in 2011.
Official data on deaths in India due to unnatural causes indicate that the number of people drowning in boat capsizes every year is invariably high. From around 550 in 2002, the annual number has crossed the 800 mark five times since then, and 900 three times. The figure for 2012 was 668. While some of these could have occurred due to circumstances beyond the boatmen’s control, such as the sudden onset of foul weather, most of these tragedies could have been avoided had fundamental norms of safety been complied with. Official enquiries have repeatedly pointed to the lapses, but these findings are either ignored or the norms forgotten after a short spell of compliance. There is a case for prosecution too as these deaths are often due to criminal negligence on the part of boat or ferry operators, but what will ultimately make a difference is a sustained awareness drive among operators and users. Passengers and tourists should also verify and demand compliance with safety measures before boarding and not merely leave enforcement to the authorities.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-lessons-learnt/article5627525.ece
30,1,2014,A surprise from the RBI,"In its third quarter review of monetary policy, the Reserve Bank of India sprang a big surprise by hiking the policy repo rate by 0.25 percentage points to 8 per cent. All other rates — the bank rate, the reverse repo and the marginal standing facility rates — stand adjusted upwards. Unprepared as the financial markets might have been to the hike, the central bank’s justification is unassailable. In the mid-quarter review on December 18, 2013, the rates were kept unaltered, anticipating a cool-off in vegetable prices. With the subsequent fall in food prices, especially of vegetables, headline inflation has fallen significantly and might stay subdued well into the next round of data compilation. However, excluding food and fuel prices, CPI inflation has remained stubbornly high while core WPI inflation has risen, although only marginally. As RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said subsequently, behind its logic has been the CPI inflation which remains close to 10 per cent and is the prime cause for the hardening inflation expectations among consumers. Besides, there is evidence to show that notwithstanding the tight monetary policy, aggregate demand pressures are still exerting upward pressure on overall inflation. A rate hike is justified, though the growth momentum is weak and there has been much fiscal tightening in the last quarter of this year.
The other important development has been the release of the Urjit Patel committee’s report which has suggested that price stability should be the primary objective of monetary policy and towards that end CPI inflation should be brought below 8 per cent by January 2015 and below 6 per cent by the following year. Formal inflation targeting has not been adopted yet, but clearly the central bank’s increased reliance on the CPI is evident in its hiking the repo rate to firmly nudge the economy towards the recommended path of price stability. The Governor has emphasised that in the long run there is no conflict between its two traditional objectives of supporting growth and maintaining price stability. Unless inflation is brought down there cannot be a revival in either consumption or investment. Further policy steps will be data dependent but if the disinflationary process evolves as projected, any more tightening in the near term is not anticipated. The economy will grow at slightly below 5 per cent this year, but can firm up to 5.5 per cent in a range of 5 to 6 per cent in 2014-15. A pick-up in investment and stronger export performance might push up growth rates further. The external situation remains uncertain — global economic growth has been uneven and emerging economies have been under pressure in recent months.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-surprise-from-the-rbi/article5631471.ece
30,1,2014,New scourge in Assam,"Northeastern India has seen a pattern for long: when one terror outfit is neutralised, another pops up in hydra-head fashion. The most recent such organisation is the Songbijit faction of the National Democratic Front of Boroland. On the ascendant in terms of strike potential, it has gone on a killing spree in the Bodoland Territorial Area Districts in Lower Assam over the past few weeks. In one recent series of attacks, eight persons were killed, including Muslims and Hindi-speaking Bengalis. While the NDFB (S) has come out with statements accusing the security forces of targeting Bodo civilians, its plan is clearly to drive a wedge between Bodos and non-Bodos. The turmoil that engulfed Lower Assam in July 2012 that claimed 96 lives and left lakhs of Muslims and Bodos traumatised and displaced, is fresh in memory. While the Ranjan Daimary faction of the NDFB signed a ceasefire agreement with the Central and the State governments in November 2013, the faction led by I.K. Songbijit refused to join the process. Songbijit, who was the Daimary’s faction’s ‘commander-in-chief’, broke away in late-2012. Remaining in Myanmar, he is now believed to be in league with Paresh Baruah of the ULFA (I), and S.S. Khaplang, chief of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (K). The prospect of the three teaming up with the Kamatapur Liberation Organisation, poses a new challenge.
As the movement demanding a homeland for the Bodo people runs its course through its second decade, it remains one of the most serious potential sources of violent political confrontation in the region. Even admitting that the Bodo cause stems from the perception of their not being a part of the composite indigenous population of Assam, extortions, kidnapping and other atrocities have over time undermined any legitimacy the movement could claim. The State government has made clear its resolve to clamp down on violence, and the Assam Police have declared 15 leaders of the NDFB (S), including Songbijit himself, as “most wanted”, even putting a price of Rs. 95 lakh on them. Considering that the outfit is estimated to have less than 250 cadres, firm enough action does not appear to be a tall order. Inter-State intelligence cooperation will be key. At a point when sustained and aggressive action by the government, with some help from across the border in Bangladesh, has substantially broken the back of militancy at large in northeastern India, the latest threat should be met with a firm hand. Meanwhile, the process of peace involving the two other dominant Bodo groups, led respectively by Dhiren Boro and Ranjan Daimary, should be handled with fairness and magnanimity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/new-scourge-in-assam/article5631467.ece
31,1,2014,A lost opportunity,"There are occasions when the finality of a judicial verdict is in unfortunate conflict with the interests of justice. The contentious case of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code is one such. By declining to review its retrograde decision to uphold the validity of Section 377, the Supreme Court has lost an opportunity to revisit a verdict that has drawn widespread criticism for failing to extend constitutional protection to sexual minorities. While it is true that the scope for review is limited, there was some hope for the LGBT community when the Union government came forward to seek a review of the December 2013 verdict in Suresh Kumar Koushal. Many jurists, activists and political leaders felt the ruling overturned a well-reasoned judgment of the Delhi High Court, which had read down Section 377 to de-criminalise consensual sex among adults irrespective of gender. It was seen as incongruous with the mores of our times. The verdict required a review on merits because of some intriguing conclusions. The Bench had ruled that “those indulging in carnal intercourse against the order of nature” constituted a different class, and that Parliament could treat the category differently from others. It had failed to see that ‘order of nature’ is itself an artificial construct rooted in the outdated view that alternative sexuality is unnatural. It had dismissed the LGBT community as a minuscule fraction of the population, as though the relative smallness of a group disentitled it to constitutional protection.
While holding that Section 377 suffered from no infirmity, the Bench had said it was open to the legislature to delete or amend it. The verdict had cast a shadow of doubt on the judiciary’s decisiveness in enforcing fundamental rights. In a recent case concerning death row convicts and mercy petitions, it was reaffirmed that the Supreme Court was best equipped to adjudicate the content of fundamental rights. “This Court has always granted relief for violation of fundamental rights and has never remanded the matter,” it said. The Bench that declined to review the verdict could have taken inspiration from these words and examined afresh the section’s chilling effect on fundamental rights, instead of leaving it to the legislature. A curative petition could provide one more avenue of redress, but its scope is limited to judgments passed in violation of principles of natural justice or in circumstances suggesting bias on the part of the court. The situation is ripe for a legislative solution, but the process may not be easy, for not all members and parties will be able to resist the influence of religious conservative groups that are likely to oppose any amendment.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-lost-opportunity/article5635619.ece
31,1,2014,Tensions in Ukraine,"The unrest in Ukraine, which recently flared into violence, is dividing the country and intensifying long-standing tensions between Russia and the West. Public protests started in December 2013 over President Viktor Yanukovych’s decision to abandon a deal with the European Union in favour of aid and natural gas agreements with Russia. The protesters, who for weeks were peaceful and even returned equipment to the police after water cannon was used to disperse crowds in the capital, Kiev, have seized government offices across the country, including the Justice Ministry. Their demands include an end to corruption and self-enrichment by the ruling political elite, and at least four people have died as security forces opened fire. Mr. Yanukovych has softened his position by putting an amnesty for protesters through Parliament and by offering the prime ministership and deputy prime ministership to the respective opposition leaders, Arseny Yatsenyuk and Vitali Klitschko. But the opposition parties are furious that the amnesty requires the protesters to vacate the occupied buildings, and the offer of political posts has been rejected.
Mr. Yanukovych has now taken a time-out by going on “sick leave,” but his cosmetic measures are bound to fail because Ukraine is a prize in a geostrategic tussle between Russia and the West. To start with, the President’s policies since his election in 2010 have troubled a substantial section of Ukraine’s 46 million people, especially those in the western regions, who support accession to the EU. Eastern Ukrainians, however, prefer closer links with Russia. Secondly, the EU deal was tied to an IMF bailout that would require public-spending cuts and higher gas prices. Thirdly, NATO and Ukraine have held joint exercises, which they have progressively enlarged, though Parliament cancelled the 2009 manoeuvres. The EU association agreement proposes deeper Ukraine-NATO links, though only 30 per cent of Ukrainians favour NATO membership; such proposals fuel support for aggressively ethno-nationalist far-right coalitions such as Prawy Sektor (Right Sector). Russian President Vladimir Putin, for his part, has blocked the Kiev-EU agreement with €15 billion in aid, cheaper gas supplies, and trade deals. While Moscow sees NATO as trying to encircle Russia, the Atlantic alliance has repeatedly tried to invent new roles for itself since the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Treaty Organisation collapsed in 1991, and both NATO and the IMF have in effect tried to hijack the EU’s relations with Ukraine; neither Ukrainians nor the EU must allow themselves to be traduced thus, and Ukraine’s future direction must be decided solely by Ukrainians.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tensions-in-ukraine/article5635946.ece
1,2,2014,Telangana birth-pangs,"By getting a resolution rejecting the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Bill for creating Telangana passed by the State Assembly just before the deadline set by President Pranab Mukherjee to consider the Bill ended on Thursday, Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy did what little he could to protect what he saw as his political constituency: those standing for a united Andhra Pradesh in the Rayalaseema and Coastal Andhra regions. Neither the delay nor the ultimate rejection of the Telangana Bill by the Assembly will have any bearing on the creation of the new State if the Centre stands firm on its decision on Telangana. The Chief Minister, in raising legal and technical objections to the Bill, might have managed to convey the opposition of large sections of the people in Seemandhra to the division of Andhra Pradesh, but the manner in which the proceedings of the House were conducted from the day the Bill was introduced till the day it was rejected reflects badly on his government and the democratic traditions of the legislature. Speaker Nadendla Manohar, who too is politically opposed to Telangana, put the Chief Minister’s contentious resolution to a voice vote amid noisy scenes, and declared the motion carried in a matter of two minutes. It was obvious from the regional representation in the House that those opposed to the Bill constituted a majority. The Bill presented a chance to address the concerns raised by the proposal to bifurcate Andhra Pradesh. Instead, the time was used for political posturing and the reiteration of known positions by both sides. Pro-Telangana members, on their part, did not press for a division amid the din, perhaps because they did not want to expose their lack of numbers. The voice vote was, in effect, the only mode of expression of the views of the legislature.
Now that the onus is on the Centre to shepherd the Bill through Parliament, the Congress must eschew any temptation to use this issue as part of any electoral strategy before the Lok Sabha polls. With the national leadership of the party backing the creation of Telangana, and the State unit divided on geographical lines, making this a campaign issue is anyway fraught with risks. No political consensus on the Bill is possible at this late stage, but the Centre can bring in amendments to the Bill to incorporate the concerns of other parties and representatives of Rayalaseema and Coastal Andhra. As the support of the Bharatiya Janata Party is necessary in the Rajya Sabha, the Congress will have to keep the Bill open for amendments. The State legislature was robbed of a free, reasoned debate on the issue, but hopefully Parliament will consider all aspects of the Bill before bringing Telangana into being.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/telangana-birthpangs/article5639804.ece
1,2,2014,Keeping people and tigers safe,"As conservation of wild species becomes more successful, higher levels of human-wildlife conflict are being reported in many parts of the country. The outcome of such encounters is a distressing number of human lives lost, and the tragic elimination of the wild creatures involved in the attacks. The ‘man-eating tiger’ incident in Dodabetta in the Nilgiris, which ended in the gunning down of the cat, brings to the fore the dilemma of ensuring a safe distance between wild animals and people. Evidently, there are no easy answers to this question, not just in India but in several other countries that have well-protected wildlife. Two strategies often adopted to prevent conflict rely on modification of human and animal behaviour. Farmers are encouraged to switch to cash crops to avoid attracting elephants, while forest departments provide access to water within protected areas to stop animals from moving out. Wild creatures in turn learn to avoid places rendered inaccessible through trench-digging and building of fences. Yet, these are by no means fail-safe interventions. It is necessary to identify areas for intensive protection, and encourage forest-dwelling communities to move out — of course, with sufficient attention devoted to their rehabilitation at a new location.
Removal of problem animals often becomes unavoidable if there are human casualties and there is a prospect of more people being killed. It would appear ironic, but conservation advice in such circumstances is usually to swiftly eliminate the lone animal, such as the Dodabetta tiger, rather than attempt slow capture and risk negative public attitudes to tigers as a whole. Unfortunately, it is not easy to identify the individual tiger or leopard, and the conflict may continue even after one animal is shot dead. In Chikmagalur district, for instance, 17 leopards had to be shot in 1995 before the problem of attacks on people stopped. Research evidence supports a strategy that relies on ‘spatial separation’ of people and animals as a more rewarding means of conflict reduction. If isolated villages and free ranging cattle are moved out of the small land area that makes up India’s protected forests, the risk of an encounter with fierce creatures can be brought down. The problem today is that successfully managed national parks and sanctuaries are witnessing a rise in tiger and leopard numbers, leading to the dispersal of old and injured animals towards habitations on the periphery and even beyond. Future conservation strategies would have to rely on well-administered wildlife sanctuaries, and equally on a voluntary resettlement programme for forest communities.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/keeping-people-and-tigers-safe/article5640136.ece
8,2,2014,Moment of truth for India,"For the first time in the history of independent India, a high official of its intelligence services stands indicted for cold-blooded killing in the service of the Republic. Thursday’s Central Bureau of Investigation charge sheet against former Intelligence Bureau Special Director Rajinder Kumar and his subordinates for the alleged extra-judicial execution of Maharashtra residents Ishrat Jahan Raza and Javed Sheikh, as well as two alleged Pakistani Lashkar-e-Toiba operatives, marks an unprecedented challenge for India’s national security system. The CBI’s charge sheet has blown the lid off the comforting fiction that extra-judicial killings are aberrations, crimes carried out by brutish policemen and villainous provincial politicians. In this case, the Gujarat Police might have played executioner, but the charges against Mr. Kumar give reason to believe that the death warrants were signed, so to speak, in North Block. Loud and acrimonious political debate has broken out on whether the four victims were linked to terrorism or not, which really is an irrelevant issue. Instead, political leaders must introspect on the role of governments in encouraging murder as a tool of national security, and demonstrate the legislative will needed to set wrongs right.
India is exceptional among democracies in having no legal framework for its intelligence services, nor a system of oversight and accountability for covert operations. For individual officers, the absence of a regulatory law for covert operations creates perverse incentives for wrongdoing: who, after all, would want victims of their criminal acts to tell the story in court? In its absence, kidnapping has been substituted for legal detention, torture for criminal investigation, and the bullet delivered to the back of the skull, for trial. Leaders of all parties, though, have been loath to change the system. For years now, figures like Union Minister Manish Tewari, and former intelligence chiefs, have campaigned for the legal regulation of the intelligence services, arguing that the status quo will end up undermining national security. To continue to ignore these voices will ensure the destruction of the intelligence services, and threaten the security of the republic they are charged with defending.

8,2,2014,Divesting to bridge the deficit,"The Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India (SUUTI, for short), formed specifically to take over the regular income schemes of the Unit Trust of India, has been in the news recently. Reversing an earlier decision to form an asset management company to take it over, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs recently decided to encash some blue chip shares held by it. The earlier proposal, while being technically and theoretically sound, would be time-consuming and will not suit a government in a great hurry to raise money to bridge its deficit by March, A divestment of some of SUUTI’s prized shareholdings, on the other hand, will be a quicker way to meet fiscal targets. The government holds through SUUTI 20.72 per cent of Axis Bank with a market value of over Rs.8,060 crore. It also owns 11.3 per cent of ITC (Rs.19,800 crore) and 8.2 percent of L&T (Rs.6,640 crore). A sale of these would fetch the government over Rs.34,500 crore at current prices. Assuming that the modalities of the sale could be gone through in the remaining less-than two months of the current fiscal year, the disinvestment target of Rs.40,000 crore will be very nearly met. Though the 2G spectrum auctions are on course to exceed initial expectations, the boost in disinvestment proceeds will strengthen government finances and make the target of reining in fiscal deficit at less than 4.8 per cent of GDP that much easier.
That said, it is important to choose the correct method of selling these shares. The objective is not only to meet financial targets but also fulfil some of the broad objectives of the disinvestment programme. Over the years, the government had adopted ingenious methods to meet its disinvestment targets, including sale to state undertakings, buybacks, cross-holdings, special dividends and setting up of exchange-traded funds. None of these benefit the common man. The disinvestment programme has theoretically espoused retail investors’ interests. The vision statement of the Department of Disinvestment seeks to “promote people’s ownership of shares through disinvestment” and spread the equity culture. Over the years, however, the government has ignored retail investors, offering them mere token incentives such as a small discount in the few share offerings of public sector companies. In contrast, large investors have benefited substantially. In fact, the capital market regulator SEBI introduced new schemes that completely bypassed small shareholders. The government could recompense retail investors by selling its shares in SUUTI exclusively to them. That way, retail investors will get to own some blue chips, and the capital market will get some depth.

10,2,2014,All guns blazing,"Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal seems intent on proving that he is in no way politically or morally obliged to the Congress, which is supporting his government from the outside. By lodging an FIR against former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit in connection with a street light project that was implemented ahead of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, the Delhi Anti-Corruption Branch furthered the political agenda of the Aam Aadmi Party government. It reinforced one of the core points of the AAP campaign, fighting corruption in high places. It also demonstrated the AAP’s resolve not to engage in any political compromises in return for an extended lease in power. The Delhi Police are not under the control of the AAP government, and Mr. Kejriwal therefore used his government’s own arm, the Delhi Anti-Corruption Branch, which is staffed by personnel on deputation from the Delhi Police, to register the case under the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Indian Penal Code. Of course, it is not as if the AAP government brought up the case out of thin air to prove a few political points. The findings of the Shunglu Committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General had pointed to irregularities in the tendering and allocation of work for street lights. Although the CBI registered a Preliminary Enquiry in this case, it could not find anything irregular against Ms. Dikshit. Mr. Kejriwal must be hoping that the ACB will come up with something substantial against his political rival.
The AAP recently targeted top politicians, including Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi, P. Chidambaram, and Kapil Sibal, branding them all as corrupt. While the minority AAP government being supported by the Congress is unlikely to last very long, the Congress cannot obviously bring down Mr. Kejriwal on the ground that he is attacking its leaders as corrupt. The Congress strategy would be guided by political calculations, and party leaders might want to allow Mr. Kejriwal to continue for a little beyond the Lok Sabha election. So far, the Kejriwal government has shown that it wants to use power in Delhi to enhance its national image as an anti-corruption crusader. Governance benefits for the people of Delhi are only incidental to this larger agenda. How far the corruption case against Ms. Dikshit would go is not very clear, but the AAP government might already have achieved what it set out to do: present itself as a relentless crusader against corruption. Born as it was of a social movement, the AAP sees power as being only incidental to the larger purpose of eradicating big ticket corruption, and is ready to go down with all guns blazing.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/all-guns-blazing/article5670800.ece
10,2,2014,Road tolls and resentments,"The recent attacks by Maharashtra Navnirman Sena activists on toll booths in Maharashtra are to be condemned. However valid their protest against paying road toll may appear, it does not legitimise violence. Such acts at one level exposes the uncertainties involved in collecting toll, which could potentially harm plans to build an extensive road network. At another level, they highlight public concern over opaque ways of determining road-user charges. The government, which is trying to find ways to ensure safe ways of toll collection, must bear in mind that both issues are inextricably linked. Since 2000, the Central government has been promoting the levy of toll as an important tool to finance road construction. It now considers toll as being indispensable to attract private investment. The existing rules permit investors on road projects to charge users for an agreed period and retain the amount collected. To the investor, the projected rate of return of 14 to 16 per cent looks attractive. The Central government plans to build the bulk of the 10,000 km of national highways and 1,000 km of expressways in the next four years as toll roads, with private investment. State governments are taking a similar route to upgrade road networks.
However, in recent times investors have started to complain that their revenues are less than projected because of imprecise traffic estimates. As a 2012 study on Indian toll roads done by Fitch Rating, an international company that evaluates project finance, shows, the figures of actual usage of many roads are less than the projected figures. Protests against tolls only add to their woes and increase risks, developers lament. These issues need quick remedies, and so does the plight of users. Unlike other parts of the world where alternative toll-free roads are available in a given route, in India there are hardly any. Those who find the user charges steep and want to take an alternative route, even if it is longer and winding, have no option. Governments too overlook the improvement of alternative routes, to reduce leakage of toll revenue. Second, as cities expand rapidly, toll roads on the periphery, originally conceived as inter-city roads, become part of the city. The toll plan does not accommodate such changes in travel patterns. This causes hardships to users and increases resentment. Another contention is that even before roads are completed, toll charges commence. It is possible to remove distrust about tolls by bringing in transparency in the contracting process. The projected traffic volumes, estimated revenue collection and details of actual amounts collected should be available in the public domain. The long-term solution, however, lies in treating roads as a public good and spending more government funds on developing them.

11,2,2014,Disquieting process,"In a country and in a region that has witnessed prolonged conflict, there can be no quarrel with the proposition that the smallest chance for peace has to be grasped. But the recently launched talks between the Pakistan government and the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan give rise to too many disquieting questions, including about the kind of peace Pakistan wants, and the Pakistani state’s vision of itself. After months of contradictory statements, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s acceptance of the TTP’s long-standing offer of talks came in the midst of a ruthless bombing campaign by the militants from Karachi to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and right after 20 soldiers were killed near the North Waziristan tribal area. Representatives of the two sides have already met once to plan a “roadmap” for the negotiations. The TTP is not participating directly, but through interlocutors in two of Pakistan’s Islamic parties, the Jamat-i-Islami and one faction of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, almost as if these were its political wing. One of the TTP’s negotiators is the former head of the Lal Masjid, the Islamabad mosque that under him became a terrorist stronghold. These representatives will be accountable to a 10-member Taliban committee. Through its own interlocutors, the government has said that talks must be held within the framework of the country’s Constitution and that their scope be limited to “insurgency-affected” areas. It wants the TTP to stop its terrorist attacks, and a time frame fixed for talks. It is yet not known if the Taliban and the government are on the same page on these points.
This is not the first time that Islamabad has tried to make peace with the militants. Every previous effort failed because the Taliban refused to submit to the state’s writ. Each time they came back stronger, their network of militancy in Pakistan expanding constantly, while the state’s own confusion on militancy and jihad helped Islamists occupy a large share of the national mindspace. It has come to a point where the Taliban now dictate terms, confident too with their brethren Taliban in Afghanistan on the ascendant. If Pakistan’s political leadership and its security establishment had at all absorbed the lessons of 2001, they would have been doing everything to prevent a repeat of history after the drawdown of foreign troops from Afghanistan. Instead, what appears to have trumped again is Pakistan’s desire for influence in Afghanistan, plus the delusion that it can somehow control the Taliban and other militants on both sides of the Durand Line. It is hard to escape the feeling that the region’s instability is going to get worse. India has to be on guard.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/disquieting-process/article5674419.ece
11,2,2014,A chance not to be squandered,"The Bill now placed before Parliament is the best chance yet to enact a ground-breaking law for an estimated 70 million people with impairments — an overwhelming majority of whom, and their care-givers, live in conditions of abject poverty and deprivation. The definition of disability in the Bill is a big departure: it means all long-term physical, mental, intellectual and sensory impairments which, in interaction with barriers in the environment, hinder persons’ effective participation in society on an equal basis. As many as 19 impairments are sought to be accorded legal protection, as opposed to seven under the 1995 Persons with Disabilities Act. Correspondingly, the proportion of reservations is proposed to be increased to 5 per cent from the existing 3 per cent. The provision to ensure that the disabled enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with every other person is a strong protection, especially for people with mental retardation. And finally, the incorporation of penal provisions to ensure accountability for law enforcement — a lacuna in the current law — could potentially bridge the gap between professed intentions and practice.
The issue of disabilities has seldom in the past been regarded as politically divisive and the Bill stands a fair chance of mustering the support of parties across the political spectrum. Moreover, the constituents in the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government were instrumental in the incorporation of the question on disability in the 2001 decennial population census. This was a step that perhaps has permanently reversed the earlier exclusion of this segment from a crucial national exercise in post-Independence India. Similarly, the political parties of the Left had always supported the passage of important social legislation. Members of both Houses should demonstrate a strong sense of purpose, urgency and sensitivity to make a new law a reality during the current term of Parliament, overcoming the continuing impasse on various other counts. While the concerns expressed by well-meaning non-governmental organisations may be valid in principle, they should weigh the huge practical gains to be made from seeing through this Bill, rather than wait for eternity for the perfect piece of legislation. Parliament could consider incorporating a provision in the new law, mandating that revenues from the levy on corporate social responsibility be channelled to promote employment for the disabled. The disabled are said to constitute the single largest minority in society, as per the World Health Organization and the World Bank report of 2011. Legal protections would go a long way to promote their full participation in society as equal members.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-chance-not-to-be-squandered/article5674416.ece
12,2,2014,Cricket’s moment of truth,"The true merit of the insightful report of the Justice Mudgal committee appointed by the Supreme Court lies not only in its factual findings, but in the compelling case it presents for a thorough clean-up of cricket in the country. The main report’s authors, Justice Mukul Mudgal and L. Nageswara Rao, have avoided the beaten path of giving ‘clean chits’ to top administrators or finding scapegoats, and laid bare the facts in an orderly way. The report provides a sound basis as well as an opportunity to address the malaise the game suffers from in terms of business practices that lack transparency, unbridled commercialism that ignores obvious conflicts of interest, and an overall atmosphere conducive to venality. It rejects the stand of Board of Control for Cricket in India president N. Srinivasan and India Cements, which owns Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League, that Gurunath Meiyappan was not its owner or principal, and the astounding claim that he was no more than an enthusiastic follower of the team. By describing him as the face of the franchise and undoubtedly a team official, and concluding that he had indulged in betting and passing on information, the report has rendered the CSK franchise liable to termination under certain clauses in the Franchise Agreement and the IPL Operational Rules. These clauses cast a responsibility on the franchise to ensure that each of its officials complied with all rules, including the anti-corruption code. The report recommends further investigation into allegations of betting and spot fixing against Raj Kundra of Rajasthan Royals.
Of course, it has to be borne in mind that the main report bases its conclusions on police records, and that these are not meant to be treated as findings of guilt in respect of criminal offences. The separate report by the committee’s third member, Nilay Dutta, does not agree that Mr. Meiyappan could be considered the team’s owner, although he was an official under the Operational Rules. Also, he does not want to accept the allegation of betting against Mr. Meiyappan, unless taped conversations relating to this were proved authentic. He favours a comprehensive investigation into the entire issue of betting and fixing in cricket. It is clear that the present measures undertaken by the BCCI in combating sporting fraud are insufficient. Going beyond its terms of reference, the main report has flagged the conflict of interest involved in Mr. Srinivasan being head of the cricket board as well as being associated with a franchise owner. It is a moment of truth for Indian cricket, and the Mudgal committee has presented to the Supreme Court weighty reasons to undertake a thorough cleansing of the sport.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/crickets-moment-of-truth/article5677710.ece
12,2,2014,Memorial excesses,"The Congress government in Maharashtra is gripped by memorial mania. It has sanctioned Rs.100 crore to build a grand memorial for Chhatrapati Shivaji, the Maratha ruler, on an islet in the Arabian Sea, about 2.5 km off Nariman Point in Mumbai. The State government approved this project in 2009, called for designs and even planned to spend Rs.350 crore on it. However, the project did not move forward. If the approaching election is one reason behind the revival of the project, the commencement of work on a 182-metre-tall statue of Sardar Patel, in the adjoining State of Gujarat, is another. The Patel statue, which it is claimed would be the tallest in the world when completed, has provided the Narendra Modi government and the Bharatiya Janata Party high political visibility. The Gujarat government is aggressively pursuing the project. This in turn seems to have created a sense of urgency in the Congress. It appears that the Maharashtra government, which originally planned a 94-m-tall Shivaji statue, is planning to increase the height significantly. Though the government has not yet announced the revised financial estimate for the Shivaji memorial, the final figures are bound to match the grandeur of the Rs.2,063-crore Gujarat project. Political one-upmanship between the two parties is on, and the casualty is public money and space.
For many years, political parties have indiscriminately imposed statues of leaders on Indian cities. They have not spared road junctions, traffic islands and even footpaths, leading to hardships and safety issues. It was only in January 2013 that the Supreme Court ordered the State governments not to permit any more statues that would affect traffic in public spaces. In a similar way, the construction of large memorials too requires regulation. Their claim to serve a public purpose must be tested. Governments often try to legitimise memorial projects as efforts to create public spaces. They point to amenities such as exhibitions, museums, auditoriums and parks built along with them. Any attempt to improve and expand public spaces is to be welcomed, but parties in power cannot use it as an excuse to install statues and symbols, which would only serve their agenda. Installing memorials in urban spaces is a colonial legacy, and this practice has to be discontinued. Only genuine collective remembrance of people and events, such as the Bhopal gas tragedy, can be encouraged. The government too has to get its priorities right. For instance, in Maharashtra, many heritage structures are in need of protection and assistance. Instead of mindlessly spending money on gigantic memorials, it would serve the public good if it is spent on conserving neglected heritage structures.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/memorial-excesses/article5677711.ece
13,2,2014,Publish and perish,"In a distressing pattern that has come to define the fate of publishing in India, another book whimsically determined to have transgressed cultural sensitivities, has been withdrawn from circulation. Bowing to the diktats of a Delhi-based Hindutva group, Penguin Books India has agreed, in an out-of court- settlement, to recall, pulp and destroy all copies of Indologist Wendy Doniger’s 2009 bestseller, The Hindus: An Alternative History. The trouble for Penguin Books started with a 2010 legal notice by a Hindu fundamentalist group, Shiksha Bachao Andolan, asking that the publisher and the author unconditionally apologise for the book and withdraw it. By 2013 Penguin Books was enmeshed in a legal maze, fighting a civil suit as well as two criminal complaints. Penguin Books is an international publishing giant with a record of standing its ground in the face of the worst intimidation. As >Kenan Malik pointed out in an article in The Hindu, the same publisher had shown exemplary courage in the defence of The Satantic Verses, arguing that what was at stake was the future of free speech itself.
Against this sterling backdrop, and given its not inconsiderable resources, Penguin was unarguably in a position to fight a longer legal battle in defence of Wendy Doniger’s right to be read, and by implication the right of every Indian to choose what she wants to read. That the publisher allowed itself to be browbeaten into submission by a little-known outfit that saw no contradiction in its own sweeping slander of the author — among other things, the petitioner called her “sex hungry” — is a comment on the illiberalism incrementally taking India in its sweep. To an extent this was unavoidable because the churn in Indian politics was inevitably leading to a heightened awareness about community identities and group rights. However, sensibilities have become so susceptible to hurt that virtually anything written can be contested and asked to be withdrawn. The intolerance, visible especially on the social media, is towards anything seen as modern and forward-looking, with the unofficial censors assuming the right to attack and abuse at will. This twin intimidation — of censorship combined with licence — has flourished all the more in a political environment increasingly supportive of moral policing and guilty of an almost kneejerk willingness to ban books. The Maharashtra government banned Shivaji: Hindu King in Islamic India, under pressure from vandals who attacked the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in protest. More recently, cartoon depictions of B.R. Ambedkar had to be withdrawn from NCERT text-books. A quarter century after The Satanic Verses, the written word seems to be more and more under threat.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/publish-and-perish/article5681639.ece
13,2,2014,Challenges for a new IOA,"For more than 14 months, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) stubbornly refused to listen to reason. It engaged in a ‘no-win’ stand-off with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), staking the country’s Olympic future. It drew contempt for its officials amidst a power struggle, before accepting the inevitable. Suspended by the IOC in December 2012 for violation of the Olympic Charter, the IOA eventually bowed to every diktat of the former in holding fresh elections on February 9 under IOC-dictated rules. This has paved the way for India’s return to the Olympic fold. What started off as a tussle between the Union government and the IOA regarding the implementation of the National Sports Code, ended up in a ‘cleansing’ operation that kept out officials “charge-framed” by courts from the elections ordered by the IOC. The IOC advocates ‘principles of good governance’ while the IOA has through the years tried to hide behind the cloak of ‘autonomy’ ordained in the Charter. The government, faced with criticism both within and outside Parliament about poor administration of sports in the country, had started tightening the rules governing the IOA and the national federations, when the IOC slapped the suspension on India.
The quick response of the IOC in lifting the suspension to enable the Indian tricolour to be flown at the ongoing Winter Olympics at Sochi, Russia, showed that it was completely satisfied with a repentant IOA. The IOC might have managed to push through more stringent clauses than that could have been possible in other times while demanding clarity to the IOA constitution. But problem areas still remain. The IOA could be expected to bargain hard with the government in order to retain what is left of its autonomy and that of the national federations when the draft National Sports Development Bill is amended. The 25 per cent representation in the Executive to Athletes’ Commission members, as incorporated in the draft, is far from reality. The continuation of State Olympic associations as voting-members in the IOA, in a clear attempt to manipulate vote banks, is much against the provisions in the Olympic Charter, and the wishes of the IOC and the government. National federations in boxing, fencing and taekwondo remain suspended by the respective international federations and were barred from voting in the recent IOA elections. The IOA needs to facilitate their quick return to international sports. Faction feuds within federations should be tackled urgently, and so too questions related to the democratic functioning of the sports bodies that have come up in court cases. The IOA chief, N.

14,2,2014,Dealing with new lows,"Even for a country with a long and unedifying history of parliamentary pandemonium, nothing can be as shameful and disgraceful as the use of pepper spray by a member on his peers to disrupt proceedings. Vijayawada MP Lagadapati Rajagopal, one of six Congress lawmakers expelled for disorderly behaviour earlier, wielded this weapon in the Lok Sabha in a desperate bid to stall the introduction of the Telangana Bill. The Speaker herself was affected by the lachrymatory substance, and quite a few members required medical attention. Mr. Rajagopal’s claim that he used pepper spray in self-defence is absurd. Another member has been accused of brandishing a knife, but he has denied it, claiming what he was holding was a microphone, probably one wrenched from its fixture. Parliamentary security was perhaps prepared for what many saw as the final battle for Telangana as the time came to introduce the contentious Bill that will pave the way for the reorganisation of Andhra Pradesh. One MP had threatened to set himself on fire if the Bill was introduced, but no one could have expected that assorted weaponry would find its way inside for actual use. Many a distressed observer of bedlam in the House had been dreading such an incident, and it was only a matter of time before a desperate member went beyond routine ruckus. Speaker Meira Kumar should no more restrict herself to feeble entreaties to maintain decorum but adopt sterner measures, ranging from ordering eviction to allowing criminal prosecution in select instances.
Legislative business is often the casualty of unseemly behaviour and even though Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde managed to introduce the Telangana Bill, the principal opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party, doubts whether it had been introduced at all. The incident raises the question whether Parliament should go the way of State legislatures and resort to eviction of unruly members to ensure the smooth functioning of the House. En masse eviction of whole groups of legislators is quite common in State Assemblies. Parliament has been more democratic and tolerant but this restraint has often led to a small group of obstreperous members blocking key legislation, such as the women’s reservation bill. The Congress must bear responsibility for the present logjam, as it has been unable to build enough support through discussions. The BJP’s stand has been ambiguous: it supports the formation of Telangana in principle, wants the concerns of Seemandhra to be addressed, blames the UPA for the mess in Parliament and has demanded that there should first be order in the House. Political consensus may be the ideal way, but legislative activity cannot forever be hostage to deliberate disorder.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dealing-with-new-lows/article5685752.ece
14,2,2014,A formal exercise,"Being an interim budget and a vote on account for four months, Railway Minister Mallikarjun Kharge’s maiden budget could not have gone farther than it has. It was only a holding operation to enable the Indian Railways to spend for the first four months of the next financial year, till a new Railway Minister presents a full-fledged budget for 2014-15. Like the Union government, the Indian Railways has been on autopilot for some time, given the scandals and crises that have confronted UPA-II. Despite these limitations, the Railways have done reasonably well, considering the slowdown in the economy. Freight loading and operations have done well, but there has been a dent in passenger traffic, more so in terms of earnings. Mr. Kharge appears confident of finishing the current fiscal year with a surplus of about Rs.8,000-plus crore. One has to wait and see if the current trend is sustained and if that becomes possible. All that the Minister could announce were 73 new trains, extension of rail linkages to the Northeast, 24 surveys for new lines or doubling projects, and a new generation of superfast trains with ‘dynamic fares.’ He has taken a leaf out of the airlines to introduce this concept of dynamic pricing, where passengers could get tickets at a premium price, depending on demand.
The Railway Minister has projected an annual plan of Rs.64,305 crore, of which Rs.30,223 crore will come from Central budgetary support. There will be no increase in freight or passenger fares. Now that a Railway Tariff Authority will become functional in the coming year, any change in the fare structure will be handled by it, taking the difficult political decisions out of the hands of the Minister or the government. Unfortunately, the operating ratio is still hovering around 90 per cent, creating serious concerns about efficiency. As for the political leadership, unlike UPA-I, where one Railway Minister — Lalu Prasad — continued through the innings, UPA-II has seen a huge turnround of Railway Ministers on account of coalition politics. After 18 years, a Congress Minister has presented the budget, even though it is an interim budget. Given the importance of the Indian Railways, it is to be hoped that the next government would ensure continuity in terms of policy and administration. Mr. Kharge has announced a few ‘green initiatives,’ but expects the private sector to chip in by means of corporate social responsibility programmes. But there have to be innovative plans for the private sector to invest in the railway system. Any future public-private partnership in the Railways will depend on what is on offer, and a careful strategy to attract investments needs to be worked out.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-formal-exercise/article5685758.ece
15,2,2014,A pragmatic engagement,"The U.S. decision to end the boycott of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi is part of a recognisable pattern of pragmatic State Department engagement with politicians or political groups it perceives as carrying heft on the national scene. Consider for instance how it swallowed its anathema toward the Muslim Brotherhood to engage with the group when it took power in Egypt; or its “outreach” to the Taliban in Afghanistan. There are many other examples from across the world. With India’s political churning ahead of the elections, it was only a matter of time before the U.S. decided to buy itself some insurance for any post-election possibilities. This is the context to Thursday’s meeting between U.S. Ambassador Nancy Powell and Mr. Modi, the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate. The State Department holds that its 2005 decision to refuse him a visa remains unchanged. Mr. Modi’s then existing tourist/business visa was revoked under sections of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act that make any foreign government official who was “responsible for or directly carried out, at any time, particularly severe violations of religious freedom” ineligible for a visa; his then proposed travel plan to the U.S. was declared “not for a purpose that qualified for a diplomatic visa”. The decision, three years after the riots, came when the Vajpayee-led National Democratic Alliance was no longer in power at the Centre. It is clear that if Washington needs to reverse its stand on the visa question, it will do that too.
What this means is that Washington’s self-interest cannot be the yardstick with which to address an issue that goes to the heart of India’s nationhood. Mr. Modi has been absolved by an investigation team of any direct role in the Gujarat riots in which more than 1,000 people, mainly Muslims, were killed; the clean chit has been accepted by a trial court. But questions remain about his moral and political accountability for a pogrom that took place under his watch. These questions will not go away whatever the change in the U.S. position. Also, electoral victories clearly do not constitute a clean chit. The Congress has been re-elected many times since the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in which several of its leaders were alleged to be involved; it continues to be haunted by that dark episode. Citing Mr. Modi’s re-election three times since 2002 as the measure of people’s trust is much like Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s defence that all the corruption charges against his government related to UPA-I and do not matter as the people entrusted the coalition with governance for another five years after that.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-pragmatic-engagement/article5690039.ece
15,2,2014,Spectrum of success,"After the two relatively unsuccessful attempts to sell 2G spectrum in November 2012 and March 2013, it was a case of third time lucky for the government as it hit pay dirt with the latest round of auctioning that ended on Thursday. With all the spectrum on offer in the 900 MHz band sold out and 80 per cent of that offered in the 1800 MHz band sold for a total of Rs.61,162 crore — which is substantially higher than the reserve price — the government is patting itself on the back for what it calls a big success. Yet, this has to be viewed in the backdrop of a couple of issues. First, this auction was critical for two of the biggest telecom operators in the country, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone, because their licences are set to expire later this year, and to continue in business they had to pick up spectrum irrespective of the price. So, an element of desperation was built into the bidding from the moment it began, pushing up valuations. With a new entrant in the form of Reliance Jio Infocomm queering the pitch by adding to the competitive element, it is not surprising that the final values of the 900 MHz spectrum for Delhi and Mumbai were 105 per cent and 72 per cent more than the reserve price. Of course, it could be argued that this is exactly how markets work and as the owner of the spectrum the government is entitled to get the best price.
That brings us to the second point. The auction can be truly termed as successful only when telecom services develop at affordable prices for the consumer. If the high spending by operators in the auction forces them to raise tariffs, the objective will be lost. This is exactly what happened in the 3G arena where companies outbid each other paying big bucks for spectrum, only to discover that the market was not willing to absorb the high tariffs. The net result is that 3G services have not taken off in a big way. The signals on tariff now are mixed, with the operators complaining about the money they had to cough up for the spectrum — which they are bound to anyway — but they have stopped short of saying that tariffs will rise. The competition in the market will probably ensure that tariffs do not shoot up immediately, at least for voice telephony. Groaning as they are under high debt levels, it is unlikely that telecom companies will be able to convince banks to lend more to them now; banks are under pressure from the RBI anyway as they are over-exposed to the sector. It remains to be seen how these companies manage their funds. Yet, all things considered, the bottomline is this: the auction and the money put on the table by the operators prove, yet again, the attractiveness of the telecom market in the country, notwithstanding the fact that it is already 900 million connections strong.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/spectrum-of-success/article5690040.ece
17,2,2014,Story of an end foretold,"Sometimes, the end is foretold at the beginning. Arvind Kejriwal was quite reluctant to assume office as Chief Minister of Delhi, and the lack of a majority of its own for his Aam Aadmi Party seemed only part of the reason. The crusader against corruption did not want anything to do with the Congress or the Bharatiya Janata Party; it was almost as if he were afraid of being tainted by mere association with them. From the time he was sworn in, he was keener on projecting his party as a serious national-level alternative to the two principal national parties than on governing Delhi. Delhi was a stage for his theatrics, a campaign platform before the Lok Sabha election. The thrust was on politically exposing the Congress and the BJP, and not on solving the small, everyday problems of Delhi. Mr. Kejriwal obviously wanted to demonstrate what he would not be allowed to do as Chief Minister, and not what he could do as head of the government. Given the paucity of time before the parliamentary election, he must have thought it safer to approach the people as the leader of a party whose government was thwarted by political rivals than as a Chief Minister who was unable to deliver on his promises. Thus, the Jan Lokpal Bill was seen as the ideal issue over which to create circumstances for his own exit. Having built a political party of a movement that had the Jan Lokpal Bill as its rallying point, the AAP convener believed he would find popular support for staking all on the Bill. But the manner in which his government manoeuvred the Bill appeared to be aimed at inviting opposition rather than at seeing it passed in the Assembly. An honest attempt could have been made to follow constitutional procedures in pushing through the Bill, making it politically difficult for the AAP’s rivals to oppose it. The all-or-nothing attitude Mr. Kejriwal adopts on every issue can do little to further his party’s agenda of change.
If Mr. Kejriwal achieved anything at all in the Jan Lokpal fiasco, it was in tarring the Congress and the BJP with the same broad brush. For good measure, he brought in a new factor: their supposed support for the Reliance Industries head, Mukesh Ambani. The linking of the opposition to the Bill to the First Information Report lodged against Mr. Ambani on the gas pricing controversy seems a stretch, but Mr. Kejriwal was looking for a conspiracy that could tie the Congress and the BJP together. By turning the movement against corruption into a political party, Mr. Kejriwal took the first step in trying to change the system from the inside. But when he was expected to take the next step as the head of a government — even if it be of a minority government with uncertain support — he fell short.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/story-of-an-end-foretold/article5696389.ece
17,2,2014,Excitement and concerns,"For a sector that is deep in trouble, the show that the automobile industry put up at the 12th Auto Expo that ended in Delhi last week was a grand one indeed. With 70 new vehicles being unveiled or launched across the spectrum from two-wheelers to cars and heavy vehicles, presence of all the big players in the global auto industry and milling crowds — the final weekend alone attracted more than 2,00,000 visitors according to industry body SIAM — it may be difficult to believe that this is an industry in recession. Yet the truth is that sales of commercial vehicles have been falling for the last two years and were down 20.93 per cent in the first ten months of this fiscal year. Passenger car sales are at their worst in a decade, having fallen 9.34 per cent in the April-January period. And with high costs of financing, falling freight volumes and adverse sentiment, only the brave can predict a quick turnaround for the industry. What the celebration at the biennial industry jamboree underlines though is the potential that auto companies, especially those producing cars, see in the growing Indian market. This is also proved by their launching vehicles specifically designed for local consumers. Some of the big multinationals such as Suzuki, Hyundai and Ford have turned their Indian operations into bases to produce for markets abroad.
In addition to the growth slowdown, the industry is up against a couple of other challenges. The government has notified fuel efficiency norms that will kick in from 2017 based on average fleet weight for passenger cars. While this is good news for buyers, who can look forward to cars with higher mileage than what is available now, for manufacturers this means a re-look at their strategies. They have to push out more high-mileage vehicles to counterbalance the sale of fuel-guzzling SUVs. They will also have to develop more efficient engines and associated technologies, which could mean higher costs. Passing on such costs may not always be possible in a competitive market. Car manufacturers will also have to focus on designing safer vehicles. A recent study by a U.K. agency pointed out how some of the most popular, high-selling models in India failed crash tests. Car buyers are not going to buy the argument that average vehicle speeds in India are much lower than in the West and hence those safety standards are not applicable here. Along with the industry, the government needs to do some soul-searching as the exploding numbers of vehicles is causing chaos on the roads, especially in the cities. At least the metros need to have well-thought-out public transportation policies that will obviate the need for citizens to take their personal vehicles out on a daily basis.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/excitement-and-concerns/article5696390.ece
18,2,2014,UPA-II’s swan song,"The interim budget for the fiscal year 2014-15 presented by Finance Minister P. Chidambaram predictably did not contain any surprises. There has been limited leeway to announce spectacular measures either on the revenue side or the expenditure side. Whatever changes that have been proposed, such as a reduction in excise duty on many categories of automobiles, will be reviewed by the government that will take office after the general election. Yet, the last budget of the UPA-II government does not pretend to be a purely fiscal exercise, merely fulfilling the constitutional obligation of seeking a vote-on-account for government expenditure over the next few months until a new government takes office after the election. The temptation to highlight the achievements of the government permeates the Finance Minister’s budget speech. On the one side, the budget presents a healthy fiscal picture but on the other side there are no concrete measures to rein in subsidies. In fact, non-Plan expenditure has exceeded the estimates for fiscal 2013-14 even after rolling over some Rs.35,000 crore of subsidies. For the next year (2014-15) Plan expenditure has been estimated at Rs.555,322 crore and non-Plan expenditure at Rs.1,207,892 crore. Special significance is attached to the Rs.115,000-crore allocation for food subsidies under the National Food Security Act, which will be rolled out all over the country as a landmark achievement of the UPA-II government.
The government can claim credit for containing the fiscal deficit during the current year at 4.6 per cent of the GDP, below the “red line” of 4.8 per cent committed to by Mr. Chidambaram. However, some of the gloss gets diminished when one considers that the revenue deficit has remained sticky at over 3 per cent. Fiscal consolidation should not be achieved by pruning growth-inducing Plan expenditure, a point that is particularly valid in the context of the ambitious projection of a 4.1 per cent fiscal deficit for the next year. Economic growth, a key determinant of fiscal health, has been an enigma. As against the claim that the UPA-I and II governments have delivered above the trend growth of 6.2 per cent, recent indicators are not flattering. The economy is struggling to get into a GDP growth orbit of above 5 per cent. There has been a commendable improvement in the current account with the deficit projected to be at $45 billion in 2013-14 as against $88 billion last year. There is much that a new government should do in furthering this budget’s vision — insofar as they are non-controversial, and in striving for a much needed consensus in, for instance, reforming indirect and direct tax laws.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/upaiis-swan-song/article5699610.ece
18,2,2014,A glimmer of Syrian hope,"The Geneva II conference on Syria ended on Saturday in a predictable standoff between President Bashar al Assad’s regime and a section of the opposition National Council for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces (SNC), but it was remarkable that the talks, held indirectly with United Nations and Arab League mediator Lakhdar Brahimi moving between the two sides, took place at all. The conflict will enter its fourth year on March 15; it has so far killed 136,000 people and displaced over two million amid atrocities by all involved. Even a short truce a few days ago for the residents of the besieged city of Homs to leave or acquire food was negotiated not in Geneva but by the Homs Governor, Talal al Barazi, and the UN’s resident coordinator, Yacoub El Hillo. Meanwhile, positions at Geneva II – where the parties were to start implementing the plan reached at Geneva I on June 30, 2012 – remain bitterly entrenched. Damascus brands the opposition terrorists and insists that Mr. Assad will not step down; the SNC, for its part, only attended under pressure from its Western and West Asian allies and after a series of internal disagreements. Of its 119 members, only 75 attended the vote in Istanbul, voting 58-14 to go to Geneva II; the representatives of Syria’s 10 per cent Kurdish minority also boycotted the Swiss talks. Any chance of wider participation had ended on January 16, when the officially sanctioned opposition National Coordination Committee (NCC) said it would not attend.
Even worse complications obtain. The Syrian situation has been called a proxy war involving the West, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar on the opposition side, and Russia and Iran plus the Hezbollah on the regime’s side, but certain opposition leaders resent being used thus, and government officials speak of being treated like vassals by Iran, Russia, and the Hezbollah. In addition, the al Qaeda-linked faction, the Islamic State of Iraq and al Shams (ISIS), holds the provincial capital of Rakka in central Syria, and serves a purpose both for Damascus, which tells the West that if the government fell al Qaeda would win, and for the SNC, which submerges its internal differences to fight ISIS. Furthermore, Iran, which could well have some leverage on Mr. Assad, had no option but to pull out of Geneva II when Washington stated the precondition that Mr. Assad step down in any transition process. The one glimmer of hope in all this is that since October 2013, opposition and government members have been meeting privately at the Château de Bossey in Switzerland. As the United States and Russia will almost certainly back any agreement they reach, it is imperative that those involved continue talking and that all others stay away.

19,2,2014,Above politics and passion,"It is a sign of the expanding vision of the Indian judiciary that it has reaffirmed the law relating to the correct and constitutional use of sovereign clemency powers without being weighed down by the political and high-profile nature of the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. The court has stuck to its humanitarian outlook, placing emphasis on the continued relevance of fundamental rights even after a convict’s death sentence has been confirmed and mercy petitions rejected. Coming less than a month after a three-judge Bench unequivocally laid down that unexplained delay on the part of the executive in disposing of mercy petitions is a supervening circumstance warranting commutation of death sentences to life terms, the Supreme Court’s latest verdict extending that relief to V. Sriharan alias Murugan, T. Suthendraraja alias Santhan and A.G. Perarivalan is least surprising. There was very little scope for it to deviate from its sound and well-reasoned earlier verdicts. It was quite obvious that the passage of 11 long years since their mercy pleas first reached the President would render any move to execute them unconstitutional. The court has also clarified that “life imprisonment means [until the] end of one’s life”, but has noted that the life term would be subject to provisions relating to remission by the appropriate government under the Code of Criminal Procedure. It has wisely refrained from any discussion on the roles played by Murugan and Santhan, both committed LTTE members, or Perarivalan, an Indian national.
One unsavoury aspect needs to be taken note of. There was an attempt in Tamil Nadu to give an ethno-linguistic angle to the campaign to save the three convicts from the gallows. The humanitarian demand to abolish capital punishment was overshadowed by efforts to portray the three men as “innocent Tamils”. It is good that the court had laid down a sound jurisprudential foundation for its verdict well before it granted relief to the Rajiv Gandhi case trio, lest someone read in it any unseen influence of emotions whipped up by some political elements. There is bound to be a view that the state’s failure to execute convicted killers and conspirators may mean that justice had not been fully rendered to those killed or maimed in the blast. Rather than looking at it as inadequate justice, an enlightened citizenry should see conviction and imprisonment as sufficient punishment that would give true closure to a dastardly offence, and not execution, which even in the case of the most brutal offences would not be in keeping with the values of a civilised community. Verdicts such as this would create a humane atmosphere and pave the way for the eventual abolition of the death penalty.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/above-politics-and-passion/article5703169.ece
19,2,2014,Vatican’s moral imperative,"The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has in a report indicted the Catholic Church for acts of clerical child abuse, a scandal that has dogged it for more than a decade now. Acting under the authority of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which the Vatican is a signatory, the panel has recommended that the Church remove priests suspected or known to have resorted to abuse, open its records on abusers and the bishops who covered up for them, and turn the cases over to the civil justice system rather than let the Vatican’s own justice department handle them behind closed doors. The committee has blamed the Vatican for valuing its own reputation above the protection of child-victims, and maintaining a “code of silence.” It has also urged the Holy See to ensure that issues of reproductive health, including access to information about contraception and preventing HIV, are included in the curriculum in Catholic schools, and to use its moral authority to condemn discrimination against children raised by same-sex couples. The Vatican promptly hit back, accusing the committee of exceeding its mandate and adopting the “prejudiced” positions of anti-Catholic advocacy groups. Reacting to the recommendation that the Church amend canon law to allow abortion in some cases, it complained that religious freedom was being trampled upon, saying that the committee had “gone beyond its competence and interfered in the moral and doctrinal positions of the Catholic Church.” The Vatican accused the committee of having ignored its unique status and its efforts to address the abuse crisis.
Even more problematic is the Vatican’s effort to wash its hands of broader responsibility for the staggering scale of priestly misdeeds. The argument is that the Church is not comparable to a global business operation and cannot be expected to keep in check all clergymen in all parts of the world. This is a dodge. The committee has rightly said that by ratifying the convention the Vatican “committed itself to implementing the convention not only on the territory of the Vatican City state, but also as the supreme power of the Catholic Church through individuals and institutions placed under its authority.” Pope Francis has generated hopes of a new dawn, but on the question of abuse, he is simply not there yet, although last year he termed it “the shame of the Church.” His predecessor Benedict XVI apologised to abuse victims and called for zero tolerance, but rhetoric seems to have outstripped real action. The Church hierarchy should appreciate the urgency of the issue. There will be a heavy moral cost involved if it insists on looking for legal loopholes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/vaticans-moral-imperative/article5703170.ece
26,2,2014,When all is foul,"Whatever the troubles within the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the split in its Bihar Legislature Party seems to have been encouraged and engineered by its rival, the ruling Janata Dal (United). That the Speaker of the Assembly, Uday Narayan Choudhary, chose to recognise 13 of the rebels in the 22-member Legislature Party as a separate group was surprising as even if their action was considered to be a split, they did not constitute two-thirds of even the Legislature Party, the minimum required for the benefit of exemption from the provisions of the Tenth Schedule, which provides for disqualification on the ground of defection. Indeed, seven of the 13 claimed that their signatures were forged and that they had not left the RJD at all. Evidently, political considerations weighed on the Speaker’s mind more than the Tenth Schedule. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who is surviving on the support of the Congress and Independents, required six more members for his party to have an absolute majority. At a time when he was involved in propping up an alternative to both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party at the national level, Mr. Kumar could not have counted on continued Congress support. Moreover, the Congress and the RJD are close to coming to a seat-sharing understanding for the Lok Sabha election, and it would only have been a matter of time before the RJD persuaded the Congress to withdraw support. While the rebels might have had their own reasons for leaving the RJD, the split could not have happened without the blessings of the JD (U) leadership, and the partisanship of the Speaker. The proper course for the rebels to join the JD (U) would have been to resign their seats, and contest elections again on the JD (U) ticket. That they did not do so is also illustrative of the lack of confidence in the JD (U) camp: not much can be left to chance, or the will of the people.
Bihar remains one of the crucial States in the Lok Sabha election calculus, sending 40 members to Parliament, and the Congress, the BJP, and third front parties all fancy their chances. The Lok Jan Shakti Party led by Ram Vilas Paswan seems to have added another dimension to poll-eve politics by moving closer to the BJP. While this might be a pressure tactic as seat-sharing negotiations gather momentum, Bihar seems to be one State where several permutations and combinations are possible in alliances. At different points of time, the JD (U) and the LJP wooed both the Congress and the BJP. No matter how the RJD rebels issue plays out, the State seems set for hectic political activity in the weeks before the election, and a fiercely contested three-way battle. It is to be hoped that the latest turn does not heighten the turbulence in the State.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/when-all-is-foul/article5726532.ece
26,2,2014,Iran keeps the door open,"The Vienna talks between Iran and the E3/EU+3 group, acting for the P5+1, reached a constructive conclusion on February 20, with Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and the European Union’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton making identical statements, in Farsi and English respectively, that the parties had identified all the issues necessary for a long-term deal. In effect, they have agreed on the framework for a “comprehensive and final agreement.” The next round of talks is to start on March 17, again in the Austrian capital. Under the interim agreement, Iran will stop producing uranium enriched to nearly 20 per cent, will dilute half the stockpile it has already enriched to the same level, and will continue converting the rest to a form unsuitable for further enrichment. In addition, Tehran will not enrich uranium in about half the centrifuges at Natanz and three quarters of those at Fordo. It will manufacture equipment only to repair existing machines, and will put the Arak heavy-water reactor on indefinite hold. It will not build any more enrichment facilities. Furthermore, the International Atomic Energy Agency will be able to inspect Natanz and Fordo on a daily basis, and the Arak reactor at least on a monthly basis.
On the other side, the western countries in particular have undertaken not to impose further nuclear-related sanctions if Iran fulfils its Vienna commitments; they will also pay Iran a total of $4.2 billion in oil revenues, allow Iran to resume exporting precious metals, suspend sanctions on Iran’s petrochemical exports, and permit the Islamic Republic to import goods and services for automobile manufacturing plants. In addition, they will maintain their current levels of crude oil imports from Iran, and will allow Iran’s civil airlines to acquire spare parts and services. Yet the deal already faces interference. Israel is pushing certain western governments to include Iran’s missile programme in future talks, thereby showing its own anxiety that a final agreement will be reached without it. Saudi Arabia, which sees Iran as a theological and political rival, will also view the current prospects with alarm. Iran’s willingness, however, to keep the door open need cause neither surprise nor suspicion. It was in fact the United States which, by providing uranium enriched to 93 per cent, helped start Iran’s nuclear programme in 1967, and Tehran aimed for nuclear self-sufficiency only after the West imposed sanctions on the Khomeini regime in the 1980s. There could be no clearer evidence for continued engagement between the P5+1 and Iran, and both sides must reach fair and just final-status arrangements without delay.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/iran-keeps-the-door-open/article5726533.ece
27,2,2014,Time to speed up this trial,"India’s pragmatic decision not to invoke its anti-piracy law against two Italian marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen off the Kerala coast in February 2012 sets the stage for some tangible judicial progress in the case. Italy’s diplomatic pressure, especially a dramatic move to recall its Ambassador in New Delhi for consultations, may have spurred the government to make up its mind after considerable dithering. Ultimately, the decision is reasonable as it is difficult to characterise the shooting, which happened on the basis of the impression that the fishermen were pirates, as an unlawful act that threatened navigation security. For far too long, the legal process has been delayed, initially on the question of jurisdiction and later on whether the Centre should allow the National Investigation Agency to proceed against the marines under the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against Safety of Maritime Navigation and Fixed Platforms on Continental Shelf Act, 2002 — which prescribes the death penalty for those causing death during an act of violence against any ship or vessel. The NIA, which has a charge sheet ready and was waiting only for the outcome of the petition before the Supreme Court, may have to rework the final report, as SUA has been dropped and fresh penal provisions may have to be incorporated. Having given an assurance against awarding capital punishment earlier, it would have been unacceptable for India to apply a law that provides for mandatory death sentence.
The delay itself was due to a legal dilemma that the NIA faced. The Act that gives statutory status to the NIA has a schedule of offences it can investigate, and SUA is one of them. Further, the shooting incident took place in the Contiguous Zone, bringing the matter into the realm of maritime security and conferring the requisite jurisdiction to the agency. Without SUA, the NIA would undoubtedly be handicapped in its prosecution. Invoking the law, on the other hand, was unpalatable for Italy, as it felt that it will amount to classifying the country as a “terrorist state”. The next legal battle is already on, as the marines have now challenged the jurisdiction of the NIA to prosecute this case, and the court will hear the matter shortly. The process would be more purposive if this aspect is not actively pursued, as the NIA took up the probe only after the Supreme Court ruled that only the Union government had the jurisdiction to investigate it, and not the Kerala police. What is required now is an expeditious trial and a tangible outcome and not further rounds of legalistic hair-splitting. The right balance should be struck between bringing about a sense of closure to the victims, and maintaining cordial diplomatic relations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/time-to-speed-up-this-trial/article5729987.ece
27,2,2014,Central African dilemma,"In December 2013, France intervened in an African civil war for the second time in a year, again under impeccable United Nations authority, but it now faces an increasingly difficult predicament in the Central African Republic (CAR). The first intervention, in Mali, was a success for French President François Hollande, as French and African Union (AU) troops restored stability and blocked an imminent takeover by the Maghreb-based and al Qaeda-linked extreme Islamist group Ansar Dine. In CAR, however, several constraints obtain, such as local conditions, French public reluctance to commit more troops, and the unwillingness of the European Union and the United States to help. These are making it more likely that CAR will collapse into what a U.N. official has called ethnic-religious cleansing, even though the country has no history of religious strife. Even partition now looms, despite desperate efforts by CAR Interim President Catherine Samba Panza; half of CAR’s 4.6 million people are Christians, and 15 per cent, or about 700,000, are Muslims. The fighting has taken at least 2,000 lives and displaced about a million people, many of whom are barely surviving in terrible conditions; 80,000 Muslims have reportedly fled the north to Chad and the west to Cameroon. The killings have been extremely brutal, and Christian militias, called the anti-balaka (Sango for anti-machete), are massacring Muslim civilians in revenge for killings of their co-religionists by Muslim militias called the Séléka, which engaged in such killings themselves after overthrowing President François Bozizé in March 2013.
French troops in CAR, however, have not done everything they could have done, even if their numbers have been raised from 1,600 to 2,000, and their task is to help a 6,000-strong African Union force; the narrow streets in the capital Bangui and dense vegetation in the rural areas make heavy military equipment and air power ineffective, and more ground troops are needed. Human Rights Watch emergency director Peter Bouckaert has told the BBC that he saw French troops sitting still while civilians were murdered barely yards away, and other eyewitnesses speak of Chadian troops escorting Séléka fighters across the border; the Chadian army has lost men and has reportedly killed CAR civilians. In addition, western interest in the country is low; it is landlocked and of little strategic importance to the west. In other regions of the world, nevertheless, concern is growing, and West Asian governments are paying closer attention. A failure of political will in France, the EU, and the United States could make CAR yet another target for what could well be externally-funded Islamist extremists.

28,2,2014,Looming military breakdown,"In a nation where instances of admission of individual responsibility are depressingly rare, Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral D.K. Joshi’s resignation following the tragic accident on INS Sindhuratna is welcome evidence that some officials, at least, still hold themselves to the highest standards. Behind his resignation, though, lies a terrifying story: India’s military is, literally, on the verge of breakdown. In recent years, each military chief has told Defence Minister A.K. Antony of the growing danger that India might prove unable to fight future wars. Even as the Army has been instructed to be prepared to fight a war on two fronts, acquisitions of desperately needed armour and artillery systems have been endlessly delayed. The Air Force is warning that its combat fleet will start shrinking from 2017; squadrons are rationing flying time to prolong the life of aircraft for as long as possible. The Navy is well below strength, and its increasingly obsolescent platforms are dangerous. Last year’s explosion on board INS Sindhurakshak, one of 10 significant accidents involving the Navy in the last seven months, caused more damage than the Navy ever suffered at war. Perhaps most dangerous, all three services face large-scale deficits of officers, because the armed forces’ pay scales and service conditions are too poor to attract the skilled young people modern militaries need. There are more than a few in the armed forces who are asking whether the civilian leadership is not just as responsible for the deaths on board the Sindhuratna as Admiral Joshi, whose resignation the Union government was so quick to accept.
Though Mr. Antony’s years in office have seen him maintain his stellar reputation for personal probity — which is no mean achievement in itself — he has done little to address the looming crisis in Indian defence. Equipment purchases have stalled at the whiff of scandal, often forcing the forces to restart the acquisition process, that can last years. In fairness to Mr. Antony, the problem is not all of his making. The depreciation of the rupee against the dollar, and India’s slowing growth, have stripped him of resources badly needed for modernisation. Yet, there is no glossing over the fact that too little has been done on defence reform and capacity-building. India can only hope it is not too late. The last Indian military chief to hand in his resignation was General K.S. Thimayya, who did so in 1959 to protest Defence Minister V.K. Krishna Menon’s refusal to consider his plans to prepare the Army for a war with China. Prime Minister Nehru persuaded the legendary General to take back his resignation, but chose not to persuade his Defence Minister to take the threat of war seriously. The consequences still haunt India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/looming-military-breakdown/article5733356.ece
28,2,2014,From austerity to growth,"In a noticeable change in its stance, the G-20, comprising the world’s biggest economies, at the recent meeting in Sydney decided to shift emphasis from championing austerity to promoting growth at a time when the financial crisis in seen to be receding. Towards that end, Finance Ministers and central bank governors of the G-20 agreed to target reforms aimed at adding more than $2 trillion to the global economy over five years. Political leaders from the bloc who will meet in November are expected to outline what reforms they expect to implement to achieve the target. Yet the tasks of identifying reforms and implementing them in a synchronised manner among countries are not easy. For one, the world’s biggest economies are not a homogenous lot. Even the traditional categorisation such as advanced and developing economies falls flat when individual countries in each sub-group exhibit diverse characteristics. Among advanced economies, the U.S. is ahead with recovery gathering steam. Countries of the EU, on the other hand, are still struggling to come out of the recession, although they have put their worst days behind them.
Another important development often highlighted by institutions such as the IMF is that while in the early post-recovery period, China and India along with a few other developing countries were spearheading global growth, the position is now reversed with the advanced economies led by the U.S. emerging in the forefront. All these explain why the joint G-20 communique cannot be anything but bland. It talks of ambitious but realistic policies to lift the collective GDP to 2 per cent above the trajectory implied by current policies, over the coming five years. The fixing of a numerical target for future growth is considered significant. In the past, the G-20 has shied away from fixing numbers in such areas as fiscal adjustments. India’s strong views on the deleterious consequences of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s ongoing taper process were accommodated in the final communique, which calls for a continuous calibration of monetary policy settings by individual countries and their communication to one another. Another of India’s key concerns — the reform of the IMF quota system to give developing economies a greater say — was also taken on board. The G-20, comprising the biggest industrialised and developing countries accounting for 85 per cent of the world economy, might have regained some relevance which it was fast losing as countries went their own ways, However, even its most notable success — persuading members to shift gears from austerity to growth — has met with scepticism from certain key members, who have termed the numerical targets aspirational rather than realistic.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/from-austerity-to-growth/article5733355.ece
29,2,2014,Right by birth: On daughters and Hindu succession act,"The latest decision of the Supreme Court on the right of Hindu daughters to ancestral property corrects an obvious anomaly in the interpretation of a crucial 2005 amendment to the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. The verdict settles the question whether the coparcenary right of daughters comes into effect only if the father through whom they claim that right was alive on the day the amendment came into force. The apex court has now categorically ruled that the daughters’ right flows from their birth and not by any other factor such as the existence of their fathers. In other words, it has rejected the common misinterpretation that only daughters of coparceners who were alive on that day could get an equal share in property. The court has rightly recognised that the amendment conferred equal status as a coparcener on daughters in Hindu families governed by Mitakshara law, and this right accrued by birth. The change came into effect from September 9, 2005, but with a provision that partitions or testamentary disposition that had taken place prior to December 20, 2004 — the date on which the amendment Bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha — will remain valid and unaffected by the change. This led to the interpretation that the daughters’ coparcenary rights, being prospective, would not come into effect unless both the coparcener father and his daughter were alive on September 9, 2005. This position was crystallised in a 2015 judgment of the Supreme Court in Prakash and Others vs. Phulavati. This judgment now stands overruled.
The court’s reasoning is unexceptionable. First, it locates the origin of the coparcenary right in one’s birth. Second, it finds that there is no necessity for a predecessor coparcener to be alive for one to acquire that status, as what is relevant is birth within the degrees of succession to which it extends. In that sense, the legislation, even though it comes into effect on a prescribed date, is retroactive in its application as it is linked to birth, an antecedent event. It also underscores that the legislation makes it clear that the daughter’s rights are the same “as that of a son,” and “as if she had been a son at the time of birth”. The coparcenary status given to daughters has been a subject of reform in many States, particularly in south India, long before the UPA regime brought in the amendment for the whole country. Kerala had introduced legislation in 1975, Andhra Pradesh in 1986, Tamil Nadu in 1989 and Maharashtra and Karnataka in 1994. The legislative aim was that a flagrant discrimination between sons and daughters in entitlement to an equal share in coparcenary property, that is property inherited from one’s father, grandfather or great-grandfather, should be done away with. It is indeed welcome that the apex court has sought to give full effect to this intent by setting at rest doubts arising from varying interpretations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/right-by-birth-the-hindu-editorial-on-daughters-and-hindu-succession-act/article32347299.ece
29,2,2014,Historic ratification: On universal ratification of a labour standard,"The welcome decision by the Kingdom of Tonga to outlaw the worst forms of child labour is the first time in the International Labour Organization (ILO)’s 101-year history that a labour standard has been universally ratified. Convention 182, which was adopted in the 1999 annual international labour conference, prohibits the sexual exploitation of children, trafficking, deployment in armed conflict and other conditions that compromise their overall well-being. The Convention complements the ILO’s efforts under the 1973 Minimum Age Convention to prevent the employment of children below a lower age threshold. Under the influence of both these ILO standards, millions of young boys and girls have been rescued from hazardous conditions of work. Concomitantly, these have resulted in significant increases in enrolments in primary education. The landmark ratification, however, does not detract from the enormity of the challenge that remains. An estimated 152 million are trapped in child labour and 72 million of them are engaged in hazardous work. If anything, current efforts would have to be stepped up significantly to achieve the ambitious goal of total abolition of the scourge of child labour by 2025. But the COVID-19 pandemic is threatening a reversal of recent gains, with widespread job losses, deterioration in conditions of work, decline in household incomes and temporary school closures.
The historic first universal ratification of a global labour standard may be an occasion for celebration; it is nonetheless a moment for sober reflection. The two instruments on child labour are among the eight core ILO Conventions regarded as embodying the spirit of the 1998 declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work. Instruments relating to the freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining and the elimination of discrimination in employment and occupation are among the others. These conventions provide the necessary framework to counteract the predominance of informality in the conditions of work and ought to be a priority for governments. Though belated, India has signalled its legal commitment to the elimination of child labour with its 2017 ratification of Convention 182 and the instrument prescribing the minimum age of work for children. As the world prepares to designate 2021 as the year to abolish child labour, governments must seize the moment to instil hope in the future generations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/historic-ratification-the-hindu-editorial-on-universal-ratification-of-a-labour-standard/article32347515.ece
1,3,2014,Apologies and vote banks,"The chase for vote banks is the surest sign that an election is in the offing. So with the general election less than two months away, it is no surprise that political parties are offering protection, prosperity and more to Muslims. Nonetheless, it does seem odd when the Bharatiya Janata Party woos the community with the same passion as those among its rivals whom it has always accused of practising vote bank politics. In the event, BJP chief Rajnath Singh went beyond customary entreaties to offer a general apology to Muslims for whatever hurt the party may have caused them in the past. This is the farthest the BJP has gone vis-à-vis Muslims, with whom it has so far shared an uneasy equation — as much on account of the party’s belief in majoritarian Hindutva as because of its calculation that it stands to gain electorally from religious polarisation. Against this backdrop, Mr. Singh’s overture raises some questions: What explains the attempted inclusion? And secondly, is this enough to bring around a community that has felt deeply alienated by the BJP’s exclusivist philosophy? After all, the BJP’s opposition to Muslim welfare schemes, which it characterises as “appeasement”, is a matter of record.
That the BJP does not need the Muslim vote is an open secret. But it is an equally well-established fact of history that no party or alliance can rule this country without showing at least a semblance of accommodation towards the community. The ‘sectarian’ image of the BJP was balanced by the many ‘secular’ constituents in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led National Democratic Alliance. The same constituents deserted the alliance, unfailingly citing the 2002 anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat. With the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, as its prime ministerial nominee, the BJP’s task becomes that much more difficult, and hence Mr. Rajnath Singh’s offer to apologise. But critically, the offer has not come from Mr. Modi himself. Asked if he regretted the 2002 violence, Mr. Modi, in a 2013 interview to Reuters, generalised about pain and hurt, using the metaphor of a puppy coming under a car. Not just this, arguing before the Supreme Court recently, the Gujarat Government disputed the very constitution of the Rajinder Sachar Committee on the ground that it was only for Muslims. Set up in 2006, the Sachar Committee was a landmark effort at evaluation of Muslim deprivation; it concluded that on some indices, Muslims were worse off than Dalits. Not surprisingly, Sachar is today an article of faith with the community. Muslims will regard the BJP’s apology offer as a gimmick — unless it is accompanied by verifiable action on the ground.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/apologies-and-vote-banks/article5737102.ece
1,3,2014,Waiting for bifurcation,"President’s Rule in Andhra Pradesh was the only option left before the Union Cabinet after the resignation of Chief Minister Kiran Kumar Reddy, who also quit the Congress protesting against the bifurcation of the State. With most of the members of the Legislative Assembly divided on geographical lines, and party loyalty counting for nothing, no government would have been able to get adequate numbers for a vote of confidence. Moreover, with the election to the Assembly due to be held along with the Lok Sabha polls soon, none of the senior State leaders of the Congress could have been very enthusiastic about the prospect of serving the remainder of the term as an ineffectual Chief Minister. With the model code of conduct bound to become operative with the announcement of the election schedule, a new government would have been left without much leeway for even routine administrative decision-making. Thus, other than bringing together unwilling, disparate elements in a weak, ineffectual government in Andhra Pradesh, the Congress leadership had no option. President’s Rule suggested itself to the Centre, and the Assembly could only be kept in suspended animation.
President’s Rule in Andhra Pradesh opens up another possibility for the Centre and the Congress: holding Assembly elections at a later date, and not simultaneously with the Lok Sabha polls. Unlike in the case of the previous round of state-formation exercises involving Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh, the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh has been left to coincide with the parliamentary and State Assembly elections. Depending on the timing of the presidential assent and the notification of the appointed date for the formation of Telangana, elections will have to be held either to the composite Andhra Pradesh Assembly or to the two assemblies of Seemandhra and Telangana. Elections to two separate assemblies may well take some time to organise, but it does make political sense. The process of first forming a government for Andhra Pradesh in its current form out of the composite Assembly, and later for Telangana and Seemandhra after bifurcating the Assembly, can thus be avoided. However, while President’s Rule can be justified on the ground that there was in Andhra Pradesh a “situation of impasse” as specified in the Bommai judgment, the postponement of the Assembly election will have no such justification. An alternative government might not have been possible from the current Assembly, but this in itself is no argument for postponing the Assembly election. Whether or not Telangana comes into being before the Lok Sabha polls, the Centre and the Election Commission need to take the most democratic course — which is to put a popular government in place without delay.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/waiting-for-bifurcation/article5737105.ece
2,3,2014,Eleventh hour decisions,"As the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance Government races to fend off the imminent freeze on key policy decisions, when the Election Commission’s (EC) Model Code of Conduct for political parties comes into force before the 2014 General Election, a slew of last-minute decisions by the Union Cabinet a week after both Houses of Parliament adjourned sine die, comes as no surprise. Most of the measures cleared by the Cabinet are part of a poll-eve image shoring-up exercise, while some of them may be a procedural necessity for any government in the last days of its tenure. Hiking the election expenditure limit incurred by a candidate for each parliamentary constituency to Rs.70 lakh from Rs.40 lakh for all the bigger States, should come as a big relief to most political parties facing both inflationary pressures and demands for greater transparency in poll-spending. At the all-party meeting recently convened by the EC to discuss this issue, only the Aam Aadmi Party is reported to have rejected the proposed hike on expenditure limits for both parliamentary and assembly constituencies, citing its 2013 ‘Delhi Assembly experiment’ of open accounting and spending.
Based on the broad consensus among most political parties, the EC had reportedly written to the Law Ministry to raise the cap on poll expenditure for each Lok Sabha and Assembly seat, factoring in “the cost inflation index, increase in number of electors and polling stations” among others. The EC also sought to bring the expenditure cap in the northeastern and hilly States on a par with those in the plains and proposed a limit of Rs.54 lakh for them including States such as Arunachal Pradesh, Goa and Sikkim, besides Union Territories such as Chandigarh and Puducherry. Those limits earlier ranged from Rs.22 lakh (for Goa) to Rs.35 lakh (for Manipur). In the case of each Assembly constituency, the limit has now been hiked to Rs.28 lakh in all the major States, while it will be Rs.20 lakh in the smaller States and some UTs including Puducherry. The last upward revision was effected in February 2011. Further, the Cabinet approving a minimum monthly pension entitlement of Rs.1,000 under the Employees Provident Fund Organisation’s Employees Pension Scheme, to benefit 28 lakh pensioners including five lakh widows, is calculated to strengthen its pro-welfare stance. The reaching out to the organised sector by enhancing dearness allowance for Central government employees, a golden handshake to staff of the sick Hindustan Photo Films, besides other regional sops like clearing a new rail coach manufacturing unit at Kolar in Karnataka, and provision of funds to support four new National Institutes of Design are also in tune with this eleventh hour give-away approach.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/eleventh-hour-decisions/article5743658.ece
2,3,2014,India-Saudi Arabia ties get a boost,"The visit by Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud has imparted fresh momentum to ties between India and Saudi Arabia. The high-profile visit of the Saudi royal, who is also the Kingdom’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, has built on the foundations of two earlier game-changing outings — the visit by King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz in 2006, which was followed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s trip to Riyadh four years later. Dr. Singh’s 2010 visit resulted in the signing of the Riyadh Declaration, which proclaimed that a “strategic partnership” between New Delhi and Riyadh had been established, spanning diverse fields including energy security, information technology and outer space. The document did not exclude a security element either, signalling that a standalone relationship between India and Saudi Arabia had been anchored, de-hyphenated from Riyadh’s long-standing ties with Islamabad. The signing of a defence pact during the Crown Prince’s visit implies that the focus imparted to military ties, during Defence Minister A.K. Antony’s visit to Saudi Arabia in 2012, has been emphatically retained. An acknowledgement that a new thrust on promoting investments is required augurs well for the evolution of a substantial, multifaceted relationship.
Despite their promise, India-Saudi ties will have to be carefully nurtured. On the bilateral side, the welfare of millions of Indian workers in the Kingdom has to be ensured, especially at a time when authorities in Riyadh have embarked on a major undertaking to generate maximum employment for their own nationals, shrinking job opportunities for expatriates. The future of ties between New Delhi and Riyadh would also have to be insulated from the differing perceptions of the two countries of developments in West Asia. Besides, India has to stay clear of the crossfire between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which are at loggerheads on account of the situation in Syria, and whose hostility towards each other has acquired a dangerous sectarian dimension in the region. While it bonds with Riyadh, India has an abiding interest in the simultaneous development of its relationship with Iran, which not only is a major energy-supplier but — after the American withdrawal later this year — is bound to play a pivotal role in Afghanistan. Simultaneously, India has no basis to grudge Saudi Arabia’s “all weather” ties with Pakistan, so long as they do not harm New Delhi’s core interests. In fact, distancing itself from zero-sum expectations, India, if invited, can turn its proximity with Riyadh and Tehran to its advantage, by making its contribution in defusing tensions between the two regional heavyweights.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/indiasaudi-arabia-ties-get-a-boost/article5743659.ece
4,3,2014,The mischief in the rules,"The refusal by two eminent jurists to join the Lokpal Search Committee is symptomatic of the credibility crisis that the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime faces in its last days. Even the process of putting in place an independent anti-corruption ombudsman has been engulfed in controversy, exposing the government to the charge that it is in an unseemly hurry to appoint the body before the expiry of its term. At the very first meeting of the Selection Committee, Sushma Swaraj, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, objected to the inclusion of senior advocate P.P. Rao in the selection panel as the fifth member, and her objection was overruled. Senior advocate Fali Nariman declined to be on the Search Committee, voicing the fear that in the two-stage selection process, “the most competent, the most independent and the most courageous will get overlooked.” Retired Supreme Court judge, Justice K.T. Thomas, went through the Rules framed under the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act, and noted that the Search Committee’s recommendations were not binding on the Selection Committee, headed by the Prime Minister. Such controversies need not imply that the statutory framework for the Lokpal is substantively flawed; but when the finer points in the process that emerge after rules are framed appear loaded in favour of the ruling dispensation, the process itself becomes suspect.
When the much-delayed Bill was passed in Parliament in December 2013, there was a sense of relief that a reasonably sound law was in place. However, the government equipped itself with some potential filters while framing the rules. The process involves a Selection Committee that will appoint a Search Committee. Going by the rules, the search panel will scrutinise only applications forwarded to it by the Department of Personnel and Training. The rule circumscribes the Search Committee’s role to choosing names out of a list submitted by the government and blocks any independent nomination from the community at large. Further, the panel of names recommended by it need not be accepted by the Selection Committee, which is free to consider names from outside the panel too. Empowering the apex committee with the freedom to go beyond the recommendations may not be inherently wrong. However, the potential for mischief in confining the first stage to a government list and conferring wide discretion on the selection panel in the second stage may ultimately result in some deserving candidates being ignored or, worse, someone deemed inconvenient being deliberately disregarded. The government needs to shore up the credibility of the process; as an immediate step, it should revisit the rules and give a free hand to the Search Committee to do its job.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-mischief-in-the-rules/article5750644.ece
4,3,2014,Towards fair regulation,"The importance of a strong regulator and even-handed regulation cannot be overemphasised in a critical sector such as power which is faced with numerous regulatory issues holding back its development. Two recent moves of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), which regulates all central generation and transmission utilities and projects that sell electricity in more than one State, show that it is possible for a regulator to be practical and pragmatic while simultaneously protecting the interests of the consumer. Tata Power’s 4,000 MW ultra mega power project (UMPP) in Mundra that depends on imported coal has been facing an existential challenge ever since the Indonesian government decided to charge an export tax on coal — the company imports all its coal from Indonesia — which made fuel costs prohibitively expensive. This badly hit the economics of the Mundra project, the first UMPP to have been commissioned, because the company cannot pass on the higher fuel cost to consumers as per the norms on which the project was awarded. Tata Power had to take an impairment charge on its balance sheet last year and ironically, the state-of-the-art power plant, which was commissioned on schedule, converted a profitable company into a loss-making one. It is in this backdrop that the company sought CERC’s permission to pass on the higher fuel cost to consumers.
In what is a balanced decision, the regulator granted permission recently to Tata Power to charge a tariff of Rs.2.78 a unit, marking an increase of 52 paise from the originally contracted price. The regulator could have argued that the company should have anticipated such exigencies while bidding for the UMPP and on those grounds said no to higher tariffs. But that would have forced Tata Power to stop generation and cut losses and there would have been no winners. While the higher tariff will now cover most of the increased fuel costs for Tata Power, the final price is still affordable for the consumer. The regulator has also notified new tariff norms for the next five years for central generation and transmission utilities which aim to increase operating efficiencies and lower tariffs. For instance, the NTPC will find its incentives falling because the regulator has now linked them to capacity utilisation, which is a change from the current practice of linking them to the availability of generating stations. As a consequence of the new norms, tariffs could fall even as the generating stations are forced to improve operating efficiencies. The utilities may have to sacrifice a part of their margins in the short term but will stand to gain in the long term as a result of higher efficiencies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/towards-fair-regulation/article5750645.ece
4,3,2014,When better sense prevailed,"In choosing not to adopt the ordinance route to bring in anti-corruption measures, the United Progressive Alliance has managed to avoid questions about propriety and legality. It is unlikely that President Pranab Mukherjee could have been persuaded to promulgate ordinances to introduce laws that Parliament had the opportunity, but not the will, to enact. If the government had gone ahead, Mr. Mukherjee might have asked for reconsideration of the advice, causing embarrassment to the ruling party, especially its vice-president Rahul Gandhi. In the circumstances, it was surprising that the ordinance route was considered at all. It is true that several good measures fell by the wayside in the din and chaos of the final Parliament session. Yet, the undemocratic ordinance route is not a proper substitute for sound legislative management to which both the government and the Opposition have to contribute. With the Opposition not ready to keep Parliament in session indefinitely, the Houses adjourned sine die on February 21 and the session was prorogued a week later. With the country in election mode, issuing ordinances with the sole purpose of enacting laws that Mr. Gandhi was keen on would have been seen as politically partisan and constitutionally improper. The power to promulgate ordinances should be used sparingly and only when the urgency is manifestly clear and when there is a real possibility of the legislature reconvening in time to provide the requisite approval. The composition of the next Lok Sabha as well as the level of support for any given bill are likely to be vastly different.
The set of anti-graft measures contemplated, no doubt constitutes a serious and organised effort to combat corruption. And none can find fault with Mr. Gandhi for bestowing attention on it. Yet, by repeatedly hinting in various forums that the government was considering ordinances to introduce these laws ahead of the elections, he gave the impression of pursuing an agenda aimed at bolstering his image as a crusader against corruption. Predictably, some Congress leaders are now blaming the Opposition for the non-passage of these Bills when Parliament was in session. Such criticism fails to take into account the government’s own inability to come up with a credible legislative schedule earlier. The fact that an ordinance is now required to fine-tune the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, and the controversy surrounding the selection of the first Lokpal indicate that even Bills that Parliament found the time to consider and pass are not free of lacunae. Ordinances on issues that require a full discussion, then, are unlikely to be perfect pieces of legislation, and are best avoided in the run-up to a general election.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/when-better-sense-prevailed/article5747032.ece
4,3,2014,Sign of the times,"So many awards are handed out before the Oscars, with strong favourites emerging on the basis of those wins, that the Academy Awards ceremony has today become largely predictable. The same people who garner those earlier awards inevitably end up winning Oscars. Thus, Matthew McConaughey won Best Actor for Dallas Buyers Club, despite rumours that long-denied Leonardo DiCaprio would pose a threat with his work on The Wolf of Wall Street. Cate Blanchett was anointed Best Actress for Blue Jasmine, despite worries that her association with this Woody Allen film would prove too scandalous, after the fresh round of sexual abuse charges by Allen’s daughter. As widely predicted on the basis of his win at the Director’s Guild of America, Alfonso Cuarón was declared Best Director for Gravity. And 12 Years a Slave won Best Picture, despite predictions of an upset by Gravity. There was no way a 3-D sci-fi spectacular was going to beat a noble-minded account of slavery in the antebellum South. But despite the lack of surprise, history was made. 12 Years a Slave was the first film made by a black to receive the Academy’s highest honour: Best Picture. It was fitting that one of the presenters was Sidney Poitier, America’s first black star.
The first instance of the largely white Academy acknowledging the diversity in the nation was when Hattie McDaniel became the first black person to be nominated for an Oscar. (She went on to win, for Gone With the Wind.) And this year, Lupita Nyong’o and John Ridley picked up two major awards for their work on 12 Years a Slave. Even the traditional address by the president of the Academy for Motion Picture Arts and Sciences upheld this trend, coming as it did from the first black woman to hold the position. And that wasn’t all. It is a sign of how far the Academy Awards have come that its 86th edition was hosted by a lesbian. Ellen DeGeneres has hosted earlier, in 2007, but this year she made an explicit quip about her sexual orientation during her opening monologue. And one of the major contenders of the evening was Dallas Buyers Club, which features several gay characters and which won Best Supporting Actor for Jared Leto’s widely acclaimed work as a transgender AIDS patient. These are important signposts in spreading the message of tolerance because, unlike festivals like Cannes or Berlin that award artier films that are seen mostly by a niche audience of cinephiles, the Oscars recognise mainstream cinema, seen by millions worldwide. Despite (rightful) complaints that the Academy, along with Hollywood, should be doing a lot more to further the cause of the minorities, this year’s awards are at least a sign of how much better things are today.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sign-of-the-times/article5747033.ece
6,3,2014,India in election mode,"The numbers say it all. With about 81.45 crore people eligible to vote, India will witness a nine-phase election over a 36-day span covering 9,30,000 polling stations that will press into service 18,78,306 electronic ballot units — the largest and lengthiest democratic exercise in the world. The country added more than 10 crore voters since the last election five years ago, and significantly, those in the age group of 18 to 19 years will constitute 2.88 per cent of the total number of voters as against a mere 0.75 per cent in that age group in 2009. With security concerns in Jammu and Kashmir, the northeast and the Naxalite-affected areas adding to the problems of logistics, the Election Commission of India has done well to stick to a relatively tight schedule while taking into account school examination dates — most of the polling stations will be housed in school buildings — and festival days. Stretching the election period beyond this would have been unfair to the voters and candidates, who will have to go through a gruelling campaign in the middle of another harsh Indian summer. Among the new features in this general election would be the introduction of the ‘none of the above’ option in the electronic voting machines, and the adoption of a voter verifiable paper audit trail system in some constituencies.
But the election to the 16th Lok Sabha will be remembered not for the logistic difficulties and the sheer size and magnitude of the exercise. After ten years of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance, this election will see corruption and governance as major issues, along with livelihood and safety concerns. The Bharatiya Janata Party, by announcing Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi as its prime ministerial candidate, is seeking to turn this election into a vote for a strong, able government that does not waver in decision-making. Unmistakably, the UPA coalition, with many of the allies pulling in different directions, and some of the Ministers caught in corruption cases, has come to be seen as weak and ineffectual. But also tapping into the voter fatigue with the UPA would be the new entrant, the Aam Aadmi Party, with its focus on institutionalised responses to ending corruption and delivering services. However, Indian elections have been known to throw up surprises. While there are clear favourites, and some dark horses, including those presenting themselves as the third alternative, India is too varied and fragmented a country for psephologists to make predictions with any degree of accuracy. Elections are also to be held to the Legislative Assemblies of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim. The Assembly of the new State of Telangana following the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh will have to be formed after the constitution of the new House. There is a lot to campaign for in the coming weeks.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/india-in-election-mode/article5753952.ece
6,3,2014,Smoothening out cross-LoC trade,"In January, trade across the Line of Control (LoC) came to a standstill after a truck driver from the Pakistan side of Kashmir was arrested on a charge of carrying 110 packets of brown sugar. About 48 trucks were stranded on the Indian side while 27 Indian trucks were held back, as Pakistan demanded that the driver be handed over so that the case could be investigated. It was argued that the driver could not be arrested given the terms of the trade and the fact that he enjoyed diplomatic immunity. Trade resumed over a month later. An extraordinary session of the Joint Working Group on Cross-LoC Confidence Building Measures (CBMs) on March 4 discussed the streamlining of standard operating procedures and introduction of scanners, and a suggestion that all stakeholders should be present at the loading and unloading points. The introduction of banking facilities would also help the trade, which is now conducted on barter basis. The bus service between the two sides of Kashmir had resumed on humanitarian grounds to avoid inconvenience to the people, even as the standoff continued.
Cross-LoC trade, which began in 2008 through Salamabad in Uri and Chakan-da-Bagh in Poonch district with two trade facilitation centres, is an important CBM, and both India and Pakistan need to learn the lessons from this episode. After an initial standoff, both sides did show a willingness to resume trade, but it is important to work out fool-proof systems to avoid any more rounds of a blame game. In the past, trade across the LoC has witnessed interference from armies from both sides, and tensions between the two countries also had their impact. For the CBM to work, there is a need to ensure the smooth flow of goods and also create an atmosphere conducive to the building of trust. If trucks and people from either side are treated with suspicion, it defeats the very purpose of a confidence building measure. Scanning the goods and initiating a joint mechanism to check them at crossing points, as has been proposed during the meeting of the JWG, would help. It should not take over a month of protracted discussions to restore normalcy. A prompt system of redress needs to be put in place so that livelihoods and cross-LoC travel are not held up while the two countries dispute threadbare the details of standard operating procedures as in this case. Neither should it be the case that an offence, if established beyond reasonable doubt, goes unpunished. Any future steps will have to incorporate measures that would prevent such incidents and tackle them without any disruption of trade or bus services.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/smoothening-out-crossloc-trade/article5753953.ece
7,3,2014,Elusive recovery,"Growth data released by the Central Statistics Office last week point to a >continuing economic slowdown and offer very little comfort to a government that is hoping to proclaim a recovery ahead of the elections. With no further data releases scheduled until May-end, the government will have to reckon with the fact that based on published figures it would be extremely difficult for the economy to clock a rate of even 5 per cent for the whole year. The >economy grew by 4.7 per cent in the quarter ending December, which was slightly better than the average of 4.6 per cent clocked during the first half of the year (April-September 2013). For the seventh successive quarter, >GDP growth has been below 5 per cent. Finance Minister P. Chidambaram in his recent budget speech expected economic growth during the second half of the year to be at least 5.2 per cent. That now seems a stupendous task given the slackness in the third quarter. The CSO’s advance estimates for 2013-14 released earlier of 4.9 per cent growth certainly does not look to be an underestimate as some government officials have been claiming. It ought to be quite disconcerting that having witnessed annual growth rates above 9 per cent in a few years during its two terms the UPA will be facing elections with the economy stuck in a sub-5 per cent growth trajectory.
A closer look at the third quarter data reveal some well-entrenched weaknesses in specific sectors. The investment scenario remains weak notwithstanding recent efforts by the government to fast-track certain large projects. There is an expected measure of uncertainty in decision-making ahead of the elections. Both mining and manufacturing declined in the three-month period. They have been weak throughout this year. Policy logjam and environmental and judicial activism have impacted adversely on mining output and this has had major negative consequences for the current account of the balance of payments. The outlook for the near future is not bright. Eight core industries which have more than one-third weight in the Index of Industrial Production, an important lead indicator, grew by just 1.6 per cent in January compared with 2.1 per cent in December. Exports are growing but at a slower pace during the three months up to January. Agriculture has done reasonably well while services, driven mainly by one sub-sector, personal community and social services — which is a proxy for government spending — picked up in the October-December quarter. GDP growth along with retail inflation and inflation expectations will figure prominently in the general election. Barring an unexpected turnaround, the government would seem to be on a weak wicket.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/elusive-recovery/article5757616.ece
7,3,2014,Cold War redux,"Russia’s de facto annexation of the Crimea — which President Vladimir Putin says is a humanitarian intervention — has exposed ugly motives all round. On February 22, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, panicking over public protests calling for early elections and a return to the 2004 Constitution, abandoned his violent crackdown on the protesters and fled the capital, Kiev. The national parliament voted to remove him from office and impeach him; Speaker Oleksander Turchynov took over as interim president, and the assembly decided to hold elections on May 25. Mr. Turchynov has since then made political appointments by decree, and some of his choices have extreme right-wing and anti-Semitic backgrounds. On March 1, Russian troops moved into the eastern province of Crimea, without facing any resistance; the Russian military had, in any case, retained their Sevastopol naval base and various airfields under an arrangement made after the Soviet Union was abolished in 1991; there are now 16,000 Russian troops in the region. The West could only watch as a candidate for EU and NATO membership faced what could end up as a Russian takeover, or partition, or possibly a new status on the front-line of a fresh Cold War.
The western Ukrainian public were shocked by revelations of Mr. Yanukovych’s kleptocracy, which funded an opulent mansion and a country estate with an artificial lake, a full-size replica galleon, and a zoo; their eastern compatriots, mainly ethnic Russians, seemed to be disturbed less by the arrival of Russian troops than by a new law from Kiev abolishing the official status of the Russian language in their area. Moreover, Mr. Yanukovych resurfaced in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don and, according to a Russian diplomat, said he had asked Moscow for help; the U.S. reaction had already bordered on the surreal, with Secretary of State John Kerry, apparently forgetful of his own country’s conduct over Iraq, telling Russia not to invade a sovereign state on a “trumped-up pretext.” Washington also needs EU support for sanctions against Moscow, but many EU countries reject sanctions. Secondly, several western governments are implicated in the Ukrainian crisis; some of Mr. Yanukovych’s assets are owned by British-registered companies. Thirdly, NATO has tried to implement detailed plans for former Soviet republics like Georgia and Ukraine to join it. Moscow sees that as highly provocative; furthermore, by acting through NATO, western governments are all but eliminating accountability to their own legislatures and publics. While the legality of the Russian moves in the Crimea is at best uncertain, the West for its part needs to learn the lessons of the Cold War.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/cold-war-redux/article5757615.ece
8,3,2014,Abuse of sedition law,"Cricket between India and Pakistan indeed incites great passion in both countries, and among the followers of the two teams patriotism often gets unduly mixed with the love for the game. However, for its sheer perversity and unreason, the action of the Meerut police in booking a group of students from Jammu and Kashmir on a charge of sedition beats all previous instances of the misuse of the penal provision. The ostensible ‘crime’ committed by the students seems to be that they cheered for the Pakistan cricket team during a closely fought one-day match against India and celebrated Pakistan’s victory. The charge of sedition under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code has been dropped, but only after the strong outrage evoked by this irrational act. Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah appealed to his counterpart in Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav, and described the invocation of grave offences unacceptably harsh. The only small comfort is that no student has yet been named in the first information report even though the charges of promoting enmity between different groups, under Section 153-A of the IPC and causing mischief (Section 427), remain. The Swami Vivekanand Subharti University, a private institution in Meerut, says it sent back Kashmiri students from the hostel where the incident took place as a precautionary measure to prevent the incident from being given a communal colour. While the University authorities claim they had not lodged a complaint, the district’s Senior Superintendent of Police says the police acted only on a complaint from its Registrar.
The reckless invoking of the grave charge of sedition for minor expressions of views that may be contrary to conventional notions of patriotism is an unacceptable affront to India’s democracy. The Supreme Court has made it clear that it cannot be invoked unless there is actual incitement to violence and intention to cause disorder, and that merely using words that indicate disaffection against the government cannot be termed sedition. The police officers who included Section 124A in the FIR appear to have no understanding of this aspect of the law. Nor did they take into account the adverse effect such a measure would have on the psyche of students and others from Kashmir residing or working elsewhere in the country. It was only recently that the Jammu and Kashmir cricket team was subjected to a midnight search of hotel rooms on the eve of a Ranji Trophy match in Jammu. The Uttar Pradesh government should take quick steps to drop the case and bring back the Kashmiri students to the same campus and let them resume their studies. Otherwise, this will be another ugly episode that will intensify the alienation of Kashmiris from the Indian mainstream.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/abuse-of-sedition-law/article5761462.ece
8,3,2014,One election for two States,"Andhra Pradesh goes to the polls as a united State, but the voters will in effect be electing two governments, one for Telangana and the other for the residual Andhra Pradesh. As the Assembly constituencies for Telangana have already been identified, there can be little confusion in the voters’ minds on this score. Indeed, the two regions are slated to vote on separate days: while the election to the Telangana region (119 Assembly constituencies) is to be held on April 30, the election to the rest of Andhra Pradesh, Seemandhra or the residual Andhra Pradesh State (175 constituencies), will be on May 7. Ideally, the bifurcation should have been completed before the election so that the process of dividing the legislature after its constitution could have been avoided. However, with Telangana slated to come into being as early as June 2, just a couple of weeks after the declaration of results, the division of the newly constituted House will have to be done immediately, and separate governments sworn in. The election is being held on the basis of the extent of Assembly constituencies as per the 2008 Delimitation Order. But more importantly, the total number of reserved (Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) seats in the State remains the same (31 in Telangana, including 12 for STs and 36 in residual Andhra Pradesh, including seven for STs). Given the requirement of ensuring adequate representation in proportion to the population of SCs and STs in each of the State units, this might change in the future.
With the bifurcation having taken up most of the political space in Andhra Pradesh, issues arising out of the creation of Telangana will dominate the election. In Telangana, the Telangana Rashtra Samiti, which spearheaded the statehood agitation, and the Congress, which is seen as the prime facilitator of the bifurcation, will undoubtedly make gains, especially if they fight as an alliance. In the Seemandhra region, parties that had tried to stall the bifurcation, including the Telugu Desam Party and the YSR Congress, will probably gain at the expense of the Congress. Even livelihood concerns are being framed within the debate on the bifurcation. Agricultural issues are seen in terms of sharing of water resources between the two regions, and employment and investment opportunities are seen as being either enhanced or limited depending on perceptions of access to Hyderabad after the bifurcation. The Telangana and Seemandhra regions are therefore sure to vote in very different ways. While the TRS is confined to Telangana, members of other parties that are active in both the regions are divided in their loyalties and will have to be walking a tight rope in their campaign.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/one-election-for-two-states/article5761464.ece
10,3,2014,A tragic mystery,"Two days after the disappearance of a Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777-200 aircraft, flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, even the debris has not been traced. It is suspected to have crashed into the South China Sea between Malaysia and Vietnam. Neither the fleet of ships and rescue vessels nor aircraft pressed into an emergency search operation has located any sign of wreckage at sea, except for an oil slick. The Malaysian authorities have taken the initiative to start an international investigation. With five of the 239 passengers and crew killed in the crash being Indians, the DGCA is also joining the probe. The one disturbing evidence on Day 1 of the investigation was that two of the passengers were travelling on fake, probably stolen, passports. But the authorities do not want to jump to the conclusion that it was an act of terrorism. The Boeing 777 has earned a reputation as a safe long-haul aircraft. After the 2013 Asiana Airlines crash, this is only the second tragedy involving this aircraft type in the nearly two decades it has been in operation. Malaysian Airlines will certainly want to get to the bottom of this tragedy in order to maintain its reputation for safety in a very competitive environment. Given the close cooperation in the Southeast Asian region, all the countries are pooling their resources to find the cause of the crash.
The only premise the investigators have begun with is that the end was “sudden and violent.” There was no report of bad weather and the aircraft was cruising at about 35,000 feet above sea level. The pilots did not radio for help and there was no emergency bleep. The plane just vanished from the radar hardly an hour after take-off. There is also the theory that it tried to turn back to Malaysia. Experts have offered several explanations. First on their list was structural failure in the fuselage, which could result in the splitting up of the body. The second was bad weather, of which there is no evidence. Was it an act of terror? And finally, could it have been the rare case of human failure or a suicidal streak? Until the debris is recovered, the investigation cannot proceed. Aviation experts are of the view that the size of the debris spread could provide a useful starting point for any serious investigation. That could give an indication whether the aircraft suffered an explosion, got split in the air, or just plunged into the sea and broke up. Once that is known, the investigators could proceed with a particular line of enquiry. Since there are no survivors, nothing can be verified as such. It is in the interests of all airlines, passengers and aircraft manufacturers to uncover the mystery behind this unfortunate tragedy and draw the lessons.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-tragic-mystery/article5767492.ece
10,3,2014,Accountability in focus,"Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa will have much to worry about when the 25th session of the UN Human Rights Council takes up the ‘report of the OHCHR on promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka’ on March 26. Despite the fact that the 47-member Council has 14 new members, including some known friends of Sri Lanka, such as China, Cuba, the Russian Federation and Saudi Arabia, the draft resolution submitted by the United States is forceful as it incorporates several new aspects: it includes ‘Human Rights’ in its title, elaborates upon the attacks on minorities, dwells on the importance of transitional justice and reparation policy, and asks the Sri Lankan government to broaden the scope of its national action plan based on its reconciliation commission, the LLRC. Though the draft resolution, ‘Promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka’, stops short of using the phrase “international investigation into war crimes” – a fact that has disappointed the Tamil diaspora and pro-LTTE elements in Tamil Nadu – Sri Lanka has no reason to feel let off the hook. The resolution “welcomes the High Commissioner’s recommendations and conclusions on the need for an independent and credible international investigation,” and asks the High Commissioner to “assess the progress toward accountability and reconciliation, to monitor relevant national processes, and to investigate alleged violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes by both parties in Sri Lanka.”
In effect, this gives the High Commissioner many tools to carry out her work. These are new mandates, and move up from the oral update that was given in the last session. And, from “encouraging” Sri Lanka to cooperate with the High Commissioner, the draft resolution steps up the tone and “calls upon” Sri Lanka to do so. Thus boxed in, Mr. Rajapaksa’s meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Nay Pyi Taw on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC summit on March 4 gained significance. Dr. Singh, who has steadfastly refused to visit Sri Lanka since the 2008 SAARC summit — while he has met his Pakistani counterpart more often — once again brought up the most critical issue that affects the Tamils of Sri Lanka’s Northern Province: the Army’s brazen occupation of vast areas of civilian land. Dr. Singh asked Mr.Rajapaksa to pare the Army presence in the North. No doubt, the mellow mood in the Sri Lankan ruling establishment comes from the realisation that slowly but steadily the UN Human Rights Council, and, by implication, the international community, is becoming tougher on the issue. In the long run, there is no escape from a credible investigation that establishes accountability. And the question of the political rights of Tamils remains to be addressed with a measure of seriousness and urgency.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/accountability-in-focus/article5767495.ece
11,3,2014,Who is the real Sena?,"By announcing support for Narendra Modi as Prime Minister, and at the same time releasing a list of candidates to contest against the Shiv Sena, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena leader Raj Thackeray achieved several things in one stroke. First, the MNS strongman sowed the seeds of discord in the alliance between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiv Sena. Quite understandably, Raj’s cousin, Uddhav Thackeray, who heads the Sena, is fuming over the development. The Sena would have been prepared for the MNS contesting against it in all the constituencies, but the party was taken aback by the meeting between former BJP president Nitin Gadkari and Raj Thackeray, which set the stage for the MNS deciding to support Mr. Modi for the prime ministership and to not field candidates in many of the seats where the BJP is in the fray. For the Sena, the very fact that the BJP was interested in any sort of an electoral understanding with the MNS was a cause for concern. Both the Sena and the MNS are targeting the same political constituency, the Maratha-Hindu chauvinist sections of the vote base; and with this move, the MNS got closer to its eventual political aim of replacing the Sena as the BJP’s ally in Maharashtra. Secondly, the MNS managed to give itself some relevance in the parliamentary election by committing the support of its MPs for Mr. Modi. Now, even without a direct alliance with the BJP, the MNS can hope not to be disadvantaged by any polarisation between the United Progressive Alliance and the National Democratic Alliance in the Lok Sabha election.
But the pact with the MNS will come at some cost to the BJP. Mr. Gadkari’s attempt to win over both the Sena and the MNS might help in the seats where the BJP is contesting, but his party cadre and sympathisers are bound to be confused in seats where the Sena is pitted against the MNS. Hardcore Sena sympathisers are bound to see the BJP as an untrustworthy ally, and this cannot but have implications for the prospects of the alliance. As for the MNS, the party seems to have made the best of a bad situation. Ever since its formation, the party has been forced to project itself as an extremist form of the Sena: a party that sought to replicate the politics of Maratha-Hindu chauvinistic violence of the old Shiv Sena of Bal Thackeray. The unwritten pact with the BJP gives the party some respectability. As the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party alliance takes on the BJP-Sena alliance in Maharashtra, the battle within the battle between the Sena and the MNS will be of keen interest. All that the MNS needs to do is one better than the Sena, and it could present itself as the “real” Sena and, in the long run, win over a huge section of its committed cadre.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/who-is-the-real-sena/article5770840.ece
11,3,2014,Nalanda is not about nostalgia,"It is only appropriate that a government that is actively seeking overseas collaboration in the arena of higher education should be steadfast in its support for an inclusive and ambitious model of global partnership. The Union Cabinet’s approval of the amendments proposed by a Standing Committee on External Affairs should settle once and for all the question of the status of Nalanda University — at Rajgir in Bihar — as an international institution. As per the proposed amendments, the preamble to the 2010 Act would characterise Nalanda unambiguously as “a non-state, non-profit, self-governing international institution.” Such a stipulation should put an end to attempts to depict the modern avatar of the historic centre of learning as a central university, thus saving the government the embarrassment of having to clarify its position to other participant-countries in this unique project. Indeed, the Standing Committee has proposed the insertion of a clear reference in the relevant law to the 2013 intergovernmental memorandum of understanding that has entered into force. Significantly, the latter provides for the involvement of any country that subscribes to the objectives of Nalanda. Russia, the United States, Australia and New Zealand have already expressed their commitment at various levels.
The transnational composition of the modern Nalanda was only to be expected. For the states of the second East Asia Summit (EAS) in 2007 saw the revival of this ancient seat of learning as being central to realising the concept of an Asian community and strengthening regional educational cooperation. A capacity to attract students and faculty from across geographical boundaries was one of the hallmarks of this great and ancient seat of learning. It would have therefore seemed rather odd for the architects of Nalanda’s new version appearing not keen to foster a cross-cultural and cosmopolitan spirit of intellectual and cultural exchange. In the context of the relatively backward State of Bihar, the creation of state-of-the-art infrastructure and improved overall connectivity would prove an immense boon. The University’s Chancellor, the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, has repeatedly emphasised his commitment to promoting the highest academic standards, as well as ensuring equity in the recruitment and admissions processes. These are worthy objectives that India’s public institutions generally, and those in the field of education in particular, must foster at every level. If indeed the 21st century is critical to the future of Asia, then Nalanda is potentially a great platform to create that future. It could prove no less a model for the promotion of international understanding.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/nalanda-is-not-about-nostalgia/article5770841.ece
12,3,2014,A state of flux,"The unfolding of multi-cornered contests for the 39 Lok Sabha constituencies in Tamil Nadu and the lone seat in neighbouring Puducherry, both of which go to the polls on April 24, as opposed to well-marked two or three-way fights in earlier elections, is an indication of a likely churn in the State’s politics. With these 40 seats that may make a crucial difference in the government-formation exercise in New Delhi, the uncertainty of outcomes that usually goes with such quadrangular or pentangular fights is bound to put Tamil Nadu on top of the pollsters’ radar screens in the coming days. As things stand today, the Jayalalithaa-led All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam is in maximalist mode, staking claim for all the 40 seats, leading an independent front, after it dramatically bid ‘goodbye’ to the main Left parties — the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India (Marxist). When the leaders of the CPI and the CPI(M), A.B. Bardhan and Prakash Karat, set much store by an alliance with the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu as part of a larger nationwide strategy to forge an ‘alternative’ to both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party to fight both corruption and communalism, the sudden collapse in seat-sharing talks came as a blow to the ‘third front’ idea. But the two veterans were quick to discount its fallout, declaring that the two Communist parties would jointly contest the election on a broad Left platform, even while squarely blaming the AIADMK for its ‘unilateral’ decision that gave rise to another formation.
At the other end of the spectrum, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam which quit the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance last year, made little headway in reworking power equations with a younger, Rahul Gandhi-driven Congress, more so after the DMK’s recent general council meeting which decided against any alliance with either the Congress or the BJP. The Congress at the Central level made little effort to rebuild ties with its former ally, leaving State Congress leaders demoralised. The DMK chief, M. Karunanidhi, sewed up a separate alliance with smaller parties including two Dalit parties. The DMK’s own list of 35 candidates, which featured the names of two controversial former Ministers, A. Raja and Dayanidhi Maran, was torn into by the patriarch’s elder son, M.K. Alagiri. The Congress enters the fray without any allies. The Aam Aadmi Party has not made any visible ripples in this overcrowded political space. The BJP for the first time is set to lead another big front, with the Vijayakant-led DMDK, the PMK and the MDMK. The State seems to be in for a fascinating five-cornered contest.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-state-of-flux/article5774391.ece
12,3,2014,Regulating stem cell therapy,"A revised set of guidelines on stem cell research was recently released by the Indian Council of Medical Research and the Department of Biotechnology, seven years after an earlier one was issued. Despite claiming that the revision was necessitated by a need to “reflect new scientific and clinical findings” that have changed the landscape of stem cell research being undertaken in the country and its possible translation, there is a glaring omission that reflects a lack of application of the mind. The guidelines make it abundantly clear that any use of stem cells in patients except to treat various haematological, immunological and metabolic disorders using haematopoietic stem cells should, by default, be considered as clinical trials. The exemption is on the grounds that the use of haematopoietic stem cells to treat the said disorders has been “established as a standard of medical care.” Of course, the use of bone marrow (containing haematopoietic stem cells) to treat diseases like leukaemia has been in vogue in India since the 1960s. But what has been overlooked in the new guidelines is that treating damaged corneas by limbal transplantation for limbal stem cell deficiency should also be considered as an established method of care; limbal stem cells are transplanted from the healthy eye to the damaged eye of the same patient to treat an affected cornea. No other alternative method is currently available to treat such cases. For the last few years, a handful of tertiary eye hospitals in India have been treating such cases using limbus stem cells; since 2001, one institute alone has treated nearly 1,000 patients. Though the use of limbus stem cells is not as old as haematopoietic stem cells, about 1,500 patients with corneal damage have been treated so far; there is also sufficient evidence to prove its safety. Hence, there is a compelling reason for the ICMR and the DBT to apply the same yardstick and correct the anomaly.
Though belated, the decision to call all the untested “therapies” offered to gullible people as clinical trials is indeed commendable. This would end the rampant exploitation of patients by some doctors. Many untested and unproven stem cell treatments are being offered as a magic bullet for many types of diseases and conditions. Similarly, several untested techniques to separate, grow and expand specific stem cells are available in the country. Besides failing to produce the promised benefits, there is a real possibility of causing greater harm to patients when stem cells are manipulated in the laboratory. But with many clinics and hospitals already offering stem sell therapy for a wide variety of conditions, it remains to be seen how swiftly they can be regulated under the new guidelines.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/regulating-stem-cell-therapy/article5774392.ece
19,3,2014,The importance of Uttar Pradesh,"With the Bharatiya Janata Party deciding to field its prime minister-in-waiting, Narendra Modi, from Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh has, unsurprisingly, become the focus of interest in this election. For long, it was an article of faith with pundits that the road to Delhi lay via U.P. The Congress under P.V. Narasimha Rao broke the myth; it won just five of 84 Lok Sabha seats from U.P. in the 1991 general election but nonetheless went on to form a government at the Centre. And yet, the sheer size of U.P. meant that the major political parties would continue to place the State at the centre of their electoral calculations. For the BJP especially, U.P. has been a high-stakes State with its overall electoral fortunes tied to its seat tally from here. The party held sway over U.P. right through the heady Ram mandir phase, winning 50-plus seats from the State in the general elections of 1991, 1996 and 1998. The party’s electoral graph soared in tandem with its performance in U.P, and in 1998 it formed a coalition government at the Centre on the back of an incredible tally of 57 seats from the State. The critical importance of U.P. in the BJP’s electoral and government-formation calculations can be gauged from the fact that, in all, the BJP won only 181 seats in that election.
The BJP’s remarkable run ended in the 1999 general election, with the party’s seat tally from U.P. plunging to a decadal low of 29. That year the BJP returned to power helped by its bandwagon of allies, but by 2004 its luck had run out. Over the past decade, the BJP has hit rock bottom in U.P., coinciding with the spectacular rise of the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party. The coming of Mr. Modi has placed the BJP once again in top league, and indeed opinion polls uniformly suggest a U.P. seat tally for it in the region of 35 to 40 — a remarkable potential upswing in fortunes for a party seemingly without a hope until recently. It helps Mr. Modi that he has arrived at a time of deep despair with the incumbent United Progressive Alliance government. The UPA’s 10-year incumbency and the policy paralysis and corruption witnessed during its second term appear to have combined to push Mr. Modi to the forefront in this election. However, no election is won till it is won. And Mr. Modi faces a new challenge in the form of the indefatigable Arvind Kejriwal. The Aam Aami Party’s convener has already raised the pitch by relentlessly attacking the Gujarat Model. With his possible emergence as a candidate from Varanasi, the holy city is bound to witness a David versus Goliath battle. Mr. Modi’s entry, and its sheer size, have restored to Uttar Pradesh a pre-eminent position in this election.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-importance-of-uttar-pradesh/article5801641.ece
19,3,2014,Far from resolved,"Environment Minister Veerappa Moily’s decision to allow field trials of genetically modified food crops marks a major shift in official policy on a highly contentious issue. That he would make a departure from the stand adopted by his two immediate predecessors was clear from his replies to questions in Parliament: a week before the formal announcement, Mr. Moily told the Rajya Sabha that field trials were necessary to generate biosafety data, and a common affidavit covering various Ministries would be filed by the government in the Supreme Court, which is considering the issue of allowing trials. Governments the world over have been torn between passionate, unreasoning opposition from activists and the callous push and greed of seed companies. Since these modified plant species are of relatively recent origin, data on biosafety are still not accepted as conclusive or comprehensive. The question of their superiority over hybrids is also a matter of debate. From the farmers’ perspective, there is fear of commercial monopolies in agriculture — wherever GM crops are linked to intellectual property rights or commercial contracts, restrictions on use and the prospect of litigation come into play. This is an important dimension in India, which has a large number of small farms. Moreover, the GM foods industry claims transgenic plant varieties are safe on the one hand, but fiercely opposes labelling of products as such.
The UPA government has in its last days permitted field trials of GM food crops on the ground that there is no court injunction in force, but a transparent regulatory mechanism that is neither blindly obstructionist nor unduly permissive and which does not needlessly delay decisions needs to be put in place. The Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India Bill, 2013 will lapse with the dissolution of the Lok Sabha even as the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science, Technology and Environment on the legislation is awaited. Now that Lok Sabha elections are coming up, a decision on the future of GM foods will rest with a new government. At least 18 different varieties of GM crops including rice, wheat, maize, sugarcane and vegetables are officially in the pipeline. The key questions that must be answered while considering grant of permission for their production is their impact on health and the environment; the farming community must also be given a hearing. Scientific assessments must be independent of the proponents of GM agriculture, notably commercial entities. What this underscores is the importance of instituting a regulatory mechanism before permission is granted for work outside laboratories. It is equally vital that in a country with a diverse agricultural heritage, traditional seed varieties are not wiped out by monoculture.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/far-from-resolved/article5801638.ece
20,3,2014,A three-horse race in Bihar,"Until June last year, Nitish Kumar was Bihar’s tallest leader, the hero who lifted the State from its crushing poverty and rewrote its destiny. Under his chief ministership, Bihar transformed itself from a basket case to one of India’s fastest-growing economies. When Mr. Kumar broke up with the Bharatiya Janata Party, his ally of many years, it was in the belief that the BJP needed him more than he needed that party. However, almost in the blink of an eye, the wheel of fortune was reversed, and today, on the eve of the general election, the Janata Dal(United) leader is judged to be fighting with his back to the wall. With the collapse of the successful BJP-JD(U) alliance, Bihar looks poised for a three-way contest featuring two alliances and the JD(U) on its own. A surprise recent development has been the joining of forces between the BJP and the Ram Vilas Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party. Mr. Paswan was considered a sure bet for inclusion in the Congress-Rashtriya Janata Dal alliance, and indeed this pact had been treated as a given, till the LJP leader made the switch. The LJP’s long-standing relationship with the RJD aside, it was the first party to quit the National Democratic Alliance protesting the Gujarat anti-Muslim violence of 2002.
The LJP will hardly qualify as a heavyweight, and yet its return to the NDA under Narendra Modi carries a symbolism beyond the party’s size if only because the move is seen to have ended the Gujarat Chief Minister’s political isolation. It is apparent enough that, as in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh Mr.Modi’s stars are on the ascendant in Bihar; besides drawing good crowds, he appears to have rejigged the caste coalition that made the JD(U) and the BJP a winning combination. The JD(U) and the BJP were a perfect fit with the former’s backward caste base complementing the BJP’s support among forward castes. The split was expected to favour Mr. Kumar but the opposite seems to have happened, with Mr. Modi managing to dent the Bihar Chief Minister’s backward caste support. Mr. Kumar’s articulated opposition to Mr. Modi has made him a natural part of the ‘third alternative’, but in Bihar itself he seems to have overestimated the dividends from targeting the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate. In an added advantage to the BJP and Mr. Modi, the Muslim vote looks set to be split between the JD(U) and the RJD-Congress alliance. Mr. Kumar seems unfazed, undoubtedly because of his conviction that he took a morally correct stand. Whatever his fate in the election, Mr. Kumar’s real test will come 18 months from now — when he faces the Assembly election. For now, the BJP seems in the lead with the anti-Modi vote splintering between the JD(U) and the RJD-Congress.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-threehorse-race-in-bihar/article5806316.ece
20,3,2014,Issues of corporate governance,"If you are a multinational company with a foreign subsidiary that contributes more to your bottomline than even your home business, general wisdom would be that you handle the subsidiary and its issues with care. Not so with Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC), which is now embroiled in a controversy over a plan to set up a car plant in Gujarat as a fully owned subsidiary when it already has Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, where it owns a little over half the equity. Maruti’s royalty payment to SMC last year was higher than the Japanese corporation’s net profit derived from its business in Japan, and Maruti is the market leader in the Indian car market. Yet, SMC came up with a proposal that is adverse to Maruti’s minority shareholders. Confronted by adverse reaction from the market and institutional and retail investors alike, the multinational has now watered down the proposal and also said it will seek the consent of the minority shareholders as envisaged under Section 188 of the new Companies Act. SMC has also clarified that the cost of the new plant will be funded by depreciation and by its equity contribution. Should the contract-manufacturing agreement between the two end, the plant will be transferred to Maruti at book value and not fair market value, as was first decided. So far, so good.
The basic question, however, has not been answered, and that is: why does SMC want to go it alone when it has a 56.21 per cent subsidiary in Maruti Suzuki? The question becomes more relevant if you consider that Maruti has Rs.7,500 crore of free cash idling on its balance-sheet, earning about half of what the company earns as return on its capital employed. This is the point that some minority shareholders are still unhappy about, and the company has not answered the question. The issue is one of corporate governance especially because the creation of a wholly owned subsidiary when a partly owned one exists can lead to conflict of interest. It could also lead to tricky transfer pricing issues in transactions between the wholly owned subsidiary and the parent given that Maruti will be taking the cars produced by the new plant at cost. There is the fear among Maruti’s minority shareholders — not entirely misplaced — that in course of time the company will be reduced to a marketing unit selling cars produced by the wholly owned subsidiary. The role of institutional investors, including FIIs, will be critical to the fate of the resolution when it is put up for vote. Shareholder displeasure being justified, the Life Insurance Corporation of India, which is the single-largest shareholder after SMC with 6.93 per cent stake, should take the lead and vote down SMC’s proposal for being unfair to minority shareholders.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/issues-of-corporate-governance/article5806315.ece
21,3,2014,Rumblings over constituencies,"By every account, the projection of Narendra Modi as the next Prime Minister has catapulted the Bharatiya Janata Party from nowhere to number one position in the coming general election. But try as it might, the BJP has not been able to paper over its own internal dissensions coinciding with the rising national profile of the Gujarat Chief Minister. Over the past year, Mr. Modi has incrementally asserted his authority within the BJP, bolstered by his popularity with the rank and file and the overt support he has got from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The Gujarat Chief Minister’s reputation as a unilateralist precedes him, and his promotion to prime ministerial candidate has reinforced the impression that he would have his way even at the cost of injuring the self-respect of party elders, even those who have made stellar contributions to its growth. The BJP’s founder-leader, L.K. Advani, has been overruled time and again, and Sushma Swaraj, with an impressive record in Parliament, has not fared any better.
Mr. Modi was elevated to prime minister-in-waiting over the objections of Mr. Advani. The internal discomfiture has been especially evident during ticket allotment, with little deference shown to veterans. Ms. Swaraj has publicly objected to the party ticket going to tainted candidates, and Murli Manohar Joshi has barely concealed his annoyance at being summarily evicted from the Varanasi seat to make way for Mr. Modi. Admittedly, it is the prerogative of the prime ministerial nominee to contest from a place of his choice. It is also reasonable to expect that Mr. Modi’s candidature from the holy city would favourably impact the party’s prospects in the Hindi belt. But Mr. Joshi appears to have been offended not so much by his having to vacate the Varanasi seat as by the manner in which the mission was accomplished. Mr. Advani has been refused a transfer to Bhopal on the grounds that he has won five consecutive elections from Gandhinagar in Gujarat. But if that was indeed the case, there was no reason for the party’s Central Election Committee led by Mr. Modi to have deferred announcing his name until Mr. Advani, in frustration, asked for a change. It was evident that the former Deputy Prime Minister felt more secure about contesting from Bhopal which falls in the friendlier domain of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. In the event, it took an entire day of drama and much coaxing and cajoling by BJP president Rajnath Singh before Mr. Advani of his own accord agreed to stay back in Gandhinagar. As Mr. Modi forges ahead in the electoral race, he will do well to ensure that his own party is on board with him.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rumblings-over-constituencies/article5810995.ece
21,3,2014,Cerén at the helm,"The leftist and former rebel leader Sánchez Cerén, of the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN), has won the presidency of El Salvador by no more than 6,364 votes, gaining 50.11 per cent of the March 9 poll. He defeated Norman Quijano of the right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA), whose vote-share was 49.89 per cent. The new President, whose deputy will be Oscar Samuel Ortíz, led the campaign by 18 per cent at one time, but the ARENA team’s adoption of a sustained smear campaign against him saw the lead all but eliminated by election day. The losers repeatedly alleged fraud and even seemed to threaten a military coup; they then demanded that the result be annulled, but the electoral court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to support their claim that the election was rigged; international observers and the State Department in Washington have said the elections were free and fair. Mr. Cerén will succeed his FMLN colleague Mauricio Funes on June 1 for a five-year term lasting until June 1, 2019; despite being hated by the country’s political right, he has committed himself to reconciliation and to governing on behalf of all Salvadorans. Yet, collaboration may be impossible after ARENA’s vitriolic attacks on him.
That could have serious consequences, because El Salvador is yet to recover from a terrible civil war which lasted from 1980 to 1992, during which the army, backed by the United States and the landed elite, tried to crush FMLN, who were supported by the majority of the population. The conflict claimed over 80,000 lives and left 12,000 missing, and an amnesty law has left survivors bitter. The Inter-America Court of Human Rights has, however, ruled the amnesty illegal, and imminent Salvadoran Supreme Court rulings may result in charges against former military officers as well as an investigation into the 1981 El Mozote massacre, when the army allegedly killed 800 civilians. The mistrust and suspicion which divide the country are nevertheless worsened by gang violence which accounts for nine murders a day on average. FMLN’s unique and wide programme of social measures includes preventive and rehabilitative justice, but everyday life is still dangerous and insecure. Mr. Cerén will be further constrained by the current total ban on abortion, which the powerful Catholic Church adamantly backs in this conservative society. The fact remains, however, that FMLN has a renewed centre-left mandate like those that voters in other Latin American countries have approved; although the opposition ARENA has a narrow majority in the legislative assembly, Mr. Cerén may now feel more confident in the run-up to next year’s legislative assembly elections.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/cern-at-the-helm/article5810997.ece
22,3,2014,The message from speedy trials,"If there is one message in the Mumbai Sessions Court’s judgment in the Shakti Mills gang rape cases, it is that the pervasive cynicism about the country’s criminal justice system, especially in rendering justice to victims of sexual violence, may not always be justified. The verdict of Judge Shalini S. Phansalkar-Joshi, sentencing four convicts to life terms for the gang rape of a telephone operator in the abandoned mill compound eight months ago, is noteworthy for meting out speedy justice as well as for imposing the maximum punishment available in law under the recently amended and strengthened penal provisions. There was much shock and anger when a photo-journalist was sexually assaulted by a group of youngsters, including a juvenile, on August 22 last year. The fact that she went to the police immediately encouraged another woman, the telephone operator, to come forward and disclose that she too had been gang-raped some weeks earlier at the same spot. A key response of the government after the Delhi gang rape of December 2012 was to amend the penal provisions relating to sexual violence. The Shakti Mills episode provided an opportunity to the judiciary to make use of the provision for enhanced punishment. It is significant that the judge has sentenced the four convicts under Section 376D, which deals with gang rape, to the maximum punishment of imprisonment for the remainder of their natural life. The sentence in the second incident involving the photo-journalist has been deferred after the prosecutor, invoking Section 376E, which provides for the death penalty for repeat offenders, demanded capital punishment. Three of the convicts participated in both the crimes, but it is debatable whether there is any case for awarding death, when life-long incarceration, which comes with the possibility of repentance and introspection, can serve the ends of justice.
There were moments in the last year or so when many believed that the national outcry since December 2012 may have been in vain, as sexual crimes continued to be reported, and no part of the country seemed safe for women. Yet, even if the larger malaise of sexual violence against women appears entrenched in society, it is of some comfort to know that there is no question of impunity. There is a fair degree of certitude now that timely complaints and disclosures would help the police to undertake a proper investigation, while public opinion and activism keep the issue alive so that the case is not derailed at the trial stage. As the Shakti Mills trials demonstrate, the way forward is in fostering trust in the system of criminal administration by efficient investigation and speedy trials.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-message-from-speedy-trials/article5815825.ece
22,3,2014,Road to urban future,"The grim future of cities played out in Paris recently. Smog wrapped the city and air pollution increased beyond safe limits. Pollutants, particularly particulate matter measuring less than 10 micrometre in diameter (PM) reached unsafe levels of 180 micrograms per cubic metre, against the WHO’s permissible limit of 50 micrograms per cubic metre (24-hour mean). Though bad weather contributed to this high concentration, the principal cause, as is often the case, was increased fuel emission. The city authorities had to take drastic steps to reduce pollution since prolonged inhaling of particulate matter would cause respiratory diseases, lung cancer and cardiovascular ailments. They imposed restrictions on the use of cars, permitting vehicles with odd and even number plates to ply only on alternate dates and encouraging shared use of cars. People were allowed to use buses, Metro rail and other public transport, besides shared bicycles, free of charge during weekends. The reasoning was that restrictions and incentives would encourage commuters to shift to public transport, thus reducing pollution. Initial reports indicated that these measures worked, and congestion had come down by 60 per cent. Free use of public transport cost the city about $5.5 million a day, but considering the public-health interest it was a necessary investment.
There is a lesson or two here for Indian cities. The Central Pollution Control Board has listed more than 70 cities that have violated ambient air quality standards. Places such as Delhi and Ludhiana have unacceptable levels of PM — 198 and 259 micrograms per cubic metre respectively. Mitigation efforts thus far have been limited to improving the fuel efficiency of vehicles. Enhancing emission norms is necessary, but equally critical is the need to increase the use of public transport. Delhi is a case in point. The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority for the Delhi region, in a recent report, stated that all gains made by converting buses and three-wheelers to Compressed Natural Gas have been lost to a rapid increase in the number of private vehicles. The level of particulate matter has increased substantially over the years. Though various urban policies have stated that public transport is a priority, on the ground, investments have not matched intentions. The modal share of public transport has steadily declined in the large cities. It is only in recent years that State governments are trying to increase transport options by building metro rail networks. This alone may not deliver. Integrating city functions with transport plans and encouraging non-motorised transport such as cycling are also critical. The future of Indian cities is inextricably tied to the improvement of public transport.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/road-to-urban-future/article5815821.ece
28,3,2014,"Judged by deeds, not words","Election manifestos of political parties tend to promise all things to all people. Promises cost nothing, and most manifestos would typically have some takeaways for the rich, the middle class and the poor in varying proportions. Predictably, the Congress election manifesto makes no radical break from the past. The aam aadmi is not mentioned specifically, presumably because the term was hijacked by the Aam Aadmi Party, but she is very much present in the manifesto. The aam aadmi comprises the worlds of both the middle class and the poor, and the Congress manifesto with promises of creating 10 crore jobs, providing a job quota for the economically weaker sections without affecting the existing caste-based reservation, and establishing rights to health, housing, pension and social security, seeks to coalesce the two worlds. The effort, the manifesto clearly states, is to lift the bottom two-thirds of the population — “the skilled hands that build India” — into the middle class by ensuring economic security and minimum standards of living. This is part of the rights-based approach to development that the United Progressive Alliance governments adopted through legislation on the rights to information, education, and food in the last ten years. Of course, there is no mention of how these schemes would find their funding, but then, a manifesto is not a budget, and election promises are not generally taken as more than statements of intent.
If the poor and the middle class were wooed with a rights-based welfare agenda, the corporate houses and the managerial class could take comfort from the manifesto’s stress on a high growth trajectory; investment in power, transport and other development infrastructure of one trillion dollars over one decade; and avoidance of retroactive taxation, which was seen as deterring foreign investment. But if the Congress were to be judged by its manifesto alone, it would have no problem at all. Unlike the principal Opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, and the energetic new party, the AAP, the Congress would be judged by its performance in government in the last decade, and not by the promises it holds out. The party’s record is enough to take the shine off many of the promises listed in the manifesto. Some of the promises made in previous manifestos that remain unfulfilled have found mention again. The promise of affirmative action for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the private sector thus rings hollow. A party that was at the head of the government for the last 10 years should have fought the election on achievements, not promises. Words cannot always make up for performance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/judged-by-deeds-not-words/article5840453.ece
28,3,2014,The MH 370 mystery,"The sighting of objects that could be debris from Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, about 2,500 km from Perth, brings partial closure to the mystery over the missing aircraft. The Boeing 777 disappeared on March 8 when it was headimg for Beijing from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board. The theories surrounding the flight vanishing from radars across South East Asia will be put to rest only when the black box or other evidence is recovered from the depths of the southern Indian Ocean where the plane is supposed to have plunged. Recovery of debris is difficult here. This part of the Ocean, about two miles deep in places, is home to the ‘roaring forties’ where wind speeds routinely range between 30 and 40 mph, and witnesses some of the largest waves. As for the aircraft’s disappearance, one hypothesis advanced is that the plane’s transponders, the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, and radio failed more or less at the same time. But experts say it is highly improbable that the systems malfunctioned without any attempt being made to convey distress and that, at the same time, the plane continued flying without being detected for hours after that. The other speculation is that the crew changed the course. This theory gains credibility because the plane made three course changes and two altitude changes. Changing course mid-way needs human intervention. Available evidence indicates a deliberate act on the part of the pilot or the co-pilot. A multinational team led by Australia, and with experts and resources from 26 countries, is working to get to the bottom of the issue.
Usually, after every such disaster new regulations are put in place to ensure that safety, navigation and tracking technologies are foolproof, and that mistakes do not recur. The Boeing 777, which entered service in 1995, is the workhorse of many airlines across the world. It has an enviable safety record — the only crash that resulted in a few fatalities has been that of an Asiana flight in San Francisco in 2013. The Malaysian disaster will end up focussing more on the people who operate the machines. Psychiatrists say a test will not reveal a person’s intentions if he or she chooses not to answer queries honestly. In an era where safety cannot be taken for granted, it is vital for experts in security, technology, transportation and manufacturing to sit together and spell out concrete proposals to make air travel safer. Apart from delivering on technological solutions, experts may now have to factor in the airworthiness of commercial airline crew – spread over, on an average, 52 aircraft worldwide every minute. The search for and the investigation of MH370 should provide some clues to what needs to be done to safeguard against both technical flaws and human subversion.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-mh-370-mystery/article5840456.ece
29,3,2014,A chance to cleanse the game,"The Supreme Court order appointing former Indian cricket captain Sunil Gavaskar as interim head of the Board of Control for Cricket in India to manage the affairs of the Indian Premier League this year ought to be welcomed by players, administrators and fans alike. The order seeks to strike a pragmatic balance between addressing the malaises highlighted by the scandal that hit the IPL’s sixth edition and allowing the highly popular tournament to remain on the country’s cricket calendar without impairment. A happy outcome for cricket is the removal of N. Srinivasan, who had refused to step down as president of the Board despite his position becoming untenable long ago. The order thus removes the element of bias in the ongoing inquiry into the allegations of betting and spot-fixing in IPL. It also addresses the conflict of interest between Mr. Srinivasan’s role in India Cements, the owner of a franchise, and as head of the national cricket body. It has directed that none associated with India Cements should be part of the BCCI. The Board will be managed by two former Test cricketers — Shivlal Yadav, who will discharge the BCCI president’s functions, and Mr. Gavaskar, whose role will be limited to IPL operations this year. Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals, the two franchises embroiled in the scandal, will stay in the tournament.
The people who should take the blame for the game reaching such a pass that the country’s highest court has had to intervene and make arrangements to run cricket without taint or suspicion, are without doubt Mr. Srinivasan and his colleagues on the Board. The Board displayed laxity in implementing anti-corruption measures and responded to the crisis set off by revelations of spot-fixing with equivocation, obfuscation and intransigence. It tried to paper over the scandal by appointing an inquiry panel that the Mumbai High Court declared illegal. Captain M.S. Dhoni, tainted by obvious conflict of interest, joined the chorus before the Supreme Court-appointed Mukul Mudgal Committee that Gurunath Meiyappan was not the owner or principal of CSK, but only a cricketing enthusiast. Hopefully, the tenure of Mr. Yadav and Mr. Gavaskar, however brief, will be an opportunity to clean up the BCCI’s affairs. By disclosing his interest in advance — that he had a contract as a commentator with the BCCI — the ace batsman has got off the mark with a touch of credibility. To meet the challenges ahead, he needs to bring to his latest role the qualities he had displayed on the field — the discretion to evade a barrage of bouncers, the courage to carry on without the protection of a helmet and the instinct to know where his off-stump is.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-chance-to-cleanse-the-game/article5845208.ece
29,3,2014,A mandate for the UNHRC,"In adopting a country-specific resolution against Sri Lanka that calls upon the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner to “undertake a comprehensive investigation into alleged serious violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes by both parties in Sri Lanka,” the UN Human Rights Council has again brought the focus as much on the killings in the last phase of the civil war in Sri Lanka, as on the international investigation into issues in a sovereign state. No progress has been made to fix responsibility for the mass killings in the last phase of the civil war in 2009. The resolution, co-sponsored by 41 countries and piloted by the U.S., contended that Sri Lanka has failed to achieve reconciliation following the end of the three-decade long civil war. But it does not build on the earlier resolutions against Sri Lanka; it rather marks a worrying point of departure. So far, the emphasis has been on ‘encouraging’ and ‘urging’ Sri Lanka. The new mandate of the international investigative mechanism is open-ended. Opponents of the resolution were against the imposition of an international investigation by expanding the role of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), and the Special Procedures of the HRC. The resolution includes many prescriptive elements. The U.S. sees the vote as an act that seeks to push Sri Lanka into pursuing lasting peace, and wants to drive home the point that justice and accountability cannot wait.
India was in the limelight at the 25th session of the HRC. It had unconditionally backed Sri Lanka in the 2009 session, soon after the end of the war. It went to the other extreme and voted against Sri Lanka in 2012 and 2013. In fact, in 2013 it even worked to make the language of the resolution harsher. The same conditions as in 2013 exist now: elections to the Northern provincial council were held in September 2012. The Tamil Nadu factor that had influenced India’s vote the last time round seems to have lost steam with the Congress and the DMK parting ways. In any case, it is debatable if even at its height it would have overcome India’s long-standing opposition to intrusive international investigations as envisaged by the latest resolution. By voting twice against Sri Lanka in the past years, India had already antagonised the majority Sinhala community. With India abstaining this time, the northern Tamils seem to have lost faith in India. Not many believe anything will change for Tamils in Sri Lanka if the OHCHR carries out the investigation. An intrusive investigation has so far not yielded genuine reconciliation, and a life of dignity and self-respect for people anywhere. Sri Lanka can’t be any different.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-mandate-for-the-unhrc/article5845210.ece
31,3,2014,An unequal contest,"Varanasi’s magnified importance this election season obviously stems from the presence in the fray of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s prime ministerial candidate. In the event, the arrival of Arvind Kejriwal as Narendra Modi’s challenger has added plenty of drama and excitement to a contest increasingly projected as one between David and Goliath. In theory, and possibly in actuality too, Mr. Modi has all but won the election. Mr. Modi comes into the battle backed not just by the BJP, in itself a party of considerable means, but additionally by the formidable campaign machinery of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Mr. Kejriwal, on the other hand, is the proverbial little man with no resources bar his spunk and daring. In the Delhi Assembly election, too, the Aam Aadmi Party had made its financial bankruptcy its USP, deliberately placing itself as the underdog pitted in an unequal race with the Big Two, the Congress and the BJP. However, unlike at that time, today the AAP chief carries the baggage of having hurriedly dumped the first-ever government he formed in Delhi, thus betraying his pre-poll promise to usher in systemic reform. Indeed, the BJP’s narrative, bought into by a large enough section of voters, is that Mr. Kejriwal ran away from responsibility and therefore does not deserve a second chance.
Curiously, the counter-view that Mr. Kejriwal sacrificed his chief ministership to uphold a principle, has takers as well, and this group appears to be made up largely of people on the margins — Muslims, sections of Dalits and the economically poor. What makes this election riveting is the seeming clash between the larger picture, which is of Mr. Modi winning the seat on the back of a phenomenal wave all across Uttar Pradesh, and the smaller, fragmented stories featuring underclass resistance. Mr. Kejriwal’s strategy is obviously to motivate the alienated sections into understanding the power of their numbers so as to consolidate themselves as a force against Mr. Modi. However, this is easier said than accomplished given the potential of other contestants to queer the pitch. Rival parties such as the Congress, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party will be loath to fielding weak candidates against Mr. Modi, lest that seem like handing him a walkover. The Muslim community may be divided by the likely candidature of a powerful local leader, Mukhtar Ansari of the Quami Ekta Dal. The Varanasi competition is also skewed in favour of Mr. Modi by the AAP’s logistical constraints in fighting a Lok Sabha election, which involves money, manpower and booth management skills. Mr. Modi’s biggest strength, of course, is the perception that he is the man of the moment, the leader on the cusp of power.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-unequal-contest/article5851815.ece
31,3,2014,Striving for a polio-free world,"The polio-free certification given by the World Health Organisation to its 11-nation South-East Asia Region, which includes India, has become a beacon of hope at a time when there is much to be gloomy about in terms of ridding the world of a virus that has crippled and even killed countless children. When the nations of the world committed themselves to eradicating polio in 1988, it was a goal they intended to achieve by the year 2000. But the target date slipped repeatedly. The strategic plan approved last year aims to stop transmission of all naturally-occurring ‘wild’ polio viruses by the end of this year and complete the task of eradication by 2018. The first of those objectives appears to be in jeopardy. Polio cases worldwide during 2013 recorded an 82 per cent increase over the previous year. Although the polio-endemic countries of Afghanistan and Nigeria more than halved the number of polio cases last year, Pakistan registered a 60 per cent increase. “The current situation in Pakistan is a powder keg that could ignite widespread polio transmission,” warned the Independent Monitoring Board, a body established to evaluate global eradication efforts, in a letter sent in February 2014 to the WHO Director-General, Margaret Chan. Worse still, the virus has reappeared in countries that had been free of it. Viruses from Pakistan have surfaced in the Middle East, and those from Nigeria produced a resurgence of polio in the Horn of Africa.
The virus could well find its way to more countries, and the situation is serious. Dr. Chan has called a meeting next month of an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations to advise on measures to reduce the risk of further international spread. One such step could be the compulsory vaccination of travellers from polio-infected areas. India recently made it mandatory that those coming from countries with polio produce a certificate of vaccination with an oral polio vaccine. As long as the virus circulates in any part of the world, all countries free of it need to be vigilant and stop it from getting a foothold in their territory. Despite the current unpromising outlook for global polio eradication, it would be unwise to give up in despair. As recently as in 2009, almost half the world's polio cases were occurring in this country. Yet, India had its last polio case just two years later, paving the way for the South-East Asia Region’s certification. As the Americas, Western Pacific and Europe have already received such certification, four out of five children in the world now live in countries that have eliminated polio. The global community must find the will and the means to end this scourge once and for all.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/striving-for-a-poliofree-world/article5851816.ece
1,4,2014,Final reprieve for Bhullar,"The story of Devendar Pal Singh Bhullar is truly extraordinary. Condemned to death thrice in the past, he has now obtained a final reprieve from the Supreme Court, thanks to the humanitarian jurisprudence on clemency evolved by it in recent times. With the Court giving him the benefit of its January 21, 2014 verdict, the man convicted of killing nine persons and wounding 17 others in a car bomb attack in Delhi in 1993, will not be executed. His death sentence stands commuted to life on two grounds — that there was an unexplained delay of eight years in disposing of his mercy petition, and that he suffers from mental illness. The verdict was only to be expected, as both these grounds figure among the supervening circumstances for commutation listed by the Supreme Court in January in Shatrughan Chauhan vs Union of India. There were at least three days in Bhullar’s life that appeared to indicate that his fate was sealed: March 22, 2002, when the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence against him; June 13, 2011, when the President’s rejection of his mercy petition was communicated to the prison authorities; and April 12, 2013, when the Supreme Court upheld the President’s order. Rarely do cases get reopened after reaching finality in both the appellate and review jurisdictions of the Supreme Court. Yet, such was the scope of the relief envisioned in Shatrughan Chauhan that the Attorney General conceded that this death sentence was liable for commutation in the light of the principles enunciated in that verdict.
The question that arises now is whether there is any aspect of clemency, or constitutional limitation on imposing the irreversible penalty of death, that remains to be settled by the Supreme Court. One aspect that the Court will probably take note of some day in an appropriate case is whether difference of opinion among judges in the appellate court can be a ground for commutation. In Bhullar’s case, the death sentence imposed on him by the Designated Court was upheld by the Supreme Court by a majority of two judges to one. And the dissenting judge did not differ just on the sentence: he acquitted him, holding that the accused could not be convicted solely on the basis of a statement recorded by a police officer. While considering his review petition, the Bench was divided two-one on the effect of this difference of opinion, with the majority holding that one dissent could not be a ground to review the verdict. Questions on the irreversible harm caused by a possible doubtful or mistaken conviction will keep cropping up as long as the death penalty remains on the statute book, helping the judiciary fine-tune and humanise the body of law on death and mercy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/final-reprieve-for-bhullar/article5855800.ece
1,4,2014,Message from Sri Lankan polls,"The elections to the Western and Southern provincial councils in Sri Lanka, home to a third of the country’s voters, was expected to be a walkover for the Mahinda Rajapakasa-led United People’s Freedom Alliance. After all, the government had fought bravely against ‘foreign conspirators’ at the 25th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva barely days ahead of the well-timed polling. In fact, much of the election campaign made it appear as if Sri Lanka was under siege and no one other than President Rajapaksa’s UPFA was capable of saving the nation. But the electorate did not buy the whole story, the voter turnout was low, and the results appeared puzzling. Local elections may be fought on immediately relevant issues and the outcome of a national poll may well be decided on larger considerations; still, the latest results provide an idea of the country's mood. The UPFA did win a majority in Mr. Rajapaksa’s home province, the Southern Province, and emerged the biggest party in the Western Province that has Colombo as its headquarters. But a point of concern for the ruling combine was the numbers: the UPFA won 33 of 55 seats in the South — down from 38 in 2009 — and managed 56 of the 104 in the West where it had 68 in 2009. More worrisome for the UPFA is the fact that it lost votes in the President’s hometown, Hambantota — represented in Parliament by his son Namal Rajapaksa. Clearly, people of the port-town prefer their district MP, Sajith Premadasa, son of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa. Mr. Sajith Premadasa has fought both the Rajapaksas and has a running battle going in his own United National Party. This is the last round of polls in Sri Lanka ahead of the parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for 2016.
Though the losses do not appear massive, the message behind it cannot be wished away. The UPFA’s loss did not result in its main rival, the UNP, gaining votes. In fact, there appears to be serious confusion among people: they voted for former General Sarath Fonseka’s Democratic National Alliance, which is now emerging as the third force in the country, and also the JVP, which is re-grouping under a new leader, Anura Kumara Dissanayake. The UNP’s vote share declined in Colombo Central, its biggest stronghold, and it will have to double its vote share if it has to emerge on top in a future election. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the UNP chief who survived many bids to unseat him, does not seem to be the leader who can carry the UNP into an election victory. With Sarath Fonseka’s fate already sealed following the deal he struck to be released from prison, people are clearly looking for a new leader. And there appears no one in sight. That might be Mr.Rajapaksa’s biggest trump card yet.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/message-from-sri-lankan-polls/article5855802.ece
2,4,2014,Maintaining the status quo,"The Reserve Bank of India’s first bi-monthly monetary policy statement is the last such before national elections and the formation of a new government. Obviously, monetary policy will have to be dovetailed with the new government’s policies, especially fiscal policy. The interregnum is not particularly conducive to major monetary policy announcements. However, even while playing it safe on certain key ongoing initiatives — for instance, the award of new bank licences has been referred to the Election Commission by way of abundant caution — the central bank has perforce to address monetary policy issues that cannot be postponed. The policy statement, it has been emphasised, is an economic and regulatory statement and ought not to be viewed through the prism of contemporary politics. The decision to hold policy rates was widely anticipated and, as is to be expected, based on a critical assessment of macroeconomic factors, both within India and outside. Since January, economic growth in the developed economies has moderated. For India and a number of developing economies, renewed volatility of capital flows and tightening of external financing conditions are the biggest threats. While sticking to its inflation and GDP growth forecasts, the RBI has warned of upside risks to inflation and downward risks to growth.
On inflation, the risks to the central forecast of 8 per cent CPI inflation by January 2015 stem from a less-than-normal monsoon, uncertainty in the setting of minimum support prices, the outlook for fiscal policy and the possibility of higher commodity prices. The monetary policy stance will be firmly focussed on keeping the economy in a disinflationary path towards a CPI inflation of 6 per cent by January 2016. GDP growth is projected to pick up from a little below 5 per cent in 2013-14 to the central estimate of 5.5 per cent, in a range of 5 to 6 per cent in 2014-15. However, there are no tangible signs of a sustained revival in industry and services as yet. Clearing of stalled projects and a pick-up in export growth as the world economy gains traction should brighten the outlook. Elaborating on the developmental and regulatory policies outlined earlier, the key recommendations of the Urjit Patel Committee’s report that have been implemented include the adoption of the new CPI as the key inflation measure, and a transition to a bi-monthly policy cycle. For banks, the transitional period for full implementation of Basel III capital regulations has been extended by a year to March 31, 2019. It is proposed to make inflation-linked savings bonds more investor-friendly. A wealth of information on non-monetary policy measures are found in this bi-monthly monetary policy statement, and hopefully that will become the norm.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/maintaining-the-status-quo/article5859603.ece
2,4,2014,A milestone for Pakistan,"After 25 hearings at a special court, former President and Chief of the Army Staff Pervez Musharraf was indicted on March 31 for high treason, contrary to expectations that a civil court would not try a military dictator. For a country ruled for the most part by the Army this is a first, and its Defence Minister described the day as a milestone for democracy. Few imagined that Prime Minister Muhammed Nawaz Sharif would initiate proceedings relating to high treason against Mr. Musharraf, and his supporters — some of them still in the government — were dismayed, to say the least. The high jinks by the Musharraf defence team did nothing to improve his case in court, and at one point Justice Faisal Arab and his Bench rose in disgust at the behaviour of counsel. The court gave Mr. Musharraf a long rope by allowing him to seek exemptions on the grounds of security and health, and only issued a non-bailable warrant as a last option after he repeatedly failed to appear before it. There was a feeling that this trial was turning farcical and that the court was unable to exercise its authority.
The dramatic appearance of Mr. Musharraf and the overnight change of his defence counsel signalled a new phase in the trial. Not only were the charges read out to him, but the court was firm that the power to take any decision for him to go abroad either to visit his ailing mother or to seek medical treatment was vested with the federal government. He was not under custody and as such the court could not regulate his movement. The government in the past had refused to take his name off the Exit Control List, and despite speculation of a safe passage and a Saudi-brokered deal it remains to be seen if he actually leaves the country. That is not as significant as the fact that a military dictator who not only abrogated the Constitution but amended it illegally has been brought to book. The transgressions of former military dictators are now the subject of history and they all ruled with impunity. This civilian government which has been trying to enforce the rule of law — not an easy task in the best of times — has sent a tough message that it has the courage and the conviction to do so. Whether the trial will play out to its logical conclusion and how long the process will take remain to be seen. But a blow for civilian authority has been struck, even if critics dismiss it as symbolic, and this could mark a new phase in the lopsided civil-military relations in Pakistan. The government should build on this and strengthen the foundations of liberal democratic governance where the military and civilian authorities are not at loggerheads with each other but are part of a system where each has a clearly defined role to play.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-milestone-for-pakistan/article5859605.ece
3,4,2014,One against all in West Bengal,"After the formation of the Mamata Banerjee-led All India Trinamool Congress, an interesting electoral battle was fought in the historic constituency of Medinipur in south Bengal in the 1998 Lok Sabha election. It was the first four-way contest after the formation of the AITC where all the main political contenders in West Bengal fielded their candidates. While Indrajit Gupta of the CPI won handsomely, the other main players — the Congress, the AITC and the BJP — got a substantial number of votes, between 10 and 20 per cent. Two of the parties, the BJP and the AITC, had an electoral alliance, but this had not had the intended effect due to “a misunderstanding,” leaders said. Sixteen years later, West Bengal mirrors Medinipur as the Left Front, Congress, BJP and AITC have put up separate candidates in all the 42 seats in the State, thus triggering an inevitable question: who will cut into whose vote base in the first four-way contest in 16 years? This time, however, everyone refuses to misunderstand the other. Mamata Banerjee — the single most powerful politician in the State today — is under stress not only because it is the first multi-party contest in a long time, but also due to the fact that the AITC has never fought an election alone.
While the AITC allied itself with the BJP in the first half of the last decade, in the second half the party allied with the Congress. The Congress’ vote share — 13.45 per cent in the last Lok Sabha election — was crucial for Ms. Banerjee’s victory. Even in the 2011 Assembly election, the Congress got nearly 10 per cent of the votes. The other key puzzle is whether the BJP — which had 6.14 per cent in 2009 — will increase its vote percentage and cut into the AITC’s base owing to the Modi factor. The third imponderable is whether the Left Front — whose legislators and cadres are increasingly aligning with the AITC — will be able to retain their share, which was an emphatic 43.30 per cent in the 2009 election. However, in the last few years, Ms. Banerjee has not committed any major political blunders. While the issue of law and order in the State is snowballing, she has managed to somewhat control the disturbances in Darjeeling and the Maoist-dominated areas. Now, if she gets a mandate that will catapult her to a national role, Ms. Banerjee may actually play it up to boost West Bengal’s economy, which is heading for a disaster. On the other hand, the Opposition feels the AITC’s slide will start from 2014 owing to Ms. Banerjee’s bid to control every level of administration, and large-scale corruption. Whatever the result, there is little doubt that both the Left and the Right are contesting against one adversary in West Bengal — the Chief Minister of West Bengal. Ms. Banerjee herself has described it as a battle of “all against one.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/one-against-all-in-west-bengal/article5863811.ece
3,4,2014,Public purpose of architecture,"The Pritzker Architecture Prize, the most distinguished and celebrated award in architecture, is given to a professional in the field who has contributed substantially to humanity and displayed excellence in built work. Awarded this year to Shigeru Ban, the 56-year-old Japanese architect, the Prize has truly met its objective after a long time. Mr. Ban has built inexpensive, easily transportable and recyclable disaster relief structures across the world for two decades. His ingenious designs have converted cardboard, paper and other relatively inexpensive materials into useful and reliable building components. He has utilised them in challenging situations ranging from earthquake-disaster relief work in Bhuj to refugee structures in Rwanda. Not many architects commit their skills and resources to design for the needy. Their preoccupation has been with creating expensive, glitzy and monumental structures, and major awards, including the Pritzker Prize, thus far have favoured such less socially relevant projects. This recognition of Mr. Ban’s contributions probably marks the beginning of a rethink. In a way it tries to make up for the failure to recognise his illustrious predecessors, such as Hassan Fathy and Laurie Baker, who were prolific in designing delightful buildings for the poor.
This year’s Pritzker Prize raises a key question for Indian architects and policymakers to reflect on: if good design brings in innovation and adds value, why are they not increasingly deployed to serve the public good? Organisations such as the Design Council of the U.K., which advises the government on matters of design, have repeatedly demonstrated that creative solutions can improve the quality of everyday life and deliver public services efficiently. They have also shown that funds invested in design fetch profits and social value. Such savings are critical for fund-starved projects such as low-cost housing. The New York City Department of Housing and Preservation Development has taken up collaborative work with designers to create a better liveable environment in their affordable housing projects. In contrast, State departments in India pay hardly any attention to design. As a result, low-income housing projects impose unliveable environments on the poor, and cities are yet to see well-designed bus stops, easily maintainable public toilets and user-friendly civic buildings. Even the National Design Policy, announced in 2007, has not sufficiently focussed on socially useful products. Architecture has to rediscover its social purpose to stay relevant. Professional education and public policy must enable it to serve those in need than just those who can pay for it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/public-purpose-of-architecture/article5863810.ece
4,4,2014,In the shadow of insurgency,"As during several elections in the past, the northeastern States are going to the Lok Sabha polls this time too under the shadow of the gun as ethnic insurgency continues to grip the region. Official reports of Maoists trying to gain a foothold in the region and forge alliances with some northeast-based ethnic insurgents have added to the worries of the Election Commission and the security forces. For this development-deficit region, unemployment has remained a gigantic problem that is pushing thousands of youth from every State to migrate to cities and growth centres outside it to look for greener pastures. The parties play upon the perceived fear among the indigenous populations of marginalisation as a consequence of illegal migration through the porous India-Bangladesh border. The concern gripping migrant religious and linguistic minorities of being clubbed together with illegal migrants and driven out of the country, adds to that fear.
The eight States together account for 25 seats, which could constitute a key component in the process of government-formation at the Centre. Of these, the Congress won 13 seats, the BJP four, the CPI(M) two, the NCP one seat and prominent regional parties one each, in 2009. The AGP and the BJP failed to clinch a pre-poll alliance this time. In 2009, a pre-poll alliance between the AGP and the BJP, and the emergence of the AIUDF, the principal Opposition party in the Assam Assembly, brought down the Congress' tally in the State. However, the choice of candidates by the AIUDF this time has fuelled speculation that it has reached a tacit understanding with the ruling Congress party to check the BJP. Tripura, currently the only Left-ruled State, however, still appears to be a fortress of the ruling CPI(M). In Nagaland, where inconclusive peace talks between the NSCN(IM) and the Centre continue to be a pivotal issue in garnering votes, the ruling Naga People’s Front (NPF) has fielded Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio as its candidate for the lone Lok Sabha seat. In Arunachal Pradesh, elections to the two Lok Sabha seats and the 60-member Assembly will be held simultaneously on April 9. In 2009, apart from winning the two Lok Sabha seats, the Congress also swept the Assembly polls held later in the year, winning 42 seats. This time, the Congress government recommended the dissolution of the Arunachal Pradesh Assembly well ahead of the expiry of its five-year term. The North East Regional Political Front, formed by 10 parties of the region in October 2013 in Guwahati, has not so far been seen as playing any role in the poll battle. In the absence of a formidable pre-poll combination of Opposition parties, and with the influence of regional parties limited to individual States, the Congress appears to be in a numerically advantageous position in the region.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/in-the-shadow-of-insurgency/article5868193.ece
4,4,2014,Threat of disintegration,"The fragile Libyan constitutional arrangement, reached after the dictator Muammar Qadhafi was overthrown in a regime-change operation instigated by NATO governments under cover of a United Nations no-fly resolution in 2011, is disintegrating. Prime Minister Ali Zeidan, who was kidnapped on October 10, 2013 and released within a few hours, fled the country in March 2014 after the General National Congress (GNC) passed a vote of no-confidence in him. Secondly, in December 2013 the GNC voted to extend its own mandate for another year, thereby violating the transitional constitutional plan, which gave it a mandate only until February 7. Various GNC factions have their own agendas too; the Justice and Construction Party, the Muslim Brotherhood’s Libyan branch, leads a bloc with 34 of the 80 party-allocated seats in the 200-seat Congress, and may well be spreading hardline Islamist influence. Furthermore, the eastern province of Cyrenaica (Barqa in Arabic) accuses Tripoli of not sharing oil revenues, and Barqa leaders based in Benghazi now demand a federal constitution. On March 10, a Barqa militia group blockaded Es Sidr, ensuring that a tanker of uncertain origin and ownership loaded an estimated $36 million worth of crude oil and put out to sea; the U.S. sent Navy SEALS to capture the ship. A wider blockade that started in August 2013 has already cost the country $8 billion.
Other tensions are causing yet more fighting. Early in March, Misrata-based militants exploded a bomb at a military base in Benghazi, killing five persons and injuring 14; moreover, the 225,000 Libyans registered as members of militias are paid by the state but remain under their own local or political commanders. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch and other observers have criticised western governments and sections of the international media for credulously accepting the rebel factions’ claims that the Qadhafi regime had engaged in genocide and had inflicted mass civilian casualties in the western-backed uprising. None of the claims has been substantiated, and foreign military intervention will almost certainly worsen matters, as it did during the uprising, when it enabled rebel groups to reject deals and escalate violence. In October 2013, U.S. commandos arrested an al-Qaeda suspect on Libyan soil, causing fury against Tripoli for collaborating with Washington, but the U.S. failure to create functioning public institutions in Iraq and Afghanistan may mean it will consider only military intervention in Libya, with or without U.N. legitimation. As Libyans face a new civil war and possible partition, unsurprisingly many of them are reportedly nostalgic about the Qadhafi era.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/threat-of-disintegration/article5868190.ece
11,4,2014,Watching the money flow,"In line with the constitutional mandate to curb the corrupting influence of money power in elections, the Election Commission of India (ECI) has issued detailed guidelines and set up an elaborate administrative machinery to monitor the expenses of candidates and ensure a free and fair poll. The ECI’s detailed compendium of instructions on Election Expenditure Monitoring (ECM) that is updated and issued before every general election, has come on top of hikes effected in the election expenditure limit for each parliamentary constituency to Rs.70 lakh from Rs.40 lakh for the bigger States based on a formula linked to a cost inflation index. The bulky ECM compendium, that deals with matters ranging from maintenance of accounts by each candidate, training of election agents on expenditure monitoring, maintenance of registers, appointment of election expenditure observers for each constituency and preparation of daily activity reports by flying squads on seizure of cash and so on, to norms for political parties and even “the language in which the accounts of election expenses may be filed”, is bewildering in terms of its details.
Apart from the irritation some of these norms could cause to normal and bona fide day-to-day cash-carrying transactions by even ordinary citizens and businesses, the most hotly contested rule now, amidst the poll campaign, relates to adding the costs of campaigning by party leaders and star campaigners to the expenditure of individual candidates. The demands on time made on and security considerations of VVIP leaders who campaign for their respective political parties require a certain mode of campaigning that includes the use of aircraft and helicopters. This invariably involves high-cost logistics, besides expenses on special platforms and enclosures prescribed by security agencies to ensure protection. If the ECI accepts the basic logic that expenditure on ‘general propaganda’ of political parties should not be added to candidates’ expenditure, then it implies that some allowance needs to be made for their ‘star campaigners’ who lead those political parties. The general propaganda of political parties cannot logically exclude campaigning by leaders. Or else, it results in an anomalous situation of ‘star campaigners’ like Sonia Gandhi, Narendra Modi and Jayalalithaa having to campaign sans their party candidates. The leaders cannot even mention the names of a candidate, lest the candidate be burdened with a bill that includes the travel costs of the leaders and overshoots the ceiling. The experience with such a rule, as highlighted by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, should prompt the ECI to revisit the norm.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/watching-the-money-flow/article5897050.ece
11,4,2014,Triumph for the Afghan public,"Afghanistan’s presidential election, held on April 5 with over 350,000 security personnel on duty, marks the country’s first potential democratic transfer of power. The Independent Election Commission put the turnout at about 60 per cent of a 12-million electorate. Three million more people voted than did in 2009, which shows public confidence in the electoral process itself; the previous election was deeply flawed. This time, although the Electoral Complaints Commission has received over 1,200 allegations of malpractice, the poll was better run than the previous one. Afghans of all ethnic groups turned out, and women made a strong showing; the figure was estimated at 35 per cent of the turnout. One candidate, Daoud Sultanzoy, voted along with his wife, the first time an Afghan politician appeared in public with a spouse. Over 86 per cent of the 20,000 polling stations opened; most of those which stayed closed were in the southern and southeastern provinces, where the army said it could not provide security. According to defence ministry spokesman General Zahir Azimy, the Taliban made about 700 attacks in various areas, but none was serious enough to disrupt the election, which was also the first in recent times to take place without foreign help. The counting process is being managed better than it was in 2009, with duplicated teams so as to limit fraud. Every polling station is required to post its results for the public to read or photograph.
The overall result is to be announced in a fortnight’s time, but uncertainties remain. The Taliban, who will lose most by the consolidation of democracy, have not succeeded in derailing the election, but their ranks number as many as 30,000 and they may be waiting for other chances to wreck the political process. A second issue has to do with the candidates’ own attitudes; none of them is likely to obtain the 50 per cent plus one vote needed for outright victory, and of the eight who contested, only three stand a realistic chance of going into the May 28 runoff. These are former foreign ministers Abdullah Abdullah and Zalmai Rassoul, and former finance minister Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai (the incumbent, Hamid Karzai, has completed the two five-year terms the Constitution allows). Mr. Rassoul trails the others, as his largely educated supporters are based around Kabul and other cities, and the two front-runners are claiming victory. Squabbling, or delays in the runoff, could let the Taliban to exploit the vacuum. The politicians owe it to the Afghan public, who have shown courage and commitment to the ballot box, to ensure a prompt and smooth handover of power.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/triumph-for-the-afghan-public/article5897048.ece
12,4,2014,India’s pro-rapist lobby,"“Boys will make mistakes,” Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav said of rape, on Thursday. His remarks making light of such a heinous crime illustrate just why the feminist battle in India has barely begun. Mr. Yadav believes new rape laws, introduced after the 2012 rape-and-murder of a Delhi woman, are being misused by women to punish their boyfriends. “When their friendship ends,” Mr. Yadav asserted, “the girl complains she has been raped.” Mr. Yadav’s lieutenant, Abu Asim Azmi, meanwhile invoked shari’a law to call for the death penalty — but, for the victim. “Even the woman is guilty,” he told a Mumbai newspaper. Mr. Azmi believes that if “any woman, whether married or unmarried, goes along with a man, with or without her consent, she should be hanged.” The sad truth, though, is that these kinds of attitudes aren’t exclusive to the Samajwadi Party. From the Rajasthan legislator who thinks rape happens because schoolgirls wear skirts to the Puducherry Minister who wants them covered up in overcoats; from Shiv Sena leaders who blame migrants to Delhi community leaders who scapegoat Africans; from Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat who thinks “western values” provoke rape to the Haryana khap panchayat leader who says it happens because of hormonal excesses he attributed to chowmein — there is no shortage of Indians willing to blame rape on anything and everyone other than the rapist.
Mr. Yadav’s words, we can be reasonably certain, were no mistake. In the midst of a bruising election campaign, he spoke as he did because he knew there is political gain to be had from this stand. The hideous truth is that in India, as in many other countries, there is something that can only be described as a pro-rapist lobby that extends beyond political pulpits into streets and homes. The renewed feminist activism of the last year has left patriarchy scrambling for new bogeys and new ways to protect itself. Ill-informed scaremongering about the “draconian” provisions of the new amendment to sexual assault laws has been a handy tool. For India’s women, rape is part of a continuum of violence that begins in the womb. Also, contrary to the myth that rural “Bharat” is safer than westernised India, of the 24,923 cases registered in 2012 by police, 3,035 took place in major cities. The data also tell us the typical rapist isn’t a feral juvenile, crazed by raging hormones or bad upbringing. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the perpetrator was known to the victim. Mr. Yadav’s words have rightly caused outrage. They should also lead to some hard introspection into how many of us believe an only slightly more benign version of those very words to be true.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/indias-prorapist-lobby/article5901936.ece
12,4,2014,The quiet IPCC warning,"The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has given its starkest warning of the likely impact of climate change. The IPCC’s March 31 report, the most comprehensive yet, states that the evidence of global warming is now overwhelming, and warns that all countries and all social classes of people will be affected by changes which are likely to be “severe, pervasive and irreversible.” All animal species face an increased risk of extinction, and vegetation patterns are likely to change substantially, with low-latitude species appearing in higher latitudes and lower latitudes becoming more arid, even if rainfall patterns there are becoming less predictable. If temperatures rise to 2 ˚ C or more above 20th century levels, yields of major food crops will probably fall; the likely yield increase in colder climates as those grow warmer may not offset declining yields elsewhere. Water resources, already under stress in Asia, are likely to come under even greater stress, and ocean acidification — caused by the absorption of rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide — is likely to compound the problems. The poor in all countries are likely to suffer more than the rich, but all humanity may well be unable to adapt to temperature rises of above 2 degrees.
While the report is not apocalyptic in tone, and specifies the level of confidence with which it states its main findings, one major question arising thence is whether we can adapt to survive, or whether far more drastic measures are required. This is especially important in South Asia, where almost one and a half billion people live. Spreading aridity, or increasingly severe individual events like storms or droughts, not to mention the disappearance of land as sea levels rise, could well lead to large-scale migration, which in turn could cause resource-driven conflict not between countries but between rural and urban populations or between crop farmers and animal farmers. Existing inequalities are likely to worsen, which will make it harder for people to climb out of poverty. Yet, on the evidence the report has received only the briefest of responses, for example from United States Secretary of State John Kerry, and from the environment ministers of various European Union countries; moreover, the very possibility that gradual adaptation may not avert climate catastrophe appears not to figure, particularly in regions which would be the worst affected, such as South Asia. That countries — states — are the only bodies even remotely capable of action on the scale required hardly needs saying, but the regions at greatest risk have some of the world’s most dysfunctional states. We cannot say we have not been warned.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-quiet-ipcc-warning/article5901935.ece
14,4,2014,Staunching the vitriol,"The Election Commission’s order banning two political leaders from addressing public meetings and rallies for their divisive and inflammatory speeches during the ongoing election campaign sends out a strong message to those who seek to exploit communal sentiments for electoral gains. Such resolute action is bound to find resonance with a vast majority of the people. For the past few weeks, the country has been subjected to venom and vitriol in the name of electioneering, as leaders of different parties have reduced canvassing for votes to distasteful rants against their adversaries. By making it clear that it would not only enforce the Model Code of Conduct, which bars appealing for votes on sectarian grounds, but also demand that authorities initiate criminal prosecution, the EC has demonstrated the full extent of its vast powers under Article 324 of the Constitution. If the threat by Congress candidate Imran Masood to “chop off” the hands of the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, represented the nadir of this trend, his immediate arrest and remand ought to have had a moderating effect on others. However, Amit Shah, the BJP leader in charge of its Uttar Pradesh campaign, made an explicit call for revenge while addressing a meeting in riot-hit Muzaffarnagar. U.P. Minister Azam Khan of the Samajwadi Party sought to inject communal venom by claiming that the Kargil war of 1999 was won by Muslim soldiers alone.
These leaders now claim that they would clarify their remarks to the Election Commission, and seek to have the ban on their rallies lifted. However, the EC has noted that they had failed to respond to show-cause notices within the stipulated time. The Commission has said the U.P. government failed to respond to the offences with the required alacrity and was soft-pedalling action. Fresh FIRs have been filed in response to the EC’s rebuke. It is debatable as to what extent the police machinery can keep track of every inflammatory utterance, given the frequency with which the campaign has collapsed into divisive rhetoric, but there can be little excuse for responsible governments to delay action on egregious offences. If there is one purpose the EC’s firm action will serve, it is that the lethargy or indifference of the authorities towards this trend will end and there will be redoubled efforts to crack down on those making offending speeches. Yet one should also not fail to note that the leadership of various parties appears to be complacent, if not openly supportive, when it comes to provocative remarks by their own functionaries. Ultimately, the responsibility to stem the degeneration of political discourse lies with the political class. What is at stake is not a mere election victory but the credibility of electoral democracy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/staunching-the-vitriol/article5908529.ece
14,4,2014,Merger medicine,"Digesting acquisitions is never easy in the corporate world, especially when the acquirer and target are of similar size. And when one of the two companies is in distress, the merger can be testing indeed. This is the challenge that Sun Pharmaceuticals faces in its acquisition of Ranbaxy Laboratories. In what is probably the biggest such all-stock merger deal between two Indian companies, Sun Pharma announced on April 7 that it will be acquiring Ranbaxy using its own shares as currency. The $4 billion deal, subject to approvals, also includes an $800 million loan in Ranbaxy’s books. Analysts have been quick to point out that this is a bargain acquisition by Sun, given that Ranbaxy’s valuation is half of what it was when Japanese major Daiichi Sankyo acquired the company from the original promoters in 2008. But there is a reason why Ranbaxy came so cheap, and that is its run-ins with regulatory authorities in its largest overseas market, the U.S. The company’s four plants in India have been blacklisted and barred from making supplies to the U.S. by that country’s regulator for sub-standard manufacturing practices. Worse, Ranbaxy underwent the humiliation of pleading guilty to felony charges, paying up $500 million as fine. So, the question to ask is not whether it is a cheap acquisition but a smart one for the ambitious Sun Pharma.
Sun, and its founder Dilip Shanghvi, seem to believe it is. The troubles aside, Ranbaxy is known for its strength in generics and has a long research and product pipeline. Besides, Ranbaxy owns well-known over-the-counter brands such as Revital and is present in emerging markets and in parts of the developed world too. In India, the combined entity catapults itself to the top of the table. Importantly, buying distressed assets cheap and reviving them seems to be part of Sun Pharma’s DNA. It has nursed at least three major companies abroad back to health after acquiring them. Sun’s confidence probably stems from this trait. Yet, Mr. Shanghvi will be the first person to concede that Ranbaxy is qualitatively a different challenge and more than just turnaround skills will be needed to make this deal shine. His biggest asset as he sets out to repair Ranbaxy’s name in the U.S., however, will be Sun’s own clean image. From a domestic market perspective, the merger is good as it will create an entity of a scale and size big enough to take on emerging competition from multinationals. The stock markets seem to agree with Sun’s strategy, which is a big battle won. However, quickly settling the issues with the U.S. regulators will be key to the success of the merger, and Sun’s capabilities will be fully tested in this effort.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/merger-medicine/article5908528.ece
15,4,2014,Inexplicable reticence,"As a candidate in the 2002, 2007 and then the 2012 elections for the Gujarat Assembly, Narendra Modi chose not to make his marital status clear in his nomination papers. Now, having set his sights on becoming the next occupant of 7 Race Course Road, the BJP’s prime ministerial nominee has for the first time acknowledged in his election papers the existence of a wife, Jashodaben Modi, who he appears to have distanced himself from almost half a century ago to become an RSS pracharak. Jashodaben, apparently at Mr. Modi’s urging, continued with her education after they parted. She became a village schoolteacher, but the reality of the social milieu she lived in was such that she had to rely on her brothers to give her a home. By itself, this belated revelation should have been of little consequence, especially as this had already been reported on in the press. In India, unlike in the West, details of a politician’s personal life normally have little impact on the electorate unless they have criminal implications. But what caused consternation in this case was why Mr. Modi should have suppressed for so long the fact that he was married. Further, in a country where women have a robust public presence, keeping his wife hidden away from the public eye, suggested a regressive view on Mr. Modi’s part of a woman’s place in this country.
Indeed, this delayed disclosure of the crucial personal detail dents Mr. Modi’s credibility as a prime ministerial candidate. With the socially conservative RSS driving the BJP’s campaign, there is the apprehension of a resurgence of a patriarchal mindset reflecting restrictive approaches to the issue of further empowerment of women. The Gujarat model that Mr. Modi is assiduously marketing in his bid to become Prime Minister does not inspire much confidence in his ability to promote gender equality. The 2011 census says there are 918 women for every 1,000 men in the State, below the national average of 940, indicating an unacceptable trend of male-preference, lower rates of school enrolment for girls, and higher levels of malnutrition among children than in the rest of India. The State’s conviction rate for rape and abduction of women is also among the lowest in the country. Mr. Modi’s political opponents have naturally seized upon this disquieting impression of a regressive impulse, seeking to make political capital out of it. The onus is on him, given his prime ministerial aspirations, to be more transparent about what prompted this somewhat misogynist reticence in disclosing his marital status. This will put to rest fears that we are about to enter an era of renewed social conservatism, should Mr. Modi become Prime Minister.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/inexplicable-reticence/article5911903.ece
15,4,2014,Another case of fraud in science,"Just as the chapter on Hwang Woo Suk, a South Korean stem cell researcher and one of the biggest known research fraudsters, came to an end recently, another major fraud by a Japan-based stem cell researcher has taken centre-stage. Two “path-breaking” papers published on January 30 in Nature by a team led by 30-year-old Haruko Obokata of the Riken Center for Developmental Biology in Kobe claimed to have made the process of reprogramming adult mice cells to pluripotent stem cells (capable of becoming any of the specialised adult tissue) very simple. Also, by being able to contribute to the formation of placental tissue, the pluripotent stem cells so produced were shown to be more versatile than even embryonic stem cells. But a torrent of questions on falsification, manipulation and duplication of images and plagiarism were raised days after the publication. Scientists were also unable to replicate the study in their labs; one of the co-authors of the papers failed in his attempts post-publication. With the papers and Ms. Obokata coming under intense scrutiny, researchers unearthed a few unethical practices in her thesis as well — about 20 pages of her thesis, completed in 2011, bear a striking similarity to information posted in the National Institutes of Health website. Also, two images used with one paper, produced through an experiment completely different from the published work, appear in her thesis. But the most damaging factor is that the two stem-cell lines produced from a particular strain of mouse have been found to come from different strains.
Unfortunately, for a fraud of this magnitude, the investigation by a six-member committee constituted by the Riken Center did not measure up to the standards one would normally come to expect of such institutions. The scope of the examination was limited — only six issues concerning image manipulation and duplication and plagiarism were scrutinised but the core issue of examining the veracity of the study was skirted. While dismissing the four problems as “innocent errors,” the committee judged the manipulation of an image and the use of an image from her doctoral thesis as deliberate attempts to falsify data. Though it has labelled her actions as “scientific misconduct,” the committee has only confirmed what is abundantly clear. Unlike Riken, the Seoul National University did brilliantly in probing Mr. Hwang’s case. With Nature yet to conclude its investigation, Ms. Obokata planning to appeal the judgment and another committee being set up to determine punishment, the last word has not been said. But Ms. Obokata has surely not read the journal’s elaborate points of information for authors on the matter of image manipulation, which was added after the Hwang episode.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/another-case-of-fraud-in-science/article5911933.ece
21,4,2014,The Delhi dilemma,"By leaving it to the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi to decide whether to recommend >dissolution of the Delhi Assembly or not, the Supreme Court has wisely refrained from giving any direction to the constitutional authority to follow a particular course of action. What the Court has done instead is to clarify the position concerning the power of the President to rescind or modify his February 16, 2014 >Proclamation imposing President’s Rule in Delhi. There is “no fetter or impediment” to the President exercising his power to revoke or vary his earlier order. When the > Aam Aadmi Party government resigned in February, the Lt. Governor did not accept the outgoing regime’s recommendation to dissolve the House. Instead, >the Assembly was kept under suspended animation. This was rightly done, >as the Supreme Court, in S.R. Bommai vs. Union of India, had ruled that the legislature could be dissolved only after the Proclamation imposing President’s Rule receives the approval of both Houses of Parliament. In the case of Delhi, both Houses have approved the Proclamation, but the Assembly continues to remain suspended. The AAP has approached the Supreme Court challenging the non-dissolution of the House and seeking fresh elections. While the legal position is clear, that the President’s order is subject to judicial review, if it is found to be mala fide, or based on extraneous or irrelevant considerations, it is difficult to see any scope for a direction to a constitutional authority to dissolve — or refrain from dissolving — the legislature. >President’s Rule in Delhi cannot go on beyond a year, unless extended with Parliament's approval.
While the AAP alleges that the Assembly has been kept under suspended animation with the mala fide motive of delaying fresh elections, the government has defended its decision not to dissolve the House. The government’s position is that it would not be expedient or in the public interest to hold another election so soon after the last Assembly election held in December 2013. The absence of a representative government is a real concern. And it is an issue that requires a political solution. The possibility of forming another government out of the present composition of the Delhi Assembly, in which the two top parties are short of a majority, is limited. A fresh election is the obvious way out of the present impasse, but none can guarantee a decisive verdict with any one party winning a majority. In the case of a hopelessly fractured verdict, the only option will be for parties to work together for a reasonable period of time so that repeated, frequent polls are avoided. Ultimately, though, it is the responsibility of the electorate to be decisive and put in place a government that would be stable, and responsive to their needs.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-delhi-dilemma/article5931347.ece
21,4,2014,Gabo puts down his tools,"The writer Michael Jacobs, who died in January 2014, met the legendary Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez by chance when he arrived in the country to undertake a journey on the river Magdalena. He was introduced to Marquez by a friend as “an Englishman obsessed by the river Magdalena.” Describing this encounter in his travelogue, The Robber of Memories, Jacobs writes of Marquez: “He burst into a smile, his eyes glowed and he held tightly to my wrist without seeming to want to let go. He looked up at his brother, like a child asking for a favour, and suggested that I be invited to their house, where he would love to talk to me at length about the Magdalena, the river of his life, the river that gave him the one reason for wanting to be young again. So that he could sail along it one more time.” Marquez passed away at the age of 87 on April 17 in Mexico, where he had shifted in 1981 after feeling threatened by the Colombian military’s efforts to question him over his alleged links with the country’s Communist guerrillas. But Colombia formed the backdrop of his works – the Colombia where people remained impoverished and democracy a miasma.
Fondly called Gabo, Marquez was known for his magical realism that came to him through stories he heard as a child from his grandmother. In 1965, he began work on his most famous novel, > One Hundred Years of Solitude, for which he locked himself in a room for 18 months with cigarette packs as sole companions. The book sold more than 20 million copies and was translated into over 30 languages. This novel was a major influence on >the committee that awarded him the Nobel Prize in literature in 1982. Marquez remained a friend of Cuban President Fidel Castro, and as a result of his outspoken views on U.S. policies, he was denied a visa for years — till Bill Clinton came to power and lifted the ban, citing the fact that One Hundred Years of Solitude was his own favourite novel. In an interview to The Paris Review, Marquez likened writing to carpentry. “Both are very hard work,” he said. “Writing something is almost as hard as making a table. With both you are working with reality, a material just as hard as wood. Both are full of tricks and techniques.” That skill showed in his every work. In the opening of Love in the Time of Cholera, Marquez writes: “It was inevitable: the scent of bitter almonds reminded him of the fate of unrequited love.” In an instant, the reader becomes Dr. Juvenal Urbino — and can smell bitter almonds.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/gabo-puts-down-his-tools/article5931346.ece
22,4,2014,The power of words,"Elections always throw up inventive rhetoric, catchy one-liners, barbs, and taunts. These are amplified even more when social media rule the roost among the young and trendy in particular. Nonetheless, it is disheartening that in a country that otherwise takes pride in its rich traditions, great love for poetry and elevating metaphors in almost every regional language, in the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha election the campaign styles of the two major political players at the national level have largely smacked of clichéd and stereotyped labels. A certain style of leadership that has been projected well in advance since last year has shaped the poll discourse as well. It may well have begun with the seemingly innocuous >puppy-under-the-wheel remark by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, to convey his expression of pain over the 2002 anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat. But as he lent more lung power to a style of speech that was laced with ostensibly tell-all words such as ‘ >Shahzada’ (prince), in referring to Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, ‘Matashree’ in addressing Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the ‘Recounting Minister from Tamil Nadu’, alluding to P. Chidambaram, and coined terms like ‘burqa [veil] of secularism’, liberal sections were only hoping that the political Rubicon would not be crossed.
But the power of campaign rhetoric is such that it triggered a counter-discourse virtually across the political spectrum. While the ‘tea boy’ allusion to Mr. Modi by some Congress leaders in a pejorative reference to his humble beginnings in life boomeranged on the party leading the UPA, the caustic and at times vitriolic references to Mr. Modi by some Congress functionaries like Imran Masood in Uttar Pradesh made people wonder whether the Congress too was falling for the aggressive, no-holds-barred mode of speech. In this battle of wits, Rahul Gandhi himself was forced to condemn the likes of Mr. Masood, while >Mr. Chidambaram sought to pay Mr. Modi back in his own coin, by asking whether the latter could not be termed “Encounter Minister”. All these to some extent go to show how much of the campaign style has been shaped by images and themes more associated with an ‘icon’ rather than flowing from political programmes and policies. True, there has been quite a bit of talk about the ‘Gujarat development model’ going all-India, beef exports being highly subsidised, poverty being a ‘mental state’, and so on; these speech-acts only remind us of the Oxford linguistics philosopher J.L. Austin’s great work, How to Do Things With Words. It was everybody’s expectation that the leaders would put words to better, more positive use in this poll campaign.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-power-of-words/article5934504.ece
22,4,2014,CAG scan of the private sector,"The >Supreme Court’s ruling that the Comptroller and Auditor General of India can audit private telecom firms that share their revenues with the government is a landmark one. The ruling has, at one stroke, extended the reach of the CAG from government and public sector companies to any entity that may be using a public resource in its business and sharing revenue with the government. The ostensible principle behind the ruling is that when the Executive deals with natural resources, such as spectrum, which belong to the people, Parliament should know how the nation’s wealth has been dealt with. The quantum of revenue generated from the resource has to be verified; whether the revenue has been properly accounted for by the government and the private licensee also needs to be ascertained. The principle behind the ruling is unexceptionable and gains resonance in the context of scams in spectrum and coal blocks allocations that were unearthed by the CAG. Politicians are not beyond colluding with private firms to extract rent from their control of public resources, and the latter have been happy to play along. The origins of the case that has led to the Supreme Court ruling lie in a dispute between a couple of telecom companies and the government over accounting of revenues, which is crucial to determining the licence fee payable to the government. The government suspected that the companies were accounting for revenues in a manner that would lower their fee liability.
The fact is that >companies that use public resources have a responsibility to bear, and if they play true and fair they have nothing to fear from an audit, including one by the CAG. A CAG audit can be an irritant in the conduct of daily business as records need to be produced and queries answered, especially because this will be in addition to the statutory audit under the Companies Act. If governments and the CAG ensure that there is no harassment, there would be no cause to protest against the audit itself, as industry associations are now doing. After all, the ruling is a direct result of proven misdemeanour by some entities in recent times. That said, the challenge for the CAG will be in deploying adequate resources and talent in such audits when called upon by the government or the regulators. These need to be completed and the reports submitted in good time unlike traditional CAG audits of public sector entities that are invariably delayed. The government and the regulators should resort to CAG audits sparingly and only under exceptional circumstances where they suspect serious wrongdoing by a player. Turning to CAG audits routinely will only increase the regulatory burden and turn away private investors.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/cag-scan-of-the-private-sector/article5934505.ece
23,4,2014,A sinister design,"By asking Hindus not to allow Muslims to buy property in ‘Hindu localities’, Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Praveen Togadia was seeking to undermine the basic constitutional values of the nation. This was no ordinary ‘hate speech’ made in the rough and tumble of elections. Mr. Togadia’s intent was far more sinister than swinging the election mood in favour of the Bharatiya Janata Party. It certainly appeared to have a more long-term objective: to create a feeling of insecurity among India’s Muslims, push them into ghettos, and encourage Hindus to engage in violent action against them. Article 14 of the Constitution guarantees equality before law within the territory of India, and Article 15 prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. Article 19(e) protects the rights of a citizen to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India. The VHP firebrand’s call to his Hindu audience was thus an incitement to violence and illegal actions, an invitation to encroach on properties bought by Muslims from Hindus. By asking his supporters to pressure the state to invoke — actually misuse — the Disturbed Areas Act to prevent Muslims from moving into so-called Hindu localities, Mr. Togadia was not displaying an ignorance of the country’s laws: he was actually setting a majoritarian agenda for the government.
That Mr. Togadia’s speech would not serve the immediate goals of the BJP was evident soon enough. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the mentor of both the BJP and the VHP, after first denying Mr. Togadia made such remarks, came out expressing disapproval of any discrimination on the basis of religion or caste. Coming as it did after party candidate Giriraj Singh’s speech that said the critics of the prime ministerial aspirant Narendra Modi had no place in India, but belonged in Pakistan, the BJP was expected to make an unambiguous statement condemning Mr. Togadia’s brand of politics. Mr. Modi tweeted that he disapproved of any irresponsible statement from those claiming to be the BJP’s well-wishers, but he was reluctant to go any further. At the heart of the controversy is not the question of any deviation of the BJP’s campaign from the issues of development and good governance, as Mr. Modi sees it, but fears over the fringe elements of the Sangh Parivar exerting an excessive influence over a party seen as the front-runner in the race to form the next government. Distancing himself from Mr. Togadia can only be the first step: Mr. Modi needs to reassure voters that his is not a divisive, sectarian agenda, and that if he were to head the next government he would act in the interests of all sections of the country — and not serve merely as the prime minister of the Hindu majority.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-sinister-design/article5938085.ece
23,4,2014,Talking without saying,"In a context of deepening confrontation and sporadic violence in eastern Ukraine which has so far left three people dead and many more injured, Russia, the United States, and the European Union reached an agreement of sorts in Geneva on April 17. The deal calls on all illegal groups in the region to lay down their arms, and to vacate government buildings and other public spaces they have occupied. In return, the protesters would be offered an amnesty for all capital crimes, and the national government in Kiev would start public consultations on a devolution of powers to the country’s provinces. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) is to oversee and help implement the agreement, and will be augmented by monitors from the U.S., Russia, and EU countries. Meanwhile, the situation on the ground in the whole of eastern Ukraine remains fraught. That Russian security personnel are in the area is beyond doubt; perhaps in fear of infiltration, Kiev is now refusing to allow male Russian citizens between 16 and 60 years of age entry into the country. Secondly, many eastern Ukrainians are reported as saying that if they speak Ukrainian they risk being assaulted.
It is, moreover, not clear if the parties at Geneva can, or even want to, prevent an escalation of tensions. In a televised phone-in shortly before the talks, Russian President Vladimir Putin derided asset freezes and travel bans on selected Russian and Ukrainian officials; he also stated that Russia’s Parliament had given him the “right” to use armed forces in Ukraine. Another potentially destabilising factor is that Mr. Putin can claim that violence by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine has nothing to do with Moscow. Furthermore, he has said nothing about the actual extent of support for Russia; groups of eastern Ukrainians have started demonstrating against secession and in favour of the status quo. The Western powers, for their part, have made no apparent commitment on certain major issues. One is NATO’s eastward expansion, which Russia understandably perceives as a very serious threat. The U.S., NATO’s dominant member, has done nothing to curb the alliance. The second is that of whether the Kiev government will abide by the Geneva deal, including the requirement that all sides desist from extremism; interim President Oleksander Turchynov has several Ministers with neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic records, and he will not forget that his troops’ attempts to retake occupied facilities in the east ended with their being humiliatingly disarmed by secessionist forces. U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden’s current visit to Kiev is largely symbolic, but so is the Geneva agreement: it says good things, but avoids the things that matter.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/talking-without-saying/article5938084.ece
24,4,2014,BCCI and a credibility deficit,"Once again, the credibility deficit of the Board of Control for Cricket in India stands underlined. A three-member committee recommended by the BCCI to hold an investigation into charges concerning the Indian Premier League matches last year has not found favour with the Supreme Court. Instead, the Court has, in a welcome move, chosen to request Justice Mukul Mudgal, who headed a Court-appointed panel that came out with an insightful report earlier, to hold a full-fledged investigation. The probe will cover allegations contained in a sealed cover against 12 persons, including some cricketers, besides N. Srinivasan, related to the IPL spot-fixing and betting scandal. It has suggested that Mr. Justice Mudgal could also take the assistance of investigative agencies. Going by the manner in which the Board responded to the Court’s suggestion at an earlier hearing that it should spell out how it proposed to conduct an internal inquiry, it is clear that the cricket body is more worried about the fallout of a probe than getting at the truth. When the Supreme Court itself was against any police agency probing the matter — so that the players’ reputation and the Board’s autonomy were not undermined — all it had to do was come up with a panel comprising members with no obvious conflict of interest. Yet, what the Board proposed was a committee comprising a former CBI Director with some connection to a team in the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association league, a retired Calcutta High Court Chief Justice related to the court-appointed BCCI president Shivlal Yadav, and a former cricketer with a lucrative commentating contract with the Board.
While all of them — former CBI director R.K. Raghavan, Justice J.N. Patel and Ravi Shastri — are individuals of undoubted personal integrity, experience and understanding of the issues involved, the BCCI could not have lost sight of the need for an investigation of some of the leading personalities in Indian cricket to appear to be fair and free of any conflict of interest or connection with the BCCI. There can only be one explanation for the Board not coming up with a plan for a credible investigation by a completely independent panel: it does not want a fair inquiry even if in the process its credibility takes a beating. It reveals an unwillingness to shed its image as an opaque clique. What cricket fans and the public need now is reassurance that the glamorous flagship tournament of the BCCI is not yielding illegal spin-off benefits to punters, bookies, fixers and assorted operators seeking to capitalise on the popularity of the sport. Apart from a thorough clean-up of the game, the Indian cricket board needs to win back the trust of the game’s fans, and the public at large.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bcci-and-a-credibility-deficit/article5940822.ece
24,4,2014,A virus to watch out for,"In September 2012, an alert Egyptian doctor working in a Saudi Arabian hospital isolated a new human virus in samples taken from a man who had died of pneumonia and kidney failure. The virus came to be known as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). By late last month, 200 laboratory-confirmed cases of people infected by the virus were reported to the World Health Organisation, with 85 deaths. Since then, however, there has been a spurt in infections, with 53 more cases and eight additional deaths being reported to the WHO. The vast majority of all MERS-CoV cases have occurred in the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia accounting for a large proportion of them. The United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Yemen have also reported cases. France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Tunisia and Greece reported instances where people had been infected in the Middle East or came into contact with such infected individuals. Asia recently reported its first cases — and the first death from the virus. A 54-year-old Malaysian man appears to have caught the virus while on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia; he developed pneumonia on his return and died days later. A male nurse from the Philippines, who had been working in the UAE, was found to be carrying the virus though he did not fall sick.
India — especially States like Kerala — needs to be watchful. “Countries that have large numbers of travellers to the region, including workers, are reminded of the need for vigilance in the form of surveillance, and the importance of good infection control practices in managing patients with acute respiratory infections,” the WHO cautioned in an update last month. Unlike the swine-origin flu virus that caused the 2009 pandemic, the MERS virus does not easily spread from one person to another. But it has a high case fatality rate and its appearance here could well fuel public anxiety. That can be avoided if the Central and State governments put in place well thought-out plans for testing and surveillance as well as for dealing with any cases that turn up. Likewise, hospitals, both government-run ones and those in the private sector, need to be ready to handle patients who have the virus. In the Middle East, many infections have occurred in hospitals, and their staff members have been among those affected. Healthcare facilities dealing with MERS-CoV infections should take appropriate measures to reduce the risk of the virus passing to other patients, staff and visitors, warns the WHO. Now that the virus has reached Asia, India’s Central and State governments would do well to review their preparedness.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-virus-to-watch-out-for/article5940825.ece
25,4,2014,Sustainable mining,"The >Supreme Court’s verdict permitting resumption of iron-ore mining in Goa with a temporary cap of 20 million tonnes per annum is welcome for more reasons than one. First, the lifting of the mining ban will restore livelihoods to a vast number of people in a State whose economy is powered by the twin engines of mining and tourism. By the Court’s own finding, more than 1.5 lakh Goans depend on the mining industry directly, and then there are downstream beneficiaries such as truck operators and other service providers. The State’s economy has suffered, as indeed the country’s exports, due to the 18-month ban. The verdict represents an acknowledgement that the problem with mining is not the activity itself; rather, it is illegal and unregulated mining that needs to be clamped down upon. The problem in Goa, as also in Karnataka, began with the unscrupulous activities of some mining companies which pushed the boundaries of their operations, literally and figuratively, beyond legal limits. Mining in areas outside the lease territory, under-reporting production both in quantitative and qualitative terms and showing scant regard for the environment were the reasons that attracted action from the NGOs and the public and caused the courts to step in with a ban. It is shocking that the exports of iron ore exceeded official production figures in each of the five years between 2006-07 and 2010-11. This is evidence of illegal mining.
The Supreme Court has now defined the framework, inclusive of directions to the Centre and the State government over the promulgation of rules and adherence to them. It has also acknowledged the concerns of >environmentalists by prohibiting mining within a kilometre of the boundaries of national parks and sanctuaries in Goa. By directing the Centre to notify eco-sensitive zones around national parks and sanctuaries within six months, the Court has ensured that the mining industry’s territory is clearly marked out and there is no possibility of harm being caused to the ecology and environment. The interim solution of allowing up to 20 million tonnes of ore to be mined per annum until the expert committee appointed by the Supreme Court comes up with its final report in the next 12 months, is a fair one as it takes into account the interests of both the mining industry and the environment. With the State government now being permitted to grant fresh leases as per its own policy, whether by auction or other means, the onus is now clearly on it to move quickly in framing a transparent policy in this regard. A well-regulated mining industry that is also environmentally sustainable is not a difficult goal to achieve if the government sets its mind to it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sustainable-mining/article5944373.ece
25,4,2014,Drones cannot replace politics,"The drone attacks which the Yemeni government says have >killed at least 55 suspected al-Qaeda militants in the Mahfad region of central and southern Yemen show that current United States policy there is both self-defeating and dangerous. The attacks took place on April 20 and 21 and may have killed, among others, Nasir al Wuhayshi and Ibrahim al Asiri, both leaders of al-Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula (AQAP). >U.S. officials confirm that they provided intelligence and logistical support, and the New York Times cites them as saying the Central Intelligence Agency operated the drones on this occasion, but the CIA — which runs the drone warfare programme — has refused to comment on any direct involvement by Washington; so has the Department of Defense. There have been 11 drone strikes in Yemen this year, and the country is now the main such target, as al-Qaeda seems no longer to have a presence in Saudi Arabia. Significantly, the government in Sanaa has acknowledged that the recent attacks killed three civilians; an attack in the same region in December 2013 killed 15 wedding guests, but as the U.S. does not acknowledge drone strikes, innocent victims’ relatives cannot even claim compensation. Yemen faces extreme poverty and illiteracy, weak and corrupt public institutions, and poorly equipped security forces.
The overriding fact, however, is that drone warfare by the U.S. is achieving the opposite of what it was meant to do. Under the 2001 Authorisation for the Use of Military Force (AUMF), the U.S. government can engage in targeted killings, including attacks on U.S. citizens (three of whom have been killed by drones), without further warrant; even the targets, namely “associated forces” of al-Qaeda, are loosely defined. President Barack Obama’s stated support for a repeal of the AUMF remains mere words, but on April 21 a Federal appeals court ruled, in response to a challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Times, that the administration must disclose, albeit in redacted form, papers giving its legal justification for killing U.S. citizens suspected of terrorism overseas. Secondly, a U.S. diplomat formerly stationed in Yemen estimates that every drone attack generates 40 to 60 new AQAP adherents, and notes that the U.S. mission in Sanaa has been reclassified as a non-family post, with staff now unable to live outside the embassy compound. The U.S. is not even at war with Yemen, a country where the popular uprising which started in 2011 was far more successful than those in other countries in the region. By replacing political engagement with drone warfare, the U.S. itself is becoming something of an al-Qaeda recruiting agent.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/drones-cannot-replace-politics/article5944372.ece
26,4,2014,Appointments and propriety,"T >he Centre informing the Supreme Court that it will not take an immediate decision on the appointment of a chairperson and members of the Lok Pal has brought to an end an unnecessary controversy which began with its calling for a meeting of the selection committee on April 27 and 28. In fact, Common Cause, the petitioner, is worried more about the attempt to make an appointment while the Court is seized of the matter than about the propriety of an outgoing government doing it. The petitioner has challenged the rules under which the search committee only scrutinises those applications forwarded to it. There were also >serious questions of propriety rightly raised by the main Opposition party, the BJP, as the country is in the middle of a general election. The Lok Pal Bill mustered the numbers in Parliament with great difficulty, and the haste in pushing through an appointment would have negated all the spadework done so far. The very fact that the case is pending should have kept the Government back from proceeding with the matter. The Lok Pal selection process has had its share of controversies, including the problems that resulted in the resignation of the head of the search committee, the former Supreme Court Judge, K.T. Thomas, and of Fali S. Nariman, a member. It is only proper that the first Lok Pal of independent India does not start his or her tenure under a cloud of procedural controversies. There are practical issues too. With Chief Justice P. Sathasivam’s retirement and the constitution of a new government, a new-look selection committee will take charge. It should be the task of the new committee to deal with the issues.
On the other hand, just >as a new Chief of the Naval Staff was appointed after the electoral process had begun, after referring the matter to the Election Commission, the process of appointment of the Chief of the Army Staff has been cleared by the Commission. In the case of the Navy, there had been a vacancy at the top for some weeks, but the Army chief would be retiring in June. It has been a longstanding practice to appoint a successor two months before a chief lays down office. A former Army chief and the BJP have reservations about a likely candidate, that need to be considered. Here the main issue is suitability, not timing, and unless there are concerns over conduct and professional responsibility — which the government would be in the best position to judge in this case — the normal criteria combining seniority and merit must be applied. The BJP’s objections merit careful consideration and a cautious approach that cannot, however, be pushed to the point of paralysis. It is important that a one-million-plus-strong professional Army is not allowed to remain in continued uncertainty about its head.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/appointments-and-propriety/article5948468.ece
26,4,2014,Preparing for a poor monsoon,"With an El Niño brewing, there is disquiet over what that might mean for the coming monsoon. Many droughts experienced by this country have, after all, been associated with the exceptional warming of the equatorial waters of the Pacific that is characteristic of an El Niño. The forecast issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Thursday is in line with other predictions that warn of poor rains this year. Using a statistical model, the met agency has put a 33 per cent probability of the monsoon being ‘below normal’, a category where nationwide rainfall during the season is between 90 per cent and 96 per cent of the long-period average. That is almost twice the climatological probability based on how the monsoon fared in past years. The IMD forecast, however, also indicates a significantly enhanced risk this year of nationwide rainfall during the monsoon slipping below 90 per cent of the long-period average and turning ‘deficient’. Such a monsoon would, in the parlance used by atmospheric scientists, be considered as having ended in a drought.
There is already a substantial body of unusually warm water below the surface in the tropical Pacific; this water, if it comes to the surface, can trigger an El Niño. The IMD has placed a 60 per cent probability of such an event occurring during the monsoon season. It must be borne in mind that not every El Niño leads to a drought over India. Indeed, an analysis found that the monsoon became deficient in only 43 per cent of the El Niño events that took place between 1880 and 2005. Although an El Niño looks probable this year, it is not yet possible to say how big it might turn out to be. Moreover, the fact of which part of the Pacific warms also influences its impact on the monsoon. El Niño events where the surface waters of the central Pacific heat up have been found to retard the monsoon more than ones where the eastern Pacific warms. In addition, favourable conditions in the Indian Ocean can counter any adverse influence from the Pacific. That famously happened in 1997 when, despite an exceptionally strong El Niño, the country enjoyed slightly above average rains. This year, there is no indication as yet that the Indian Ocean might lend a helping hand. Even if no drought ensues, an El Niño can seriously reduce rainfall, particularly during the opening and closing phases of the monsoon. For agriculture especially, the distribution of rainfall across the season is vital. With the possibility of a bad monsoon this year, water conservation and the harvesting of as much rainwater as feasible become particularly important. For its part, the new government that will be voted to power in Delhi must prepare for any eventuality.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/preparing-for-a-poor-monsoon/article5948470.ece
28,4,2014,Revisiting the law on remission,"An administrative decision that appeared to be a politically partisan misadventure has now become an opportunity for the judiciary to revisit the law. The Supreme Court has referred to a Constitution Bench the issues arising out of the >Tamil Nadu government’s attempt to release the seven life convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. The State government’s decision to release them was made a day after the Supreme Court commuted the death sentences of three of them in February on account of the long delay in disposing of their mercy petitions to the President. The State’s announcement touched a raw nerve in the Congress-led Union government, which >challenged its legality. A three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice P. Sathasivam had reserved orders on the scope of the provisions relating to grant of remission and it was expected that an unambiguous verdict would be delivered. However, the Court has found enough reasons to let the matter be decided by a larger Bench, as the existing body of case law does not present a clear picture on several questions. One immediate consequence of the Bench framing seven substantial questions of law is that the matter now seems less of a political and emotive issue than when the attempt was made to fast-track their freedom.
One may wonder whether the Bench could not have referred the matter to a Constitution Bench at an earlier stage itself, or it could not have laid down the law on whether the State government was the appropriate government to invoke the power of remission to convicts who had been prosecuted by the Central Bureau of Investigation but convicted under sections of the Indian Penal Code and some Central laws. The 40-page order of the three-Judge Bench makes it amply clear that several issues had been raised during the arguments and that only a Constitution Bench could provide clear and final answers. The Court has asked for an authoritative pronouncement on whether ‘life imprisonment’ means ‘imprisonment for the rest of one’s life’; and whether it was time that a special category of sentence — imprisonment for life or a term in excess of 14 years without any remission — can be created for cases in which the death penalty is deemed excessive and the regular life term with scope for remission after 14 years seems inadequate; and whether remission is still available to those whose sentences were commuted to life either by the President or the Governor or by the Supreme Court in judicial review. This is a case in which the Court will have to evaluate the competing merits of multiple considerations: adequacy of punishment, right of release after prolonged incarceration and the need to lay down a process for exercising the sovereign power of remission.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/revisiting-the-law-on-remission/article5953705.ece
28,4,2014,Ensuring accuracy of rolls,"The shocking state of affairs revealed by reports of several lakh names of >voters missing from the electoral rolls in Maharashtra, mainly from the country’s financial capital, Mumbai, in the most recent phase of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, has raised troubling questions about the efficiency of the process of periodic electoral rolls revision, inclusion of new voters who have attained 18 years of age, and special enrolment drives and camps periodically organised by the election authorities before a general election or byelection. The irony weighs even more heavily on the popular mind as the Election Commission of India (ECI) way back in 1993 not only initiated the issue of Electors Photo Identity Cards (EPIC), but also followed it up with computerisation of the entire electoral rolls in a phased manner. States like Kerala and Tamil Nadu went a step further in publishing ‘photo electoral rolls’ (displaying the image of every voter on the rolls on printed sheets in all the Assembly constituencies). Such measures, including the more recent online registration of voters, were meant to ensure a near-foolproof voters list over a period of time, besides eliminating impersonation and bogus voting.
Nonetheless, for all the application of latest information technology tools — as recently as April 8 this year the ECI launched a national-level online ‘electoral roll search’ that could be used by voters even from their smartphones to search their names on the rolls — there are still thousands of instances of names of citizens who have been long-time residents at a given address being struck off the rolls. It is a grim reminder that technology cannot be a substitute for care, verification and proper supervision of the process. Burgeoning urbanisation, with people frequently shifting residences, or large numbers of migrant workers moving to cities, calls for a great deal of care to ensure that all eligible voters are included. The process of inclusion and deletion has perforce to be decentralised at the ward level, and the changes made by authorised officials linked to a real-time database that can quickly reflect these changes. This should be possible as the EPIC gives a unique number to every registered voter. Address-change verification processes could also be made citizen-friendly: long lists of apparently missing names that are stuck on house doors often go unnoticed. The distribution of booth slips by the ECI helps those on the rolls find their polling booths. It is an innovation that has flowed from the system of distribution of slips adopted by political parties whose stakes in the elections are high and who are keen to bring in the voters. It is equally important that staying on the rolls or getting on to them is not made a tedious or burdensome task.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ensuring-accuracy-of-rolls/article5953706.ece
29,4,2014,Safeguarding temple treasures,"The phenomenal treasures found in the vaults of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple in Thiruvananthapuram three years ago are back in the spotlight, but not for good reasons. The amicus curiae appointed by the Supreme Court, after a 35-day inspection, made sharp remarks about “pilferage” of precious objects and financial irregularities in the temple. The temple authorities and the State have been asked to file their responses. However, finding the state of affairs disturbing, the >Supreme Court has appointed a new committee to manage the temple in an interim arrangement. The disquieting conclusion, it appears, is that the temple and its treasures face more threats from its own inept administrators than from any scheming thieves. Questions about the management of the Padmanabhaswamy temple have been around for some time. Mounting public concern led to a long legal battle, and in 2011 the Supreme Court appointed an expert committee to oversee the inventory of treasures. When the committee inspected five of the six vaults in the temple, the vast amounts of jewels and antiquities came to public notice for the first time. The documentation of these objects is on. In 2012, the Court appointed >Gopal Subramaniam, a former Solicitor-General, as amicus curiae in the case. In his second report he has recommended that the present administration, which includes a member of the erstwhile royal family of Travancore, be replaced as a part of corrective measures.
How to protect temple properties and endowments and give primacy to the public interest are challenges facing not only the Padmanabhaswamy temple but also many others. A few years ago, the Andhra Pradesh High Court had to intervene to ensure that a proper inventory is made of the precious jewels of the Sree Venkateswara temple in Tirumala. Instances of poor accounting of offerings and income, and lax recovery of dues from temple properties, abound. Unfortunately, most temple administrators have not done much to attend to such concerns or reassure the worshipping public. Some of the temple managements, instead of embracing change, have tried to resist reforms in administration, viewing them as interference in religious affairs. The settled position in law is that the secular functions of a temple are open to public regulation. One reason behind the practice of recognising idols as juristic persons who can own properties is to prevent administrators from holding endowments in their own names and prevent misappropriation. Temples are not private fiefdoms, but places of public worship. While proper religious observances are not to be interfered with, there must be a system of public accountability in the management of the secular affairs of temples.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/safeguarding-temple-treasures/article5956978.ece
29,4,2014,Contradictions to the fore,"The >April 23 decision by Hamas and Fatah, the Palestine Liberation Organisation, to unite with a view to forming a government in five weeks has rightly refocussed attention on the >Israel-Palestine issue. The two parties have in effect governed, respectively, Gaza and parts of the West Bank since 2006; each has its own security forces, and tensions have been severe. For example, in the West Bank the Palestinian Authority has cooperated with Israel to arrest and jail members of Hamas and its associate group, the Islamic Jihad. Secondly, the new pact would involve the recognition of Israel within the 1967 borders, the renunciation of violence, and the acceptance of previous Palestinian-Israeli agreements as well as Fatah-Hamas agreements such as those reached in Cairo in 2011 and Doha in 2012. Elections are to be held at least six months after the forthcoming talks, to form a new government. The context, however, remains volatile. Hamas has consistently refused to recognise Israel, and both Fatah and Hamas face internal problems. Mahmoud Abbas, whose status as Fatah leader is at best questionable, may feel he needs a mandate from all Palestinians; for his part, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh faces an economic and political crisis following the Egyptian military junta’s crackdown on Hamas’s ally, the Muslim Brotherhood; Cairo has also blocked off vital supply tunnels into Gaza, and Mr. Haniyeh has little control over militant factions.
The key international reaction, that of the United States, has been predictably one-sided. President Barack Obama, currently brokering talks which have lasted eight months and were due to conclude this week, says the pact is “unhelpful” and calls for a “pause” in the talks. Mr. Obama echoes, less aggressively, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who accuses Fatah of allying with a “murderous terrorist organisation” that wants to destroy Israel. Tel Aviv, however, also says it cannot deal with a divided Palestinian movement. Hamas is the elected ruling party of the Palestinian people, having won the 2006 election, but Israel has suspended the talks. It also continues construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Hamas’s incapacity to control sub-groups will enable Tel Aviv to continue with collective punishment against Gazans for largely ineffective rocket attacks. Furthermore, Mr. Netanyahu insists Israel be recognised as a Jewish state; nothing short of that. The Fatah-Hamas pact may show desperation, but Israel seems to get everything it wants, irrespective of the contradictions therein. The continuing tragedy is that of four million Palestinians, for whom the only country which could make a difference, the U.S., does nothing.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/contradictions-to-the-fore/article5956980.ece
30,4,2014,The road to safety,"India’s roads have acquired a reputation, quite deservedly, of being the most dangerous in the world. Rapid motorisation and fast-paced economic activity over several years have been accompanied by an annual toll of nearly 140,000 accident fatalities; injuries are estimated to be 15 to 20 times the number of deaths. In absolute numbers, more people die in road accidents in India than in any other country. Apart from the human dimension of the tragedy, avoidable death and disability seriously affect economic progress — by some estimates, 3 per cent of GDP is lost in a year due to the carnage. The recent decision of the Supreme Court to appoint a three-member committee to suggest ways to prevent road accidents and ensure accountability offers some hope that a new government at the Centre will be compelled to address the issue as an emergency. It is not as if suggestions for improvements for enhanced safety have not been proposed earlier. The Sundar Committee constituted by the Centre called for an apex agency to be created to assess all aspects of road safety, and to address the lacuna in scientific accident investigation. Although the recommendation was made seven years ago, it has failed to take off. Indians are travelling more miles per capita today, and are at high risk for injury or worse.
Unsafe transport, including services operated by government agencies, are a major part of the problem. Several ghastly accidents involving public transport vehicles have been reported, but the State governments involved have shown little sense of accountability. They routinely challenge even claims for compensation. Their response to the need for improved infrastructure has been woefully weak. In its recent report, the National Transport Development Policy Committee headed by Rakesh Mohan suggested that national, State and local-level institutions be set up, with responsibility to address the issue of safety. There is an urgent need to form these committees, and appoint professionals to them. They must be empowered to upgrade driver-licensing practices, road systems, public lighting and signage. Accident investigation, which remains a neglected area, requires a thorough overhaul, and CCTVs can help determine the cause of mishaps. Also, the neglect of the public district hospital network in most States, and the high cost of treatment at private hospitals affect access to good trauma care for accident victims. The right to life demands that the Central and State governments provide medical facilities at a proximate institution free of cost to all. The Supreme Court panel must give road accidents the status of a public health issue that has acquired alarming proportions. Reform to improve road safety cannot be delayed any longer.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-road-to-safety/article5960266.ece
30,4,2014,The tasks ahead,"Amid the ongoing rounds of high-voltage electioneering, a statement by Finance Minister P. Chidambaram deserves closer scrutiny. It is not for the first time that Mr. Chidambaram has painted a rosy picture of the economy that he will bequeath to his successor. The two specific achievements claimed by him — a spectacular turnaround in the current account and containing the previously intractable fiscal deficit — are as well known as they are contestable. On the face of it, the government can claim credit for getting a handle on the current account deficit. During the last year the CAD at $88 billion, or 4.8 per cent of GDP, threatened macroeconomic stability. Policymakers seemed to have run out of ideas to, for instance, stem the sharp depreciation of the rupee. The government hopes to announce a dramatic reduction in the CAD >to about $32 billion, or 1.7 per cent of GDP, when figures for March 2014 are announced. On fiscal deficit, the Finance Minister has said that the self-imposed “red line” will not be breached and that the deficit will be contained within 4.6 per cent as budgeted for. These would be considered impressive feats, except that it is the quality of contraction — in the CAD and in fiscal consolidation — that matters more than the numbers.
That the sharp fall in the CAD is due to an aggressive clampdown on gold imports, by far the largest component of imports, is well-known. The restrictions on gold imports cannot last indefinitely. There is already substantial evidence that a large part of the gold trade is shifting underground, a development that will have serious consequences for society at large. A part of the insatiable demand for gold can be moderated by developing easy-to-invest savings instruments that offer returns that beat inflation. Also, the claim of containing the deficit loses much of its gloss if one realises that the contraction is not due to the sustained rise in exports but due to a fall in non-oil imports. The latter is an unmistakable sign of a slowdown, something which is not quite comforting. On fiscal consolidation, it is known that expenditure including Plan expenditure has been compressed, and besides there have been some dodgy practices of pushing items of expenditure to the following year and taking credit for receipts which in the normal course are not available during the period under reference. The arguments for greater transparency in government finances are familiar, but need to be restated to place the macroeconomy in its proper perspective. Among other challenges, the new government will have very little time to present its budget by July. While the economy is not in any crisis, the overall situation is not very comforting either.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-tasks-ahead/article5960267.ece
1,5,2014,Mid-course manoeuvres,"Any confusion about tactics and goals midway through a battle is often indicative of the fear of failure in the midst of uncertainty. When the multi-phase election process is in an advanced stage, the Congress is suddenly talking in different voices about the prospects of a non-BJP government with a greater role for regional parties. While some voices within the party want to support the still-amorphous third front from the outside in government-formation, others want the party to join any government that requires its support. A few others, who are not willing to concede defeat so soon, are hopeful that the smaller parties could be persuaded to support a Congress-led government. Maharashtra Chief Minister >Prithviraj Chavan was the first among the senior leaders of the party to talk about a Congress-backed third front government in the event of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance failing to get an absolute majority. Mr. Chavan, while articulating his hope that potential allies of the BJP would not want Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister, ended up giving the impression that the Congress was willing to back a non-BJP government without joining it if only to keep “communal forces” out. Union Minister Jairam Ramesh, however, >wanted the Congress to be part of a third front government in a situation where neither the BJP-led NDA nor the Congress-led UPA had the necessary numbers. If Mr. Chavan and Mr. Ramesh appeared comfortable with the idea of the Congress not leading such a non-BJP government, another senior leader, Digvijaya Singh, went back to the original party line that the dominant party, read the Congress, should lead the government.
While this induced debate on government-formation is unlikely to influence voting decisions in the remaining phases, the Congress might have succeeded in opening up channels of communication with the regional parties in the post-election scenario. Also, the bargaining powers of the regional parties vis-à-vis the BJP would have been strengthened by this third front debate. At the very least, the Congress must be hoping that its implicit willingness to engage with the regional parties without any pre-conditions could make things more difficult for Mr. Modi. The Congress has conceded too much to its potential post-poll allies even before the elections are over; but this must have seemed a small price to pay for making it difficult for the BJP to find new allies after the election. The desperation shows, but the Congress would not worry too much so long as it can add to the discomfiture of the BJP if the elections throw up a hung Parliament. Most other parties too seem to be keeping their options open, given the uncertainty over the tally of the NDA, which is ahead in the race.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/midcourse-manoeuvres/article5963500.ece
1,5,2014,Lessons from a disaster,"The >resignation of South Korean Prime Minister Chung Hong-won, and a public apology by its President, Park Geun-hye, over a ferry disaster, has not calmed the people of South Korea, grieving over the unexpected death of about 200 students who were on an excursion. > Sewol, the ferry, sank on April 16 in southwestern South Korea, engulfing the country in sorrow, which quickly turned into anger against the government. Heads of state and heads of government are not directly involved in the implementation of safety standards, but that did not prevent people from expressing their rage against the country’s leadership: the President was heckled and wreaths sent by her to the school in Ansan in south of Seoul were returned by the inconsolable families. What appears to have angered the people the most is the lack of urgency exhibited by those responsible for handling the emergency response system: the ferry took two-and-a-half hours to sink fully, and yet only 174 people were saved. The fury has not subsided even after the announcement by the President that she would establish a Federal agency to handle rescue efforts during major disasters. Her government would also act to end the nexus between the regulatory agencies and industries, which breeds corruption and overlooks obvious lapses in safety standards enforcement. It is still not clear what caused the accident, but the South Korean leadership has, as an immediate response, initiated steps to make sure that such incidents do not recur.
Underlying the tragedy is the familiar tale of fraud and inefficiency, shockingly poor work ethics and indifferent people in positions of leadership, unenforced rules governing public services and sloppy, or worse, laidback, regulators. The failures get compounded as industry watchdogs, instead of working to boost the faith of the people in the system, chose instead to work on maximising profits. In short, this accident could happen anywhere in the world where such conditions exist. In this case, when the ferry left Incheon on April 15, it was top-heavy with cabins recently added to its upper deck. There are reports of overloading of cargo. The Korean Shipping Association regulates shipping, and it is obvious that the industry body had overlooked serious irregularities under its watch. Similar stories abound in many countries, including India. There are many lessons to be drawn from the disaster in South Korea. For instance, it should be a basic tenet that the industry and regulator should not be from the same pool of talent. It is time for governments to put in place measures to reward compliance and deal firmly with violators of basic safety standards who put lives at risk.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lessons-from-a-disaster/article5963501.ece
2,5,2014,Sour turn in India-EU trade,"The ban imposed by the European Union on the import of Alphonso mangoes and four varieties of vegetables from India until December 2015 after some consignments were found infested with “non-European fruit flies” has naturally upset India. As the biggest producer of the golden fruit, India sends about 70,000 tonnes of mangoes abroad every year. Yet, merely insisting that the 28-member bloc’s action is “unilateral… without any meaningful official consultation,” as Commerce Minister Anand Sharma has done, will not do. The EU had notified India in March of its concerns. Whether the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, which is tasked with ensuring that items of export are compliant in terms of sanitary and phyto-sanitary standards as set down by importing countries, was able to fully address them effectively, remains unclear. It is also to be noted that scores of consignments of mangoes and vegetables shipped in 2013 had been found to be contaminated. Periodic problems that come up with respect to shrimp exports over contamination concerns, are relevant here. India certainly needs to put in place fool-proof mechanisms for the examination and certification of export commodities to remove such taints once and for all. Necessary correctives need to be worked out with the involvement of technical and scientific bodies in order that in the lucrative but competitive export markets the country would establish its reputation as a reliable partner meeting health and phyto-sanitary standards.
On its part, the EU should ensure that any cause for a perception of its decision being an unfair one which smacks of a punitive approach and that would potentially jeopardise India-EU trade, is avoided. As the Minister has pointed out, the ongoing negotiations for a broad-based India-EU trade and investment agreement is based on the premise of trust and understanding to put in place a more liberal trade regime. Brussels should note Indian domestic concerns and invoke the necessary correctives on the basis of an appropriate assessment of risks. If it is indeed possible that sections of the EU bureaucracy see here a leveraging factor in the context of talks on a Free Trade Agreement, as also other bilateral issues, that will amount to unfairness. Although Europe is not a major market for Indian mangoes — it accounts for 16 million tonnes annually — any ban typically pulls down prices. About 80 per cent of the exports from India go to West Asia. What India should do is to strengthen its bargaining position by raising export standards and leave no quarter to be found remiss. The entire ecosystem for exports, involving farmers, packers and exporters of agri-commodities, should be geared to meet the quality and safety requirements of countries across the world.
***
>Editorial writer’s clarification: “Total Indian exports to EU countries in 2012-13 was only 4,071 tonnes. The figure of 16 million mentioned was not in terms of tonnes but absolute number of mangoes exported to the United Kingdom alone. Total exports of mangoes from India in 2012-13 added up to only 55,584.98 tonnes (according to data from the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority), and it is unlikely that the figure would go up to 70,000 tonnes this year.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sour-turn-in-indiaeu-trade/article5966709.ece
2,5,2014,Signs of helplessness,"As Ukraine slides steadily towards civil war, the sanctions announced by the United States and the European Union go further than previous attempts but show no results on the ground. On April 28, Washington announced measures against companies, officials, and wealthy businesspeople with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government, and the following day the European Union announced sanctions against 15 Russian and Ukrainian officials including General Valery Gerasimov, Russia’s chief of military staff, and Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, who is tasked with developing Crimea, the Ukrainian province annexed by Moscow on March 1. Among the Ukrainians named, presumably for asset freezes and travel bans, are the pro-Russian Igor Strelkov, an adviser to Crimean Prime Minister Sergei Aksyonov, and Sergei Tsyplakov, reportedly the head of the People’s Militia in Ukraine’s Donbass region. The U.S. sanctions are wider than the European ones, targeting businesses and individuals; 17 companies are involved, mainly in oil and gas, construction and finance. The most notable target is Igor Sechin, president of the Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft; the financial services firm Visa will have to suspend credit card services to Bank Rossiya and other banks.
The sanctions, however, are less severe than they look, and could cause problems for western firms, which may be able to keep shares in Russian companies whose senior personnel are under sanctions but may be banned from contact with such executives. This could hit BP, which owns 19.75 per cent of Rosneft and has faced huge costs since its 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico; its first-quarter profits are down by 24 per cent. Other firms with Russian interests include Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Shell; in addition, the Russian quasi-state conglomerate Rostec, whose head Sergei Chemezov is under sanctions, manufactures components for Boeing, and a Russian regional airline is set to buy Boeing jets. As for Visa, cardholders will be able to withdraw money. The U.S. and the EU may want to block Mr. Putin’s apparent plan to redraw Ukraine’s eastern border, but Moscow could retaliate with its own sanctions, particularly in oil and gas transactions. Secondly, events in eastern Ukraine are now out of Kiev’s control. On April 28, the pro-Kiev Mayor of Kharkiv, Gennady Kernes, was shot and severely wounded; separatists have occupied regional administration buildings in Luhansk, and the government airbase at Kramatorsk has been repeatedly attacked. The western bloc may so far have avoided stating preferred solutions, but its own impotence over Ukraine is increasingly obvious.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/signs-of-helplessness/article5966707.ece
3,5,2014,The sad state of India’s security,"Every man his own carver, wrote Jonathan Swift. It didn’t take India’s political leaders too many hours to begin slicing what profit could be had from Thursday’s train-bombing in Chennai. The BJP cast the bombing, on the basis of the flimsiest conjecture, as an attempted attack on Chief Minister Narendra Modi; Congress politicians, for their part, threw about innuendo about the perpetrators’ intentions and provenance. Questions about the extent to which the National Investigation Agency, that is controlled by the Central government, ought to be involved in the process of investigation within the State also quickly came to the fore. Lost in the noise was the issue that really matters: why citizens remain so much at danger when they travel, are at their workplaces, or when they are just walking down a crowded market street. Swathi Parachuri, the young woman whose life was extinguished by the bomb explosion, was one of the thousands of Indians who have died at the hands of terrorists. The killing continues though politicians have, for decades, been promising action.
The facts are simple — and make clear the States and the Central government are equally to blame. As the United States State Department noted earlier this week, India’s internal security infrastructure is severely anaemic. In spite of the massive expansion of police manpower and large investments in technology after 26/11, training standards and personnel skills are well behind minimal acceptable standards. In areas involving specialist skills, like forensics, acute staffing deficits are evident. Last year, The Hindu revealed that the intelligence services, the cutting edge of the country’s counter-terrorism efforts, were yet to fill staffing deficits of up to 33 per cent, a full five years after the Mumbai carnage. The case of the Railway Protection Force, tasked with protecting trains and tracks along with the State government-controlled Government Railway Police, is illustrative. Though the 65,000-strong force has grown steadily in numbers over the last decade, instances of serious crime occurring around the railway system — murder, rape and burglaries — are all up. Even where infrastructure exists for frisking passengers and luggage, it is utilised only cursorily. The same story unfolds in cities around the country, where ill-trained personnel wave metal-detectors over cars or people carrying metal objects — and simply ignore the beeping. The situation has not changed because political leaders and bureaucrats simply don’t care enough about the issue to ensure that police forces are adequately equipped and trained to discharge their functions. The situation won’t change until citizens start holding those in office to higher standards of accountability.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-sad-state-of-indias-security/article5970624.ece
3,5,2014,Egyptians betrayed,"The April 28 ruling in which an Egyptian judge, >Saeed Youssef El Gazar, sentenced 683 people to death, including the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohammed Badie, is the second such in just over a month, and follows a March 24 verdict in which 529 people were sentenced to death in another blanket decision. The judge later commuted 492 of those sentences to life imprisonment. The prosecutions were brought over the killings of policemen in the southern province of Minya on August 14, 2013, the day on which the police killed hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood supporters in Cairo. Observers, such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have fiercely criticised both trials; the proceedings lasted only a few hours in all, and the judge barred all defence evidence. The defence lawyers are bewildered; one says 60 per cent of the defendants, who include teachers and doctors, have evidence to show that they were not even present when the police station was attacked, and that he was given 3,500 pages of documents only 15 minutes before the trial. Another, who has 6,000 pages of case material, says the judge cannot possibly have read the papers in the time he took to reach the verdicts. Many of the defendants insist they are not supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood but were reported to the police by people acting on personal agendas. Relatives of those sentenced, some of whom are being held incommunicado 700 km from their homes, are distraught.
All the sentences will be appealed before the country’s highest Islamic authority, the Grand Mufti; a decision is expected in June. The trials, however, have focussed international attention on the Egyptian judicial process and on the military junta which overthrew the elected President, Mohamed Morsy, in July 2013. Domestic observers say the judicial system is so bad that fairness — of a sort — tends to appear only at the appeal stage. Secondly, the Cairo regime depends heavily on aid from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait, all of which are very hostile to the Muslim Brotherhood; the three countries have given Cairo $12 billion in recent years. Members of the U.S. Congress have started moves to block some of Washington’s $1.5 billion annual aid to Egypt, but the Obama administration has cleared the delivery of attack helicopters to it. The sentences have been handed down irrespective of the defendants’ faith or political background, if any; that implies strongly that Acting President Adly Mansour’s military-dominated regime intends to crush all dissent. For all Egyptians, not only those who in January 2011 challenged and then ended Hosni Mubarak’s brutal 30-year rule, this amounts to a bitter betrayal.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/egyptians-betrayed/article5970626.ece
5,5,2014,Commissions of discord,"Often a ruse resorted to by governments to quieten rumblings set off by politically embarrassing controversies, the appointment of commissions of inquiry inspire little confidence among the public. There is a general perception that these commissions toe the line of the regime that appoints them. On the legal side, they can only come up with fact-finding reports that need not be accepted by the government of the day. In this backdrop, the ongoing bickering between the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party over the UPA government’s apparent desire to appoint a judge to head a commission to inquire into the Gujarat surveillance case is only of propaganda value. An inquiry ordered by a regime at the fag end of its tenure — especially after four-fifths of the general election is over — against the principal leader of the rival political formation will command little credibility. Secondly, the commission itself may not take off in the two weeks left for counting to take place. It needs a presiding officer and a secretariat, and must be given time to make a list of people to whom statutory notices will have to be sent. If the same party or alliance is returned to power, the process may continue, but otherwise it may make little headway after the elections.
BJP leaders have said that even though the decision to order a judicial inquiry was made in December 2013, the government has been unable to find a judge to head the panel. Their claims that no judge is likely to take up the matter at this stage of the electoral process, and that the next regime will review such decisions, have added to the political colour the episode has taken. The government’s stand that it has the power to name the head of the panel anytime before May 16, when counting is due to begin, ought to be backed by an explanation for the delay in appointing the commission. There can be no dispute that the matter to be probed represents a serious political, legal and moral issue. And that the probe ordered earlier by the Gujarat government also lacks credibility as it has made little headway. The only thing that can be said with any moral and legal certainty is that the parties should avoid giving the impression that they are using the issue to score political points. The main questions — why and on whose orders a young woman was kept under surveillance both within Gujarat and outside, whether it was done with her consent and on a request from her father, and whether the legal provisions providing safeguards against indiscriminate telephone tapping were complied with — remain unanswered. The whiff of political controversy should not take public attention away from the issues of privacy and state surveillance on private citizens that this episode has raised.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/commissions-of-discord/article5975902.ece
5,5,2014,Unsafe supply chains,"One year on, an inescapable lesson for the world’s leading garment retailers from the building collapse in Dhaka in April 2013 is to take a broader view on the enforcement of labour standards across supply chains. For it is the total absence of safety measures that has stood out above all as the single most critical factor behind the collapse of the eight-storeyed building in which more than 1,000 workers were killed. Global big brands have over the years shown greater sensitivity on the ethical implications of exploiting child labour, thanks to the pressure of public opinion in North America and Western Europe. A rise in school enrolments during this period across the developing world may have been an indirect fallout of removing children from many hazardous occupations. But the catastrophe last year in the world’s second largest garment exporting country may have called into question the somewhat narrow understanding of the aspects that constitute unfair trade practices. Given the combustible nature of cotton and most other synthetic fibres, the comprehensive lack of safety regulation may explain the recurrence of fires in recent years in garment factories in Bangladesh, which number over 5,000. The official report after the April 2013 incident in fact suggested that the tragedy was waiting to happen. The approach of the European Union and the United States to restrict their preferential trade measures after the gruesome incident can at best be described as reactive. This is especially the case considering that they are the two largest markets that source garments from Bangladesh.
The 2013 tragedy also exposed legal lacunae that have hampered the effective functioning of trade unions and the protection of workers. While the government has introduced amendments to labour laws, factory owners are said to be retaliating against the assertion of the rights of workers to organise. Such a hostile approach can only prove detrimental to the long-term interests of this sector and the entire economy of Bangladesh. The legally-binding safety accord signed by 125 largely European retailers after the April 2013 incident is undoubtedly significant. However, survivors of the disaster continue to face a bleak scenario as less than 40 per cent has been realised to the targeted contributions to the fund chaired by the International Labour Organisation for relief and rehabilitation. The task before the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is to enforce better inspection, monitoring and compliance with overall safety regulation and to act decisively against vested interests. That would serve the larger interest of greater stability, which is no small consideration for a growing economy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unsafe-supply-chains/article5975904.ece
6,5,2014,Lessons from Assam’s carnage,"The killing of over 30 people, most of them Muslim women and children, across >Assam’s Bodoland Territorial Area District (BTAD) is a deadly reminder of systematic efforts towards ethnic cleansing that is under way in that area. The National Democratic Front of Boroland (Songbijit), fighting for a “Sovereign Boroland” to be carved out of Assam, remains the natural and principal suspect for the carnage: it was behind the violence between the indigenous ethnic Bodo community and the erstwhile East Bengal-origin Muslims who generally speak Assamese and certain Bengali dialects that erupted in July-August 2012, leading to the killing of more than a hundred people and the displacement of about 4.85 lakh. But the difference this time is that the atmosphere has been vitiated seriously in the context of elections. In a manifesto released for Assam in April, the State BJP unit made a potentially incendiary promise that it would identify and expel all illegal immigrants staying in Assam — but with a caveat. It promised to protect Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and members of the Scheduled Castes who have come there from Bangladesh following “religious, political and social persecution”, and not to treat them as illegal migrants. In such a context, it is hardly surprising that oblique and not-so-oblique statements have been made by different political leaders linking the BJP’s stance on such a sensitive topic, and the recrudescence of violence in the BTAD.
The Assam Police have put the blame on the NDFB (Songbijit). Meanwhile, survivors claimed to have identified some of the attackers as surrendered militants of the erstwhile Bodo Liberation Tigers (BLT). The Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), formed by former leaders of the BLT, that holds the reins of the Bodoland Territorial Council, is also a coalition partner of the Congress in Assam but has indicated it might team up with the BJP, post-election. Significantly, BPF legislator Pramila Rani Brahma had alleged that its candidate for the Kokrajhar constituency was likely to lose as a majority of Muslims did not vote for him. The constituency has about six lakh Bodo voters, nine lakh non-Bodo voters, and four lakh Muslim voters. Narrow election-related interests have complicated the situation, yet it is important that the investigating agencies are able to identify the culprits and reassure the migrant communities of the safety of their lives and property. Urgent steps are needed to ensure their security and protection. Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi’s government should be held to account for the repeated failure in checking the violence, even as it remains under the cloud of militancy that looms over the State. For a start, the government should initiate a process of vulnerability mapping in areas that could see further trouble down the line.
Correction and Clarifications
In the above article, the reference to the ""Urdu-speaking minority community"" in the context of the 2012 killings in Assam’s Bodoland Territorial Area District was wrong. They should have been referred to as ""erstwhile East Bengal-origin Muslims who generally speak Assamese and certain Bengali dialects.""",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lessons-from-assams-carnage/article5979224.ece
6,5,2014,Another wake-up call,"In yet another accident that has hit the Railways, at least 21 passengers were killed and nearly 150 injured when the engine and four coaches overturned after a >derailment in Raigad district of Maharashtra on Sunday. The surprising factor was that the engine itself derailed as the Diva-Sawantwadi Road passenger train emerged out of a tunnel, some 120 km from Mumbai, in broad daylight. Always quick on follow-up, the Railways swung into action on rescue and relief operations, payment of compensation and the announcement of an inquiry by the Commissioner of Railway Safety. It took some time for the authorities to clear the main line on the Konkan Railway route because of the impact of the derailment. Considering that it was nearly 10 a.m. and the passengers were awake, and that it was a passenger train, the casualty level seems to be on the high side. Four coaches had overturned — and photographs showed the full impact of the derailment — but the deaths should have been caused by the crush of materials in the coaches. Escaping from the coach may not have been too difficult at that point of time; the Railways must make more room for emergency exits in each compartment. The detailed probe by the Commissioner of Railway Safety should throw more light on what caused the derailment.
Preliminary reports from the accident site point to a possible rail fracture at the spot. Perhaps welded joints gave way. Normally, gangmen examine a certain length of the railway line twice a day. Depending on the location, each gangman may have to oversee a length of about 8 km. How did the engine crew fail to sight the fracture? Was the train going faster than the permissible limit? The reason for the fracture, and why this was not seen or reported by the person in charge of that area, will need close examination. There have been enough probes by successive Commissioners of Railway Safety inquiring into different accidents across the country. What is more, the Kakodkar committee appointed by the Government of India to look at all aspects of railway safety, submitted a very detailed report with exhaustive recommendations. Issues of funding have also been addressed to finance a wide range of safety measures to be implemented in the railway system. That being the case, it is surprising that the Centre and the Railways do not seem to be taking safety and security on the wheels seriously enough. Derailments will surely come under the category of avoidable accidents, and the zonal railways must be pulled up if they are not monitoring railway tracks constantly and carefully enough. It is unfortunate that even repeated accidents do not spur the Railways into more serious action to address safety issues.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/another-wakeup-call/article5979225.ece
7,5,2014,Divisive tactics again,"That the Bharatiya Janata Party and its prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi invoked Lord Ram at an election meeting in Faizabad, the twin city of Ayodhya, was no surprise at all. The real surprise was that Mr. Modi and his party had chosen not to make the construction of the Ram Mandir — at the site where the Babri Masjid once stood in Ayodhya — one of the central points of their campaign so far. With a picture of Lord Ram and the proposed temple forming the backdrop to the stage, Mr. Modi could not have politically passed up the opportunity to mention Ram in his speech. But the legal consequences are as clear as the political calculations: under Section 123(3) of the Representation of the People Act, the “use of or appeal to religious symbols” shall be deemed as a corrupt practice. Even if Mr. Modi is seen as not having directly asked the people to vote on the basis of their religion, despite his repeated references to Lord Ram and Ram Rajya, the heavy use of religious symbols on the dais as part of the campaign for the furtherance of the prospects of the candidate may well have contravened the provisions of the Act. Although the Congress has asked the Election Commission to register a first information report against Mr. Modi and de-register the BJP as a political party, corrupt practices as defined under the Act can be agitated only in an election petition before the High Court. The EC has sought a report from the Faizabad district authorities on Mr. Modi’s May 5 rally, but serious action will have to wait until after the election.
Although the Ram Mandir issue has cropped up only on the last day of the campaign for the penultimate phase, the Faizabad rally is one of the markers of the slow shift of the BJP campaign from issues of development to subjects that have formed the core of the Hindutva agenda. Uttar Pradesh, with 80 seats, is crucial to the fortunes of the BJP, and Mr. Modi and his advisers evidently view communalisation of the discourse as the surest way to undo the caste mobilisation of the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party. When the stakes are high, the BJP seems willing to take greater risks, bordering on the violation of the law and the Model Code of Conduct. If the BJP’s core Hindutva agenda is on the backburner, it is only because of the perceived need to reach out to sections beyond its traditional support base. The party wants to appeal to different sections in different ways, including to some sections in democratically and legally unacceptable ways. As the front-runner in this election, the BJP and its leaders must show greater responsibility and political maturity in taking up sensitive and divisive issues even in the heat and desperation of a campaign.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/divisive-tactics-again/article5983018.ece
7,5,2014,Issues of antibiotic resistance,"For too long, humankind has taken for granted the antibiotics that have held dangerous germs at bay. It was only about 70 years ago that penicillin, the world’s first antibiotic, came into widespread use and revolutionised medicine. Its discoverer, Alexander Fleming, who won the Nobel Prize for his work, presciently warned that disease-causing organisms would become resistant if the drug was improperly used. And that is just what has transpired. Although more antibiotics were subsequently discovered, these drugs have been given with such profligacy that pathogens resistant to them have evolved and spread with alarming rapidity. ‘Superbugs’ resistant to almost all antibiotics have become a problem, raising worries of a return to the bad old days if much greater care was not exercised when prescribing existing drugs and sufficient encouragement for finding new ones was lacking. Now, with its first global report on antimicrobial resistance, the World Health Organization has added its voice to the chorus of concern. The report has documented how bacterial resistance to antibiotics, including those of last resort, is a major health issue confronting all regions of the world. Without urgent, coordinated action, “the world is headed for a post-antibiotic era in which common infections and minor injuries, which have been treatable for decades, can once again kill,” Keiji Fukuda, the health agency’s Assistant Director-General for Health Security, has warned. The report also calls for greater emphasis on preventing infections from occurring, such as with better hygiene and by improving access to sanitation and clean water.
For India, preventing antibiotic resistance from spiralling has to be a matter of urgency. The healthcare burden placed by bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which have become resistant to many antibiotics and cause difficult-to-treat infections, is already quite substantial. Bacteria that have acquired a ‘New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM)’ gene are resistant to even last-resort carbapenem antibiotics, forcing doctors to turn to colistin, a drug that is more than 50 years old. Halting the indiscriminate use of antibiotics is vital. The Union Government has taken an important first step in that direction by introducing a stringent rule that prohibits medical stores from selling 24 key antibiotics without a doctor’s prescription. Much more needs to be done, including getting doctors to prescribe antibiotics only when essential. Hospitals must pay attention to proper infection control. In a country so large and populous, with widely differing levels of healthcare reach, curbing the rise of antibiotic resistance is not easy. But it must be done.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/issues-of-antibiotic-resistance/article5983017.ece
13,5,2014,A sense of relief,"What should have been a moment of voters’ pride, as the Election Commission of India (ECI) on Monday pulled off yet another miracle in concluding a nine-phase, five-week long mammoth exercise to elect 543 members to the 16th Lok Sabha, turned out to be mildly problematic. It came on top of the frenzied protests and rallies by the key political players over the past week in Varanasi, which was part of the 41 Parliamentary constituencies that voted last — 18 seats in Uttar Pradesh, 17 in West Bengal and six in Bihar. As a concomitant, in the high-stakes battle in the ancient pilgrim town, where the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi is pitted against Ajai Rai of the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party leader, Arvind Kejriwal, streaks of emotive exuberance and controversy were not entirely unexpected. While the ECI was quick to respond by rushing the Tamil Nadu Chief Electoral Officer, Praveen Kumar, to oversee the electoral process in Varanasi, the bout of intense pre-poll violence ahead of the last phase of election in West Bengal and on polling day was even more worrying, with scores injured in clashes mainly between workers of Trinamool Congress and CPI(M). Overall, the relatively higher turnouts in all the phases of the 2014 general election were comforting, though there were still pockets of low voter-response.
True, even on the last day of polling, the ECI had to take action for violations of the ‘Model Code of Conduct’ — as in the case of Ajay Rai for sporting his party’s symbol as he went to the polling booth. The poll body also faced an unusual endurance test in largely urban Bengal, where it reportedly deployed over 500 companies of Central forces for just 17 constituencies. The previous phase witnessed violent incidents as well, including in Bihar, and in coastal Andhra Pradesh where Assembly elections were held simultaneously before the State’s formal bifurcation. However, this election will stand out for some of its unique features — the ‘None of the Above (NOTA)’ option being incorporated in the Electronic Voting Machines, candidates asked to fill in all columns in their affidavits, and the Railways doing a commendable job in moving polling materials and security personnel in time across the country. Above all, this election, for all the heat and dust it raised, has signed off with an enduring metaphor of Indian democracy itself — 97-year-old Shyam Negi in Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh, the first Indian to vote in free India in October 1951, again casting his vote along with his 92-year-old wife, Hira Mani on May 7 — to keep alive the flame of freedom. Overall, the ECI deserves a great deal of appreciation for a job well done.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-sense-of-relief/article6002032.ece
13,5,2014,Ending cruelty to animals,"By banning jallikattu, the popular bull-taming sport associated with annual harvest festivities in Tamil Nadu, the Supreme Court has made it clear that the law on prevention of cruelty to animals “overshadows or overrides the so-called tradition and culture.” The Court has given primacy to the safety of human participants and animals rather than the argument that jallikattu has cultural and religious significance for the Tamil community. The proscription flows from two principal considerations: the avoidance of cruelty and the continued inability of jallikattu organisers and authorities to avoid injuries and fatalities to human participants and bulls, despite regulations. In the case of jallikattu, it is inherently violent and involves letting bulls run wild with the sole objective of allowing some intrepid youth demonstrate their valour by holding on to the fleeing animals. If Tamil tradition, religion and culture were invoked to justify the continuation of jallikattu, its association with cultural pride had made it politically impossible for local authorities to stop it altogether.
In 2009, Tamil Nadu enacted a law to regulate jallikattu. However, despite its stringent provisions, animal rights activists and the Animal Welfare Board of India continued to see it as nothing but a bull-baiting exercise that perpetrates cruelty. Reports from the field apprised the Supreme Court about deaths and injuries on and off the arena and the different forms of cruelty the animals were subjected to in their training. Organisers and bull owners often argue that they keep the prized animals pampered, comfortable and well-fed. However, it cannot be denied that on the day of the event, the same bulls are kept for hours without food or water, dragged into the narrow passage through which they enter the arena in a terrified or angry state. In this phase, animal rights activists say, the bulls experience cruelty, discomfort, fear and distress. Expanding the notion of rights to animal welfare, the Court has held that the State’s regulatory legislation is merely anthropocentric and has to be struck down as it is repugnant to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, an eco-centric Central law. It is true that jallikattu has imparted colour to culture and tourism in Tamil Nadu and banning it altogether will cause consternation and dismay. There may be sporadic protests and attempts through the political leadership to seek a review of the verdict and arguments that many other practices involving cruelty and danger to life are allowed to continue. However, as in the case of many old traditions that have been given up as repugnant to modern day standards, the State would be better off without this relic from a feudal past.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ending-cruelty-to-animals/article6002031.ece
14,5,2014,Dr. Singh bows out,"A period of looming electoral defeat may not be quite the right time to pass judgement on a 10-year term as Prime Minister. Yet, as Dr. Manmohan Singh lays down office, some tentative, preliminary stocktaking becomes inevitable. Seen as a whole, the 10 years are a mixed record of significant achievements of sound economic management, social harmony and strong public policy action on poverty and the social sector on the one hand, and lapsing into policy paralysis, scams and the loss of the will to govern on the other. His credentials as the architect of the 1991 reforms were an important factor in his being chosen Prime Minister, yet the promise that his elevation held remained only partially fulfilled. Ironically, as Dr. Singh bows out of office, the economy is gripped by a serious slowdown, >inflation is stubborn, >industrial output growth is negative and investment sentiment is at its lowest in recent memory. To be fair, it was not always this bad through the two terms of Dr. Singh. During UPA I, the economy grew at an average of 8.42 per cent (as per Planning Commission data) with 2006-07 seeing a record high of 9.57 per cent growth in GDP. Dr. Singh’s second term though was another story with growth slowing down to an average of 6.70 per cent and falling below 5 per cent in the last two years. The >absence of a strong, assertive prime minister was felt in the aftermath of the spectrum scandal and the coal-blocks allocation scam. If the inability to tailor industry-friendly policies caused disenchantment in the corporate sector, disastrous proposals such as the one on >retrospective taxation led to a loss of confidence among foreign investors. Dr. Singh was more effective in addressing the needs of another constituency — the urban and the rural poor — with an extensive welfare agenda including the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee programme, the Right to Food legislation, the Right to Education Act and laws on forest rights, land acquisition and disabilities.
Dr. Singh’s stewardship of India’s geo-strategic challenges must be given fair marks — though many of his projects have remained works in progress, and future historians may debate if the gains were born of circumstance or strategy. His 10 years in office saw a choking-off of the insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir, helped by pressure mounted by the United States on Pakistan. Dr. Singh, notably, came within a hair’s breadth of an >agreement with Islamabad on the future of Jammu and Kashmir — in broad terms, trading open borders and enhanced autonomy in return for an end to terrorism and recognition of the Line of Control as an international border — but the democratic movement in Pakistan swept away its military ruler, General Musharraf, and with it the prospect of a deal. Dr. Singh’s efforts to improve the relationship with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, meanwhile, saw significant progress before stalling because of opposition from his coalition allies. India’s entry into the G20 was helped along by his standing as an economist and scholar who could engage with ease with world leaders on global economic issues. Dr. Singh’s first term saw an unprecedented deepening of ties with the United States. Despite strains in recent years, those ties are on a firmer footing than ever before. Little noticed, however, Dr. Singh’s years saw a steady reduction of the lethality of India’s little wars at home, from Jammu and Kashmir to the North-East and the Maoist insurgency. It must also be noted, though, that many of his plans to enhance India’s defensive and offensive security infrastructure remained little more than words on paper. Moves to address India’s largest strategic challenge — securing energy to fuel future growth through the >nuclear deal with the U.S., among other initiatives — remain, at best, a work in progress. It was during his tenure, though, that this core issue came to occupy a central place in Indian diplomacy.
Given his own lack of a political base, Dr. Singh was bound to feel the pressures of running a government >under the watch of Congress President Sonia Gandhi. Perhaps he reconciled himself too readily to a situation where he would be in office while the real authority lay elsewhere. While Ms. Gandhi’s respect for the Prime Minister was never in doubt, the system of dual power centres initially and the emergence of a third power centre in the person of Rahul Gandhi later constrained the working of the government. The National Advisory Council, chaired by Ms. Gandhi, functioned as a shadow cabinet moving and vetting important policy decisions. Not surprisingly, the >BJP was able to portray Dr. Singh as a weak and ineffectual Prime Minister and Ms. Gandhi as a powerful extra-constitutional authority. Dr. Singh made matters worse for himself by pleading helplessness in the wake of the >2G spectrum scam. After he was rightfully given some of the credit for the return of the UPA to power in 2009, Dr. Singh saw his popularity and credibility dip very quickly with the unearthing of one scam after another. The image of a clean and incorruptible prime minister gave way to a picture of a prime minister who while retaining his own integrity was tolerant of venality all around, the tolerance coming dangerously close to being seen as complicity. The most telling exposure of the weakness of his authority came in 2013 when party vice-president >Rahul Gandhi described as ‘nonsense’ the ordinance granting relief to convicted lawmakers facing the prospect of immediate disqualification following a Supreme Court ruling. The >ordinance was in itself politically and morally indefensible and Dr. Singh ended up being seen as the protector of the corrupt and Mr. Gandhi as the party’s uncompromising crusader against corruption. The benign tolerance of corruption was undoubtedly a major flaw. Yet, uniquely among Indian leaders, even in the midst of scams, his personal integrity remained beyond question and he retained a sense of balance and decency in the most trying of circumstances.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dr-singh-bows-out/article6005951.ece
15,5,2014,Euphoria and reality,"The stock markets’ heady run has continued unabated, only pausing occasionally to book profits. On Tuesday, May 13, yet another record was breached >with the Sensex crossing 24,000 during the day. Notwithstanding such a phenomenal and seemingly irrational rise, some brokers and analysts expect the markets to go even higher. The reasons for the unbridled optimism, in turn leading to puffed-up stock valuations, are rooted in the belief that a politically stable government free from troublesome allies and capable of taking strong economic decisions under the leadership of Narendra Modi is about to take office. The >exit polls released on Monday evening seemed to confirm what the opinion polls had forecast earlier. There are some fundamental flaws in establishing a causal connection between expected poll outcomes and euphoric stock markets. For one thing, while all exit polls had forecast a win for the National Democratic Alliance, there has been considerable divergence among them on the final outcomes that will be known on Friday. Experts are divided on the real value of exit polls. Besides, in the past they had gone very wrong. However, at this stage it is possible to make a minimalistic assumption that an NDA government will be formed and that it will enjoy greater political stability than what seemed possible in the recent past. But the bigger question is whether, post-elections, a stable political formation by itself can engineer a relatively swift and enduring economic revival.
If the optimistic script plays out, the new government, buoyed by a spectacular win that matches the most favourable forecasts will proceed straight away to unleash a wave of economic reforms and revive stalled infrastructure projects to kick-start the capex cycle. Either out of political compulsions or based on a considered view of the economy, the Reserve Bank of India will begin to ease interest rates. The good times on the ground will start moving closer to the stock market's expectations. Unfortunately, that scenario is unlikely to materialise. Recent news on the inflation front is not at all favourable for an interest rate cut. Also, in a scheme of reviving investment the Centre has a much smaller role than the States have. It has been estimated that the stalling of only a fourth of the mega-projects can be attributed to the Centre’s inaction. The rest are constrained by such difficult-to-solve factors as overcapacity and high levels of debt. Finally, the current market euphoria has occurred after macroeconomic stability has been reached: both the fiscal deficit and the current account deficit have been reined in. Looking ahead, economic growth during the current year might mark the beginning of a turnaround, but the performance will most certainly not be on a scale that would justify the astronomical rise in the markets.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/euphoria-and-reality/article6009321.ece
15,5,2014,Thai recipe for a coup,"The unrelenting stand of anti-government protestors in Thailand appears increasingly like an open invitation to the country’s non-democratic forces to step in and take charge. The protestors, banded together as the People’s Democratic Reform Committee, have already won several rounds in their seven-month battle against the Pheu Thai party, but their demand for “reforms” before another election is held has an all-too familiar ring: in Pakistan last year, a cleric rallied followers and laid siege to Islamabad to demand that the elected government be dismissed and a caretaker government of unelected people be appointed to rid the system of corrupt politicians before elections were held. It is a measure of how matters have changed in both countries that the Pakistani establishment did not succumb to the temptation, but Thailand may be fast sliding towards it. Last year, in an effort to calm down protestors, Yingluck Shinawatra, who became Prime Minister in 2011 after leading the Pheu Thai to victory three years earlier, downgraded her government to a caretaker and announced early elections in February. Though the opposition Democratic Party claims it has nothing to do with the street protests, it boycotted the election. Pheu Thai won but the victory was annulled by the Constitutional court. Ms. Yingluck remained caretaker, but was last week removed from office by the same court on charges of misusing the powers of her office. The verdict has polarised the country further, with pro-Shinawatra ‘red shirts’ convinced there is a witch-hunt against the party and its leadership. The new caretaker Prime Minister, Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan, wants to hold a planned re-election on July 20, but the protestors, led by the former MP Suthep Thaugsuban and the Democrats, are firmly against it.
The larger battle behind the crisis is between the royalist-military establishment and urban elites represented by the Democratic Party, and populist forces unleashed by Pheu Thai whose political power is located in the rural areas. The prolonged showdown has had its impact on the economy: investors are losing confidence, more tourists are staying away, affecting a mainstay sector, and the growth rate has been revised downward twice since November. The King and the Royal Thai Army have stayed away from playing an overt role or taking sides in the developments so far, but if the impasse continues, voices that are now calling for a military intervention will grow louder. That would be a step in the wrong direction. The political leaders would be far better off reaching a compromise.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/thai-recipe-for-a-coup/article6009322.ece
16,5,2014,Perils of non-disclosure,"It cannot be a happy experience for a lawmaker when a hard-fought election victory is nullified on a mere technicality. Yet, legislators should now be wary of hiding, or not disclosing, the required information when they contest elections. This is the key takeaway from the latest Supreme Court verdict on a candidate’s failure to disclose all the relevant details in the prescribed form in the nomination papers. The act of voting is a form of free expression, and this right requires that voters are aware of all relevant particulars of a contestant. This is why the current election law casts an obligation on candidates to furnish information relating to their criminal antecedents, educational qualifications and assets held by them, their spouses and dependant children. The landmark Supreme Court verdict in Association for Democratic Reforms (2002) established that the Indian voter has a right to have all such information. Viewed in this light, the recent judgment in the case of Kisan Shankar Kathore, who won an Assembly election in Maharashtra in 2004, constitutes a significant decision. The Court upheld a Bombay High Court judgment setting aside Mr. Kathore’s election on the ground that he had failed to disclose his wife’s ownership of a bungalow, the municipal dues on it, and assets of a partnership firm, and dues that he personally owed to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board.
While confirming this judgment, the apex court has laid down two key points: non-disclosure of the spouse’s assets, in this case, or, as a general rule, suppressing essential information or furnishing false or incomplete information will be a ground for setting aside an election. Secondly, the fact that suppression of relevant information is an independent offence in electoral law cannot be a reason for leaving the validity of the candidate’s election unquestioned. The question did arise whether the Returning Officer’s acceptance of the nomination papers at the filing stage would not go in favour of the winning candidate. The Court has made it clear that the Returning Officer cannot be expected to hold a summary inquiry into some disputed facts and reject the nomination on the spot. Rather, it is a question that ought to be decided in an election petition. Whether the non-disclosure amounts to a material lapse or not would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. The verdict places an additional burden on candidates to be diligent and conscientious in complying with norms of disclosure. At the same time, it is an uncomfortable truth that many years elapse before election petitions are decided, sometimes leaving invalid results survive the entire tenure of a legislature. It is incumbent on the courts to deliver speedier decisions on election petitions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/perils-of-nondisclosure/article6013139.ece
16,5,2014,The ANC mould cracks,"South Africa’s fifth general election since the end of apartheid in 1994 and its first since the >death of Nelson Mandela in December 2013 has produced another substantial victory for the ruling African National Congress. In the May 7 poll, held under a closed party list proportional system, 73 per cent of the 25 million voters returned the ANC to the 400-seat Parliament in Cape Town with a 62.1 per cent vote share, down from 65.9 in 2009. The expected inroads into the ANC’s support base did not materialise, though the main opposition, Helen Zille’s Democratic Alliance (DA), raised its share from 16.7 per cent to 22.2, and the newly formed left party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), led by expelled ANC leader Julius Malema, took 6.4 per cent. The results will mean, respectively, parliamentary blocs of 249, 89, and 25 seats. As for the provincial chambers, the ANC won eight of the nine provinces. The one Assembly it did not hold, Western Cape, remains firmly in the hands of the DA, which increased its vote share there from 51.5 to 59.4 per cent. Polling was peaceful almost everywhere, though a heavy police presence figured in the >Gauteng mining town of Marikana, where 47 people had died in a violent crackdown on a strike in August 2012, and in Bekkersdal township (also in Gauteng province), where two Electoral Commission tents were burnt just before the election in protests against unemployment and poverty.
Marikana and Bekkersdal nevertheless exemplify the challenges awaiting the reelected ANC. Unemployment may be the toughest. Estimated at 37 per cent overall, it is the worst among the young; 3.3 million of the 15-24 age cohort are not in education, employment or training. This in turn increases inequalities, which exactly mirror the racial divide. Black household incomes are still one-sixth those of white ones, and 44 per cent of workers earn under 10 rand a day – just enough for a loaf of bread. Secondly, state successes, which include the provision of electricity connections to millions of the country’s poorest citizens, are tarnished by maintenance and delivery failures. Opponents cite bad construction of the five million houses built, defunct electricity and telephone lines, and deepening corruption. The ANC’s hostile reaction to criticism and dissent has alienated long-standing supporters, and the current leadership seems unable to change its ways. Younger voters too, with no memory of the anti-apartheid struggle, may well be less forgiving of failure. The ANC will be severely tested for the next five years, while its rivals develop alternatives. The ANC mould may not be broken yet, but it is certainly cracking.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-anc-mould-cracks/article6013118.ece
17,5,2014,Preserve the Idea of India,"The sensational sweep and scale of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s electoral victory was unquestionably the direct result of the strong upsurge in the popularity of its >prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi. The Gujarat Chief Minister was clearly the star campaigner and the massive “ >Modi wave” that has clearly caught the imagination of large sections of India’s voters has given the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance an unprecedented and historic mandate. With the BJP winning a majority on its own, a remarkable paradigm shift has clearly taken place in the trajectory of >India’s parliamentary politics. Breaking the trend of the last few decades in which no party was able to pull off a runaway victory of this kind, the >BJP will come to power, free from the pressures of coalition politics, giving it unfettered space and scope to govern. This election marked the entry of 100 million new voters, young Indians impatient for change and extremely aspirational in their focus. >The voter turnout — 66.38 per cent — was the highest ever in India’s post-Independence electoral history, beating the record of 1984 when 64.01 per cent of Indians voted in the aftermath of Indira Gandhi’s assassination.
This landmark election has also seen the incumbent United Progressive Alliance crash to an ignominious defeat with the >Congress party, already on a downward spiral in several elections, now humiliatingly reduced to a double-digit figure in Parliament, its worst electoral tally since Independence. An indefensibly uninspiring campaign led by Rahul Gandhi failed to rally a young and impatient electorate. The BJP’s landslide victory, almost entirely attributable to the sweeping effect of the Modi wave across India, reflects the intensity of the desire for more effective governance. The rising public anger as a result of the UPA’s policy paralysis, stalled economic growth and worst of all, the series of corruption scandals, created a hunger for change especially among young Indians who see Mr. Modi as a leader symbolising their expectations of fast economic growth unshackled from red tape and corruption. It is indeed an ironic twist of history that the Gujarat Chief Minister whose governing record is shadowed by the disquieting facts that have not really gone away — relating to his moral and political responsibility for the Gujarat pogrom of 2002 — has adroitly become the beneficiary of the increasing eagerness for a higher growth trajectory. It is also discomfiting that the election campaign that Mr. Modi conducted in the Hindi heartland States, especially Uttar Pradesh, drew heavily upon Hindu cultural nationalism, invoking as he did Hindu sacred geography in Varanasi and using Hindu cultural idioms, not really imagery suitable to the public space in democratic India.
Mr. Modi emphatically asserts that his agenda is all about governance and economic change. We welcome his assertion and wish him well in his efforts in this regard. But the reality remains that there is a huge trust deficit with the minorities, especially the Muslim community, which must be addressed. He is still regarded as a deeply polarising figure not really reaching out to minorities unlike many of his senior colleagues in the BJP or even the RSS who have made some political attempts to bridge the divide. In order to close the credibility gap that persists as regards his acceptability to govern all Indians, Mr. Modi must ensure that the idea of India as a pluralist and inclusive landscape in which all citizens have equality before the law as constitutionally decreed, is upheld consistently and transparently, while he is in office as Prime Minister. He tweeted exuberantly upon hearing the election results that “India has won!” Indeed the task ahead is to ensure that all Indians share that sense of belonging and participation in the national governing agenda. With these cautionary notes, we offer our congratulations to Narendra Modi, India’s next Prime Minister, and wish him all success, for his own sake and India’s too.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/preserve-the-idea-of-india/article6017266.ece
18,5,2014,AIADMK’s historic win,"The landslide victory of the Jayalalithaa-led All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in the Lok Sabha election in Tamil Nadu is unprecedented in many respects. Without even a single ally, >the party has won 37 of the 39 seats in a State where over the last few decades elections were won and lost on the basis of alliance arithmetic. This is a rare feat in the context of Tamil Nadu’s recent electoral behaviour where alliances have been the safe bet of mainstream parties contesting State and parliamentary elections. Of course, it helped that the AIADMK’s principal rival, the >Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, also entered the fray without any major allies. While the AIADMK spurned electoral partners, including the two Left parties who were initially welcomed as allies but not given any seat, the DMK, after having chosen not to go with the Congress, could not attract other parties to its fold. >Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s victory was all the more remarkable because the DMK could not win a single seat; in terms of vote share, the AIADMK, with 44.3 per cent of the votes, had more than a 20 percentage point lead over the DMK. The only two seats that the AIADMK did lose — to the Bharatiya Janata Party in Kanyakumari and to the Pattali Makkal Katchi in Dharmapuri — were because of the caste and religious polarisation. In Kanyakumari, the BJP succeeded in turning the election into a Hindu-Christian contest, and in Dharmapuri the PMK mobilised Vanniyar voters on the basis of their caste.
Also strengthening Ms. Jayalalithaa’s position in this election is that although her government has completed three years in office, the AIADMK does not seem to have suffered from any anti-incumbency sentiment. If there was an anti-incumbency sentiment it was against the DMK, which was a part of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government until last year — which has been totally routed, failing to win a single seat in the State. That the AIADMK is able to surmount traditional anti-incumbency sentiment and still commands a charismatic hold over the imagination of the Tamil Nadu electorate shows that Ms. Jayalalithaa remains a force to reckon with in the national arena. The BJP government might not require the support of other parties to survive; however, the AIADMK can still play a constructive role at the Centre. As the third largest party in the Lok Sabha after the BJP and the Congress, the AIADMK has the numbers to make its voice heard loud and clear in Parliament. Along with other regional parties such as the Trinamool Congress and the Biju Janata Dal, the AIADMK can play the role of a secular, democratic check against any authoritarian tendency that might surface in the days ahead.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/aiadmks-historic-win/article6020839.ece
18,5,2014,Fruits of bifurcation,"Unmistakably, the rationale behind the creation of a separate state of Telangana has been a dominant factor in shaping the outcome of the just-concluded simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha and the State Assembly in Andhra Pradesh. Both in the >flamboyant comeback of Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader N. Chandrababu Naidu in the ‘ >Seemandhra’ region — which will comprise the somewhat larger residuary state of Andhra Pradesh once the bifurcation formally comes into effect on June 2 — and in the convincing victory of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) in the ‘Telangana’ region led by K. Chandrasekhar Rao, it is largely the people’s concerns and anxieties over the way forward post-bifurcation that appear to have been reflected in the poll results. If the sweep for the TRS in ‘Telangana’ — winning 11 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats and 63 of the 119-member new Assembly to be constituted for that region — was the people’s way of legitimising its sustained role in the past decade in carving out a separate state, Mr. Naidu outsmarted the initial front-runner, the >YSR Congress, in coastal Andhra, romping home with a major chunk of the seats in alliance with the BJP. Apart from the ‘Modi factor’ felt more in the Lok Sabha poll results, in Seemandhra the TDP leader, who was criticised for being a ‘fence-sitter’ on the Telangana issue in the post-2008 phase, converted a political crisis into an opportunity in this election by reassuring an electorate, anxious and uncertain of the residuary state’s economic future, that coastal Andhra will be rejuvenated with a new dynamism. It chimed with Mr. Naidu’s image as Andhra Pradesh’s ‘CEO’ in an earlier decade when he was largely instrumental in making Hyderabad a global city.
Thus, the >TDP has emerged as the single largest party, bagging over 106 of the 175 Assembly constituencies in the Seemandhra region, belying expectations of a sweep by its key regional rival, the YSR Congress. Though the Congress’s performance was slightly better in the Telangana turf, overall it has been a washout for the national party considering it had doggedly pushed for the blossoming of Telangana. On the other hand, in Seemandhra the blow to the Congress and to its breakaway regional avataar — the corruption tag on Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy also dragged down the fortunes of the YSR Congress — shows that stability at the Centre and development at the State level outweighed other considerations in the voters’ minds. This is besides the new local caste equations which a divided Congress failed to handle on an even keel as the bifurcation process came to fruition in Parliament not long ago. Hopefully, the cloud over the constitutional steps in the formal bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh will be lifted soon.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fruits-of-bifurcation/article6020840.ece
19,5,2014,An emphatic rejection,"The Grand Old Party’s imminent rout was a given in this general election. Even so, the Congress managed to surpass the worst predictions, embracing defeat on a scale too shocking to behold. The outgoing ruling party not merely crashed to a historic low of Lok Sabha seats and votes (44 seats for 19.3 per cent), it rendered itself ineligible to claim the position of Leader of the Opposition in the lower House, having secured less than 10 per cent of the total of 543 seats. The dubious records do not end there. The Congress did not touch the two-digit figure anywhere, not even in States that previously held up its honour in the face of calamity elsewhere. Through the Congress’s defeats of 1977, 1989, 1998 and 1999, it was saved from going over the edge by either the southern States, or Maharashtra and Assam. This time, the Congress fared abysmally even in its strongholds, picking up 19 of 129 seats on offer in the South, two of 48 in Maharashtra and three of 14 in Assam. The disgrace doubles when compared to the superlative performance of the >Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party, which swept its own bastions even as it broke new ground in the South and the East. The Congress, on the other hand, was left with no straw to clutch; in the family pocket borough of Amethi, >Rahul Gandhi trailed for several rounds before finally edging past the BJP’s Smriti Irani.
It does not help the Congress that during every crisis its leadership speaks of introspection without really turning the mirror inward. It has become a habit with the party to attribute triumphs to the Nehru-Gandhi family while placing the blame for failures on a mythical “collective” leadership. In a candid interview to Karan Thapar, senior Congress leader Kamal Nath admitted that his party had fallen behind the times and not realised India had become “aspirational”. Nonetheless, he fiercely defended the Congress vice-president, arguing instead that as Prime Minister, >Manmohan Singh should have been more effective in publicising the government’s achievements. Few people will dispute that Mr. Gandhi was well-intentioned in speaking for women's empowerment and democratisation of the party’s moribund structures. Yet, he never had an answer for how a perceived dynasty could oversee the democratisation process. It is here that the Congress’s tragedy becomes almost Shakespearean in its proportions. The >family is the Congress’s life source, its oxygen. But just by being present at the top, the family prevents the emergence of any young and dynamic leadership outside of its own limited boundaries. One fleeting indication in the aftermath of the election was that the Congress may turn to Priyanka Gandhi for rescue. But will that change anything, when the verdict is emphatically against the family itself?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-emphatic-rejection/article6022897.ece
19,5,2014,Renewed mandate for BJD,"Surmounting any anti-incumbency sentiment and moving counter to the Narendra Modi run elsewhere, the Naveen Patnaik-led Biju Janata Dal in Odisha is on to a fourth term, and its 15th consecutive year in power. The >landslide win in the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections marks its best showing ever. The vote shares are telling: the BJD won 44.1 per cent in the Lok Sabha elections (43.4 for Assembly), while the Congress got 26 (25.7) and the BJP, 21.5 (18). The Congress’s performance is its worst ever. It was hamstrung by a lack of strategic direction and decisive leadership, as also a riven campaign. Mr. Modi, campaigning in the State, addressed well-attended rallies — which proved to be of no avail. The absence of a firm organisational network left the >BJP hobbled; in the end, it had to be content with a single Lok Sabha seat, exaggerated expectations deflated. For the >Congress and the BJP, the absence of a leader who could match Mr. Patnaik in terms of stature, style and image was a disadvantage. Mr. Patnaik broke his decade-old >ties with the BJP-NDA ahead of the 2009 elections. He has since proved he can hold his own. The win also proved the BJD has put behind it the episode involving Pyari Mohan Mohapatra, a party rebel who was expelled in 2012. A secular, development-oriented platform, welfare measures including those that address women’s concerns, initiatives for tribals who constitute a fourth of the population, and a largely transparent style of governance, contributed to the win. The State’s handling of the fallout of Cyclone Phailin in October 2013 was a creditable feat. Mr. Patnaik’s attempts to build a regional identity for the State added to his stature.
If the violence against Christians in Kandhamal district by fringe elements of the Sangh Parivar besmirched Odisha’s reputation during the past decade, Mr. Patnaik’s act of breaking with the BJP’s politics seemed to have succeeded in his government making amends to an extent. Yet, communal tensions still smoulder in parts of the State. These will need to be doused. Issues relating to mining that have been a bugbear for the government need to be sorted out. Maoist activity continues to be a threat in some corridors of the State. In granting it a creditable fourth term, the electorate has put the onus on the BJD to handle these issues satisfactorily while also ensuring development in a State that has historically had some of the worst patches of deprivation. In New Delhi, as the fifth largest party in the House, it should function as a constructive Opposition party with a moral role to check any overreach by the ruling formation at the Centre. To be true to the mandate, the Naveen Patnaik administration needs to address these tasks seriously.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/renewed-mandate-for-bjd/article6022898.ece
26,5,2014,A needless row,"The political rhetoric usually tapers with the conclusion of an >election process. But in Andhra Pradesh, in the end-phase of bifurcation, parties still have a lot to fight for. Telangana Rashtra Samiti president K. Chandrasekhara Rao seems intent on a confrontational course not only on the sharing of resources but also on issues relating to >allotment of employees to the Secretariats of the two States in Hyderabad. Mr. Rao went too far by threatening that he would not allow employees of the Andhra region placed in the Telangana cadre to work in the >offices of Telangana. Quite inappropriately for one who is to assume office as Chief Minister of the new State, Mr. Rao asked a meeting of employees from Telangana to send details of “ >Andhra employees” included in the Telangana list, or name them at the “war room” run by employee unions. Genuine errors could have been made in the drawing up of the provisional list of employees for the two States as per entries in their Service Register, but these can be corrected quickly enough through laid-down procedures. Mr. Rao is vesting employee unions with extraordinary powers, and giving scope for harassment and persecution of employees through his open call to name “Andhra” employees. As against claims by unions that 193 employees were wrongly allocated to the >Telangana cadre, officials could identify no more than a dozen cases of >allotment mistakes. To raise doubts over the correctness of the entries in the Service Register is to move the dispute to another level altogether.
Issues arising out of the bifurcation are complex, and can be resolved only through established procedures for apportioning assets and liabilities, employees and institutions. Official committees assigned with the responsibilities of facilitating the >post-bifurcation redistribution have completed their task. The governments of the two successor-states must do nothing that could complicate this process of sharing and redistribution. River water and power generation are subjects that will occupy the time and effort of Mr. Rao and the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister-designate, N. Chandrababu Naidu, in the immediate future. But the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 provides for the management and development of water resources, and for allotment of power from the Central Generating Stations based on the actual energy consumption of the last five years. Mechanisms for dispute resolution are already in place, and nothing is to be gained from emotional outbursts that appeal to parochial sensibilities. Telangana and the successor-state of Andhra Pradesh must look forward to working in coordination, and not start off in confrontationist mode.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-needless-row/article6046673.ece
26,5,2014,Surge in the northeast,"The >Bharatiya Janata Party has widened and deepened its footprint in northeastern India, gaining at the expense of the Congress. Of the 25 Lok Sabha seats here (including in Sikkim), the BJP won eight by itself. The Congress managed eight too, but it is a drop from its 2009 tally of 13. In Assam, with 14 seats, the Congress now has only three seats for a vote share of 29.6 per cent, as compared to seven in 2009. The >BJP has seven seats for a vote share of 36.5 per cent: the seat figure was four in 2009. Consequent convulsions in the Congress have led to demands for Chief Minister >Tarun Gogoi’s resignation. Muslims comprise some 30 per cent of the electorate, but the division of those votes between the All India United Democratic Front and the Congress, mostly benefited the BJP. The AIUDF, representing the Muslim voice, equalled the Congress’s tally of three. The BJP’s inroads into the tea garden segment in the Brahmaputra valley have been notable. The Congress, which has ruled Assam since 2001, faces issues of indiscipline and factionalism — “arrogance and complacency”, in Mr. Gogoi’s words. In Arunachal Pradesh, the Congress retained its majority in the simultaneously held Assembly elections with a vote share of 49.5 per cent. But significantly, the BJP managed to increase its tally to 11, from three in 2009, also raising its vote share from 5.21 per cent to 31. For the two Lok Sabha seats, which the Congress and the BJP shared, the BJP’s vote share was 46.1 per cent and the Congress’s, 41.2. In Nagaland, the >Naga People's Front, an NDA partner, bagged the seat, beating the Congress. In Meghalaya, P.A. Sangma’s National People’s Party, another NDA constituent, defeated the Congress. Predictably, the two seats in Tripura went to the CPI(M). In a consolation for the Congress, it retained the lone seat in Mizoram, defeating the United Democratic Front, and the two seats in Manipur.
Narendra Modi’s statements on the incendiary topic of >immigration from Bangladesh clearly marked a tipping point that led to a certain Hindu-vote consolidation. He even set a mid-May deadline for evictions to start. The BJP has also made known its opposition to the proposed land swap deal with Bangladesh. But inevitably, such vote-catching rhetoric will have polarising consequences. Having come to power in New Delhi, how the party handles this sensitive issue will be keenly watched. With militancy still simmering in parts of the region, a BJP government will also have to take a stand on competing demands on that front. The >RSS is seen as having had a role in ensuring the BJP’s systematic push into the region, and the party has also succeeded in building up an organisational base. Without doubt, the political landscape of northeastern India is a-changing.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/surge-in-the-northeast/article6046674.ece
27,5,2014,Putting dynasty before party,"The 2014 electoral mandate has been rightly read as being in favour of Narendra Modi’s dynamic connect with aspirational India. Yet it is as much a vote against the Congress’s complete failure to understand the ground realities. In the aftermath of its worst-ever electoral defeat, the >Congress is refusing to come to terms with its precipitous situation, retreating into a defence of its “first family”, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, rather than rigorously examining the causes of its ignominious defeat. The script that played out in the Congress Parliamentary Party meeting was on wearisomely predictable lines. The party dutifully placed full faith in the >leadership of Sonia Gandhi and son Rahul, both of whom offered to step down, only to take back their resignations in the face of party protests, which were expected. The Congress Working Committee spoke of a “thorough revamp of the organisation at all levels,” leaving out the two leaders from the scope of the exercise. The Parliamentary Party grandly called for unity among “all progressive and secular forces in Parliament,” even as it complimented the Congress president and vice-president “for their indefatigable election campaigns across the country.” Ms. Gandhi herself seemed in denial, appealing to the party to draw “appropriate lessons from the unprecedented electoral setback,” without even minimally acknowledging the likelihood of the family’s role in the setback.
The Congress chief’s warning to the ranks to refrain from “public acrimony” is out of sync with the mood in the ranks of the party. Milind Deora had, in fact, echoed the frustrations of many when he said Mr. Gandhi’s advisers were wrong, and “so were the people they advised.” Shashi Tharoor similarly complained of lack of avenues for free expression within the Congress and argued that the Congress must articulate a vision that embraced the aspirations of the young who formed nearly 40 per cent of the electorate. But instead of welcoming these suggestions, as a party chastened by defeat would be expected to do, the Congress deployed dynasty loyalists to skewer the critics, portraying them as malcontents who felt threatened by Mr. Gandhi’s attempts to open up the party. The tragic truth is that the >Congress has paid a huge price by indulging >Mr. Gandhi at the cost of other potential leadership talent. In this environment, it is no surprise that there have been no takers for the Congress’s call to the Opposition to form an alternative secular bloc in Parliament. The party might have found a better response had it nominated one among its 44 victorious MPs — who won against a wave — as its parliamentary leader, thus taking the first step towards truly reforming itself.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/putting-dynasty-before-party/article6050327.ece
27,5,2014,Issues in electoral arithmetic,"The 2014 general election result has, not without reason, been called a landslide. With >282 Lok Sabha seats, which amount to a gain of no fewer than 166 seats from the 2009 election, the Bharatiya Janata Party has a majority of 11; it is assured of the passage of its legislative programme, and will have little need to make the usual compromises that go with coalition governments. Those would include giving partners plum Cabinet posts, trimming legislation and policy in return for support, and ensuring the allocation of Central government funds to the allies’ respective States. The incoming government’s leaders and supporters alike will, no doubt, also claim that the Indian electorate has given them a clear mandate to govern for the next five years. Among the victors’ most barbed comments is the remark that no other party has won enough seats even to form an official opposition. The biggest loser, obviously, has been the Indian National Congress, whose 206 seats in the previous Parliament have crashed to a mere 44; as observers might well reflect, how are the mighty fallen.
While the >BJP win is beyond question, a little numerical analysis shows a more complex situation. The victory is founded on a vote-share of just under 31 per cent, and even on a record turnout of 66 per cent this means a little less than 19 per cent of the total electorate. Not just in this election but in past elections as well, under the simple-majority or first-past-the-post electoral system there has been no direct relation between >votes cast and seats won; the disproportionality is particularly striking this time. The Congress, which now has 8 per cent of the Lok Sabha seats, won a 19.3 per cent vote-share, and would have won 105 seats according to the simplest formula for proportional electoral systems; the BJP would have won 169. For regional parties, the results are equally illuminating; in Tamil Nadu, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, now the >third largest party in the Lok Sabha, won 37 of 39 seats on a State-based vote-share of 44.3 per cent and a national share of 3.3 per cent. Its main rival, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, won no seats at all but got nearly 27 per cent of the votes within the State — substantially more than the BJP-led NDA’s 18.5 per cent, which resulted in two parliamentary seats. Elsewhere, the Bahujan Samaj Party won no seats despite coming third nationally with 4.1 per cent of the vote, and the Shiv Sena won 18 seats on a 1.9 per cent vote-share. Arguments over electoral systems will continue, and the 2014 results raise questions about whether or not the formally and legitimately representative Lok Sabha represents in its composition the spread and range of voters’ support across the country.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/issues-in-electoral-arithmetic/article6050328.ece
28,5,2014,A refreshing exercise,"Given the magnitude of the mandate that the Bharatiya Janata Party received in the Lok Sabha election, and his own well-recognised role in it, >Prime Minister Narendra Modi was expected to exercise a free hand in choosing the >Council of Ministers. The allies were in no position to ask for prime portfolios, and power centres within the BJP were no longer powerful enough to question the decisions of a man credited with leading the party to victory. The Modi stamp on the ministry-formation was thus unmistakable. A leaner and younger team drawn from across India took office, with Mr. Modi making no overt attempt to placate sulking >party seniors or demanding regional allies. Rajnath Singh and Arun Jaitley, who were instrumental in projecting Mr. Modi as the prime ministerial candidate prior to the election, took their place immediately behind him. Mr. Singh got the powerful Home Ministry and Mr. Jaitley was put in charge of not only finance and corporate affairs, but also defence. While Mr. Jaitley might not hold on to the defence portfolio beyond the next Cabinet shuffle, the fact that he was entrusted with such heavy responsibilities is indicative of the extent to which Mr. Modi will lean on him for support. That he lost in the election hardly seems to have mattered in the larger context. In contrast, senior leader Murli Manohar Joshi, who initially resisted the demand that he vacate his Varanasi seat for Mr. Modi, did not qualify in the under-75 criterion.
However, whether for tactical reasons or otherwise, the Prime Minister also displayed a readiness to be accommodative. Sushma Swaraj, who was among the few dissenting voices in the party, was given >charge of the Ministry of External Affairs, though it will never be known if it was in recognition of her role as Leader of the Opposition in the previous Lok Sabha or as an expression of magnanimity. The influence of the RSS, never to be underestimated in the BJP, was evident only in the choice of Mr. Nitin Gadkari. Although the >size of the Cabinet was trimmed, the proposal for the convergence of related ministries, as implemented, seemed more a practical step than a radical move. Shipping, road transport and highways have been clubbed together; so also finance and corporate affairs. Overseas affairs, handled by a Cabinet Minister under the previous government, is now under the charge of the Minister of State dealing with external affairs. Overall, Mr. Modi seems to have made some effort to identify younger people who were loyalists or political heavyweights with experience and expertise to back them. Not everyone in the ministry satisfies each of the criteria, but all qualify under one head or the other.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-refreshing-exercise/article6054238.ece
28,5,2014,Invigorate the European Project,"The unprecedented gains registered by smaller parties in the eighth direct polls to the >European Parliament present yet again a real challenge to the victor — the centre-right European People’s Party. Deep scepticism concerning the purpose and objectives of the transnational entity that is the European Union (EU) — comprising 28 countries — binds these EU-sceptic parties. With the latest results, the European project is in need of a fresh infusion of life into the post-War vision of an economically integrated, politically unified and peaceful continent. Such a vision has repeatedly come under strain within individual states — most recently after the global financial and economic crisis and the banking and credit crunch within the Eurozone took their toll. But >EU-sceptic parties have been stoking popular fears over the influx of migrants ever since the 2004 expansion of the EU into the eight countries of the former Eastern Europe. The outright rejection in France and the Netherlands, two founding EU member-states, of the European Constitution in the 2005 popular referendum marked the climactic conversion of EU-phobia and anti-immigrant sentiment into a potent political currency by the parties of the far-right.
It is in >France, also the bloc’s second largest economy, that the Front National has beaten both the mainstream parties in this election, capturing 26 per cent of the vote share. The other topper is the stridently anti-immigrant and EU-sceptic UK Independence Party that trounced the ruling Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party. The extreme left party in Greece has emerged as the other major anti-establishment platform in these polls; not to mention small inroads made by Germany’s new party that is sceptical of the Eurozone rather than the EU itself. It remains to be seen whether the anti-EU parties have the requisite numbers to function as a cohesive political group within Parliament — at least 25 seats from seven different states. Of interest also would be whether these parties can rise above their own internal contradictions rooted in nationalism and other such narrow and sectarian considerations. Previous attempts in the not-so-distant past came a cropper. Parties of the mainstream know the value of pursuing policies that generate employment and induce growth. They are equally aware of the negative political fallout of deviation from this path. Herein also lies the answer to removing the democratic deficit of EU institutions. A key aspect of the latter is the declining voter-participation in successive elections to the EU Parliament. The prospects for regional integration globally would be strengthened immeasurably by an invigorated bloc of 28 states in Europe.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/invigorate-the-european-project/article6054239.ece
29,5,2014,Welcome initiatives,"There was a reason why the leaders of all the South Asian countries and one leader from further afield accepted Prime Minister >Narendra Modi’s invitation to his inauguration. As within the country, there is a sense in the wider world that a significant political transformation has taken place in India. The neighbours are eager to grasp what it means for them and their own interests. It was not easy for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to make the journey from Islamabad, but if he was courageous enough to do so — though not before clearance came from the Pakistan Army and hawkish sections of his own party — it was because he hoped that the >new dispensation in Delhi would match that gesture in some way. In the event, the visit has ended up not making >Mr. Sharif’s position in Pakistan any easier. He refrained from bringing up the Kashmir issue in public while in Delhi, and for the first time, a Pakistani delegation did not hold a meeting with the Hurriyat. In keeping with the spirit of the occasion, Mr. Sharif called for attitudes to change from “confrontation to cooperation”. The Indian side highlighted that Mr. Modi gave no quarter on the issue of >terrorism emanating from Pakistan, and on speedy action in the 2008 Mumbai attacks case. Mr. Sharif had to go into damage-control mode when he returned to Pakistan. It cannot be emphasised more that >India’s interests on the terrorism issue, as well as its expressed keenness to move towards “full trade normalistation” with Pakistan, are better served by strengthening Mr. Sharif’s hands.
In fact, the imagination Prime Minister Modi showed with his invitation could have been taken forward with an India-Pakistan-Afghanistan trilateral meeting right there in his new office, but perhaps it was thought to be too early. As it turned out, Afghan President Hamid Karzai, with whom Mr. Modi held a separate meeting, blamed the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba for >last week’s attack on the >Indian consulate in Herat. On Sri Lanka, the new Prime Minister has rightly signalled that there is no change in India’s position that “full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment and going beyond” would assist the process of ethnic reconciliation, and contribute towards meeting the aspirations of the Tamil community for a just peace. Political parties in Tamil Nadu, including the AIADMK and >Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, were vociferous in their protest against the invitation to Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa, but their support to the Centre would lend more weight and credence to its position. Not doing so, on the other hand, would enable Colombo to play one against the other, to the detriment of Tamil interests.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/welcome-initiatives/article6058151.ece
29,5,2014,A preventable tragedy,"The >derailment of the Gorakhdham Express on its way from Delhi to Gorakhpur on Monday, following a collision in broad daylight, was most certainly a preventable tragedy. The speeding express train rammed into a stationary goods train at Chureb, leading to the derailment of the engine and six coaches. The first coach was mangled beyond recognition and the impact of the collision and derailment presented a tragic sight. Though the final casualty figures have not been released, anywhere from >20 to 30 passengers are feared killed. Another 100 were injured. Rescue and relief operations were hampered because of the condition of the coaches. Cutters and specialised equipment were needed to rip open the coaches and release many of the trapped passengers. As always, the Railway administration was quick to swing into action to organise relief operations and arrange for treatment of the injured and restoration of the track. The Indian Railways has managed to perfect this system of coordinating rescue and relief after every accident — and the number may be rising again. With a new government assuming office on the same day, the new Railway Minister, D.V. Sadananda Gowda, may face quite a few challenges in handling the mammoth portfolio of Railways — from finances and projects to >safety and passenger amenities. This may be the best time for the government and the Railway Board to launch a serious review of its entire functioning and put the system firmly on the rails for the next phase of growth.
What makes the latest tragedy significant is that >the accident took place a little after 10 a.m. and the goods train was stationary. Even if there was a signal failure, which seems likely, the driver of the express train could have seen the train ahead and stopped. The inquiry by the Commissioner of >Railway Safety should determine if there was indeed a rail fracture, as has been reported. But the question remains as to how both trains were on the same line. It is this kind of a tragedy that detracts from the otherwise consistent performance of the Indian Railways. There have been many reports dealing with the functioning of the Railways and the >Kakodkar Committee submitted a detailed and substantive report. Railway Ministers in the previous government had not mustered the political will to restructure the fares in a manner that would provide for the funding of major initiatives in railway safety. In fact, a corpus was created in the last decade to finance a clutch of safety projects on the system. It now boils down to a question of monitoring, implementation and raising the standards of the staff — especially those in critical functions. If the new government could take this up and follow it through to a time-bound implementation stage, it would make a substantial contribution to the Railways and the millions of people it carries daily.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-preventable-tragedy/article6058153.ece
30,5,2014,A formidable task,"By appointing a Special Investigation Team >to unearth black money stashed away in tax havens abroad, the Narendra Modi government has signalled its intention to pursue in right earnest a matter that the Bharatiya Janata Party has been talking about for years. The United Progressive Alliance regime had been dragging its feet on implementing a >July 2011 Supreme Court order to form such a team, and even made a vain bid to stall a court-monitored investigation on the plea that it would erode the authority of the executive. Its stand had given the impression that the previous government — despite its active partnership with other countries in global efforts to get evasion-friendly jurisdictions to shed their obsession with banking secrecy — was not serious about retrieving ill-gotten wealth deposited abroad. The SIT is a high-level committee named by the Supreme Court and is headed by Justice M.B. Shah, a former judge of the Court, with another former apex court judge, Arijit Pasayat, as vice-chairman. It is an inter-agency group that includes the Secretary, Department of Revenue; the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, and the heads of the Intelligence Bureau, the Research and Analysis Wing, the Enforcement Directorate, the CBI, the Central Board of Direct Taxes and a few other agencies. Its primary responsibilities include the investigation and prosecution of cases involving >unaccounted money.
However, the task is not easy. Mr. Justice Shah himself has spoken about the complexities involved. For one thing, there is no clear estimate of the quantum parked in >overseas bank accounts, and it is not known whether all the money that is said to have gone out of the country had not returned in some form through ‘round-tripping’ or participatory notes, or investments in the name of entities and individuals hiding under layers of corporate cover. The government’s 2012 white paper on black money put the amount that Swiss banks owed to India in 2010 at 1.95 billion Swiss Francs, or 0.13 per cent of its total liabilities towards all countries, suggesting that estimates in the range of tens of thousands of crores of rupees may be exaggerated. The SIT must be prepared for the long haul, as its investigation will have to take into account the provisions of existing double taxation avoidance or taxation information exchange agreements that come with a heavy responsibility on recipient-states to limit the use of such information to deciding taxation issues alone. A set of global standards evolved by the OECD on >‘Automatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters’ is likely to come into force around 2017, and it may be possible for countries like India to obtain information related to bank account balances, interest and dividends so that they could compute capital gains on these sums. Whether the arrangement will result in repatriation of such money is, however, anybody’s guess.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-formidable-task/article6062688.ece
30,5,2014,Positive signals,"Given the context, the meeting between RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan and the new Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley, was expected to be significant. In the event, the meeting, which was among the first between a senior government officer and a senior Minister of the new government, has been noteworthy for several reasons. Most importantly, Mr. Jaitley appears to be on the same wavelength as the RBI, acknowledging the challenges the government faces in restoring the pace of growth, contain inflation and concentrate on fiscal consolidation, all >important policy objectives whose pursuit involves “a tough balancing act”. Those words will resonate well with the RBI, which has scheduled the second bi-monthly monetary policy review of the current year (2014-15) for June 3. That will be the first official major economic policy statement after the formation of the government. The BJP-led NDA government has fought and won the elections largely on an >economic agenda, the promise to revive growth, improve governance and curb rising prices. The last has been a particularly decisive factor during the recent State elections as well and will present a major challenge to the new government. Too often in the recent past, >the Finance Minister and the RBI have differed on the approaches to maintaining price stability and reviving growth. These might be early days yet, but the messages from the first meeting between the Minister and the Governor are positive for the conduct of macroeconomic policies without public bickering or contrary political pressure over immediate policy goals.
The monetary approach to curbing inflation is through interest rate hikes but that runs counter to reviving economic growth, at least over the near term. The government’s preference for a softer interest rate regime has not always found favour with the RBI which had doggedly pursued its own course to bring down consumer inflation to 8 per cent by January 2015 and to 6 per cent a year later. The traditional >monetary policy dilemma of growth versus stability is once again in focus. Consumer price inflation is above the RBI’s comfort zone. However, industrial growth has been weak to the point of stagnation. While this suggests an interest rate cut, the RBI will most likely again urge the government to undertake supply side measures to cool inflation and outline a credible programme of fiscal consolidation. After a lull, the overall economic outlook looks better. The CAD has been reined in. The economy seems poised to break out of the sub-5 per cent growth trajectory. Monetary and fiscal policies complementing each other will be vital to spur growth and maintain price stability.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/positive-signals/article6062689.ece
31,5,2014,A good beginning,"In identifying the government’s priority areas and fixing deadlines to meet targets, Prime Minister >Narendra Modi seems to have already set the pace for his Council of Ministers just days after the swearing-in. But drawing up plans is always the easy part. Even if the Prime Minister’s Office functions as the nerve centre of the Modi administration, providing policy inputs to all the Ministries and acting on their feedback, the challenge for the new government will be in maintaining the momentum of the proposal stage right until the final stage of implementation. More than tight monitoring from the top, this would require greater accountability and sharing of responsibility at all levels of government. Indications are that Mr. Modi is alive to the nature and size of the tasks before him. Although known to favour a top-down approach to governance, he ensured that among his first set of instructions to his Cabinet colleagues was to respond promptly to representations from Chief Ministers, to take the views of Members of Parliament seriously, and to involve Ministers of State in decision-making. The stress on listening to the States is welcome. The dominant impulse of a party with a majority of its own at the Centre and with only a few States under its control would be to concentrate all power at the Centre. That Mr. Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party have resisted any such temptation could mark a >good beginning in the government’s relations with States ruled by rival political parties. One of the positive outcomes of the coalition era at the Centre in the last two decades was the rising importance of State governments and regional parties. Decentralisation and transparency go together, and are integral to good governance. Mr. Modi seems to have realised this, moving up as he has done from being the Chief Minister of Gujarat to the Prime Minister of India.
The much talked about ten-point charter of the new government that includes growth, education, energy, infrastructure and price control covers all important sectors. Listing out priorities and spelling out timeframes for implementation should help many of the relatively inexperienced members of the >Modi Cabinet to keep a twin focus on short-term goals and long-term policy directives. Most of the BJP Ministers, while assuming office, have stressed on their adherence to the party manifesto. But the BJP, which included some controversial issues in its manifesto, would be well-advised to exercise caution, and engage in wide-ranging consultations before it takes up sensitive subjects. That the initial Cabinet meetings stuck to the development and growth agenda is, hopefully, a pointer to the direction the Modi government would take.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-good-beginning/article6067173.ece
31,5,2014,Not a right to be shielded,"The intent behind the >European Union Court of Justice verdict, to allow people to remove awkward, embarrassing and inconvenient personal information from search-engines, may not quite be to create sanitised online societies. But the May 13, 2014, ruling could more or less push citizens in the bloc of 28 states of the European Union, and possibly other countries around the world in the future, in that rather odd direction where, in the guise of protecting personal data, people end up hiding aspects of their own history. The court held that individuals have a right to influence what information others may gather about them on the Internet. Individuals have to show that the information sought to be removed is no longer relevant for the purpose for which it was originally processed. Against such a broad criterion, imagine a flood of petitions to have data deleted from search results, and on all sorts of grounds. Allowing people to exercise control over data that get into the public domain may sometimes work against transparency. This aspect cannot be wished away lightly, considering the number of repeat offenders that so often slip through the net, causing grievous harm to the public. Attempts to rewrite societies’ collective history have been viewed with some suspicion in recent years. Concealing one’s personal history also may not always be all that innocent. It is in any case not the most effective means to ensure that one’s past is not held against him. Coming clean stands a better chance of winning the trust and confidence of others.
The ruling of the Luxembourg court puts a question mark on the premium currently attached to the principle of free flow of information. Potential employers and headhunters would want to know more, rather than less, about the antecedents of prospective recruits before they finalise contracts. This need may be felt more acutely today when hiring from abroad has become a common practice. Firms would also prefer not to have to invest much effort or time to access such information. To be sure, >personal data that are dropped from Google links would still be available archivally and in records held by governments. The bona fides of persons can always be verified directly via individual sites, or through overseas contacts. Hence, the inference that the fallout from the verdict would work to the detriment of the public interest may not be entirely justified. The ruling comes against the backdrop of reform of the 1995 EU personal data protection law that has been approved overwhelmingly by Parliament, wherein the right to forget forms an element. The right to be forgotten ought not to be allowed to be abused as a right to be shielded.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/not-a-right-to-be-shielded/article6067174.ece
2,6,2014,A historic opportunity,"The future should not be held hostage to the past. Telangana, India’s 29th State, comes into being today after a long and bitter struggle that was marked by much avoidable pain and suffering. But rather than dwell on the issues of the past, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have the opportunity to work out their future as neighbours held together by a sense of shared political and cultural history. True, in sharp contrast to the celebratory mood in Telangana, the people on the other side of the new dividing line remain wary of the immediate and lasting consequences of the bifurcation. However, the occasion of the birth of Telangana must serve as an opportunity to tackle the outstanding issues between the two States within the framework provided by the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014. Hyderabad will remain a joint capital for ten years, a period long enough to allow for reinvestment and resettlement. Allocation of employees, management of water resources and sharing of power are contentious subjects, but these can be settled through the available mechanisms. As K. Chandrasekhar Rao takes charge as Chief Minister of the new State, and N. Chandrababu Naidu as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, the challenges might seem overwhelming. But if they keep the long-term interests of their people in mind, and not their own short-term political calculations, many of the seemingly insurmountable difficulties could disappear. The two sides might have taken hardline positions during their campaign and immediately after the election, but once in power they will hopefully find some meeting ground.
Andhra Pradesh was one State where the Lok Sabha election was dominated by a ‘local’ issue: the bifurcation of the State. Political parties that until the previous general election could boast of support across the regions found themselves relegated to one or the other of the two regions — Telangana and Seemandhra. Parties were defined by their stand on the bifurcation issue, and invariably this would have an impact on how the Telangana Rashtra Samithi and the Telugu Desam Party will formulate their policies on subjects that have relevance to any Telangana-Andhra Pradesh dispute. But not more than one election can be won on the basis of the bifurcation issue, and both parties must realise the importance of addressing the larger livelihood and security concerns of the people. There is little political purchase to be had in raising disputes between the two States as emotive issues that brook no compromise. Both Mr. Rao and Mr. Naidu will serve their States well if they adopt, as suggested by Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan, a consultative process in dispute resolution. The time for political rhetoric is now past.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-historic-opportunity/article6072418.ece
2,6,2014,Douse the sparks on Article 370,"In the week since Prime Minister Narendra Modi was sworn in, a succession of controversies have threatened to overshadow his core agenda of growth and governance reform. None, however, threatens to erupt into so great a conflagration as the bitter exchanges over Article 370 of India’s Constitution. Ever since Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office, Jitendra Singh, was reported to have said that the process of abrogating Article 370 had begun, the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh have been locked in aggressive polemical exchanges. Dr. Singh has clarified — correctly — that he only spoke of initiating a debate on abrogating Article 370, a commitment made in the Bharatiya Janata Party’s election manifesto, rather than of the actual process of removing it from the Constitution. The rancour isn’t surprising, though: just as many Hindu nationalists oppose Article 370 as a barrier to the full integration of Jammu and Kashmir, many in the State see it as their only protection against existential threat. Fears of being swamped by a hostile majority remain a powerful motif in Kashmir politics — last erupting into large-scale street battles in 2008.
Little understood outside Jammu and Kashmir, Article 370 lies at the heart of the State’s constitutional relationship with India. It makes six special provisions, all emerging from the Instrument of Accession of Jammu and Kashmir. They include allowing the State its own Constitution, and limiting Parliament's authority to legislate for it. In 1954, with Sheikh Abdullah in prison, Syed Mir Qasim’s regime expanded Parliament’s powers, and extended the Constitution’s Fundamental Rights to the State. In the years since, other Constitution Orders have given the Supreme Court jurisdiction over the State, and extended to it the supervisory power of the Election Commission of India. In 2001, the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly passed a resolution seeking the restitution of the original, pristine Article 370; the BJP and some Congress leaders from the Hindu-majority Jammu province wanted it overturned altogether. The National Democratic Alliance flatly refused to discuss the Assembly’s demand. There is no doubt that there will have to be a debate on Jammu and Kashmir’s constitutional status at some point, especially if there is a final resolution of the India-Pakistan dispute over the State. The debate must be had in a calm frame of mind, though — and this is not the time to have it. Prime Minister Modi, who spoke in measured and open terms on the issue during the election campaign, would do well to douse the sparks his junior Minister has let fly, before a fire breaks out.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/douse-the-sparks-on-article-370/article6072416.ece
9,6,2014,The new urban agenda,"The new BJP government, consistent with its election manifesto statements, has outlined an urban agenda to make cities “symbols of efficiency, speed and scale.” To achieve this, it plans to prioritise housing and public transport, build 100 new cities, use technology to improve urban services, and make development sustainable. The government has also ambitiously declared that everyone would own a house by 2020. Some of these proposals seek to take forward ideas introduced by the previous Congress-led government, while a few others significantly depart from the earlier ones. For instance, policies meant to make cities slum-free and infuse investment in infrastructure were in place even earlier. Certain schemes extended home loans, provided interest subsidies, and improved land tenure to the poor, but these did not substantially reduce the housing deficit. About 95 per cent of the 18.78 million-unit housing shortage still affects the lower income groups. The question is: will this government succeed where the previous one failed? The proposal to reduce interest rates on home loans, and rope in private companies to invest in housing as part of corporate social responsibility requirements, are good initiatives. However, these will not deliver unless the incentives are strictly tied to the actual creation and delivery of affordable housing.
The concept of building new towns to accommodate growing urbanisation has been in vogue since the 1950s, but this time the BJP government has reinvented it and made a new avatar of it. Instead of building new cities in distant places around a single industrial activity, the present proposal is to build them either as a satellite city or a twin city near existing metros in order to ease urban pressure. Would this simple extension of cities fare well when compared with alternatives such as the city-cluster approach followed by China, which also announced a new urbanisation plan recently in March? Building a new city on the periphery of an existing one is a plausible solution but without a regional approach, better distribution of the urban population and the efficient integration of the hinterland will not become possible. A standardised urban growth template also will not work for all situations. The plans have to go beyond a city-centred approach, and comprehensively include larger areas around them. It will help deftly integrate greenfield development with an existing city, enable the networking of small urban centres in the vicinity using rapid transit systems, use land optimally, and protect ecological assets. Urban governance is another major area of concern. The success of the government’s policies will depend on how well they bridge the distance between intention and implementation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-new-urban-agenda/article6094999.ece
9,6,2014,The monsoon arrives,"For Keralites, it is Edavapathi, the rains that come in the middle of the Malayalam month of Edavam. The arrival of the southwest monsoon over this southern State is an event greeted with unalloyed joy and relief right across the country. The rain-bearing clouds will, in due course, make their way north, bringing to an end the unremitting heat of summer. There is hope too that the rains will lead to a bountiful harvest, thus lending an extra bounce to the economy. This year, the rains reached Kerala five days later than the long-term average date of June 1. It must be borne in mind that the date of onset is highly variable. The earliest it occurred was on May 11 (in 1918) and the most it was delayed was till June 18 (in 1972). Moreover, the date of onset is not quite an indicator of how the rainy season will shape up. Although the southwest monsoon came three days earlier than normal in 2002, that year saw a severe drought. In 1983, on the other hand, the monsoon got to Kerala almost two weeks late, but nevertheless went on to provide a surfeit of rain in the months that followed.
Mariners of yore knew and made use of the change in winds that preceded the monsoon. Strong winds blowing across the Arabian Sea are a prerequisite for transporting the vast amounts of moisture needed to sustain the huge girdle of thick clouds that provide rain over India. Sufficient levels of wind blowing from the west is among the criteria that the India Meteorological Department uses to determine monsoon onset. This year, although the winds meet those requirements, there is nevertheless concern that they have not grown powerful enough, and that the progress of the monsoon northwards might falter. The rains typically ought to reach much of the country by the end of June and the remaining parts by mid-July. However, the waters in the central and eastern parts of the equatorial Pacific Ocean have been warming rapidly and showing signs of turning into a full-fledged El Niño. A developing El Niño phenomenon can take its toll as the monsoon establishes itself over the country. If that happens this year, rainfall in June, which is essential for several crops, could be affected. A bigger worry concerns the larger impact that an El Niño might have on the monsoon. While most of the severe droughts over India have occurred when there was an El Niño, only about 43 per cent of the El Niño events that occurred over 126 years (from 1880 to 2005) resulted in deficient monsoon rains. Although all the indications are that an El Niño is indeed brewing this year, it is not clear as yet how strong it might turn out to be or how much impact it could have on the monsoon. Hoping for the best and preparing for the worst is perhaps the best strategy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-monsoon-arrives/article6095306.ece
10,6,2014,"Smaller State, bigger problems","Andhra Pradesh is now smaller in size, but the challenges before its Chief Minister, N. Chandrababu Naidu, are much bigger than they were when he ruled the undivided State from 1995 to 2004. Building a new capital near Vijayawada, attracting big-ticket investments to cities dwarfed by Hyderabad, finding funds to fulfil electoral promises such as a loan waiver for farmers and others — these are only the foremost among the many difficulties that confront him. Mr. Naidu, who has staged a remarkable comeback after a decade of being out of power, knows he will need all the help he can get from the government at the Centre. This harsh reality is reflected in the political choices he has made after the general elections. In a departure from practice, the Telugu Desam Party joined the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre. During the previous two terms of the NDA government, the TDP accepted the Speakership of the Lok Sabha, but stayed out of government. The distancing was deliberate: Mr. Naidu was keen to have the BJP as an ally to fight the Congress, but was at the same time wary of the political costs of aligning too closely with a party whose secular credentials were in question. Now, however, such considerations do not seem to matter. Mr. Naidu also inducted two Ministers from the BJP into his Cabinet, thus cementing relations with the national party further. The BJP at the Centre and the TDP in the State do not really need each other’s support, but both parties view the alliance as a long-term investment. When the TDP allied with the BJP before the election, there were many who thought that it had more to lose than gain by teaming up with a party that was seen as having supported the bifurcation of the State. But Mr. Naidu was looking well beyond the election while making his choices. And his political calculations paid off.
Unlike Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who has no stakes beyond his State, Mr. Naidu hopes that at some point his party will be able to rule both States at the same time. The TDP lost heavily in the election in the Telangana region as the whole campaign turned on the bifurcation issue. However, as the leader of a party with a political base in both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Mr. Naidu will have to push for amicable settlements to inter-State disputes. Mr. Rao, who has been making belligerent remarks on several of the contentious issues, should realise that there is little to be gained by political posturing. The interests of the people of the two States will be better served if both Chief Ministers approach the difficult issues with a dispassionate mind. Mr. Naidu can take the lead, but Mr. Rao should follow.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/smaller-state-bigger-problems/article6098221.ece
10,6,2014,"In a hole, and still digging","United States President Barack Obama’s announcement of $1 billion in military aid to selected European NATO countries has provoked mixed reactions in Europe and Russia, and has revealed domestic pressures on Mr. Obama. Announced in Warsaw on June 3, it is known as the European Reassurance Initiative. The money will cover the dispatch of more equipment to Poland, and an increased frequency of U.S. troop-rotation there. It will also involve more air patrols over the Baltic Sea and more intensive naval operations in the northern Black Sea. It is meant particularly to allay Polish, Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian fears about what those countries perceive as Russian expansionism following Moscow’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea province in March 2014. Mr. Obama has described the security of Poland and the three Baltic states as “sacrosanct”, but has said nothing about permanent U.S. bases in the countries concerned. The plan is contemporaneous with the European Union’s intention to expedite association agreements with other former Soviet republics, such as Moldova and Georgia, for finalisation later in June rather than at the end of this year.
Inevitably, Mr. Obama’s move intensifies tensions throughout Europe. On June 2, Russia’s ambassador to NATO, Alexander Grushko, reportedly told the alliance’s foreign ministers at a meeting in Brussels that their plans could revive the Cold War and the arms race. Secondly, European NATO members are divided, with Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski complaining that Washington’s plans amount only to “virtual deployments” — but countries such as Germany, France, and the United Kingdom have strong commercial and energy-related links with Russia and may resist more confrontational measures. In addition, the EU agreements might well be no more than a way for the bloc to import cheap labour and get easy access for EU businesses. Furthermore, NATO has its own agenda; with its Afghan operations winding down, its commanders may well be desperate for a new role, as they were when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. While NATO is under little scrutiny from member-states’ elected assemblies, it has direct access to the foreign ministers concerned and can put considerable pressure on them to increase deployments on Russia’s southern and western borders. Moreover, Mr. Obama’s domestic position is fraught. The money he has announced is subject to Congressional clearance, but both Republican and Democratic members of Congress are angry about his taking major decisions without their approval; many also consider the 73 per cent U.S. share of NATO defence spending to be excessive. The west faces Cold War questions it may never have expected to return to, but its current leaders are only exacerbating the problems.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/in-a-hole-and-still-digging/article6098280.ece
11,6,2014,Building on traditional links,"The swift visit by China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi was a sign that Beijing wants to lose no time in establishing contact with the Narendra Modi government and acquainting itself with its strategic and foreign policy objectives. As Mr. Wang told The Hindu, he came as a “special envoy” of Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is scheduled to visit India later in the year; Premier Li Keqiang was among the first foreign leaders to call the Prime Minister after he assumed office. Foreign Minister Wang struck all the right notes during the visit, describing India and China as “natural partners”, and the sensitive issue of the border dispute as “a question left over by history” to which there had to be a “fair” solution but which should not be allowed to adversely affect other aspects of India-China relations. He held substantive discussions with External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and National Security Adviser A.K. Doval before his meeting with Mr. Modi, during which he is reported to have conveyed a message from the Chinese President, that “[u]nder your leadership, India will achieve greater development and progress.” Clearly, China’s top leadership is eager to send positive signals to the new government. Mr. Modi has been an old friend: he visited the country four times as Gujarat Chief Minister. Beijing also likes to deal with decisive leaders and strong governments — Mr. Modi’s reputation and the BJP’s definitive electoral victory check both boxes. Moreover, at a time when most of China’s neighbours are increasingly irritated by and resentful of its actions, whether in the South China Sea or in the matter of airspace restrictions, Beijing is eager to shake off its tag as a difficult neighbour.
After his criticism during the election campaign of China's “expansionist mindset”, Mr. Wang’s visit was also an opportunity for Mr. Modi to make up by emphasising the civilisational links between the two countries, and how they “should build on them to enhance understanding of each other.” It is significant that the Chinese reach-out to India’s new leadership preceded the U.S.-India-Japan trilateral, which New Delhi is hosting later this month. India’s strategic partnerships with China’s rivals do not constitute a zero sum game – much the same way as Beijing’s partnerships with India’s rivals do not — and should not be perceived as such. Japan is Mr. Modi’s first port of call outside the region, after his visit to Thimphu at the end of this month. But it must also be noted that he will meet China’s President Xi at the BRICS summit in July. The problems in bilateral relations, including a yawning trade gap, cannot be papered over, but the latest high-level interaction reiterates that there exists willingness on both sides for pragmatic engagement.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/building-on-traditional-links/article6101794.ece
11,6,2014,An unusual recipe,"Central banks and governments around the world will be keenly watching the outcomes of a radical plan of action unveiled by the European Central Bank on June 5 in Frankfurt. The objective is to spur growth and avert the threat of deflation in the sluggish Eurozone economy. In the most noteworthy part of the announcement, the ECB cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low and took the unprecedented step of lowering the bank deposit rate to below zero. Essentially that means the ECB will be charging lenders to park their funds with the central bank. The hope is that banks will lend to credit-starved businesses, especially small ones and those in the periphery of the Eurozone. A large liquidity enhancing package has also been announced. The moves are also expected to weaken the euro, thereby making exports from the zone competitive, and push up an inflation rate that had dropped to a four-year low of 0.5 per cent in May. It is for the first time that a major central bank has taken as drastic an action as to push key interest rates into negative territory. Neither the Bank of Japan in its two-decade battle with deflation, nor the U.S. Federal Reserve in the wake of the recession, has gone so far. Observers attribute the radical steps to the president of the ECB, Mario Draghi, who two years ago brought stability to the Eurozone by acting forcefully to preserve the euro.
Given the serious threat of deflation accompanied by a high rate of unemployment, particularly in countries on the outskirts of the Eurozone, the ECB’s action has won more supporters than critics. As was amply demonstrated in Japan, deflation has several deleterious consequences. It cuts into business profits, raises real debt, and discourages household consumption and investment. The central bank’s gamble might pay off if businesses and consumers start believing that prices will not fall further. It is therefore a question of managing expectations, a topic that has been engaging central banks around the world. For India and other developing countries which face rising prices, the threat of deflation is extremely remote. The ECB’s package is nevertheless important because if it succeeds in reviving the Eurozone economy, India’s trade and other economic relations with an important grouping will benefit. The ECB has also promised to supplement its interest rate action with a massive bond purchase programme, akin to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing. If the plan of an ultra-soft monetary policy in Europe materialises, it will help India and other developed countries face with greater equanimity the consequences of the Fed’s ongoing programme of withdrawal of its quantitative easing.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-unusual-recipe/article6101795.ece
12,6,2014,Focus on diamond quadrilateral,"In keeping with the BJP’s election manifesto, and the campaign pronouncements of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the first address by President Pranab Mukherjee to the joint session of Parliament has kept the focus clearly on growth and development of infrastructure. While a major programme for the development of the national highways was launched during the Vajpayee government’s tenure, Mr. Modi has outlined a significant plan for the expansion of the railway system in the country. Of course, there is an equal emphasis on reviving the pace of development of the stalled highway projects, as also on embarking on port-led development along India’s long coastline. The government recently emphasised the need to strengthen safety and security on the Railways, and taking the Kakodkar committee report on safety and funding seriously. With the slowdown in the economy, and the unwillingness of successive Railway Ministers to raise fares, not much could be achieved on this front over the last few years. One major initiative during the past decade of the UPA involved the conceptualisation of western and eastern railway corridors. Preparatory work has been launched on the western corridor linking Delhi and Mumbai, with Japanese technology and funding.
Now the President’s address has outlined a ‘diamond quadrilateral project of high speed trains.’ Perhaps modelled on the golden quadrilateral national highways programme, this project could provide special high-speed corridors to link the four main metros. Mr. Modi has hinted at enlisting the support of Japan and China in fast-tracking special and hi-tech Railway projects. Both Japan and China have the experience and the technology to operate bullet trains. High-speed trains could be the answer to the congestion along the highways and slowing road speeds. But it calls for huge investments and consequently high fares. Other concepts mentioned in the address relate to ‘agri-rail networks’ for the quick movement of perishable commodities, and the expansion of the rail network in the northeast. In addition to going in for these dedicated corridors and high-speed trains, the Indian Railways must get its act together on safety and security on the rails — both in terms of technology and human resources. Safety is of paramount importance, given the magnitude of the operations and the more than a million passengers carried every day. It is hoped that these dream projects do not remain on paper. The new Railway Minister, D.V. Sadananda Gowda, has his job cut out for him. He needs the full backing of Nitin Gadkari, who oversees the infrastructure portfolios, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, and of course Prime Minister Modi, to get started on the ambitious projects.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/focus-on-diamond-quadrilateral/article6105076.ece
12,6,2014,Kick-off time in Brazil,"As Brazil readies itself to host its first FIFA World Cup in 64 years, the tournament is viewed as a burden on a nation that has failed to provide basic amenities to many of its citizens. The $1.1-billion budget for the stadium has been exceeded by at least 1000 per cent, not to forget the inordinate expenditure on security and infrastructure. The delay in preparation was exacerbated by the absence of World Cup-related legislation until June 2012; the previous host, South Africa, had passed the bill four years in advance while the 2018 host, Russia, approved it last year. FIFA has attracted criticism as well for allowing former Brazilian Football Confederation president Ricardo Teixeira, previously accused in major corruption cases, to take charge of the Local Organising Committee. Indeed, the Brazilian government itself found Mr. Teixeira guilty of creating an “administrative disaster”. The disaffection with the tournament reached its highest point during last year’s Confederations Cup when an increase in bus fares prompted large-scale protests that demanded “FIFA-quality” facilities for all. The subsequent repression by the military and the police evoked the trauma of the dictatorship that severely affected the majority of Brazil’s current middle-aged population. While many, including FIFA president Sepp Blatter, have derided the protesters for taking advantage of the excessive media glare on the country, it is necessary to address their sense of alienation.
Indeed, a successful tournament may work as “the opium of the people.” Though the social problems will not be forgotten, a Brazil win would exorcise the pain of its loss at home in the 1950 World Cup. Under coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, who had led the team to its last title in 2002, the host has developed into an exceptionally balanced side with Neymar as its star forward. But the shadow of the defending champion, Spain, lurks ominously, considering that it has also won consecutive European Championship titles. Led by Lionel Messi, Argentina will benefit from a dominant line of attackers and familiarity of playing conditions. Germany is boosted by its bounteous midfield talent, but the lack of a specialist forward may prove to be its undoing. In a break from tradition, Italy will be one of the most exciting teams to watch considering its strategic versatility. The previous edition’s runner-up, the Netherlands, as also France and England, are expected to pose a serious challenge. Chile and Belgium are viewed as the likely underdogs, but discount Bosnia-Herzegovina and Japan only at your own peril. Meanwhile, connoisseurs of the game everywhere will be expecting high-quality football, and hoping that the chaos that preceded the build-up to the event does not cast a shadow on football’s quadrennial showpiece.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/kickoff-time-in-brazil/article6105075.ece
13,6,2014,Consistency and restraint,"A quick end to an emerging controversy is in the interest of a new government, especially one that has set an ambitious agenda for itself. The question of succession in the Army leadership was expected to be one such impending row as the Bharatiya Janata Party had raised issues of propriety when the outgoing Congress regime chose to name the next Chief of the Army Staff towards the fag end of its term and with well over two months to go for the incumbent to retire. Defence Minister Arun Jaitley has done well to give an early quietus to this question by declaring in Parliament that Lt. Gen. Dalbir Singh Suhag’s appointment is final and that the government stands by it. The National Democratic Alliance regime has chosen wisely to stay above the temptation to politicise it. By deciding that it would continue to defend the Army chief-designate against a legal challenge in the Supreme Court, the ruling party has indicated that it never had a problem with Lt. Gen. Suhag’s suitability or merit, and had reservations only about the timing of his appointment. For sections of the ruling party, the government’s error, if any, may have been in its consistency: it has repeated in a recent affidavit in the Supreme Court the contents of an affidavit that the previous UPA regime had submitted before the Armed Forces Tribunal. Those contents include remarks against V.K. Singh, former chief of the Army and a Minister in the present government, charging him with acting without material basis and in a premeditated manner while imposing a ‘discipline and vigilance ban’ on Lt. Gen. Suhag in 2012.
While the Defence Ministry is expected to maintain consistency in ongoing judicial proceedings, there can be no justification for Mr. Singh to comment on the government’s conduct and cast aspersions on the reputation of the Army chief-designate. Mr. Singh is no stranger to controversy, but it was hoped that he would give up his contentious ways after getting elected to the Lok Sabha with a massive victory margin and being appointed a Minister of State, for the North East, among others. The least that was expected of him was that he would avoid voicing an adverse opinion on an issue in which he was fully involved while in service. It is disquieting that one wing of the government casts aspersions on a Minister while he publicly questions the Union government’s stand. So far, the government has merely stated that there can be no politics over the Army chief’s appointment and does not seem to be embarrassed by the whole episode. It can afford to ignore calls for his resignation or removal, but there is little doubt that there is a case for Minister V.K. Singh to be advised restraint, and the adverse remarks on him toned down.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/consistency-and-restraint/article6108339.ece
13,6,2014,Banking on governance,"The report of an RBI-appointed committee under the chairmanship of former Axis Bank head P.J. Nayak that reviewed issues of governance in banks was released just before the announcement of the parliamentary election results. There is a risk of the report getting lost in the abundance of official and non-official recommendations and suggestions on financial sector reform that are now available to the new government. On the other hand, the committee’s report might well be the blueprint that a new government that is keen on reform might consider adopting, albeit with modifications. The report has already become controversial, with major bank trade unions threatening to go on strike against its key recommendations that are centred on the dilution of government ownership in public sector banks (PSBs) to 50 per cent of their paid-up capital, and the revamping of their boards. No one doubts that PSBs suffer from external constraints flowing from dual regulation by the Finance Ministry and the government. They also face severe restrictions in being subject to external vigilance — by the Central Vigilance Commission and the Central Bureau of Investigation. Corporate governance has suffered because of weak board supervision and excessive government interference. These in turn have resulted in policy objectives rather than commercial considerations dictating business decisions. There has been a lack of transparency in appointing top managers of PSBs. Most of them are not able to stand up to government interference and this has largely contributed to weak governance. PSBs lag behind private banks with respect to a wide range of parameters such as profitability and asset quality.
An immediate task before the government as the majority owner stake-holder in these banks is to find very large amounts of capital to take care of their impaired assets and also meet the international capital adequacy norms following their shift to Basel-III, which is imminent. The Nayak Committee has proposed that the government stake in the banks be transferred to a separate bank investment company which will be professionally managed and be able to raise resources. A separate category of authorised bank investors (ABIs) will be allowed to own up to 20 per cent of a private bank without regulatory approval. On the face of it, recommendations such as this are not for the PSBs, but they will be applicable once the government brings its stake down to 50 per cent or below. It is therefore not surprising that many, even those who are not on the side of the bank unions, see the report as a push towards bank privatisation. It is precisely on that score that the report, though well-intentioned, needs a great deal of deliberation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/banking-on-governance/article6108340.ece
14,6,2014,Change @ Infosys,"The most successful start-up venture in the country, founded at a time when start-ups were largely unknown here, has just set foot into a new era. After being led for the last three decades and more of its existence by one or the other of its co-founders, the $8.25-billion Infosys has now been passed on to the hands of its first non-founder CEO who is also an outsider. The appointment of 47-year-old Vishal Sikka, former Chief Technology Officer of SAP Labs, as CEO-designate brings to an end a turbulent period in Infosys — once a stock market darling — ever since N.R. Narayana Murthy returned to helm the company last June. Mr. Murthy stepped in after the Board requested his return to steady the ship, but ironically, the fact of his return together with his son as executive assistant was seen as a retrograde move in terms of corporate governance. High-profile senior executives, some of them groomed over the years for the top job, headed straight for the exit as their career paths suddenly turned uncertain within the company. Infosys lost more than a dozen senior managers in the last one year alone. The fact that the search committee formed by the Board to identify the next CEO had to settle for an outsider to lead a company that was once known for its top-management bandwidth tells a story in itself.
Significant as this is, equally so is the fact that Mr. Murthy, Rohan Murthy and co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan, currently the executive vice-chairman, are stepping down right away. This is pragmatic and prudent even as it dispelled doubts that were expressed over the rationale for Mr. Narayana Murthy’s return and over the nature of governance in the company. In a sense, Mr. Murthy has proved his critics wrong. With the seniors out, Dr. Sikka now gets a free hand to mould the company without having to keep looking behind his back. The exit of top-drawer talent over the last one year may have left Infosys poorer, but it can also be argued that it is an opportunity for Dr. Sikka to assemble a team of his choice. He will need a strong A-team to back him up, especially because he will be operating out of the U.S. That Dr. Sikka, a Stanford University computer science PhD, faces a stiff challenge will be stressing the obvious, but the fact is that Infosys — and indeed the entire IT industry in India — needs to recode its business model. The company needs to move on to the next level from simple IT services and systems management to software and product platforms in the era of newer technologies such as cloud computing. This is where Dr. Sikka’s educational and professional background will be of value. Watching him and his moves closely will be not only the founders of Infosys and its investors but also competitors who are grappling with similar issues.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/change-infosys/article6112273.ece
14,6,2014,Pricing public transport,"The launch of the metro railway service in Mumbai, which has enhanced public transport options in the teeming city, would have normally called for unqualified appreciation. However, the row over fares between the State government and Reliance Infrastructure, the latter holding the majority share in this public-private partnership project, has dampened the enthusiasm and in fact raised serious concerns. The outcome of this dispute, which the courts will determine, could affect the future functioning of the project and have a significant bearing on other metro rail schemes that seek private funding and participation. The 11.4-km elevated Mumbai Metro line has improved connectivity and reduced travel time for thousands of passengers. Just before the service was launched, Reliance Infrastructure steeply revised the fares and increased the range of fares, originally fixed at Rs.9 to Rs.13, to Rs.10 to Rs.40. The government has opposed this since it is higher than the pre-agreed fare and decided without any consultation. Reliance Infrastructure has defended the action, stating that under the Metro Railways Act it has the authority to fix fares. The increase in the project cost from Rs.2,356 crore to Rs.4,321 crore and higher operational costs had warranted the change, it asserted.
Almost every metro rail project in the country has overshot the projected cost. Companies often tend to underestimate the cost and inflate user-figures to convince funding agencies that travel by metro rail would be relatively inexpensive. Later, they complain of cost overruns and demand higher allocations. Ticket prices are then raised and the travelling public bears the burden of such poor planning. Fares should be affordable, particularly to the large number of lower-income group users, and should factor in the less visible benefits that accrue from the service. Increasing the use of public transport relieves road congestion, reduces pollution and cuts fuel consumption. Realising this, cities such as Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, have made public travel free for its citizens. Even if Mumbai and other Indian cities do not want to take such a radical route, and decide periodically to review fares, the process should be transparent and fair — more so when the private sector operates public transport. Striving to balance subsidy and revenue is understandable, but high prices should not affect transport choices. Alternative financing options must be explored. Many countries have mobilised funds by imposing additional charges for using private cars, which pollute more and occupy road space disproportionately. The urban future lies in promoting good public transport, and its success depends on fair pricing and quality service.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pricing-public-transport/article6112274.ece
16,6,2014,Time for the final push,"In the President’s address to Parliament, the NDA government announced its commitment to enacting the long-pending Bill that seeks to reserve a third of the seats in Parliament and the State Assemblies for women. Recent reports suggest that with the Samajwadi Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal — that had opposed the Bill in its present form in the past — now numerically reduced in the Lok Sabha, the government should have no problem in mustering a two-thirds majority to push through this contentious piece of legislation with the help of the Congress and the Left parties. This argument, however, does not factor in the reality that even during the UPA’s 10 year-long rule, the Congress, the BJP and the Left parties together had the numbers to pass the Bill in the Lok Sabha. The problem lay elsewhere: when the Rajya Sabha approved the Bill in March 2010, the UPA was forced to use marshals to physically check MPs who got unruly and violent, rendering the entire episode controversial, and acting as a deterrent to using the same tactics in the Lok Sabha. In 2014, the SP, the BSP and the RJD may have been rendered ineffective, but at least two of the BJP’s partners in the NDA, the Shiv Sena and the Lok Jan Shakti Party, have traditionally opposed the Bill and it is not clear whether they have had a change of heart since.
In the past, MPs belonging to the Other Backward Classes across all political parties — including the BJP — have argued vociferously that reservation for women in the legislatures would reduce the representation of OBCs who had fought a long and hard battle to get their share in Parliament, as women candidates would be drawn largely from the elite, upper-caste sections. This is a fallacious argument: for parties selecting candidates, men or women, generally factor in the caste composition of the individual constituency. Indeed, even in the 16th Lok Sabha, a third of the 62 women MPs belong to the OBCs, reflecting the increase in their numbers in the House over the years. The reason for the violent and rancorous opposition to the Bill springs not merely from the fact that many male legislators will lose their seats, nor from the fact that the rotation of seats every five years will ensure that MPs may no longer be able to ‘nurture’ their constituencies. The real battle is for political power: for, if the Bill does become law and at least 181 women sit in the Lok Sabha and corresponding numbers in State Assemblies across the country, it will result in a fundamental change in the power dynamics in an arena where it matters the most — decision-making in the highest echelons of the country. Will the BJP government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi address the women’s reservation issue with the seriousness and determination it demands?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/time-for-the-final-push/article6117046.ece
16,6,2014,Premature optimism,"The latest economic data relating to retail inflation and factory output can give rise to optimism. Consumer price index inflation for May at 8.28 per cent on a year-on-year basis was lower than the 8.59 per cent for the previous month. The index of industrial production (IIP) grew 3.4 per cent in April over the same period last year. In March it had contracted by 0.5 per cent. Also, in April, according to government figures there was a revival in exports. Merchandise trade deficit shrunk as exports grew after declining over the previous three months. All these relate to a period when UPA-II was in power. However, for the NDA government these could be a harbinger of better times. At the very least, the first set of important monthly statistics after the new government was formed can reinforce the robust sentiment reflected in the stock indices and spur the Narendra Modi government’s economic revival plans. Yet, for all their positive connotations, evidence of a growth revival is not robust. The IIP, regarded as an important lead indicator, has often been faulted for being inconsistent and volatile. The drop in retail inflation by itself is not significant enough to influence the Reserve Bank of India to cut rates immediately. Food inflation, which has underpinned both the main inflation indices, has not come down appreciably. Core retail inflation, excluding food and fuel prices, has remained high.
Besides, there are other important risks. The forecast of a less-than-satisfactory monsoon raises the possibility of higher agricultural prices. All of a sudden the geopolitical situation in West Asia has deteriorated sharply. Petroleum prices have shot up in the global markets and this naturally has important ramifications for India. Oil imports will become more expensive. The much-vaunted reduction in the current account deficit to below 2 per cent of GDP as was seen last year (2013-14) will be difficult to achieve now. Higher oil prices can push up other commodity prices. India’s subsidy burden might go up, adding to the fiscal deficit. If, however, the government decides to pass on the burden of high global oil prices to consumers, retail inflation will rise. Turning to factory output data, it is difficult to explain the 16 per cent jump in the capital goods segment in April, the highest such rise in nine months. In March it had contracted by 11.6 per cent. Over three months the trend in capital goods output has been negative. The small uptick in intermediate goods does not really suggest a revival. Bank credit has grown at a lower rate than what an economy on the rebound would require. The upshot of all this is: the usual lead indicators need to be evaluated over time to draw firm conclusions regarding the economy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/premature-optimism/article6117043.ece
17,6,2014,Reaching out to Bhutan,"Thimphu has been as out of the ordinary a choice of destination for the first bilateral visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as was his invitation to the heads of SAARC countries to his swearing-in. The common theme though is India’s neighbourhood, and the strategic overtones in the Prime Minister’s Bhutan visit were hard to miss. Bhutan-India relations are governed by a friendship treaty that was renegotiated only in 2007, freeing Thimphu’s external relations from New Delhi, but still subjecting the Himalayan nation’s security needs to supervision. India has also provided financial assistance to its tiny neighbour’s five-year development plans since 1961, last year committing Rs.4,500 crore for the period up to 2018. The gamut of ties between the two countries covers cooperation and investment in infrastructure development, health, education and most significantly, hydropower projects. Meanwhile, Bhutan itself has undergone radical changes, transitioning from a benevolent monarchy to a democracy. A new generation of Bhutanese have come of age under the new system. The country held its second democratic election last year, one in which, for the first time, resentment against New Delhi’s “meddling” through the cutting of fuel subsidies, among other actions, was openly expressed. Supporters of the Druk Phuensum Tshogpa, which lost the election after its first term, believed that New Delhi was cut up with the 2012 meeting between Wen Jiabao, the then Chinese premier and Jigmey Thinley, then Prime Minister of Bhutan.
At that meeting, which was held in Rio de Janeiro on the sidelines of a multilateral forum, the Chinese side was quoted as saying that Beijing was “willing to complete border demarcation with Bhutan at an early date.” Both sides have held many rounds of talks on the issue, without coming close to a resolution. Chinese territorial claims in western Bhutan are close to the Siliguri Corridor, also known as Chicken’s Neck, the narrow strip of land that connects West Bengal to northeastern India. China is also interested in establishing formal ties with Thimphu, where it does not yet have a diplomatic mission despite a nearly 500-km shared border with Bhutan. All this is no doubt causing concern in New Delhi, and is clearly part of the reason Prime Minister Modi chose to visit the country quickly. During the visit, the two sides reiterated an important clause in the 2007 Treaty — neither side will allow its territory to be used for “purposes inimical” to the other. India cannot stop a sovereign country from establishing diplomatic relations with other countries. What it can do though is to protect and nurture its relations with Bhutan in a way that the friendship grows and does not falter.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/reaching-out-to-bhutan/article6120402.ece
17,6,2014,The tasks in Uttarakhand,"In June 2013, unprecedented flash floods and landslips wreaked havoc in Uttarakhand. That it was a man-made calamity was clear: unplanned development and misuse of the lower Himalayan region’s natural resources were at its root. The chief question to be answered is this: to what extent did human over-activity contribute to it? Specifically, what has been the impact of unhindered religious traffic, even tourism? The boom in such traffic had put a severe strain on infrastructure. Scores of hotels, guesthouses and religious centres sprang up, some of them on the flood plains of the Mandakini and the Alakananda rivers, which join to form the Ganga. Several of them were washed away. The valley where the Ganga, the Bhagirathi and the Alaknanda flow should be declared an eco-sensitive zone. This has to be done in a manner that factors in the religious sentiments of millions of people keen to undertake what they would consider a sacred journey. The livelihood concerns of people who depend on tourism need to be taken into account, too. Dams, barrages and tunnels had impacted the course of rivers. Scores of them are in place in Uttarakhand alone. Some of them come with dams, but a majority are run-of-the-river projects requiring tunnelling through mountains. Debris from some of the displaced structures caused havoc downstream. However, it is equally true that the devastation would have been even more widespread had the Tehri reservoir failed to contain a significant volume of the deluge. So, the critical issue may not be dams per se, but overall hydel management. Another lesson that remains to be learnt relates to the role of deforestation in making the region vulnerable to landslips and erosion. The absence of vegetation in the higher reaches aids landslips.
The task of reconstruction is nowhere near completion. Post-disaster, the State government set up a Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Authority to look into planning and development of the region. But in a holistic sense, precious little has been done to address the larger issues. A full-fledged Ministry as part of the Union government needs to be created to chart out and implement — in tandem with the State government — an action plan to set priorities for the region and preserve its ecology, while striking the right balance between its development needs and the vulnerability factors. A suitable mechanism, bringing together scientific expertise, dispassionate efficiency and administrative acumen, should be put in place to ensure proper and transparent utilisation under diligent oversight of the aid package that was made available. Uttarakhand and the rest of the region needs to pick up the pieces and move forward — and be certain that its future will be secured against any more disasters to come.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-tasks-in-uttarakhand/article6120404.ece
18,6,2014,"Answering to law, not to Caesar","Last week’s leak of an Intelligence Bureau report slamming foreign-funded non-governmental organisations for retarding India’s development ought to generate concern about the capabilities and sense of balance of those charged with defending the republic. Liberally plagiarising from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speeches, the report alleges that a “significant number of Indian NGOs funded by donors based in US, UK, Germany and Netherlands have been noticed to be using people-centric issues to create an environment, which lends itself to stalling development projects.” It argues that NGO interventions led, among other things, to the scrapping of Posco’s steel plant project and the Vedanta bauxite project in Orissa, dams in Arunachal Pradesh, and research into genetically-modified plants — supposedly shaving 2 per cent to 3 per cent off India’s Gross Domestic Product. Leaving aside the dubious arithmetic underlying this claim, the more worrying fact is that the report happily elides over Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s role in agitating against bauxite mining in Odisha, or former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh’s opposition to genetically-modified crops. Nor can it be the Intelligence Bureau’s case that it is illegitimate to seek to mobilise people around causes, the stuff of democracy. There can of course be two opinions on the wisdom of the politics of Greenpeace or other NGOs, but it is significant that the Intelligence Bureau did not find any criminal wrong-doing.
The larger issue, though, isn’t incompetent spies: it is the dysfunctional role of the intelligence services in our republic. In the decades after Independence, successive Prime Ministers turned the Intelligence Bureau into a kind of private detective service for the government, charging it with surveilling everything from political opponents to routine economic activity. The Intelligence Bureau — often with little domain competence — weighs in on everything from the appointment of judges to the credentials of business houses. In most developed democracies, the law would render such activities illegal. In India, though, there are no laws — and no major party is committed to enacting one. Though politicians when out of office routinely rail against the Intelligence Bureau’s political espionage, they discover its advantages once seated on the throne. This has had a demonstrable cost: even though the Intelligence Bureau is a third below its sanctioned strength, the vast majority of its personnel are committed to duties of dubious relevance to national security. The Intelligence Bureau is charged with the defence of the republic, not with the defence of the policies and interests of whoever is in office. It is time for law to guide the intelligence services’ work, not Caesar.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/answering-to-law-not-to-caesar/article6123746.ece
18,6,2014,Turning to Iran,"The rapid advance across Iraq by Islamic State in the Levant (ISIL), the Syria-based extreme Sunni militia, to the point where its forces are only 60 km from Baghdad, has caused a serious humanitarian crisis and reopened several questions that are central to the future of West Asia. Over half a million people have fled Iraq’s western province, Anbar, for the northeastern province of Kurdistan; the refugees need food and shelter urgently, and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is already involved. In addition, images apparently showing ISIL summarily executing captured Iraqi soldiers have been posted online; the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Navi Pillay, states that if confirmed the executions would constitute war crimes. Secondly, ISIL has caused panic in the Iraqi army, sections of which have fled leaving behind tanks and other heavy weaponry. Thirdly, the United States and the United Kingdom, which led the illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003, now face contradictions they themselves have created.
A key reason for this situation is that in 2003 the invaders abolished Iraq’s public and civic institutions, in the deluded belief that all Iraqi officials were fanatical Saddam Hussein followers. Almost immediately, extreme Sunni and Shia leaders started a savage civil war, dividing Iraqi society and enabling al-Qaeda to establish a powerful presence where it previously had none. Matters were then exacerbated by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki’s sectarianism; he sacked 700,000 Sunnis from the military and banned substantial numbers of Sunnis from civilian public-service posts. Widespread corruption and brutality on the part of government militias have made things even worse; some Mosul residents say that ISIL has brought renewed stability and an end to fighting, bomb explosions, and looting. Moreover, two allies, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, have been funding and possibly arming ISIL with a view to overthrowing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad; Riyadh and Doha might also seek to remove Mr. al Maliki’s Shia-dominated government. Above all, the British and American lies about Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction in 2003 now mean military intervention will not be tolerated by the public in either country. President Barack Obama is sending 275 troops to protect U.S. embassy staff in Baghdad, but he is on a slippery slope. As their entire political strategy towards the region collapses, and despite the harm done to Iran by western sanctions, Washington and London are finally seeking Iran’s help. They are doing so for instrumental reasons, but a constructive response from Tehran could be an immense contribution to regional peace.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/turning-to-iran/article6123749.ece
19,6,2014,Democratic credentials on test,"The National Democratic Alliance government’s attempt to nudge some Governors appointed by the previous regime to quit, amidst reports that not all of them are willing to go on their own, has revived the debate on the politicisation of the office of Governor. In 2004, the United Progressive Alliance government removed some Governors appointed by the regime that preceded it, and the present dispensation wants to follow that precedent. The difference between 2004 and the present is quite marked. Until 2010, the predominant notion was that since a Governor holds office at the pleasure of the President, subject to a five-year term, she could be removed at any time and for no reason at the Centre’s instance. However, in B.P. Singhal vs. Union of India (2010), the Supreme Court ruled that a Governor’s removal is justiciable and there should be good, valid and compelling reasons for such a removal. The power should not be exercised arbitrarily, capriciously or unreasonably. It is quite ironic that the Bharatiya Janata Party, which was aggrieved by the removal of its appointees as soon as the UPA took charge in 2004, is now in a hurry to ease out at least some of the UPA appointees.
The view that a new regime can remove a Governor on the ground that she is out of sync with the policies and ideology of the party in power at the Centre or that the ruling party has lost confidence in her, has been rejected by the Supreme Court. For too long, the office has been used to rehabilitate politicians defeated in elections or as a reward for retired bureaucrats and intelligence officials. It is surprising that in over six decades since the Constitution was adopted very few eminent persons in fields other than politics and civil or military service have been appointed Governors. Several Governors have acted as partisans of the ruling party at the Centre and hindered the smooth functioning of State governments. The Sarkaria Commission on Centre-State relations suggested that a Governor should be someone eminent in some walk of life, one “not too intimately connected with the local politics of the State,” and should not be one “who has taken too great a part in politics generally, and particularly in the recent past.” It suggested that a politician from the ruling party at the Centre should not be appointed Governor of a State run by another party. If only these norms are followed in practice, the need to ease out “inconvenient” Governors will not arise. The real test of the new government’s democratic credentials would be whether it resists the temptation to replace the Congress politicians and favourites with its own party men put out to pasture, and appoints suitable eminent personalities in line with the Sarkaria Commission’s recommendations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/democratic-credentials-on-test/article6127248.ece
19,6,2014,Beyond Bogota’s ballot,"The mandate that Colombian centre-right President >Juan Manuel Santos won on Sunday for a second term is bound to trigger huge expectations from among the mainstream left parties that backed, with good reason, his re-election. The peace negotiations that the President has held in the past four years with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), with support from Cuba, have progressed to some degree. Mr. Santos’s government and the FARC have reached an agreement to promote agrarian reform, facilitate political participation for members of the militia, and to sever links with the drug mafia. But nothing less than a decisive end to the country’s 50-year old civil war, that has killed over 200,000 people and displaced millions, could ensure stability and security in this Andean country. In fact, the conflict in Colombia is viewed widely as the longest in recent memory and the displacement of people, the largest until the recent tragic developments in Syria. But justice for the victims and the demobilisation of the FARC remain contentious issues in the negotiations. The President’s pursuit of peace with an extremist insurgency had pitted him against the conservative party of two-term President Alfaro Uribe, which denounced the peace process as little more than one granting impunity for terrorists. His right-wing challenger in the recent polls, Óscar Iván Zuluaga, topped in the first round although the margin was not good enough to avoid a run-off. The surge in support for Mr. Santos in Sunday’s run-off was reminiscent of the 2002 French presidential election that saw the left and centrist rally behind Jacques Chirac’s UMP party.
Mr. Santos’s own record in dealing with public officials, a large number of whom are linked with paramilitary groups and organised crime, has strengthened the perception of him as a leader who was not particularly effective, even if guided by the best of intentions. A controversial recent decision relates to his endorsement of the ouster of the Mayor of Bogota, a senior directly elected politician, and a prolonged bar on his standing for public office. Indeed, Amnesty International observed recently that peace talks have had little influence in preventing large-scale human rights violations in the country. Colombia has emerged in recent years as the third largest economy in Latin America. Sustaining the benefits of economic growth would be inconceivable in the absence of genuine adherence to the values of a free and democratic order underpinned by the rule of law and respect for human rights. Mr. Santos can ill-afford to fritter away the advantage of a decisive mandate, one that could potentially transform the prospects of the people of Colombia.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/beyond-bogotas-ballot/article6127247.ece
20,6,2014,A dangerous road in Sri Lanka,"Anti-Muslim violence in what were once idyllic tourist spots on the southern Sri Lankan coast has once again underscored the majoritarianism that has dominated the politics of the country since the end of the war against the LTTE in 2009. Four people were killed and scores injured, and houses and businesses looted and burnt over two days. The violence, clearly instigated by a recently formed extremist Buddhist organisation called the Bodu Bala Sena, affected the seaside towns of Aluthgama and Beruwala. It was serious enough for the government to declare a curfew and call out the Army and a special police force to maintain the peace, perhaps for the first time in that part of the country since the violent JVP insurrection of the 1980s. But for over two years, the Sri Lankan government had chosen to ignore the provocative activities of the BBS, doing nothing to rein it in despite a body of evidence that the group was involved in previous incidents targeting mainly the Muslim minority, and also Christians. Instead, both President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his powerful brother, Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, visited the office of the BBS on separate occasions, signalling powerful patronage and giving it a stamp of legitimacy. Anti-Muslim tension had been brewing in Aluthgama ever since an altercation between three Muslim men and a Buddhist monk last week. Many sensible voices in the area, and in Sri Lanka’s wider civil society, pleaded against permitting the BBS to hold a rally there on June 15. Their fears came true as the violence began immediately after a particularly provocative anti-minority speech by a Buddhist monk. Armed policemen who were deployed at the rally did hardly anything to bring the situation under control.
Having recently emerged from a long war and still mired in a host of issues relating to that conflict, including the unsettled question of Tamil political aspirations that first gave rise to it, Sri Lanka could have done far better with the opportunity it had to remake itself. Instead, the narrow political ambitions of its leaders to consolidate majority sentiment seem to be driving the Sinhala nationalist desire for new enemies. Already on watch by the world for his handling of post-war Tamil issues, President Rajapaksa is once again on the mat for being stand-offish while another minority was being targeted. Since then, he has visited the affected areas and promised compensation. But no formal condemnation of the violence, or of those behind it, has been forthcoming from the government. There is still time to nip this in the bud, but for that the President will have to do more than merely send out messages on social media that ‘we can’t let anyone harm any person or property.’",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-dangerous-road-in-sri-lanka/article6130772.ece
20,6,2014,An intractable problem,"The unexpected spike in wholesale inflation to a five-month high of 6.01 per cent in May from 5.2 per cent in April, largely underpinned by high food prices, has forced an already concerned government to unleash a package of measures to curb food prices. It has slapped high minimum export prices on two important staples, onions and potatoes, to discourage their exports. It has advised State governments to exempt perishables such as fruits and vegetables from the purview of the state-administered APMC Act. This legislation gives near-monopoly status to traders and middlemen to procure, stock and trade food produce. The Food Corporation of India has been asked to offload 5 million tonnes of rice from its overflowing godowns. The Centre cannot probably go much further than these minimal steps as agriculture is largely in the domain of the States. Yet, given the persistent nature of the problem, a holistic approach involving the States is called for. Food inflation has averaged 11 per cent over the last seven years. Though cooling slightly in April, it rose to 9.5 per cent in May and might go up further if the South West monsoon turns out to be below par. Consumers base their expectations of future prices on the present levels of retail inflation, which again is largely determined by food prices. Curbing skyrocketing food prices is imperative, not just because it means sound economics but also as a political necessity.
Recent elections both at the level of the States and the Centre were fought primarily over an economic agenda in which inflation topped the list. The NDA government has to meet the very high expectations of people who have been ravaged by high food prices. High inflation has directly translated into reduced purchasing power, especially for the poor. This partly explains why despite a bumper harvest last year rural consumption remained weak. Going beyond the short-term steps announced, the time has come to devise a long-term strategy to tackle food prices. The urgent need is to reduce the numerous intermediaries between farmers and consumers. It should be possible for farmers to fetch a higher price without pushing up the price paid by consumers. Though talked about for a long time, this has been difficult to implement because of political opposition from lobbies representing middlemen and traders. To minimise wastage of farm produce, especially of perishables such as vegetables and milk, it is necessary to put in place a robust system of logistics including cold chain facilities. Reforming the outmoded food management system is a subject that has gained traction recently. The phenomenon of overflowing granaries co-existing with high cereal inflation is totally unacceptable, but continues for want of the political will to reform the system.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-intractable-problem/article6130773.ece
21,6,2014,India faces the Iraq test,"The taking into custody of 40 Indians, drawn into the crossfire of a bitter power struggle in Iraq between an assertive but marginalised Sunni minority and the government led by President Nouri al-Maliki, has brought into focus the Narendra Modi government’s crisis management skills. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a jihadi group, is apparently behind the detention and relocation of the workers, who are from Punjab, into a cotton warehouse in the vicinity of Mosul — Iraq’s second largest city that is an ethnically divided demographic powder keg. Yet, there are indications that Sunni tribesmen, who may not share the ISIS’s virulent extremist ideology but are in a tactical embrace with it in order to counter the government of Mr. Nouri al-Maliki, which has Shia overtones, are holding the victims. The detentions, along with the entrapment of 46 nurses in a Tikrit hospital, is cause for deep anxiety; the crisis has dwarfed the 2004 abduction and release of three Indian truck drivers near Baghdad. Apart from India, countries such as China and Turkey, whose nationals have been detained in large numbers, are experiencing the pain. The blowback of the incident has hit the government hard, persuading External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to meet the distraught families of the victims, who have no option but to seek solace from the Central government.
The government is facing a complex crisis that has to be tackled at multiple levels. In order to get the hostages released, New Delhi is apparently using the channels of the Iraqi Red Crescent to communicate with the militants. Its immediate worry is to ensure safe passage that would allow the evacuation of the workers from their present locations to the Kurdish-dominated Erbil airport, which is much safer, geographically and otherwise, than the battle-hit route to Baghdad heading towards the south. But the government has to worry beyond the immediate, for a crisis of much larger proportions can emerge should fighting spill into the oil-rich south, where a large proportion of the 20,000 Indians in Iraq live. The danger of an escalation of regional upheavals is real if Iran, in supporting the Shia-dominated south, gets embroiled in the crisis — possibly creating a spiral of tensions with rival Saudi Arabia. Finally, New Delhi has also to be prepared for the internationalisation of the events in Iraq, as well as a sharp and painful spurt in oil prices, especially if the United States chooses to launch air strikes against opposition strongholds. For this could raise concerns in Russia and China that have been reacting vigorously to events in West Asia, especially Syria, in the aftermath of the 2011 fall of Qadhafi in Libya.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/india-faces-the-iraq-test/article6134195.ece
21,6,2014,"Needed, more deliberation","Many of the key recommendations of the high-level Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC) continue to attract criticism, more than a year after its report was released. Chaired by retired Supreme Court Judge B.N. Srikrishna, the FSLRC was given a wide mandate to prepare a blueprint for a new financial architecture. The report has evoked strong responses, with some calling it a potential game-changer and others faulting it for being out of touch with the Indian reality. The FSLRC has had to grapple with several dissenting views among its members. It is not surprising therefore that the report of the commission dealing with a radical overhaul of the financial architecture — an enormously time-consuming process — has remained on the back burner for a while. The renewed interest in the subject is probably due to the fact that the new NDA government would look at the subject afresh and implement some of the less controversial recommendations. Among the most contentious proposals of the FSLRC involve the setting up of two entities: one, a new “super-regulator”, the Unified Financial Regulatory Agency (UFRA); and two, a Financial Sector Appellate Tribunal to review regulatory decisions. The former would be solely responsible for the oversight of the securities market, insurance, pensions and commodities. In effect, it will take over the functions of the existing regulators, including SEBI and the IRDA. If this proposal is implemented, the financial sector will have just two regulators, the RBI and the proposed UFRA. In the new set-up, the RBI will have some of its existing functions, such as regulation of organised financial trading, taken away.
The RBI will have a diminished role, confined to being the monetary authority and regulator of banks. In another recommendation, the FSLRC wants a new monetary policy committee — which would be dominated by government nominees — and not the RBI Governor, to set policy interest rates. There are more instances of explicit bias towards the government as seen by the recommendation to appoint the Finance Minister as the head of the Financial Stability and Development Council. Over a year ago, the then Governor, D. Subbarao, sought to protect the RBI’s turf. It is now Raghuram Rajan’s turn to shift the spotlight to what he considers to be ill-conceived recommendations. For instance, the enhanced role being given to ill-equipped and inexperienced appellate tribunals will undermine the role of regulators and paralyse the system. Underlying Governor Rajan’s strong words is the belief that an overhaul of the financial architecture as suggested by the Srikrishna Commission will have to be preceded by more deliberations, a point of view that will be appreciated by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/needed-more-deliberation/article6134194.ece
23,6,2014,Biting the bullet,"In an indication of tougher decisions to come, the BJP-led NDA government has acted to raise resources for the Indian Railways. Railway Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda has announced a >14.2 per cent increase in passenger fares and 6.5 per cent rise in freight rates. These include a flat rate increase and a fuel adjustment component. Mr. Gowda had clearly indicated that a hefty increase was coming, and had sought to explain it away on the ground that he was only implementing a decision taken by the previous government on May 16 that had been put on hold. However savage this pre-budget increase may be, it was expected, sooner than later. The two hikes together are expected to fetch the Railways between Rs.7,000 crore and Rs.8,000 crore in a full year. It is estimated that the monthly loss to the Railways on account of passenger fares is about Rs.900 crore. As a result, the freight rates were subsidising or diverting profits to the passenger segment, and this was not sustainable. The increase was considered inevitable, but it can still be asked whether it should have come as a pre-budget announcement or could have waited for the Railway budget that will be presented to Parliament next month.
With the Indian Railways moving 20 million passengers a day, the subsidy burden was clearly hurting the system. For nearly a decade, successive Railway Ministers from alliance partners in the Congress-led UPA, found it convenient to deny the Railways any fare revision. Pawan Kumar Bansal of the Congress took charge in 2013 and effected the first increase, followed by a minor revision by Mallikarjun Kharge. Now, Mr. Gowda, and more so Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have decided to bite the bullet and mark up the fares substantially. The only concern is that the freight increase could contribute to inflationary pressures. It is a known fact that the Railways was finding it difficult to fund major infrastructure, safety, and other ongoing projects, given the financial constraints. Excessive market borrowing was creating another burden. Now that the new government wants to attract private and even foreign investment in infrastructure, including in the Railways, the financial viability of the system assumes importance. It is hoped that the Railways will now start investing in projects under implementation and in a major programme to shore up safety and security on the wheels. Given this round of fund-raising, the Railway Minister should make his first budget passenger, customer and investor friendly. The highest priority should be given to rail safety.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/biting-the-bullet/article6139254.ece
23,6,2014,Guard against hasty revision,"It is only about six months since the >new land acquisition Act came into force, but demands to dilute it have already started coming in. The State governments and industry representatives, probably perceiving the newly elected Bharatiya Janata Party government as industry-friendly, have pressed for a revision. They want easy and inexpensive land acquisition norms. Are demands for changing the compensation and consent provisions reasonable? The answer is an unambiguous no. For more than a century, various government agencies have used the archaic Land Acquisition Act 1894 to acquire property compulsorily. On many occasions, governments have even taken advantage of the ambiguous definition of ‘public purpose,’ which is critical to justify compulsory acquisition of land, and pursued contentious acquisition procedures. Since 1998, attempts have been made to change the Act, but nothing much had come of them. Even the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Rural Development had in three instances reviewed the proposals for revising the Act and consulted various stakeholders. Finally, after an inordinate delay, the previous United Progressive Alliance government repealed the Act and passed a new one in September 2013. The new law, the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, came into force in January 2014.
The new legislation is a vast improvement over the previous one. It has enhanced compensation, insisted that governments should obtain consent from at least 80 per cent of the project-affected families, streamlined procedures and mandated social impact assessment. Equally important, it seeks to ensure the compulsory rehabilitation of affected families. As a result, land acquisition has become relatively fair, and not impractical as detractors often complain. Many overlook the fact that the new Act in itself represents a dilution of some of the early proposals. For instance, the previous government first proposed to fix the compensation amount for property acquired in rural areas at six times the market value, but later reduced it to three. It has lifted the prohibition on acquiring irrigated multi-crop areas and overlooked contentious aspects of acquiring land to be given to private companies for industrial and housing development. Attempts to reduce transparency, deny stakeholder participation and impose unjust compensation cannot pass for efforts to reduce anomalies and improve the efficiency of the acquisition process. The BJP government should focus on working with the new Act which was legislated after a long delay and debate, and not amend it in haste. The government can review the legislation after it has been in force for a reasonable period, and after studying its impact carefully.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/guard-against-hasty-revision/article6139255.ece
24,6,2014,Far-reaching moves,"Given the paucity of regulatory initiatives in the recent past to revive the primary capital market, the slew of measures announced by SEBI recently would appear to be far-reaching in terms of their impact. There can be no two opinions about the desirability of these changes, which are avowedly focussed on the long-neglected retail investor. Yet, it would be premature to assert that there will be a dramatic revival of the new issues market. The record-breaking rise of the benchmark indices — the Sensex and the Nifty — have not so far revived investor interest in new issues. The causes are varied, and regulatory neglect may not be the most important reason. Investor apathy is more likely caused by the economic slowdown and falling levels of savings. Even in better times only a minuscule part of household savings was getting invested in equities. Another reason has been the disillusionment in the wake of various stock market shenanigans such as vanishing IPOs. A majority of their promoters have not been brought to book. All these reasons, however, do not obscure the fact that the primary market does need regulatory support in certain crucial aspects. In the first place, there is a long-felt need to increase the availability of quality stocks. Second, the case for building up a strong and active retail investor base cannot be overstated.
The latest SEBI moves are in that direction. The insistence on a 25 per cent public float for public sector undertakings, instead of the present norm of 10 per cent, is an important step that could have multiple benefits. There will be more PSU shares available in the market for all categories of investors. The PSU disinvestment programme will be moved along as many more well-run government undertakings offload their shares to meet the new SEBI norm, which incidentally also levels the field with private companies that already follow the 25 per cent norm. A reservation for retail investors in the Offer for Sale (OFS) route and the provision for a discount for them are welcome steps, but it should be pointed out that the OFS and the IPP (Institutional Placement Programme) were created to speed up large divestments of shares, bypassing the cumbersome procedures of retail investment. Therefore, even if many more companies can now take the OFS route, the value of this relaxation to small investors is questionable. Again, doubling the limit for anchor investors increases confidence-levels in individual issues and ought to be viewed as another step towards strengthening the primary market mechanism. SEBI is on the right track, but a genuine primary market revival may not happen in the short run. Such a revival can only ride on robust economic growth and consequent improved market sentiment.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/farreaching-moves/article6142581.ece
24,6,2014,The tragedy of Muzaffarnagar,"There are no signs, so far, of delivery of justice to the riot-affected people in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh. Nine months after they were uprooted from their homes following communal violence, thousands of people from the Muslim community are still languishing in camps. The Akhilesh Yadav government has been completely apathetic towards them. Not only that, it has shown utter disregard for their safety and any prospect for the future. Last week, the local administration issued a diktat to over 250 families living on government land in the adjoining riot-hit Shamli district, asking them to return to their native villages. Mr. Yadav has failed to realise that the situation is very volatile in the entire area, and there have been instances where the riot-affected people have been roughed up when they as much as dared to pass through the villages they once inhabited. Most of them are scared and, in the absence of any security, determined not to return to their villages. In many cases their homes have been burnt and their property has been looted. The payment of compensation for such losses has been very haphazard. Conditions in the camps border on the pathetic. Able-bodied men have lost the will to work. Many among the camp-dwellers are skilled workers. But they are so worried about the safety of their families, many refuse to even venture out to find work. Women have been forced to work in brick kilns in the area. Children who should be in school suffer from various illnesses. At least 34 of them perished due to cold during the last winter. Many of them have also been forced to work to supplement family incomes.
As the media and civil rights groups shifted their focus to the hanging of >two Dalit girls in Badaun, the riot-affected families do not know what lies ahead of them. In his vision for India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had stated that his government will have a policy of zero tolerance towards extremism and riots. He also specified that his government was committed to making all minorities equal partners in India’s progress. But, just a week before that, one of his junior Ministers, who is also an accused in the riots, in a show of triumphalism was busy taking out a victory procession through Muzaffarnagar. This is where Mr. Modi needs to walk the talk and ensure that there is no impediment to the delivery of justice to the victims. The State government may be dragging its feet, but that should not deter Mr. Modi from taking demonstrative steps to normalise the situation in the area. The immediate priority of his government must be to help the victims get back on their feet and then return to their homes. This conviction needs to flow down from Mr. Modi’s office.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-tragedy-of-muzaffarnagar/article6142583.ece
25,6,2014,"Positive step, but hurdles remain","The Narendra Modi government has moved swiftly to ratify the Additional Protocol (AP) to the India-specific nuclear safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Essentially, the government has bagged a low-hanging fruit left behind by the Manmohan Singh administration which had done all the hard work of negotiating and signing a credible document, but had fallen short of delivering the final punch. The timely ratification just ahead of a meeting of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) — the closely knit 48-member club that controls the global flows of nuclear material — offers India several advantages. By clearing the decks for the enforcement of the AP, the government has bolstered its case for NSG membership. Apart from creating openings that could be possibly used for easier access to advanced nuclear technology, a presence in the NSG, which functions on the basis of consensus, would arm India with the power to protect its core interests. This would be a substantial gain, given that non-proliferation zealotry is significant within the ranks of the NSG, notwithstanding its decision to relax the technology ban on India after the 2008 Indo-U.S. nuclear deal. Following the NSG’s step, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Canada, Argentina, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Namibia have signed bilateral civilian nuclear cooperation agreements with New Delhi.
The ratification of the AP reinforces India’s credentials as a country committed to non-proliferation, for transfer of data on India’s nuclear exports to the IAEA is a core element of the document. The ratification may also improve the atmospherics of the visit in September to the U.S. by Prime Minister Modi. India has now fulfilled a commitment that it had made in the Indo-U.S. joint statement of 2005. Despite the advantages that accrue from the ratification of the AP — which demands greater transparency in India’s civilian nuclear establishments that are under international safeguards, but is hardly an intrusive document — impediments to nuclear commerce between New Delhi and the rest of the world remain. The Nuclear Liability Bill, which puts the onus of damages on the supplier, continues to hamper normalisation of India’s nuclear trade with countries including the U.S. and France. The bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement between India and Japan, which would allow New Delhi to import nuclear know-how from Tokyo, is also not yet concluded. The Modi government therefore has significant hurdles to cross beyond the ratification of the AP, before India is accepted as a nuclear weapon power, outside the framework of the NPT, freely engaging in nuclear commerce. It is only when that happens can atomic energy expand as a growing and salient component of India’s energy security basket.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/positive-step-but-hurdles-remain/article6145812.ece
25,6,2014,Continue the conversation,"Contrary to what cynics would have us believe on the recent London summit, the global campaign to combat sexual violence in conflict could count on every single effort to keep the spotlight on this burning issue. All the more so considering the impunities that the perpetrators continued to enjoy for crimes against women and children in war zones ranging from the Congo to Somalia and Syria to Sri Lanka, until some years back. The particular vulnerability of children to physical and sexual assaults and the attendant social stigma and long-term devastation become a perpetual cycle owing to the impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators. The 1925 Geneva Conventions and the special tribunals to try crimes of genocide and breach of humanitarian law established in the 1990s are still at best well-intentioned, rather than vibrant and effective, institutional mechanisms. Even the more recent International Criminal Court (ICC) based in The Hague is beset with formidable obstacles when it comes to bringing criminals to justice. The refusal of the United States government to bring itself under the ICC’s jurisdiction means that The Hague court is deprived of the tremendous authority and clout the world’s foremost superpower could have brought to it. The initiative by Britain’s foreign secretary, William Hague, and the UN ambassador, Angelina Jolie, should be judged against this not-so-bright backdrop.
The London summit resulted in as many as 150 countries signing a protocol to end sexual violence in conflict situations, at the end of week-long deliberations. The guidelines contained therein on collection of evidence and investigation of atrocities remain critical to the protection of the integrity and dignity of individual victims. The provisions of the protocol are obviously far from being any binding legal commitments. Nevertheless, such promises provide a platform that civil society organisations may build upon to press governments to commit to concrete actions in the future. Reports have come to light during the summit that African victims of rape and violence seeking asylum in the U.K. have been subjected to harassment. Britain’s global leadership role on this issue would if anything pile positive pressure on authorities at home to put in place mechanisms that are more humane and sensitive while screening applicants. The “great moral issue of our time,” was how the plight of women victims of conflict, an issue that warrants urgent attention, was described in April in the UN Security Council by the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative on the subject. Deliberating on such defining questions of our collective humanity cannot remain optional for democratic governments.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/continue-the-conversation/article6145813.ece
26,6,2014,Sweetened package,"Sugar companies finally have something to cheer about with the government on Monday announcing a >package of measures to partially alleviate the industry’s problems. Sugar producers have been grappling with mounting losses caused by a combination of soft prices for the sweetener and rising costs of sugarcane procurement. While the low sugar prices are a result of a glut in production in the last couple of years, cane prices have been rising each crushing season on the back of higher prices mandated by State governments. There is already an estimated 8 million tonnes of surplus sugar stock in the country (against a consumption of about 23 million tonnes annually), and more will be added in the current year. Not surprising then that the previous government stepped in with an export subsidy of Rs.3,300 a tonne early this year and the new government has now extended this subsidy for the rest of the sugar season ending in September. Yet, despite the subsidy, the industry could export only one million tonnes this year, which is half of what was expected. On the other hand, cane arrears that are due to farmers are mounting, especially in States such as Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, causing problems for sugar mills. The promise of interest-free loans to sugar companies, amounting to a total of Rs.4,400 crore, may help increase cash flows for the mills and help them clear their dues to farmers ahead of the next crushing season.
The main problem for the sugar industry is the propensity of States to announce higher prices for cane procurement season after season without considering the prevailing prices of sugar. The Rangarajan Committee came up with the ideal solution of revenue-sharing between farmers and mills, and the ratio suggested by it is very fair to both parties. Yet, only some of the sugarcane growing States, such as Maharashtra, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, have implemented the recommendation from this year. Major States, such as Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, have ignored the Rangarajan formula and continued with the practice of announcing procurement prices unilaterally. The government has also announced an increase in import duty on sugar from 18 per cent to 40 per cent. Since imports are limited now, this is at best a sentiment-booster that might result in domestic prices firming up marginally. Indeed, in the last couple of days since the announcement, sugar prices have firmed up by about Rs.250 a quintal, or Rs. 2.50 a kilogram. The promise of 10 per cent ethanol blending in petrol has a long way to go yet, given that even the currently mandated 5 per cent blending is not being implemented fully. The government needs to get vehicle manufacturers and oil companies fully on board for the ethanol blending programme to take off.
Correction
>>The editorial, “Sweetened package” (June 27, 2014), erroneously said that sugar prices had firmed up by about 0.25 paise a kilogram. It should have been Rs. 2.50 a kilogram.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sweetened-package/article6148773.ece
26,6,2014,Suspicious derailment,"There have been two derailments in Bihar overnight, not connected to each other, but raising serious questions on their causes. At least four passengers were killed when the >Delhi-Dibrugarh Rajdhani Express derailed near Chapra in the early hours of Wednesday. And not very far from there, 18 bogies of a goods train derailed at Motihari. What is worse, three live bombs were discovered at a place about 20 km from Chapra. While the Railway administration seems convinced that the derailment of the Rajdhani was possibly on account of sabotage, the local administration, including the Bihar police, insists that prima facie there was no sabotage. Pictures of the derailment paint a serious picture of the accident, and considering it happened around 2.15 a.m., and eyewitness accounts that the driver did apply the brakes suddenly, an element of suspicion does creep in: was the track cut, or did the track give in because of the derailment? The first issue that needs to be sorted out in the probe by the Commissioner of Railway Safety is whether or not this derailment was a case of sabotage. The Railway authorities, whose view even the Minister, D.V. Sadananda Gowda, echoed, was that given the bandh called by the Maoists, and looking at the condition of the rails, sabotage cannot be ruled out. In the other incident, the goods train went off the tracks, possibly because of sabotage.
The Railways may find it convenient to blame the Maoists for the mishap to avoid taking any responsibility for the accident. And the local administration for its part would like to protect itself from any blame on the law and order front. However efficient the rescue and relief operations of the Indian Railways may be, focus on prevention of accidents assumes greater significance. Especially in the case of a high-speed Rajdhani Express, the inquiry must find out about the maintenance and inspection of tracks on the route, more so because of the bandh call. With the goods train derailment being not far from this site, and unexploded bombs having been discovered at another place, the picture that emerges is a disturbing one. Even if the Railway Minister has partially rolled back his fare increase to favour the suburban commuters, the recent hefty hike in fares and freight tariff definitely raises expectations among rail users about a clear direction in the first Railway budget of this government — a focus on safety, security, and passenger amenities. A sense of security and confidence needs to be instilled in rail users. The General Budget and the Railway Budget need to allocate substantial resources to improve safety on the rails and for the replacement of worn-out coaches and tracks. Consolidation and modernisation should take precedence over expansion.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/suspicious-derailment/article6148772.ece
27,6,2014,Stirring up a judicial storm,"Gopal Subramanium might have sought to give a quietus to the controversy surrounding the NDA Government’s opposition to his nomination as a judge of the Supreme Court by withdrawing his consent, but the episode has raised troubling questions over the roles of the executive and the judiciary in judicial appointments, and the process of their interaction. In his statement, Mr. Subramanium has suggested that the reason for his exclusion from a list of four names recommended for appointment by the collegium headed by the Chief Justice of India was that he was considered too independent to toe the government’s line. He has also faulted the judiciary for failing to stand up for him. It is understandable that he should feel let down after being invited by the collegium to be a judge of the Supreme Court, in a rare instance of a member of the Bar being sought to be directly elevated to the Bench of the highest court. However, his claim that the splitting of the list by sending three of the four names to the President for appointment compromised the appointment process is debatable. Sending a recommendation back to the collegium is part of the consultative process and there is no reason why the appointment of those about whom no issues had been raised should be held up, particularly if seniority within the list would not be affected. More serious is his allegation that his independent role as amicus curiae in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case may have been the real reason behind the Narendra Modi government’s rejection of his candidacy.
The government’s silence has not helped its case, as the nature of its reservations about Mr. Subramanium remains unknown. Now that the matter is in the public domain, it may have to clarify whether it had communicated to the collegium why it considered him unsuitable. The collegium had the option of reiterating its recommendation, a move that will be binding on the executive, but Mr. Subramanium has chosen not to wait for its decision. By voicing his “sense of unease over the judiciary failing to assert its independence,” he is actually charging the collegium with meekly acquiescing in the rejection of its own recommendation. It implies that even a valid recommendation could be circumvented by unverifiable intelligence reports and unproven allegations in an opaque process. It also raises the question whether the present legal position that accords primacy to the Chief Justice’s opinion has goaded the executive to find other means of having its way. The present opaque procedure needs to be replaced by an appointments process that is genuinely consultative and transparent, so that the best legal brains are attracted to the bench.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/stirring-up-a-judicial-storm/article6152401.ece
27,6,2014,A repressive regime,"Supporters of human rights and fundamental freedoms have expressed solidarity with Mohammed Adel Fahmy, Baher Mohammed and Peter Greste. All three are journalists working with Al Jazeera television channel, and were > jailed last December by the Egyptian authorities on charges of siding with the Muslim Brotherhood — soon after it was designated a terrorist group — and of reporting ‘false news’. The team was covering the events in Egypt after the army’s removal of Mohammed Morsi as President. On June 15, a court in Cairo sentenced Mr. Greste, an Australian national formerly with the BBC, and Mr. Fahmy, the channel’s Cairo bureau chief who was formerly with CNN, to seven years’ imprisonment; Mr. Baher Mohammed got an additional three years for being in possession of “ammunition” — he had on him a spent bullet casing. Three other journalists were given 10-year sentences in absentia. Another journalist from Al Jazeera Arabic, Abdullah Elshamy, who had been jailed in August 2013, and was on a hunger strike for over three months, was removed to an undisclosed location in May after a medical examination. The evidence produced by the prosecution against the journalists included footage of interviews done by the channel with Egyptian politicians across the spectrum, hardly corroborating the charge of their bias toward the Muslim Brotherhood; more remarkably, it included irrelevant footage from other channels. Lawyers defending the journalists had no access to the entire collection of video clips, some of which the prosecution showed to the judge alone.
The court’s verdict is an egregious blow against media freedom, and clearly a move to intimidate journalists covering the turmoil in Egypt. Days before the May 26-28 election which he won, President Abdel Fatah el Sisi, the country’s former army chief, said stability was more important than freedom, arguing that the protests that had engulfed the country since the toppling of Hosni Mubarak had badly affected the economy. Tellingly, he said Egypt needed another “20 to 25 years to achieve true democracy.” As appeals for the release of the journalists continue to pour in from across the world, President el Sisi has said he will not interfere with the judicial process, while maintaining that the journalists have been given a fair trial. The United States has called for the “chilling draconian sentences” to be reversed, but with Secretary of State John Kerry praising the Egyptian strongman, and promising to keep military aid flowing just a day before the verdict, it is doubtful if the U.S. is serious in the defence of democracy. All those committed to basic freedoms need to ensure that the pressure on Egypt is kept up. Jailing even one journalist on trumped up charges is an attack on media freedom everywhere.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-repressive-regime/article6152402.ece
28,6,2014,A World Cup with soul,"The FIFA World Cup has long had the ability to hold nearly everyone in thrall — a month of collective amnesia during which everything else seems diminished. But even by those addictive standards, the current edition has been particularly transfixing. This has been a World Cup committed to attacking. The group stages saw an average of 2.8 goals per game; the corresponding figure for the previous edition was 2.3. But it is not merely the number of goals. The tournament has had soul — players from the participating nations have spoken of their reverence for Brazil, a country whose very being is football, and many of the passages of play have appeared inspired by this. The tournament has also had a wealth of storylines. Spain’s poignant exit marked the end of an era, its style of possession football undone by intense pressing and ruthless counter-attacking. Four-time champion Italy has traditionally found a way of advancing, but its run ended against Uruguay. Luis Suarez’s actions might not have materially affected the result, but it was the lowest point of a contest that had turned condemnably dark. England, the third former champion in the group, reprised an old theme: arrive to great fanfare, depart with no one surprised. So Costa Rica topped the Group of Death, its vibrant, tactically organised football catching the eye.
Costa Rica’s progress seemed to confirm the collective wisdom that teams from the region, accustomed to the climate, will prosper. Three of the four sides from Central and North America made the cut, earning on average 1.5 points per match. The statistics for South America are more dramatic. Five of six qualified, with a vastly impressive average of 2.28 points per game. No team from Europe has won a World Cup in South America; only six of 13 made it past the first hurdle this time, with an average of 1.56 points per match. It must be added, however, that of the European teams, Bosnia-Herzegovina will feel hard done-by. Inept refereeing contributed directly to its exit — Ivory Coast suffered similarly. The standard of officiating has to improve; it must not mar the business end, which promises so much. Brazil, Argentina, and Chile appear the front-runners from South America. Neymar and Lionel Messi have proven equal to shouldering their nations’ hopes while Chile’s fast transitions make it a team no one fancies facing. Colombia merits close watching, and in James Rodriguez, has a player who can create something from nothing. The Netherlands (so impressive in its demolition of Spain), France, and Germany lead the European charge. Belgium is the dark horse. Picking a winner though is best left to others — football often makes fools of the very intelligent, and occasionally, millionaires of the very foolish.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-world-cup-with-soul/article6155879.ece
28,6,2014,Many challenges to stability,"The ninth edition of the Reserve Bank of India’s >Financial Stability Report (FSR), a bi-annual publication, reflects the collective assessment of an expert sub-committee on risks to financial stability. The periodic publication of such reports by the RBI is in line with best practices around the world for major central banks. As in the case of previous editions, the recent FSR aims to promote awareness about vulnerabilities in the financial system. Other important objectives are to examine the resilience of the financial institutions and to encourage a debate on the development and regulation of the financial sector. Most of these objectives are also currently being examined at the highest levels of the government and the RBI, in many cases with the help of expert groups. For instance, bank governance, which has a substantial bearing on financial sector stability, has been dealt with extensively by the P.J. Nayak Committee whose report is now being discussed at several levels. The deteriorating asset quality of public sector banks (PSBs) can affect financial sector stability. Although issues of recapitalising them and their ownership are within the domain of government policy, the FSR points out that there is a case to review the governance structures of PSBs with a greater emphasis on market discipline.
On the positive side, the FSR notes that by many yardsticks the level of capital with commercial banks remains well above the regulatory minimum even under adverse macroeconomic conditions. The post-election scenario marked by political stability has improved the economic outlook. The government is in a better position to resolve supply-side issues and help the RBI in its battle against inflation. The capital markets reflect the expectations on policy measures to address the adverse growth-inflation dynamics and saving-investment balance as also efficient implementation of policies and programmes. At the global level, the financial markets are showing signs of improved stability although economic growth has not picked up uniformly everywhere. Easy monetary conditions prevail in many jurisdictions. Their potential unwinding can pose a threat to financial stability in many emerging markets. Perhaps for the first time a stability report has called for a vigil over “shadow banking entities”, which are inaccurately perceived as being regulated by the RBI. There is an urgent need to eliminate ambiguities relating to these entities. The FSR calls for better monitoring of the lending operations of insurance companies and the money-spinning treasury operations of large corporations. The issues flagged by the FSR will have to be addressed in the budget and the RBI’s credit policies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/many-challenges-to-stability/article6155880.ece
30,6,2014,A tragic conflagration,"The tragic conflagration caused by a leaking natural gas pipeline in East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh represents a new type of peril before India. Leaping flames from a pipeline passing through a village conveying gas from a field operated by the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation to a private-sector power plant swept through huts, houses and trees, leaving a trail of death and destruction in a radius of more than 500 metres. It was the deadliest accident in India’s energy sector since August 2013, >when 28 people were killed in a fire at Hindustan Petroleum Corporation’s refinery at Visakhapatnam in the same State. This is the first incident of such a scale for the 30-year-old GAIL, a Maharatna company and by far India’s largest pipeline operator. It currently has a network of pipelines running to a length of 8,000 km, a figure that is set to rise to 14,000 km. Every inch of pipeline carrying the highly flammable material poses risks; habitations coming up, sometimes unauthorisedly, along pipeline routes are also a matter of concern.
India’s natural gas scenario is undergoing rapid changes and gas, considered a “new age” fuel and the cleanest among fossil fuels, is poised to occupy a significant share in the diversified energy mix. The problem lies in safely transporting the resource through pipelines. Pipeline systems for oil have a long history in India, while those for gas are relatively new. The mechanisms tend to age and deteriorate. The situation calls for a comprehensive, ongoing system of checks and oversight along routes operated by all the players in the field, and round-the-clock monitoring employing advanced technology in quick-response mode. Since GAIL has confirmed that villagers in the area had the previous evening complained of the smell of gas, negligence and failure to respond to danger signals were clearly involved. The government should quickly follow up on the pending proposal for a statutory safety regulator for the oil and gas sector. India needs to expand its gas grids. Unless safety concerns among the public over transporting gas and the operations of power plants are addressed with a sense of urgency, the Union government’s efforts to accelerate major energy and infrastructure projects may face delays. For instance, opposition by the Tamil Nadu government has stalled a key section of GAIL’s ambitious Kochi-Bangalore-Mangalore pipeline project. Tamil Nadu, through which a section of the pipeline was to pass, says it would affect the livelihood of about 5,500 small farmers and wants the line laid along highways, and not farmlands. There may well be lessons to be drawn from the latest accident while seeking to resolve this issue.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-tragic-conflagration/article6160467.ece
30,6,2014,An eventful year on Mars,"On June 24, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Mars rover, Curiosity, which soft-landed on the floor of the Gale Crater on a never-before-used contraption called sky crane, successfully completed one Martian year — 687 Earth days. The rover, a car-sized mini- laboratory on six wheels, has so far travelled nearly 8 km since touchdown. What makes the completion of one Martian year all the more significant is the rover’s ability to not only survive the harsh environment of the red planet but also fulfil its primary objective — providing much sought after information on whether past environmental conditions there were favourable for microbial life. The most important parameter that can prove that such a condition existed, is the presence of liquid water at some point in the planet’s history. The rover returned abundant and invaluable information that unequivocally confirmed that Mars once had liquid water that was suitable for drinking. Though there are micro-organisms on Earth that thrive in highly acidic and alkaline conditions, such water bodies, in general, are very unsuitable and challenging for microbial existence.
The bonanza was indeed the detection of well-rounded pebbles in the rock layers on a dry river bed. Sharp-edged stones can become well-rounded only when transported over a long distance and above a particular speed by surface running water. On Earth, rounded pebbles are seen only in the lower reaches of a river. Also, the deposition of alternate layers of pebbles aligned at a particular angle is strongly suggestive of a paleoriver. The presence of clay minerals inside a drilled rock suggests that water was present for extended periods of time. The detection of mineral orthoclase, abundantly seen in Earth’s crust but never before detected on Mars, in the Windjana sandstone sample is yet another surprise find. The biggest question now is whether Curiosity can reconfirm on the ground the latest find of glacial, periglacial and fluvial (including glacio-fluvial) activity within the Gale Crater some 3,500 million years ago. The potential evidence of paleoglaciers was gathered by cameras on board NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the European Space Agency’s Mars Express. Despite the presence of liquid water, the lack of atmospheric methane greatly reduces the possibility of any extant or extinct microbial life on Mars. Several other unique features detected by Curiosity confirm that our understanding of the red planet is very limited. There is hence every possibility that India’s Mars Orbiter Mission, which will be inserted into the Martian Orbit on September 24 this year, may unearth some unknown facets of the red planet.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-eventful-year-on-mars/article6160466.ece
1,7,2014,Eastern outreach,"The visit by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to Bangladesh saw the National Democratic Alliance government start off on a positive note with India’s important eastern neighbour. New Delhi relaxed some visa rules for Bangladeshi nationals; the frequency of the cross-border train is to be increased; there is to be a new bus service that will connect Guwahati and Shillong with Dhaka. India has also committed to sharing 100 MW of power from the Palatana power project in Tripura. It is encouraging that after an election campaign that bristled with negative references to Bangladesh, the new government has chosen to follow in the footsteps of its predecessor in reaching out to Dhaka, even though the Manmohan Singh government could not complete its own bilateral initiatives. Signalling broad continuity in ties, Ms. Swaraj has promised that her government would make efforts to take those initiatives to their conclusion, even though, disappointingly for Bangladesh, she gave no time-frame. With its majority in Parliament, the BJP needs only to convince itself that the Land Border agreement is beneficial to both sides. On the Teesta river water-sharing agreement, the Modi government will need to convince Mamata Banerjee, but it will take more than the phone call that the External Affairs Minister made to the West Bengal Chief Minister. The clear message from the trip is that the new government, as the previous one, places great importance on Dhaka-New Delhi relations. Ms. Swaraj even acknowledged the UPA government’s contributions by saying that “a great deal has been accomplished in the... relationship in the last few years,” including progress in the “areas of security, economic development, sub-regional cooperation, opening of the Indian market to Bangladeshi goods, border infrastructure, energy and people-to-people exchanges.” Dhaka’s cooperation will be critical to India’s Look East policy.
Bangladesh will watch to see if the continuity with UPA extends to another trait: playing favourites with Bangladesh’s political parties. India’s main engagement has to be with the government of Bangladesh. But as Ms. Swaraj said in an interview, the effort must also be “to establish an inclusive partnership with Bangladesh, and we want to do it by taking every section of [Bangladeshi] society into confidence.” The country has yet to emerge from a phase of great internal turmoil. Ms. Swaraj wisely refrained from making any comments on the January elections, the credibility of which has been widely questioned. Her meeting with Bangladesh National Party leader Khaleda Zia, although she is no longer Leader of the Opposition, was a well-advised move, signalling that New Delhi still considers it a significant political party.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/eastern-outreach/article6163914.ece
1,7,2014,Messy turnaround,"When push came to shove, even the Congress did not back Delhi University’s controversial Four Year Undergraduate Programme (FYUP), and the varsity’s administration was left to defend on its own a decision that was, clearly, taken for it by the United Progressive Alliance Government a little over a year ago. Successive Human Resource Development Ministers from the Congress had batted for FYUP, and the University administration — with probably some conviction about its merits and the full backing of the University Grants Commission (UGC) — rammed it down on a university system ill-prepared to deal with such a major change in course structure. What took The University of Hong Kong with an undergraduate student strength of 15,000 seven years to do, Delhi University did in a few months for an annual intake of over 50,000 students at the undergraduate level. Acting as the hand-maiden of the government of the day, the UGC looked the other way as the University rushed through the switch from the decades-old three-year programme. A year later, the UGC again donned the hand-maiden-of-the-government role when a new political dispensation wanted FYUP out. So it is not just the University that has egg on its face. The UGC also has a lot to answer for, given how it arm-twisted the University to roll back FYUP for falling foul of the law. If FYUP was illegal, why the UGC released funds for it last year is a question that begs an answer.
The flip-flop over FYUP has raised questions about university autonomy, but had Delhi University gone through the necessary procedures mandated in the Delhi University Act, 1922, the government would not have been able to bulldoze it so easily. The government’s bid to scrap FYUP gained traction only when it became evident that the University had not secured the Visitor’s nod for the change. And when it went for the jugular with the UGC acting as a tool, the University administration found itself isolated as it had over the past year failed to consult all the stakeholders, address their concerns or even consider their suggestion to defer FYUP by a year. While some bitter critics of FYUP concede merits in the pro-change argument, that the University needs to make its students more employable with courses that are in line with international standards, their contention is that this cannot be done overnight without putting in place the necessary infrastructure, having enough teachers and preparing proper course content. There was a general consensus that the foundation course syllabus was sub-standard and school-level. If anything, the controversy offers a lesson to the current government which is working to the mantra of “speed” along with skill and scale. Fast-tracking decisions without taking on board multiple factors can only set the clock back.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/messy-turnaround/article6163916.ece
7,7,2014,Welcome homecoming,"The >safe return of 46 Indian nurses from Iraq is the result of astute diplomacy and a calibrated exercise of soft power by multiple agencies of government. While External Affairs Minister >Sushma Swaraj engaged her counterparts at the political level in West Asia, including Foreign Ministers of the six oil-rich monarchies of the Gulf Cooperation Council, sound tactical leadership seemed to have been provided by Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. Moments of diplomatic imagination during the crisis were discernible when, for instance, South Block decided to widen the scope of the >diplomatic engagement. Thus, the outreach to Jordan, Turkey and Syria — countries with rich experience in extricating hostages from jihadi captivity — would have provided valuable insights into the rapidly mutating structure and operational mechanics of jihadi groups, which are enlarging their footprint across regions where Indian blue- and white-collar workers live and work. An unfinished power struggle between ex-Baathists loyal to former President Saddam Hussein who seem to have forged a tactical alliance with the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), provided sufficient headroom for diplomatic manoeuvring. Apparently, Indian officials on the ground managed to activate their decades-old links with former Baathists, who played a significant role in ensuring the return of the health-sector workers.
The episode demonstrates the enormous value of making long-term investments in soft power, which has included since the Nehruvian era invitations to promising students and personnel from the Global South to Indian universities and professional institutions. Consequently, people-to-people diplomacy has provided nodes of influence, which have yielded dramatic results during moments of crisis. India has demonstrated during the 2004 Asian tsunami and subsequently during mass evacuations from Beirut in the aftermath of the 2006 war between Israel and Hizbollah, its capacity to deploy warships and aircraft to evacuate Indians in distress, as well as people of other South Asian nationalities. But crisis-forecasting and tighter standard operating procedures may now need to be evolved, including pre-positioning and deployment abroad of civil and military assets for mass evacuations whenever warranted, especially in the Persian Gulf countries where millions of Indians reside. The irreversible trend of globalisation is bound to push more and more Indians abroad, where they could come in harm’s way. However, the risks can be minimised with improvement of domestic working conditions, which would then discourage people from migrating out of economic compulsions to dangerous conflict zones, far away from Indian shores.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/welcome-homecoming/article6183224.ece
7,7,2014,Shadowboxing in India-U.S. ties,"Something always seems to come in the way of India and the United States finding the groove in their relationship. Attempts by the two sides to inject some enthusiasm into bilateral ties despite the spat over the diplomat Devyani Khobragade and the U.S.’s past coldness toward Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue of the Gujarat riots, seem jinxed. The revelation that the U.S. National Security Agency had sought and received official permission to put the >Bharatiya Janata Party under surveillance in 2010 is the latest hiccup. It overshadowed the visit by Republican Senator John McCain, chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. The disclosures were part of the latest cache of data released by whistle-blower Edward Snowden through The Washington Post. From what is available in the public domain so far, it is not clear what methods of surveillance were used, and which particular individuals in the party were being targeted. That this was four years before the BJP became the ruling party makes it curiouser. There is, however, nothing particularly surprising in the disclosure. Virtually every country spies on every other, and in the process spares no one of any importance. Espionage is among the oldest professions. Only, the methods have become more advanced and a country’s resources determine how advanced its technologies are. It is just that the U.S. gets outed more frequently than any other. Describing the surveillance as “unacceptable”, India summoned senior U.S. diplomats, apparently to tick them off. But New Delhi cannot in all honesty say that it does not spy on political parties in other countries, or even within. So the protest should not be mistaken for a moral stand that there should be no espionage.
What the revelations have done is to create further negativity about the U.S. in the Indian mind, thus making it politically difficult for the two governments to put the past behind them quickly. As it is, a >cloud hangs over bilateral relations over the Khobragade episode. Though the Obama administration has made it clear that the Prime Minister would receive a red-carpet welcome in Washington in September, the cancellation of a visa to Mr. Modi when he was Chief Minister has not been forgotten. From all the outreach to India’s South Asian neighbours, and to China, Russia, France and Singapore, New Delhi also seems to be sending out the message that its foreign policy priorities are different from its predecessor’s. Assistant Secretary of State Nisha Biswal’s visit to make contact with the new government was upstaged by the high-profile arrival of the Chinese Foreign Minister. But good U.S.-India ties are in the “enlightened national interest” of both sides. A way must be found to break the ice before the September Washington summit.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/shadowboxing-in-indiaus-ties/article6183225.ece
8,7,2014,A very special Wimbledon,"Truly memorable tennis tournaments produce more than quality matches; they also throw up hints about the future of the game. Wimbledon 2014 did both. The >extraordinary men’s final between Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer was indeed a classic, a contest in which power was matched by refinement. It was also a match where effort demanded not just perspiration, but a range of attributes from clever innovation to sheer audacity. But history will also remember this year’s event as the crucible in which an exciting new breed of players grew to display their potential and true promise. These are young men and women who are readying to occupy the top echelons of the game as the power structure shifts, as it must, to a new generation. Among them are >Grigor Dimitrov, Eugenie Bouchard, Milos Raonic and >Nick Kyrgios — names that are likely to become more familiar to tennis-lovers in the days to come. But the men’s final first, because the ethereal must be placed above the worldly. Yes, it had its moments of psychodrama — the twists and turns that can transform a tennis match into suspenseful theatre. But its real worth lay in the near flawless quality of play — reflected most of all in a sparkling array of groundstrokes in which each player constantly challenged the other to surpass himself. Djokovic, who served better and came good at some critical moments, who was the deserved winner — but only just. As for hearts, it was Federer, who was looking for his 18th Grand Slam — which would have made him the oldest Wimbledon champion in the open era of tennis — who stole them before a packed and fawning house on Centre Court.
With the Djokovic-Federer final and the women’s trophy going to former Wimbledon champion >Petra Kvitová, tennis remained in familiar hands. But there were intimations of change, most forcefully expressed in the games of two bright young talents — Dimitrov and Bouchard. The former, who has an uncharacteristic resemblance to Federer in playing style, has the all-round game to beat anyone on his day — almost took Djokovic out in his semi-final, failing only to press home the advantage at a couple of critical moments. As for Bouchard, she may have been crushed by a rampaging Kvitová in the women’s final, but her journey in the tournament provided a glimpse into the changing face of women’s tennis. In an age where the Williams sisters and Maria Sharapova seem to be slowly fading, the place at the top is ready for challenges from a clutch of players such as Bouchard, Simona Halep and Sabine Lisicki. In short, as Wimbledon 2014 ended with one fantastic match, it also opened up a host of intriguing possibilities for the future of the game itself.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-very-special-wimbledon/article6186889.ece
8,7,2014,Weak foundations,"Buildings in cities are collapsing with depressing regularity, and precious lives are being lost. Two recent tragic incidents have yet again raised the issues of safety and accountability in building construction. On June 28, on the outskirts of Chennai, an >11-storey building under construction collapsed, and some 61 people died. In Delhi, a f >our-storied building crumbled and 10 persons including five children lost their lives. In the Chennai incident, the promoter of the apartment project blamed a lightning strike for the tragedy, but State agencies, builders’ organisations and architect groups pointed to poor design, non-compliance with rules and negligence as the reasons. The police arrested six persons including the developer, the architect and the engineer. The Tamil Nadu government has appointed a >one-man commission headed by a retired High Court Judge to investigate the incident and suggest measures to prevent such calamities in future. In the case of the Delhi incident, survivors had complained that construction work nearby had weakened the foundation. The Municipal Corporation, the reports indicate, ignored their protests. In a delayed reaction, the Corporation has suspended the engineers in charge until enquiries are completed. Every time such accidents occur, the state rushes forth to form committees and enacts new rules, only to ignore them later. Nothing has improved the situation on the ground, and the lessons have hardly been learnt.
The issue is not that of insufficient regulatory systems or safety standards, but that of non-compliance. For instance, in Chennai, building approval procedures for multi-storied buildings clearly mandate that the regulatory authorities verify soil analysis reports, structural drawings, stability certificates and design drawings before issuing approvals. Had the officials diligently scrutinised the drawings and the data, they could have detected the inadequacies, if any, even before construction commenced. Periodic inspection of buildings would have helped spot deviations and other problems at the construction stage. In Delhi, had the Corporation acted on residents’ complaints and taken prompt action, lives would have been saved. The need of the hour is to review and rigorously implement the existing rules. Frequent regularisation of unauthorised constructions have emboldened violators and eroded the compliance culture. Lack of transparency in approval processes, discretionary exemptions, and slack inspections have put the interests of many apartment-buyers in peril. Construction workers often bear the worst of the effects, and lose lives and limbs. Safety measures at construction sites and compliance with design standards are not matters that are up for negotiation. We need a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to unsafe building practices.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/weak-foundations/article6186890.ece
9,7,2014,"Full of ideas, short on substance","Having effected increases amounting to 14.2 per cent in passenger fares and 6.5 per cent in freight tariff last month, Railway Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda had very little to do in his >maiden budget. His presentation was full of ideas and policy formulations, but lacked concrete proposals or a vision or road map to take the Indian Railways forward. What became clear even before the budget presentation was that the Railways was in poor financial health, and a course correction was imperative as the operating ratio was precarious. In short, the Railways had to spend 94 paise for every rupee earned, leaving a surplus of just six paise. The system cannot afford the huge doses of investment required to complete ongoing projects, leave alone initiating new ones. Mr. Gowda says the Railways needs Rs.5 lakh crore over the next 10 years to complete just the ongoing projects. As outlined in the President’s address to Parliament, the Diamond Quadrilateral Network of High Speed Rail system connecting major metros and growth centres was announced, but with a mere Rs.100 crore earmarked for initiating the project. He also unveiled the longer-term plan to introduce bullet trains, with the Mumbai-Ahmedabad route taking the lead. While the bullet trains will require completely new infrastructure, the high-speed train can make do with upgrading the existing network to allow speeds between 160 and 200 kmph.
The budget focusses clearly on passenger amenities, cleanliness, >safety and security. The upgradation of the computerised reservation system should be a welcome step to cope with the increasing load on the online booking facility. Similarly, pilot projects to provide Wi-Fi at stations and on select trains, at a cost, may be useful to the business traveller. Continuing with the populist trend of announcing new trains, Mr. Gowda has offered five Jansadharan, five premium, six air-conditioned, 27 express and eight passenger trains of different frequencies. The annual plan outlay has been kept at a reasonable Rs.47,650 crore, but the welcome development is limiting market borrowings to Rs.11,790 crore. The freight traffic target for the current year has been set at 1,101 million tonnes. The budget was expected to signal the road to reforms and the opening up of the Railways to private investment. With hardly any progress till now on this front, the Minister has decided to seek Cabinet approval for >Foreign Direct Investment in the Railways. An open invitation to the corporate sector to invest in PPP projects will not by itself go very far without concrete proposals for land utilisation, or the development of major stations on the lines of airport terminals. The markets, which expected some major policy announcements, were obviously disappointed, and went south even as Mr. Gowda finished his budget speech.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/full-of-ideas-short-on-substance/article6190483.ece
9,7,2014,End to illegal fatwas,"Personal laws ought to be administered by the regular law courts and cannot be enforced in derogation of fundamental rights by religious courts that lack legal sanctity. This is the broad import of the >Supreme Court’s thoughtful ruling on the legality of Dar-ul-Qazas, or Sharia-based courts, established in different parts of the country to adjudicate disputes among Muslims. Fatwas issued by Sharia courts are not legally binding on individuals averse to submitting to their authority, the Court has ruled. However, it has declined to ban these adjudicatory bodies, holding that Muslims desirous of obtaining the expert opinion of Islamic scholars in Dar-ul-Qazas can continue to invoke their jurisdiction voluntarily. The ruling has thus clarified the correct status of these Sharia courts. They can exist and issue opinions, but are limited in their scope and applicability to individuals who approach them voluntarily, and not at the instance of third parties to a dispute. These rules will hopefully protect individual Muslims, especially women, from possible persecution through controversial adverse orders, often issued without regard to their fundamental rights. Fatwas on religious issues are acceptable, but no fatwa that violates fundamental rights may be issued; they may not be issued at the instance of third parties on issues that concern individuals, and more importantly, they must not be issued to punish the innocent.
The Supreme Court has preserved the religious character of these Sharia courts, noting that they do not constitute a parallel judiciary, but an “informal justice delivery system with the objective of bringing about amicable settlement between parties.” It is important that the Supreme Court’s intervention, at the instance of a petitioner who wanted Sharia courts to be banned, is understood in the correct perspective. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), which has set up most of these Dar-ul-Qazas, has a duty to regulate their functioning and restrain them from issuing edicts that violate fundamental rights. It is true that in the Imrana case, one of the three instances the Supreme Court has referred to, the controversial fatwa dissolving a marriage and ordering a woman to leave her husband after she was raped by her father-in-law was not issued by a Sharia court but by a Muslim panchayat. However, an Islamic seminary endorsed the fatwa initially, and the AIMPLB claimed that the incident of rape did not occur at all. In some parts of the country, Muslim women have formed women’s Sharia courts for themselves, contending that orders of Sharia courts are invariably adverse to women. It is up to bodies like the AIMPLB to reform the functioning of the Sharia bodies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/end-to-illegal-fatwas/article11258518.ece1
10,7,2014,Key issues identified,"The >Economic Survey 2013-14, the flagship annual document of the Ministry of Finance which reviews the performance of the economy over the previous 12 months, released a day before the Union Budget, facilitates a better appreciation of the mobilisation of resources and their allocation in the Budget. Experience suggests that the Survey, while flagging the key economic issues of the day, can offer advice and suggestions, which the Finance Minister may or may not incorporate in the Budget. The point has also been made that it is for the first time that the Survey has been prepared without the guidance of a Chief Economic Adviser. For all its limitations, however, the Economic Survey 2013-14 has done a commendable job in delineating the contours of an economy that has been struggling for more than two years to grow at more than 5 per cent. A change in government has certainly brought about a sharp variation in sentiment, but it is too early to assess the impact on the real economy. Joining the Reserve Bank of India and many professional forecasters, the Survey expects GDP growth during the current year (2014-15) to be above 5 per cent. However, poor monsoons, a deteriorating external environment, persistent inflation and a poor investment climate pose major risks to growth and macroeconomic stability. In the event, GDP growth is likely to be at the lower end of a 5.4 to 5.9 per cent band.
Economic growth during 2013-14 was dragged down by industry, which grew at just 0.4 per cent. A deceleration in manufacturing output and contraction in mining activities have been primarily responsible for the sluggishness. Reversing the serious downward trend in industry has been a top priority for the government. The budget is sure to take note of ongoing initiatives and also bring in new ones in this vital area. Inflation has come down but is still above the RBI’s comfort zone. Food prices have shot up very recently. The balance of payments position has improved considerably on top of a vastly improved current account. However, much of the improvement in the matter of the trade deficit is due to lower imports of non-petroleum products, a sure sign of the slowdown. A bigger challenge lies in the area of fiscal consolidation. The Survey has suggested a new FRBM legislation as well as rationalisation of subsidies, among other measures. The previous UPA government’s claims of pegging the deficit at 4.5 per cent in 2013-14 and targeting an ambitious 4.1 per cent for the current year have become controversial, and at the very least cast doubts on the quality of fiscal estimates. These are pitfalls which the new Finance Minister will do well to avoid.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/key-issues-identified/article6193907.ece
10,7,2014,Go for it now,"The target year of 2015 that was fixed to achieve universal primary education will not be met, the United Nations said at the recently held second Global Partnership for Education Replenishment Pledging Conference in Brussels. An estimated 58 million children, a large proportion of them from sub-Saharan Africa, are still out of school. The announcement merely confirms Unesco’s own admission last year on the odds ahead in the task of realising this Millennium Development Goal. That admission was based on its finding that the top six donors had substantially cut back on their aid commitments since 2011. Two of the donor countries slashed their allocations in this sector by 30 per cent; reductions made by the European Union were to a similar extent. Unesco observed that the momentum with respect to achieving this target was lost since 2007, implying that as in the case of several other basic human development indicators, the global economic meltdown may have contributed to the situation. But the movement to improve rates of retention in schools and to enhance quality of teaching seems to be gathering steam again, as most of the donor states promised at the Brussels conference to step up spending. But more significant, as many as 60 developing countries that were present in Brussels — India was not among them — agreed to boost allocations in their domestic budgets for primary education.
Abolition of tuition fees, cash transfers, teaching in the local language, increased financial outlays and appropriate curriculum are among measures that have helped developing countries reduce the out-of-school population among children, according to the Education For All report. Clearly, then, there are diverse ways and means to realise the goal of universal education. Governments found wanting in the requisite will to invest in the future of their youngsters may be complicit in allowing children to be weaned away by armed militias that have already wreaked much economic havoc and caused political instability in many regions. A welcome new dimension to the Replenishment Pledging Conference is the focus on the needs of disabled children. Addressing this segment is both a moral and practical imperative, considering that 15 per cent of the world’s population has some form of disability, as per figures from a 2011 report on disability brought out jointly by the World Health Organization and the World Bank. Around the world, about a third of those that are not in school have a disability, says the Global Campaign for Education UK. Given such a large proportion of such children, the relevant goal cannot be accomplished without special provision being made to achieve it. Thus, there is a case to set separate targets factoring in disability in the post-2015 development agenda.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Go-for-it-now/article11259772.ece
11,7,2014,More continuity than change,"Over the years, the Indian budget has ceased to be a mere statement of accounts and has also laid down the broad contours of economic policies to be followed. The NDA government assumed office less than two months before the >presentation of the budget with a promise to overhaul the economy. No doubt, the expectations from the Finance Minister have been unrealistically high. Not just the stock markets but practically everyone had been expecting him to deliver on the election promises of a paradigm shift to boost the economy. Arun Jaitley has done well to emphasise that the measures announced in the budget are only “the beginning of a journey towards a sustained growth of 7-8 per cent or above within the next 3-4 years along with macroeconomic stabilisation that includes lower levels of inflation, lesser fiscal deficit and a manageable current account deficit.” Those words, along with some robust but realistic budget targets and a wide range of allocations to diverse sectors, helped stabilise the markets and earned the Finance Minister appreciation for his maiden effort. Among the noteworthy measures are the move towards a friendlier and more stable tax regime, encouragement to FDI in critical sectors, the focus on infrastructure including power and roads, and the emphasis on removing obstacles to mining.
The challenge before the NDA government was to persist with fiscal consolidation while simultaneously creating more space for desperately needed public investment. The UPA government’s interim budget had set an overly ambitious >fiscal deficit target of 4.1 per cent for the current year. While acknowledging that it would be a daunting task in the backdrop of two years of low GDP growth and the subsidy burden among other factors, the government has retained the target. The fiscal deficit targets for the immediate future are even more challenging, at 3.6 per cent and 3 per cent for 2015-16 and 2016-17 respectively. The revenue deficit is slated to come down to below 3 per cent. Fiscal consolidation over the recent past has been achieved by reduction in expenditure rather than by revenue accretion. Even though the economy is yet to come out of the sub-5 per cent growth trajectory, the budget has targeted an ambitious 17 per cent growth in net tax revenues — from the revised estimate of Rs.8,36,026 crore in 2013-14 to Rs.9,77,258 crore by the year-end. Plan expenditure is budgeted at Rs.5,75,000 crore, an increase of 26.9 per cent over 2013-14. Non-Plan expenditure with additional provision for fertilizer subsidy is slated to go up to over Rs.12,19,892 crore, up from Rs.12,07,900 crore in the interim budget. As expected, the budget is depending heavily on public sector disinvestment to narrow the deficit. The target of over Rs.58,000 crore can be achieved only if the present high valuations in the stock markets continue for the remainder of this year. Recent SEBI rules mandating higher public shareholding for public sector undertakings will no doubt help the government. Expenditure control will remain a priority area. An Expenditure Management Commission to look into various aspects of expenditure reforms has been promised. Its interim report, to be submitted within a year, will be keenly watched.
Much was expected from the budget in rationalising subsidies. The Finance Minister has promised an overhaul of the entire subsidy regime including food and fertilizer subsidies at a future date. The budget has only made minor adjustments in >personal income tax, raising the tax exemption limit by Rs.50,000, from Rs.2 lakh to Rs.2.5 lakh in the case of individuals below 60 years of age, with corresponding increases for senior citizens. The investment limit under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act has been raised to Rs.1.5 lakh from Rs.1 lakh. The deduction limit on loan in respect of self-occupied housing property has been raised. A more conducive tax regime has been promised for infrastructure investment trusts and >real estate investment trusts. There have been no significant changes in indirect taxes either. The “sin” tax on cigarettes, cigars and other tobacco products has been increased. The service tax net is being widened. More than the changes in the rates, it is the emphasis on a friendlier tax regime that is both fair and certain that is noteworthy. The budget announcement on avoiding retrospective taxation is not as categorical as many industry bodies and tax consultants would have expected. The government, while retaining the retrospective changes made in 2012, has decided to get specific cases under the changes scrutinised before proceeding on them. The effort is to move towards a more stable and predictable taxation regime. A similar sentiment is behind the decision to enlarge the scope of advance ruling and generally tone up tax administration. The absence of a more definitive road map for Goods and Services Tax is understandable, but the Finance Minister’s commitment to pursuing it is to be welcomed.
>Foreign direct investment is being encouraged in a wide range of sectors including defence, insurance and real estate and in the development of smart cities. The MGNREGA, a flagship programme of the previous government, will be retained but oriented to works that are more productive, asset-creating and substantially linked to agriculture. Public-private partnerships in infrastructure will receive a boost. A new institution with a corpus of Rs.500 crore will help mainstream PPPs. Freeing infrastructure lending from the constraints of reserve requirements should bring additional resources into the infrastructure sector. While many more sectors are set to receive increased Plan allocations, the overall message of Budget 2014-15 is one of continuity. There has been no directional change, obviously on the reading that none was warranted.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/more-continuity-than-change/article6197930.ece
12,7,2014,Team Germany vs Lionel Messi,"Whatever happens at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday (early Monday morning for the bleary-eyed in India), history will have been made. Either the World Cup will have its first European champion on South American soil, or world football will have a new king to place beside Pele, Diego Maradona and Zinedine Zidane. >Team Germany versus Lionel Messi: the narrative writes itself, a rematch 24 years in the making. While it isn’t without truth, it suffers from a reduction in nuance. >German football has evolved since 1990, when an Andreas Brehme penalty won the Cup. Efficiency and collective play remain the substance, but there has been a refinement of style. Under Jurgen Klinsmann and then Joachim Low, a new German generation has showcased skilful, tactically fluid football while continuing the tradition of going deep in tournaments. But without a trophy, patience has begun to wear thin in Germany. >Argentina, on the other hand, appears not to have escaped the personality cult. It was Maradona in 1990 when he nearly managed a repeat of 1986; it’s Messi now. Much as with Maradona, the opposition’s extra-defensive attention limits Messi, but it extracts a cost: the other team can’t commit to attack without risking a match-turning moment of Messi magic. It can only work, however, if the rest of Argentina privileges an individual for its greater good.
The finalists could not have taken more contrasting routes. Argentina has managed eight goals in six matches, often leaving it very late; Germany nearly scored that number against Brazil, and has 17 in total. Argentina and the Netherlands set out not to lose their semi-final, two cautious, disciplined sides cancelling each other out. Neither could seize the initiative over 120 minutes. Germany and Brazil, in the other semifinal, went out to win, even if the host did it with absurd recklessness, “running into an open knife” as a German writer described it. In a sense it was surprising to see Brazil play thus. It had led the tournament in fouls, yellow cards, and tackles per game: this was a pragmatic unit, which despite the gaps at the back was capable of churning out results. But without Neymar, its creative force, and Thiago Silva, its leader and defensive organiser, the five-time champion crumbled. Despite inflicting such a heavy defeat, Low’s men can count on Brazil’s support in the final; not only has Germany’s football captivated the spiritual home of the game, Brazilians will rather see anyone win it but Argentina. >Alejandro Sabella has sought to lessen the pressure on his side by portraying Argentina as the underdog. But big finals know no favourites. All one can hope for is a contest that a thoroughly enjoyable World Cup can be remembered by.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/team-germany-vs-lionel-messi/article6201616.ece
12,7,2014,Changing terms of engagement,"The visit to India by British Foreign Secretary William Hague and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is part of a growing trend of major powers stepping up their engagement with the Narendra Modi government before the new administration imparts decisive direction to its >external policies. Ahead of the arrival of the visitors from London, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin was in New Delhi to give fresh direction to a deep-rooted but complex special relationship between Russia and India. Significantly, the guest from Moscow signalled Russia’s intent to rope in India as a strategic energy partner — as a consumer of Russian gas that would be transited through China.
The other visits have been less ambitious in scale, but the French Foreign Minister, Laurent Fabius, who followed Mr. Rogozin, pursued an ambitious agenda, pushing for the possible sale to India of Rafale fighter jets as well as French nuclear reactors. The high-profile >John McCain, the Senator from Arizona in the United States, also landed in the national capital — his visit preceded by his powerful advocacy for Washington’s active participation in India’s perceived military rise. The defence element also seemed strong during talks between the two British Ministers and their Indian counterparts. The British evidently have still not lost hope in upstaging the French by trying to convince their Indian interlocutors that the Typhoon jets that the British are involved in producing, would better protect Indian skies than the French Rafale. However, it will be erroneous to brand the Hague-Osborne visit as a window-dressed exercise in military salesmanship. Though trade between India and the United Kingdom has not picked up sufficient steam, and pales in comparison to New Delhi’s commercial relationship with many other countries, India along with China remains central to Mr. Cameron’s economic revival strategy. Besides, the terms of India’s engagement with the U.K. are rapidly evolving. Unlike as in the past, Indian companies have become major investors in Britain, the mutation amplified by the stunning success in the turnaround in Britain of the ailing Jaguar Land Rover venture by the Tata Group. Even during the latest visit, India’s Cipla announced it would invest $171 million for drugs research in the U.K., while the Mahindras will pump in a little over $34 million to develop electric cars in Britain. London remains a leading financial centre, and no country in the world can ignore its importance to global commerce. As India diversifies its diplomatic and commercial ties, a thriving relationship with Britain can be leveraged to bolster its finely nuanced relationships with other major constituents of a multi-polar world.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/changing-terms-of-engagement/article6201664.ece
14,7,2014,A reward for Amit Shah,"In electing Amit Shah as its president, the Bharatiya Janata Party seems to have lost sight of its special responsibilities as a ruling party at the Centre. There are many sides to Mr. Shah, but the BJP Central Parliamentary Board chose not to look beyond his organisational skills, and his success as the political strategist for Uttar Pradesh in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. An >accused in the case of the extrajudicial killings of Sohrabuddin Sheikh and Tulsiram Prajapati, two persons who were facing charges of extortion, Mr. Shah had a controversial tenure as Home Minister in Gujarat under the chief ministership of Narendra Modi. During his term, there were allegations that the law and order machinery of the State was misused for political ends. Reports of his direct involvement in a case of illegal surveillance of a woman also seriously dented his political image, but both Mr. Modi and the previous BJP president, Rajnath Singh, thought his campaign management skills trumped all the negatives. Senior BJP leaders and Prime Minister Modi obviously wanted to reward Mr. Shah for >winning 71 seats for the BJP from Uttar Pradesh. For the ruling party to have someone accused of engineering fake police encounters as its president, reflects poorly on the government it heads. Mr. Shah’s elevation in the BJP will surely send the wrong signals to all levels of the Modi administration. The real worry is that Mr. Shah, already known for his proximity to Prime Minister Modi, might emerge as an extra-constitutional authority in the government.
Within the BJP, the change at the top marks a generational shift. At 50, Mr. Shah is the >youngest BJP president, and his rapid rise is yet another indication of the sidelining of senior leaders such as L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi. Effectively, Mr. Modi will have a greater say in the affairs of both the government and the party. While party-government relations might get to be smoother than they were under the United Progressive Alliance government, this could be at the cost of democratic decision-making. Instead of the UPA’s dual centres of power, which saw a politically weak Prime Minister and a powerful party president trying to work in tandem, the National Democratic Alliance government seems to be pushing for a centralised decision-making structure with power concentrated in Mr. Modi. With a powerful PMO and a loyalist party president backing him, the Prime Minister seems to have everything going for him. But the real concern is not about Mr. Modi interfering in BJP affairs, but about Mr. Shah leveraging his access within the government. Mr. Modi will have to ensure that Mr. Shah as BJP president will not be interfering in the working of the government.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-reward-for-amit-shah/article6206809.ece
14,7,2014,Ceaseless conflict in West Asia,"Anew dance of death has started in Gaza after Israel began >ceaseless rounds of air strikes, following rocket attacks by the Palestinian Hamas. The complete disproportionality of force in response to Hamas’ strikes can be measured in numbers. Over 500 missile strikes by Hamas have not resulted in a single Israeli death. But in sharp contrast, an estimated 165 Palestinians have perished in Israeli air raids. Strikingly, civilian casualties have surged. While the Israelis term the death of non-combatants as “collateral damage”, the unintentional consequence of the focussed targeting of Palestinian “terrorist nests”, many Israeli commentators are energetically countering the official Israeli narrative. Writing in the Israeli daily Haaretz, Gideon Levy illuminatingly observed that the targeting of civilians may be deliberate — the culmination of a perverse military logic of bringing about calm by causing maximum societal pain. The Israeli establishment may well point to the tactic pursued by Hamas of embedding its rockets within civilian population clusters, which can then come under attack. However deplorable some of Hamas’ warfare techniques may be, there is a counter-view that in the overcrowded, narrow environs of the Gaza strip the Palestinian militant group has no operational option but to enmesh with the people.
The response of the United Nations to the unfolding >tragedy in Gaza has been heartening. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, turned the spotlight on “deeply disturbing reports” about civilian casualties, which included children. She added: “Such reports raise serious doubt about whether the Israeli strikes have been in accordance with international humanitarian law and international human rights law.” In sharp contrast, the Indian position on the Gaza crisis has been muted, consistent with its ambivalent approach in recent years of maintaining passive equidistance between the Israelis and Palestinians. The studied avoidance of taking clear moral positions on the Palestinian issue hardly augurs well for a country with global aspirations, as evidenced by New Delhi’s advocacy for membership in the United Nations Security Council. Pragmatism also demands that India weighs in strongly on the unresolved Israel-Palestinian issue, which is the core of >instability in West Asia — a region that is vital for India’s economy and energy security. Fears of a blowback from Israel, which would undermine national security, in case India takes a more forthright position on the Israel-Palestinian track, may be exaggerated, given the relationship of deep interdependence that New Delhi and Tel Aviv have developed over the years.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ceaseless-conflict-in-west-asia/article6206810.ece
15,7,2014,A triumph of the collective,"Germany’s historic triumph in Brazil — its fourth World Cup title and the first by a European team in South America — had an air of inevitability about it. Among the many astonishing feats Joachim Low’s side managed, perhaps the most remarkable was reanimating the legend that football is a game two teams play and >Germany wins. For, success is seldom a neat, well-ordered thing; disaster is often just an unavoidable mistake away. But if anyone can conceive and execute a grand idea, never losing sight of the bigger picture while tirelessly attending to the details, it’s Germany. This after all is a football association that built from scratch a training base in Brazil equidistant from all its venues; everything was just so, from the grass on the practice pitches to the cloistered housing arrangements that helped the team bond. Several experts have pointed to the fact that Germany, like Spain in 2010, profited from having a core group from one club, Bayern Munich in this case, Barcelona FC four years ago. It’s an undeniable advantage. However, this view fails to acknowledge Germany’s incredibly systemic work of restructuring the grassroots game and ensuring that a golden generation didn’t slip through the cracks, the success, as Low said, of “a 10-year project.”
And yet it could so easily have been different. Given what was at stake, the final was a tense, cagey affair that appeared as if it would be decided by errors. Argentina, an admirably well-drilled unit, made very few errors while defending. But it couldn’t capitalise on the chances it got. Gonzalo Higuaín, Lionel Messi and Rodrigo Palacio missed one-on-one opportunities. Manuel Neur, adjudged the tournament’s best goalkeeper, had his angles right, but the Argentines didn’t force him into a save. Messi did enough in the World Cup to be deemed its best player; it wasn’t his night, however. Germany’s big-match experience (eight starters had played a Champions League final), ingrained tactical intelligence and collective might proved too strong. When a team can absorb the loss of Marco Reus ahead of the tournament and Sami Khedira >before the final, and still call from the bench Mario Götze for a moment of pure quality, its reserves run very deep indeed. Miroslav Klose, the highest scorer in World Cup history and the lone survivor from the 2002 final, was a reminder of the balance Germany had struck between the old and the new. Determined and clinical, open-minded and creative, the Germans were popular champions of an edition that united the football world more than it divided it. The question whether $13.5 billion of public money was well spent will >need answering in Brazil, but there’s no doubt the country delivered a World Cup that will be fondly remembered for its people and the football.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-triumph-of-the-collective/article6210223.ece
15,7,2014,Mr. Chavan held to account,"The Election Commission’s order on the complaints of suppression of >election expenditure by former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan may pose a threat to his immediate political future, and of possible disqualification from contesting elections for three years. However, he has escaped action for what could have been the more damaging charge of procuring favourable coverage through ‘paid news’ in the media to further his electoral prospects in the 2009 Assembly polls. Even though informally described as a ‘paid news’ case, the Commission is not proceeding against him for getting positive coverage through consideration in cash or kind. Rather, he is being hauled up for failing to account for spending involved in the publication of 25 press advertisements that seemed to boost his electoral prospects. Rejecting his contention that he had not authorised their publication, the Commission has ruled that there was “implied authorisation” in that he had participated in 19 of those advertised meetings addressed by star campaigners Sonia Gandhi, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Salman Khan. The poll panel has pointed to the dangers of accepting his plea that he could still account for the expenditure incurred on these advertisements, as he had not exhausted the full quantum of spending allowed to a candidate. For, it could lead to candidates suppressing expenditure initially, and offering to include them in accounts statements when found out.
In recent years, the Commission has been trying to curb the ‘paid news’ phenomenon, but there is >no legal provision at present for punishment to those involved. What can be done at best is to establish whether promotional poll campaign coverage was actually paid for by candidates, and then proceeding against them for failing to include the consideration involved in their expenditure statements. In Mr. Chavan’s case, the Commission has found that some newspapers published identical or similar articles and material supplied by political sources and passed them off as editorial content. However, it has declined to find him guilty, as the content was only general propaganda for the Congress and did not aim to boost his prospects as a candidate. Its view that ethical journalism demands that even newspapers that support the political philosophy of a party need to make a distinction between opinion and news columns is unexceptionable. It will certainly be a major setback for Mr. Chavan, who successfully staged an electoral comeback in the Lok Sabha polls after being made to resign as Chief Minister over the >Adarsh Housing Society scandal, to find himself in the political wilderness again if he is disqualified, but it is some relief to him that the ‘paid news’ charge did not stick.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mr-chavan-held-to-account/article6210224.ece
16,7,2014,Continuing with the spoils system,"In the country’s multi-party polity, the role of Governors under the Constitution has been a sensitive aspect of Centre-State relations. Given that >some Governors have in the past played a partisan role during moments of political instability, and some have been accused of using Raj Bhavans for political ends, the need to appoint as governors eminent personalities who would be above the political fray rather than active political functionaries, has been advocated to remove a major irritant. The National Democratic Alliance government had a golden opportunity to demonstrate its democratic credentials while appointing new Governors. It could have chosen eminent personalities outside the political realm in line with the recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission on Centre-State relations and moved away from the beaten path of turning Raj Bhavans into rehabilitation homes for over-the-hill politicians. However, with a remarkable sense of conformity with the spoils system put in place by the Congress, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party is also treating gubernatorial office as a retirement benefit for its veterans. All the five new Governors appointed by it, for Uttar Pradesh ( >Ram Naik), Gujarat (O.P. Kohli), West Bengal (Keshari Nath Tripathi), Chhattisgarh (Balramji Dass Tandon) and Nagaland (Padmanabha Acharya), were actively associated with the BJP. The youngest of them is 78 and the oldest 87, making a mockery of retirement imperatives.
The fact that >five political functionaries closely linked with the BJP have been appointed as Governors reflects poorly on the willingness and ability of major political parties to bring about meaningful change in the political culture. If there are two outstanding features of the political events that have stood out in recent times, it is the upsurge in popular sentiment in favour of accountability in public life, and the yearning for positive changes in the way public affairs are conducted. The major parties are far from fulfilling these requirements, although they manage to win elections promising change. There are indications that the next round of appointments could also involve some political functionaries, even though a few names drawn from the bureaucracy could also be cleared. The key >Sarkaria recommendation — that a Governor should be someone eminent in some walk of life, and should not be one “who has taken too great a part in politics generally, and particularly in the recent past” — continues to be ignored for reasons of realpolitik. Having blamed the Congress for the degeneration of many institutions, the present regime could have avoided this egregious bad practice entrenched in the political system.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/continuing-with-the-spoils-system/article6214339.ece
16,7,2014,Boost for infrastructure,"The maiden budget of the Narendra Modi Government has allowed banks to raise long-term funds from the market to finance infrastructure projects. For funds thus raised, >banks are freed from requirements with respect to Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR), Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Priority Sector Lending. The move is in tune with the recommendations of the Nachiket Mor Committee on Comprehensive Financial Services for Small Businesses and Low-Income Households. The panel had suggested the gradual phase-out of SLR, and recommended CRR application only on demand deposits. The budget proposal has a two-fold objective. For one, it seeks to address concerns over the asset-liability mismatch in banks’ lending to >infrastructure projects, which have long gestation periods. By freeing banks of statutory obligations on those funds, on the other hand, the budget aims to bring down the financing cost for them. With projects facing overruns on cost and time fronts due to assorted reasons in the wake of economic slowdown, the banking system as a whole has come under heavy stress. So much so that banks have been forced to restructure a substantial portion of their lending to infrastructure projects. The failure of infrastructure projects on a large scale has seen non-performing assets (NPA) piling up in this sector. A funds-starved government needs private enterprises to give a big push to infra growth. Private enterprises will move into the infra space only if long-term funds are available at affordable rates and near-term worries on repayment do not weigh on them. Viewed against this backdrop, the budget proposal is a twice-blessed move. For, it benefits banks as well as private enterprises.
There is, however, a huge risk in looking at the proposal from a micro prism alone. Is non-availability of long-term funds the sole reason for the present predicament in the >infrastructure space? A host of factors — ranging from land acquisition to green clearance and poor credit appraisal — have combined to derail the infrastructure sector. Is the monetary regulator — the Reserve Bank of India – on the same page with fiscal bosses on the issue of letting banks go free on statutory obligations for money raised to fund infrastructure projects? Even if it is in sync with the fiscal bosses, the RBI may yet be keen to ensure that its ability to exercise control over the monetary aspects of the economy is not compromised. The RBI may do well to ensure that such selective exemptions from statutory obligations do not compromise the viability of the banking system. The budget proposal must be taken forward in a composite way by all the stakeholders so that infrastructure development is facilitated.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/boost-for-infrastructure/article6214340.ece
22,7,2014,The inevitable parting,"After what Jammu & Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah described as a “comprehensive” rout of the National Conference-Congress alliance in the State in the Lok Sabha elections, it was only a matter of time before the two parted ways. The alliance’s perceptible failure to connect with the people of the State where it has ruled since 2009, the allegations of corruption and the all-too- apparent governance deficit were responsible for the defeat. It lost in all six seats, while the People’s Democratic Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party won three each. In their search for scapegoats, the alliance partners blamed each other. The National Conference (NC) believes it was done in by the UPA government’s hanging of Afzal Guru. The Congress blamed its partner for eroding the Hindu vote bank in Jammu by invoking the spectre of secession on the issue of Article 370. The NC-Congress relationship has always been a chequered one, rarely sustained in adversity. Whenever the two parties have come together, it has been more of an understanding between the Abdullahs and the Gandhis, and the arrangement has rarely found favour with the two parties at the State level. In fact, the State’s two main Congress leaders, Saifuddin Soz and Ghulam Nabi Azad, who disagree on almost everything else, were for long in agreement that the coalition had become a liability for the Congress. After the 2010 stone-pelting agitation in the Valley, the State’s Congress leadership had strongly recommended withdrawal of support to the Omar Abdullah government.
Now that the split has taken place, both parties claim to be the first to have walked away, even though the usefulness of this as a political tactic is questionable. Anti-incumbency was much in evidence during the parliamentary elections, prompting Chief Minister Abdullah to roll out a series of measures aimed at winning back the confidence of the people immediately after the rout — SMS services on prepaid mobile phones, banned since the stone-pelting agitation, were restored; the retirement age of government employees was raised from 58 to 60 years, and all temporary recruitments were regularised. A desperate Mr. Abdullah has also given out his e-mail address asking people to send their grievances to him directly. With a resettlement plan for Pandits who fled the Valley when militancy began and still live in squalid camps in Jammu, he is also wooing the BJP’s constituency. At the moment, the PDP, fresh from its Lok Sabha gains, is already exuding the confidence of a winner. No doubt, it expects to benefit from the NC-Congress split. But the Assembly elections are still four months away, which is a long time in politics anywhere, and especially in Jammu & Kashmir.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-inevitable-parting/article6234689.ece
22,7,2014,A commendable move,"Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s promise in his maiden budget to make rupee notes and coins more accessible for the blind echoes a broad commitment to correct long-standing disadvantages that arise out of physical disabilities. Mr. Jaitley’s idea could be an outstanding example of the practical application of the concept of universal design. On this view, if you want to make provision for the disabled, you incorporate special-needs components into the general design of all infrastructure, products and services. The blind in India identify paper currency partially, as denominations-wise they come in different sizes — the greater the value of a bank note, the larger the size. You cannot eliminate altogether the element of chance in identifying a rupee bill without an improvised device. There are also other indicators on bank notes — various shapes displayed in raised print — to represent particular denominations. These can be felt by touch only on new bank notes. But it can still be hard to decipher the values they connote. Similarly, there are in circulation today coins of the same denomination in different sizes (two rupees), as also coins of different denominations in the same size (50 paise and one rupee). Besides, there are three types of five-rupee coins, all of which can cause confusion to the blind. Standardisation and consistency in coin design could ensure the distinctness of each value. Wavy edges and hexagonal shapes were present in coins that have been withdrawn.
International practice favours the adoption of tactile features, for not all users read Braille. Assistive gadgets and mobile applications also help in the identification of currency. There have been major Reserve Bank of India initiatives to promote equal access to banking for the disabled. The installation of voice-activated features on all automated teller machines and the extension of chequebook and locker facilities for the blind are some of them. India’s central bank further requires retail banks to recognise authorised guardians to enable people with cerebral palsy and autism to operate their personal accounts. The overall experience should come in handy for the RBI to determine the precise manner of executing inclusive currency. The Ministries of Railways, Transport and Urban Development, and other arms of the government, should take the cue from the Finance Minister’s proposal. A corollary to the creation of accessible currency notes would be to design all buses and train compartments with provision for low floors and room for wheelchairs. Experience has shown the introduction of disabled-friendly features in strictly designated areas to be an ineffective means to achieve social inclusion. Special provisions become self-defeating when they merely result in further segregation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-commendable-move/article6234690.ece
23,7,2014,Disquieting disclosure,"The line between a whistle-blower and a motivated accuser can be very thin, and too often those making controversial disclosures face troubling questions over their motive and timing. Former Supreme Court judge and Press Council of India Chairman Markandey Katju’s startling disclosure that an additional judge of the Madras High Court was improperly given repeated extensions of tenure, and finally made a permanent judge in 2007, despite adverse reports about his integrity, has caused understandable disquiet in legal, judicial and political circles. The Law Minister of the day and the then Chief Justice of India who confirmed in 2007 the appointment of Justice S. Ashok Kumar, have denied any wrongdoing. Some have questioned the timing of Mr. Katju’s revelation, almost a decade after the developments. Whatever is made of his motive or timing, it cannot be gainsaid that Mr. Katju has shone considerable light on a troubling feature of what is on paper an appointments system that gives primacy to the opinion of the Chief Justice of India and the collegium of judges: that the considered decision of the collegium can be undermined by political influence. However, he can legitimately be asked to explain the delay in making his disclosure, and his silence and acquiescence while he was Chief Justice of the Madras High Court and later when he was a Supreme Court judge. A 2008 Supreme Court judgment, while refusing to interfere with Justice Ashok Kumar’s appointment, had pointedly noted that “successive Chief Justices” had recommended that he be made a permanent judge.
The heart of the matter is the concern that the present system of appointing judges does little to ensure that the higher judiciary is insulated from undue political influence. The continuance of Ashok Kumar in office — he passed way in 2009 — did indeed raise troubling questions: the collegium was against confirming him between 2005 and 2007, but, intriguingly, he got three extensions before being made a permanent judge. It is disquieting that the decisions by former Chief Justices of India in the matter had gone against the collective opinion of the collegium. The government has now confirmed in Parliament that the Prime Minister’s Office and the Law Ministry had written to the Supreme Court seeking extension of service for the judge, which lends some substance to the allegation that the DMK pressured the UPA government to swing a decision in favour of its acolyte, and that the higher judiciary complied — an allegation that has been denied promptly. It is true that the present opaque procedure of appointments needs a more efficacious and genuinely consultative replacement, but ultimately only the calibre and integrity of individuals at the helm of the judiciary can really keep political interference at bay.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/disquieting-disclosure/article6238661.ece
23,7,2014,A blot on Indian science,"That getting papers published in scientific journals, reputable ones included, using manufactured data is virtually child’s play has been made painfully evident by a team of scientists at the Chandigarh-based Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH), which functions under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. Three papers that the team published last year in the PLoS ONE journal were retracted on July 9 after an internal investigation by the institute found unequivocal evidence of data fabrication. Four more papers are in the process of being retracted. All the seven papers have the same research associate as the first author and the senior scientist of the institute as the corresponding author. So much was the expertise in data fabrication and “presentation” involved that the reviewers and editors of all the papers failed to spot them. That even with “hindsight” one of the editors was unable to figure out which of the three “similar” but non-identical graphs in the three papers had been fabricated, is proof enough. The same must hold true for the four other papers as well. There is no difference whatsoever in terms of scale or implication between the current case and those involving the South Korean stem cell researcher Hwang Woo-suk and the Japanese stem cell researcher Haruko Obokata. As much as the stem cell researchers shamed their respective countries, the Indian researchers’ unethical practice is a blot on Indian science.
The only consolation in the face of this serious affront to science is that unlike many institutions in India that do not investigate such frauds committed by their scientists, IMTECH has shown the spine and tremendous alacrity to get to the bottom of the issue. While the first author has already paid the price for his commission, the scientist’s role is now under scrutiny. By virtue of being a senior author in all the seven papers, he has much explaining to do to prove his non-involvement in the scandal as some data in the PLoS ONE papers are “not supported by raw data in the lab.” More than the setback suffered by the institute, it would face a barrage of criticism and ridicule and lose all the goodwill it earned as a result of its actions if the probe does not remain unbiased and fails to bring out the truth. There is an important lesson to be learnt from the way South Korea acted without any bias to prove Hwang’s guilt and thereafter withdraw his licence and suspend him. Meanwhile, steps need to be taken immediately to teach research students the ethics of doing and reporting science. For instance, journals have found numerous instances of unacceptable manipulation of images, often arising from researchers’ eagerness to produce perfect pictures.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-blot-on-indian-science/article6238663.ece
24,7,2014,Missed opportunity on Gaza,"External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj’s statement on the ongoing Gaza crisis during a discussion in the Rajya Sabha is an exercise in political correctness. By stating that New Delhi’s stance on the Israel-Palestine issue has not shifted, and going ahead with a pro forma denunciation of violence, Ms. Swaraj has missed a golden opportunity to impress upon a domestic audience that the Modi administration is pursuing a fresh statesman-like approach on a complex global issue. Besides, she may have also let down a wider international audience, especially in West Asia and North Africa, which has been looking for a stronger and principled Indian voice to help resolve the spiralling crisis.
The new government seems to have missed the full import of the Gaza situation by choosing to espouse a minimalist position of equidistance between the Palestinians and Israel. It is important to recognise that the Israel-Palestinian issue is the core of instability in West Asia — a region that is the lifeline of India’s economy because of its huge oil and gas reserves. A long-term interest in energy security alone demands that New Delhi — a friend of both Israel and the Palestinians — should leverage its unique position to persuade both sides to revive peace talks. There is reason to believe that greater diplomatic activism by India on the Israel-Palestine issue would be welcomed by the emerging powers as well as the global south, which is looking for new leaders on the global stage. This is especially true at a time when the international system is mutating from the unipolarity of the 1990s to the emergence of a multipolar world in the second decade of the twenty-first century. However, in taking a forthright position, the government has to contend with a powerful pro-Israel constituency in India. Citing India’s close military relationship with Israel, Tel Aviv’s friends construe any position taken by India that is even mildly critical of Israel as a threat to national security. Nothing could be farther from the truth, for Indo-Israel military ties are premised on interdependence, with New Delhi providing a huge market for military products as well as joint ventures, which Israel would find hard to give up. In navigating a dense grey zone, Ms. Swaraj could have followed the lead provided by BRICS, which has at the Fortaleza fully appreciated that the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is fundamental to sustainable peace in West Asia. The new grouping has also unambiguously stressed that dialogue must be resumed, which would result in a two-state solution based on the lines of June 4, 1967, with East Jerusalem as the capital of an independent Palestinian state.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/missed-opportunity-on-gaza/article6242502.ece
24,7,2014,A minimum wage debate,"Echoes of the statutory universal minimum wage legislation adopted by Germany’s governing grand coalition seem to reverberate beyond Berlin, in the European Union and across the Atlantic. Europe’s largest economy is to enforce a national minimum pay of €8.5 an hour from January. Such a guarantee would extend cover to the millions of workers — mainly in the eastern region — who remain outside the negotiated wage settlement that defined post-War Germany’s industrial model. Britain has had a national minimum wage law since 1998. But ahead of the 2015 general election, the opposition Labour Party, which was the architect of the legislation, wants changes so that those at the bottom of the workforce may share the fruits of the economic recovery. Neighbouring France codified a legal guarantee in 1950, amended since in 1970. But Paris has recently floated the idea of a minimum wage across the European Union, although a pan-European measure may not materialise any time soon given the legal prohibition in this area. The idea may well influence the remaining six EU states — founder-member Italy, Austria, Cyprus, and the three Nordic countries — to stipulate their respective basic floor. Although the Swiss rejected a proposal that would have given the country the world’s highest minimum pay, the plebiscite in May occasioned a lively debate. U.S. President Barack Obama’s bid to raise the federal minimum wage was blocked by Congress. But there is evidence of growing support among the Republicans, who are anxious not to antagonise voters.
The implications of a minimum-wage floor on employment generation and growth continue to divide opinion. This is true equally of Germany which is set to introduce the new law in January, or Britain and the U.S. which have put forth proposals to effect an increase in the existing amount. But growing support on this contentious issue cutting across traditional party lines perhaps means there is greater recognition that minimum wages ought to keep pace with inflation, average wages and productivity growth. The imperative need to mitigate the impact of the 2007-08 economic meltdown on large sections of the population in the advanced economies has also strengthened support. A legal minimum pay remains a vital tool for the workforce in mature democracies, even though these are already underpinned by vibrant trade unions and high levels of social protection measures. However, for the bulk of the wage-earners in the developing world that is outside the organised sector of the economy, a legal guarantee of a minimum subsistence pay seems morally non-negotiable. This is true even from the standpoint of the physical and mental capacities that are paramount to enhance overall productivity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-minimum-wage-debate/article6242501.ece
25,7,2014,Time for hard decisions,"For the Congress, things came to a head this week: on a single day, two senior Ministers in Assam and Maharashtra, States where it is in power, resigned; three of its MLAs in West Bengal defected to the Trinamool Congress, and an ex-MP in Jammu & Kashmir quit the party 24 hours after the Congress and the National Conference decided to contest elections separately even though they still rule J&K jointly. Simultaneously, speculation grew about the possibility of similar exits in Haryana. This came at the end of a month that witnessed demands from within the party for the removal of the Chief Ministers of Assam, Maharashtra and Haryana. The attempts to replace them failed eventually, but the delay in settling the issue further undermined the authority of the incumbents and tried the patience of the rebels. The message that the Congress high command will not act under pressure came too late; the fact that the Chief Ministers and the dissidents both had backers in Delhi helped even less, presenting the picture of a divided leadership. The fact that State Assembly elections are due later this year in Maharashtra, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir and Jharkhand, has increased the anxiety — and impatience — of party members in these States: they fear a repeat of the results of the recent general elections that saw the Congress touching an unprecedented low in terms of seats won.
Taken together, these events are symptomatic of the deep crisis the Congress is going through. The party’s rank and file are not just looking for a major organisational overhaul and a big idea; it is actually thirsting for inspirational leadership and direction that can restore the fortunes of the Congress. But party vice-president Rahul Gandhi, who was expected to take over the organisation’s reins after the Lok Sabha polls, continues to be reluctant to lead from the front, as is apparent from Karnataka veteran Mallikarjun Kharge’s appointment as the parliamentary party leader in the Lok Sabha. And party president Sonia Gandhi is clearly unable to persuade Mr. Gandhi to either accept the leader’s role fully or learn from his failed experiments at democratising the party. Instead, thus far, a committee under senior leader A.K. Antony has been set up to make a diagnosis of, and suggest a cure for, the party’s ills. But while the committee’s sittings provided party members with a forum to vent their feelings, the report that will eventually emerge is not expected to change anything much: for, like similar post-debacle reports by Mr. Antony in the past, this one, too, is intended for Sonia Gandhi’s eyes only. The Congress is clearly not yet ready to look beyond the Gandhis, and it is therefore time now for Mr. Gandhi to take on the challenge or make way for someone else.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/time-for-hard-decisions/article6246081.ece
25,7,2014,Building the REIT way,"The Union Budget for 2014-15 has done a good turn for the languishing real estate sector that is grappling with unsold inventory of finished projects and mounting debt. There are two proposals worthy of mention that will give a much-needed leg-up to the critical sector. First, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley increased the tax deduction for interest paid on housing loans by individuals in self-occupied properties from the current Rs.1,50,000 to Rs.2,00,000 a year. This will lower the burden just that bit for middle-class tax payers with ongoing housing loan EMIs, and also hopefully push those considering investing in a house into making that decision. With interest rates likely to trend down over the next year and real estate prices at a low ebb in most cities, the higher deduction will be an important incentive for aspiring home-buyers. More interesting than this concession though is the clarity that the Budget brings to taxation of real estate investment trusts, or REITS, which are akin to mutual funds in the stock market.
REITS sell units to investors and use the money to invest in completed or almost-completed projects, mainly commercial and retail, to earn rental income. This income is then distributed to unit-holders, and the units are listed and traded on the stock markets like any other equity share. Mr. Jaitley has clarified that these units will be taxed in a manner similar to equity shares; more importantly, he has granted pass-through status to REITS, which means they don’t have to pay corporate tax. The Budget also clarifies that the sponsor (promoter) will be liable for capital gains tax not when he exchanges his shares in the project for units from a trust but when he sells those units. These proposals are in line with market expectations and will certainly give a push to REITS, which are important in more ways than one. In the immediate term, REITS could help unlock for promoters capital invested in finished but idle projects. In the medium to long term, these trusts will help capital formation in the real estate business and relieve the financing burden on banks, which are now stressed with non-performing real estate loans, among others. REITS will also help domestic investors who cannot invest large sums of money but wish to have real estate in their portfolio as they can invest in units that are expected to be priced as low as Rs.1,00,000 to start with, going by draft guidelines of market regulator SEBI; the guidelines will be finalised once the Budget is passed by Parliament. Most important of all, the advent of REITS will usher in global best practices into an industry that is in dire need of transparency in its business practices.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/building-the-reit-way/article6246082.ece
26,7,2014,An unedifying spectacle,"The sight of Shiv Sena MP Rajan Vichare forcing Arshad, a catering supervisor at the IRCTC canteen in Delhi’s New Maharashtra Sadan, to eat a chapati during his Ramzan fasting period last week, marks a new low in the conduct of elected representatives. Whatever post-incident gloss might be put on it, the country saw clearly the high-handed approach of Mr. Vichare and his colleagues from the Shiv Sena, who thought they were highlighting the problems they faced while staying at the Sadan. The Shiv Sena, which specialises in using strong-arm tactics to silence those who disagree with it, has long been a prime culprit in taking resort to extreme and unacceptable behaviour. Whether it is in attacking newspaper editors or television channels critical of it, or others who come in its way, the Sena has violated the law of the land with impunity time and again. In this case, Mr. Arshad’s complaint to his supervisors said he was in uniform, displaying his name badge. Even then, the aggressive MP, as clearly seen in television footage, tried to force a chapati into his mouth in the face of his protestations that he was fasting. Interestingly, though the incident happened last week, television channels ran the video footage of the coarse behaviour of the Member of Parliament only after the matter was reported in print on Wednesday.
India has changed for the better in so many ways, with greater public scrutiny of and accountability in public life, but we know that the powerful still enjoy impunity. Even if it would be too much to expect elected representatives to set an example for people by their behaviour, the level of boorishness to which they descended in Maharashtra Sadan is alarming. Accommodation and food that were not to their liking may be legitimate complaints. But forcing food into the mouth of an employee is not the way to improve the situation. If Maharashtra government officials were not being responsive enough, the Sena MPs could have addressed their problems in other ways. In the past, too, there have been instances of some MPs making a ridiculous spectacle of themselves. The display of arrogance of power cuts across political lines, and one Congress MP, who is now in the BJP, brandished a gun at a toll plaza in Gujarat not so long ago. The distress caused to a Muslim employee by the callous, even if not deliberate, disregard of his religious sensibilities is apparent. Good governance in India must be premised on equal respect for all individuals. Any sense that some religions are less equal than others can only be exploited by extremist elements. The Narendra Modi government would do well to distance itself from such actions by MPs who are allied to it. A positive agenda for governance can work only if every citizen feels that the state and its representatives are sensitive to his or her way of life.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-unedifying-spectacle/article6250176.ece
26,7,2014,The crowded skies,"The decision of the Union Civil Aviation Ministry to issue six no objection certificates to applicants both in the national and regional sectors raises a few questions. Air Asia has just taken to the skies in India. The Tata-Singapore Airlines joint venture airline should become operational by the year-end, and Air Pegasus is likely to get the nod soon. India already has eight airlines, providing a dense network of flights linking different parts of the country, though not with a uniform spread. While the public sector Air India gets weighed down with social commitments and the burden of government or political interference, the private airlines get to run on more commercial lines. However, except for Indigo, which turns in a profit most of the time, all the airlines are running up losses, looking to the government to provide some relief or concessions. The charge of the public sector airline is that the government and the authorities are more helpful to the private airlines. Air India has been bleeding consistently, and the government has been injecting funds in small doses to help it survive. It has not been able to acquire all the aircraft it wanted, or reduce the burden of over-staffing. Some of the private airlines are run more efficiently and have unveiled plans to expand operations significantly.
At this critical juncture, does the country need another six airlines? Can they all survive in a hyper-competitive environment? Are the Aviation Ministry, the Airports Authority of India, and the State governments ready to improve the infrastructure and facilities at some of the smaller airports? Since outgo on aviation turbine fuel and staff constitutes the largest share of the operational cost of any airline, how are the new entities planning to manage their finances? No doubt, job opportunities will open up for young men and women, including qualified commercial pilots who have been without work for some time now. From the point of view of passengers, more airlines and lower fares may once again make air travel cheaper and within the reach of the common person. The Aviation Ministry may say it just issued an NOC for applicants, and it is up to the promoter to work out the economics of the operations and ensure that the new airlines remain viable. The Centre has also to take a call on the norms for allowing private or domestic airlines to fly international routes, because other than the domestic trunk routes the airlines earn their revenue from flights overseas. It is also time for the aviation regulator to get prepared and equipped for the critical task of monitoring the skies and the operators, as well as their aircraft.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-crowded-skies/article6250177.ece
28,7,2014,Countering a divisive agenda,"It is easy to dismiss as a >needless controversy the opposition from a Bharatiya Janata Party legislator to the appointment of tennis star Sania Mirza as a >brand ambassador of the young State of Telangana, but one cannot afford to ignore the implications of his perverse remarks concerning her very nationality. By describing her as a ‘daughter-in-law of Pakistan’ because she is married to a Pakistani national, K. Lakshman, the floor leader of the BJP in the Telangana Assembly, was both questioning her ‘Indian-ness’ and insinuating that she has incurred some sort of disqualification for promoting his State because of her marriage. The fact that Ms. Mirza had to publicly >avow her loyalty to India is not something our society can be proud of. The BJP leadership has, rightly, distanced itself from Mr. Lakshman’s remarks, but such issues have a tendency to find a resonance among fringe elements in the party and its cohorts. Questions are already being raised about Ms. Mirza’s suitability for the position, her residential status, and loyalty to the nation. While it is legitimate to suggest that other Hyderabad-based sporting icons such as V.V.S. Laxman and Saina Nehwal are also well-suited to represent the Telangana brand, there is little reason to question the State government’s choice, on communal grounds. However, by introducing a 1956 cut-off date to decide who among Hyderabad domiciles will be entitled to government benefits and schemes, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi regime may also have provided the context for a needless scrutiny of Ms. Mirza’s domiciliary status, forcing her to assert that her family has had links with Hyderabad for over a hundred years.
The plight of Ms. Mirza is a mere symptom of a larger malaise creeping into public life. It is the assertion of a distasteful combination of ultra-nationalism and communalism. It is doubtful if the question of divided loyalties would have been raised in the case of a non-Muslim person marrying a foreigner. And outside the nationalist and political domain, the issue also has a gender dimension. Looking at women as ‘daughters-in-law’ of another society after they marry outside it is an unsavoury example of an entrenched discriminatory mindset. It is quite unlikely that an Indian sportsman married to a woman from another country would have been described as that country’s ‘son-in-law’. Belligerent elements are finding means to mask their agenda, behind public issues that arise from time to time. The BJP in the Narendra Modi era has to decide whether it will continue to suffer the polarising tactics of some its members and its extended parivar, or intervene to arrest the retrogressive trend. No responsible leadership can afford to allow fringe elements to indulge in divisive behaviour.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/countering-a-divisive-agenda/article6254913.ece
28,7,2014,New turn in Indonesia,"A long and complex electoral process in Indonesia finally concluded with the >remarkable victory of Joko Widodo, who was officially declared the winner in the presidential elections. An outsider to Indonesia’s entrenched military and political establishment, Jokowi, as he is known, had never held national political office, and was unheard of until just nine years ago when he was elected Mayor of Solo, a city in central Java. In the seven years that he held office, he transformed that densely populated, run-down, crime-ridden city into a sparkling tourist destination, rebranding it as a hub of Javanese art, heritage and culture. His runaway success there led to his taking over as Governor of Jakarta in 2012 in an election that saw him unseat the incumbent, a veteran politician who had once been the treasurer of Golkar, the party of Indonesia’s military ruler General Suharto. Jakarta’s problems were more challenging than Solo’s, but Jokowi’s popularity only grew. At first it was not clear whether the Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle (PDI-P), which had backed Jokowi for the Jakarta election, would nominate him for the presidential election. But after party leader Megawati Sukarnoputri stepped away from the race, his path was cleared. Jokowi and his vice-presidential running mate won 53.15 per cent of the total vote; the rival team of Prabowo Subianto, a former military general who belongs to the Great Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra), got 46.8 per cent. Citing “massive cheating” during the counting, Mr. Prabowo withdrew from the process. He has since appealed to the Constitutional Court against the verdict, but is yet to produce evidence to back his allegations of massive electoral fraud.
Jokowi’s victory is significant for several reasons. In this election, more than in previous ones, Indonesian voters have signalled that what they want is a clean break from the legacy of the Suharto dictatorship, which ended in 1998. Another country in South East Asia, Thailand, is now back under military rule. Further afield, in Pakistan, the elected government and the powerful military are still unable to disentangle their locked horns. The rise of an outsider in Indonesian politics also owes itself to a system of decentralised governance that enabled Jokowi to prove his credentials locally first, even though he still needed the aid of a mainstream political party to ascend the national stage. But the real challenge is yet to begin. The PDP-I is in an unwieldy coalition that backed Jokowi’s candidature, but even so has only 207 out of 560 seats in the House of Representatives, while the Opposition coalition has 353 seats. With national expectations running high, Jokowi will be on test from the day he takes office in October this year.

29,7,2014,Debate over a critical office,"The >Attorney General’s opinion that the Congress is ineligible to claim the post of Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the Lok Sabha as it does not have the requisite number of 55 members to be recognised as a Parliamentary Party is based on precedent established since the first Lok Sabha. But it may not be the last word on the question. That precedent was followed by the Congress itself when in power, and for >long periods in the history of the Lok Sabha there was no recognised leader of the opposition. The rationale was that the leader of the opposition being in line to form an alternative government should be able to hold the House with the required quorum of 10 per cent of its strength. The 10 per cent rule was established by G.V. Mavalankar and incorporated later in the Directions for the functioning of the Lok Sabha as Direction 121, though it did not mention the LoP as such. The 1998 law concerning the facilities to be given to leaders and whips of recognised parties and groups, which fixes 55 as the minimum number of members required for recognition as a Parliamentary Party in the lower House, does not mention the LoP either. It is the 1977 statute on the LoP’s salary that does so. And that definition says the LoP shall be the leader of the party in opposition with the greatest numerical strength and “recognised as such” by the Speaker. While the statute itself is silent on it, the question arises if the Speaker, while recognising the LoP, needs to go by parliamentary precedent and Direction 121.
It needs to be noted that after the anti-defection law in the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution came into force, the system of recognising political parties in the legislature ended. Now, even a lone member elected on a party ticket is enough to form a legislature party. The constitutional provision will override any ‘Direction’, and it is debatable whether the Speaker’s decision on the recognition of a ‘Party’ or a ‘Group’ can any more be dependent on the 10 per cent norm. Further, there are recent laws that require the leader of the opposition to be part of selection panels for the Central Vigilance Commissioner, the Chief Information Commissioner, the Lokpal and the CBI Director. Some of the relevant Acts do say that where no person has been recognised as the LoP, the leader of the opposition party with the largest numerical strength may play that role. A recognised leader of the opposition is necessary for the proper and harmonious functioning of Parliament and for the working of several of the recently enacted laws. Legal ambiguity, the Congress party’s own flawed record and the BJP’s triumphalism over its rival’s poor electoral performance, should not stand in the way of an important parliamentary office being filled.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/debate-over-a-critical-office/article6258684.ece
29,7,2014,Keep talking peace,"The four-month extension of talks to >halt Tehran’s bid to make an atomic bomb is an indication of the positive if limited fallout from the historic late-2013 interim agreement. Beneath that was well-founded and deep scepticism — in the United States, Europe and even among the Israeli intelligence — of any resort to brute force as a means to restrain Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons. The five permanent members on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and Germany accordingly decided to ease sanctions worth $7 billion for six months. The readiness of the latter to relent on Iran’s continuation of uranium enrichment up to the level necessary for power generation was in sharp contrast to past UNSC resolutions requiring Tehran to freeze all enrichment. In return, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear programme and permit vigorous multilateral inspections of its facilities. Whereas U.S. President Barack Obama insisted that such relief was conditional and reversible, the Republican hard-liners and Israel decried the November agreement as a huge mistake. It is significant that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should have acknowledged in June that Iran was cooperating with investigations into the so-called Possible Military Dimensions to its nuclear programme. The IAEA had also observed that such inspections could necessarily proceed in a step-by-step manner — a possible case to extend the deadline for negotiations.
There is evidently no guarantee that the November deadline would yield the outcome that all parties envisage. Tehran has offered to freeze the country’s operations at current levels over the next three to seven years and thereafter resume uranium production as per its own requirements. Conversely, Washington and its partners insist that Iran dismantle major aspects of its uranium enrichment facilities and that current restrictions should continue for well over a decade. The real force behind these stated positions may also be influenced considerably by geopolitics in the Middle East. A foremost factor is the election last year of Iran’s moderate President Hassan Rouhani, which almost coincided with the interim nuclear agreement. A thaw in Britain’s relations with Tehran could prove to be a vital channel for the European powers and the U.S. to exert pressure on the radical Sunni Islamic groups in Iraq and Syria. These are factors with a strong potential to influence the course of nuclear talks. The road to long-term peace lies in eschewing hard positions; one that goes to the root of the global Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Nuclear weapon-states championing disarmament ought to tread a delicate line vis-à-vis potential aspirants in order to strengthen world peace.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/keep-talking-peace/article6258683.ece
30,7,2014,Indians in the line of fire,"The >killing of two Indian security guards by a Taliban suicide bomber during a recent attack on the Kabul airport, coupled with the successful evacuation from the line of fire of >40 nurses from Kerala, who were employed at a hospital in Tikrit in Iraq, highlights the growing entrapment of >Indians in war zones abroad. Anxiety continues to mount regarding the fate of 39 young men from Punjab who were taken captive near Mosul, following clashes between Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) jihadis and Iraqi security forces. In both cases Indians have become inadvertent victims of major geopolitical conflicts that are being fought under the cover of the Global War on Terror (GWOT) coupled with the doctrine of “regime change”. In the case of Afghanistan, the guards, both from Kerala, were employed by the private security firm DynCorp International, highlighting how Indians had been channelled into the controversial policy adopted by the United States to outsource military duties to “security contractors,” not all of whom are above board. The security firm Blackwater Security Consulting, now called Constellis Holdings, was caught in a firestorm after its employees shot and killed 17 civilians in Iraq. The situation may only turn grimmer, as the U.S. speeds up its troops withdrawal from Afghanistan.
The killings in Kabul of Ponnappan V. Kuttappan and Parambat Ravindran, also puts the spotlight on the underlying causes that push Indians into conflict zones. Horrific tales of innocent workers being duped by a nexus of unscrupulous agents and traffickers into high-risk combat areas are common. Yet, many migrate with foreknowledge of the dangers that might lie ahead. Relatively high salaries continue to be an attraction for people from the developing world, for a security guard in a U.S.-based security firm in Afghanistan can earn a monthly income equal to Rs. 1 lakh, far more than salaries that obtain at home. In Tikrit, most of the nurses seemed unwilling to return, till such time that the dangers to their lives became overwhelming. Despite the odds, the government is obliged to prevent the migration at least of those who are unknowingly transported into war zones, where they are virtually held in bondage because the fighting surrounding them restricts their movement. Indian embassies and consulates, in cooperation with the immigration authorities of host countries, must build a data bank on the entry and exit of Indian nationals, while also maintaining an early-warning oversight on the type of contracts that these individuals may enter into. In the long run, only sound employment and better working conditions at home can stem the flow of Indians into hazardous zones of conflict in faraway lands.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/indians-in-the-line-of-fire/article6261451.ece
30,7,2014,A cruel neglect,"The state, and individual schools, are not doing enough to protect children from physical abuse. The recent gruesome incidents in which three students were brutally >thrashed by the principal of a school in Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh, and equally despicable conduct by authorities elsewhere, are shocking reminders of this fact. We have to acknowledge this naked truth and also recognise that the onus of ensuring the safety and security of children on campuses is ultimately the responsibility of the teaching and non-teaching community. Else, we cannot confront the circumstances on the ground where violence committed by authorities against those under their care routinely goes unpunished. The Union Women and Child Development Ministry banned corporal punishment in 2010, following the tragic death of a ward who was subjected to humiliation by the principal of a reputed Kolkata boys’ school.
The many punitive measures listed in the guidelines are effective only on paper. Spanking, caning and such-like physical and verbal abuse injure and insult victims. Such acts largely go unnoticed and unchecked because the belief that these are effective means to discipline wards runs deep in the adult psyche. Incidents such as those in Kakinada, and in Kolkata — where a >three-year-old boy was virtually tortured by his care-giver — are but extreme examples which expose susceptibility to brutal behaviour. Publicising the guidelines among teachers, parents and children may influence positive behaviour. Training programmes ought to equip teachers with humane, practical and effective skills to deal with children within and outside classrooms. There is an underlying assumption that children require minimal academic and allied inputs and that these may be provided by almost anybody. The fact is that these must be age-appropriate and inculcated by skilled teachers.
The cause for indiscipline could also be far-from-stimulating teaching methods and an unhealthy teacher-pupil ratio. Most schools have also dispensed with science laboratory activity to demonstrate practicals. The profession has long ceased to attract the best of talent owing to poor remuneration in many private schools and adverse conditions of service. Cumulatively, the atmosphere is one where the energies of students are not channelised into constructive and meaningful avenues. These systemic limitations are the result of the low priority accorded to basic education by successive governments in India. With universal free and compulsory education a legal right now, there is reason to hope for qualitative improvements in conditions in schools and in learning outcomes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-cruel-neglect/article6261452.ece
31,7,2014,Tests of aptitude and attitude,"For the second successive year, a large number of civil services aspirants are >up in arms against the Civil Service Aptitude Test introduced by the Union Public Service Commission in the preliminary stage of the selection process. CSAT seeks to test a range of abilities and skills — including in terms of comprehension, interpersonal-communication, logical reasoning, decision-making and problem-solving and English language — all at Class X level proficiency. To argue that a screening test that involves questions from that level gives an unfair advantage to any one section appears surprising. It is also being argued that the pattern of testing puts those with a Hindi language background in a position of disadvantage — when in fact candidates are at liberty to take the test in either English or Hindi. In truth, when Hindi is allowed as a medium for the main examination, regional languages such as Tamil, Telugu and Gujarati are what face a disadvantage, because unless one has done the first degree and has written an examination in the language concerned, one cannot take the main examination in that language. Another argument is that CSAT favours students from science, management and engineering backgrounds to the detriment of those from the humanities, given the stress on logical reasoning skills. This does not stand to reason either. Any debate that puts forth language bias arguments and issues of equity and egalitarianism to downplay the need for a minimum level of basic skills, cannot but be flawed. Indisputably, administrators have to be able to fulfil requirements that make for a logical approach to day-to-day issues. By coming out on to the streets, are the protesters suggesting that they lack these essential life-skills, rather than show a willingness to take any test as a challenge of prowess and attitude?
The preliminary examination for 2014 is scheduled for August 24. Scrapping the test at this stage will prove disruptive for a substantial section of aspirants who have prepared for the annual cycle of testing in the current pattern, introduced in 2011. Introducing a new pattern without giving them a reasonable length of time to adjust to changes, will violate the principles of natural justice. However, complaints that the translation from English into Hindi of questions is done using a software in an automated process, which leaves ambiguities, need to be addressed immediately. A government-appointed committee that is looking into the demands for changes, should first be allowed to complete its task, and any reforms factored in over time.

31,7,2014,Difficult diplomatic decision,"The tragic loss of more than a couple of hundred European lives in the horrific >downing of Flight MH17 appears to have been the final provocation for the European Union and the United States to impose >sanctions on Russia for backing the Ukrainian separatists. But penalties against Moscow would cause considerable economic pain at home. The sweeping measures that Washington and Brussels have announced will bar hundreds of Russian companies from accessing European capital, and banks from raising funds in Europe. They are also intended to undercut Moscow’s technological capability to tap its vast natural resources. But the potential of the latest measures could well be limited by the disproportionately large pile of new Arctic, deep-sea and shale resources under Moscow’s control. The country holds the largest combined oil and gas reserves in the world, assets which Western economies are keen to exploit. An estimated 350,000 German jobs depend directly on trade between Berlin and Moscow of nearly €80 billion in 2013 according to the Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations, an influential German business lobby. It points out that 25,000 jobs in the country are at risk under the ongoing sanctions and that many more would be in jeopardy following the latest round. British and European energy companies have been cautious in endorsing the sanctions, even as they emphasise the extent of Russian dependence on their technology. Similarly, the embargo on European arms sales would be applicable only to future contracts.
The EU and the U.S. have insisted that the sanctions announced on Tuesday, described in European jargon as Tier III or red alert stage, do not amount to a return to the Cold War days. But the steps announced are the harshest since the collapse of the Soviet Union. These are a clear indication of the growing frustration across the Atlantic over Moscow’s alleged supply of arms to rebels in eastern Ukraine and the crash of the Malaysian aircraft in rebel-held territory. But the deep economic and trade ties built with Russia in the past two decades and the geopolitical imperatives of regional stability and security present difficult choices for the Western powers in fashioning a coherent response. In specific terms, it calls for the adoption of a calibrated approach, one that weighs the implications of economic penalties on the one hand, and addresses political and democratic sensibilities on the other. The task before EU leaders and their counterparts in national capitals is to garner political support among their populations at every stage. The domestic constituency cannot be taken for granted in matters of foreign policy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/difficult-diplomatic-decision/article6265081.ece
1,8,2014,Closure to a tragic episode,"The main feature of the Kumbakonam fire tragedy, in which 94 children died in the Tamil Nadu town in July 2004, was that it need not have happened. If only laws regulating schools had been enforced, and education officials had been more scrupulous in the discharge of their duties and stopped the private management from running three schools on the same premises and flouting every norm possible, the disaster could have been prevented. It is some consolation that after a much-delayed trial, a district court in Thanjavur has sentenced the school’s founder, >‘Pulavar’ Palanichamy to life imprisonment. He has been found guilty not only of culpable homicide on 94 counts, but also of forging documents that helped his school get undeserving approvals and upgrades in status from time to time. His wife and school correspondent, and the headmistress, along with staff involved in running the noon meal centre in the school, and some officials and staff in the district elementary education office have been given five-year prison terms. The verdict indicates that to some extent the State government had woken up to the real dimensions of the tragedy and did not see this as mere negligence on the part of a cook or her supervisor that led to a kitchen fire engulfing the whole building. Rather, an individual’s avarice, his treatment of education as a business for profiteering, his use of political clout to get things done, and pervasive corruption all made it an enormous crime.
The victims’ parents, who believed substantial justice lay in stringent prison terms for all those involved, were disappointed with the acquittal of 11 persons — three of them teachers and the rest officials — and say >justice has eluded them. They cannot be faulted for feeling that some others who were charged with being party to the flagrant violation of norms have got away. The verdict has come after 10 years, and the main culprit, ‘Pulavar’ Palanichamy, is an octogenarian now. His story contains a lesson for the State, the education sector and parents alike. His education entrepreneurship had been built successfully on deceit and forged documents. He had managed to run three schools in one campus with impunity, with no official holding him to account. A thatched shed, a dimly-lit, narrow stairway, and a collapsible gate that children may not be able to handle easily all indicated an obvious lack of elementary safety, but neither parents nor officials seemed to have taken the threat seriously. The verdict represents a closure of sorts, but >memories of the tragedy caused by greed, corruption and negligence will serve as a reminder that it is not laws alone, but their honest enforcement that can keep children safe in our schools.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/closure-to-a-tragic-episode/article6268751.ece
1,8,2014,Irrational prejudice,"That India still has no anti-discrimination law to protect the interests of HIV positive people shows how little the nation as a whole cares about them and how callous society is to their plight. As a result, discrimination against HIV positive people, including children, rears its ugly head time and again. The latest example is the case of >13 HIV positive orphans studying in a school in Rivona, Goa, being forced to leave school because of pressure from parents of other students; these children join the ranks of a couple of hundred others in India who have faced the same fate. Stigma and discrimination have affected and gravely impeded the battle against HIV. Besides anxiety and denial, the mortal fear of being stigmatised and discriminated against prevents many from seeking early testing and treatment. As a result, they not only fail to get timely intervention but also go about infecting others. Only about half of the 2.1 million people in India who are HIV positive are currently on antiretroviral treatment. It’s a shame that this situation prevails even 28 years after the first person with HIV was diagnosed in Chennai. Besides doing nothing to end discrimination, this incident amply demonstrates that the state has failed to raise awareness and dispel the myths and misconceptions about the routes of HIV transmission. The sexual route, transfusion of HIV infected blood, being pricked by a needle used on an HIV positive person, and from infected mother to child are the only modes of HIV transmission. Also, the fact that young children are infected with the virus turns the spotlight on our failing to eliminate transmission from pregnant mother to child. Preventing vertical transmission is one of the easiest ways to cut the incidence rate.
Refusal of school admission and expulsion from school are but only the beginning of a long journey of discrimination and negative social response that HIV positive people encounter. Eviction of HIV positive tenants from houses, refusal to employ such people and even ostracism from villages are not uncommon. But most alarming is the refusal by most private hospitals to admit HIV positive people, and the fear among many doctors and paramedics to treat them. These individuals who are supposed to be best informed seem to suffer from the same paranoia that has seized the common man. In stark contrast, doctors have no hesitation in treating those with hepatitis B and C, which are much more easily transmissible than HIV by the same routes. Hence, the compulsion to broad-base the Health Minister’s initiative to “mainstream AIDS awareness to reduce HIV infection rate” to also address the issue of discrimination cannot be overemphasised.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/irrational-prejudice/article6268753.ece
2,8,2014,"Religion, culture and values","Dinanath Batra seems to be a man with a mission: he is in a hurry to “ >Indianise” education. The convenor of the Shiksha Bachao Andolan Samiti has set up the Non-Governmental Education Commission as part of his programme, enlisting the support of educationists sympathetic to the Hindutva political project. That Mr. Batra enjoys the confidence of the Bharatiya Janata Party is clear. In schools in Gujarat, his books, steeped in medieval values and primitive science, are compulsory reading. In the name of Vedic Mathematics, Value Education, and Integral Humanism, he is seeking to push through an ahistorical, eclectic version of Indian nationalism that is seen as inseparable from Hindu civilisation. In ordinary times, Mr. Batra could have been dismissed as a maverick and a hyperactive Hindutva votary. But the problem is that he is very much a part of the ruling establishment. Especially after his success in getting Penguin to >withdraw Wendy Doniger’s book The Hindus: An Alternative History, Mr. Batra is recognised as a champion of Hinduisation of culture and history in the name of promoting Indianness. With support from several allied organisations of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the BJP, he seems intent on influencing government policy on education and culture. Not surprisingly, among the first to come out in his support was Ram Madhav, an RSS ideologue who joined the BJP recently. Mr. Batra, according to Mr. Madhav, was merely trying to ensure that Indian values were taught to schoolchildren.
Mr. Batra has a record of wanting to rewrite history in his own words. Among his targets were the National Council of Educational Research and Training for publishing textbooks that “distorted” history, and the essay of A.K. Ramanujan on the many versions of the Ramayana. In the eyes of the retired schoolteacher, culture, religion, nationalism, all these should be woven into school textbooks in a value-laden education. Indian culture is a proper subject for enquiry and teaching, but Mr. Batra has marked out a narrow religious territory with emphasis on the superficial and the outward symbols rather than on deep learning and enduring values. With a BJP-led government in power at the Centre, Mr. Batra, who was regarded highly by the Modi government in Gujarat, is now in a position where he can influence policymakers. The new BJP government at the Centre appears intent on bringing in educational reforms, but it would have to look beyond the likes of Mr. Batra in inculcating scientific temper and human values in schoolchildren. After all, there is nothing intrinsically Hindu or Indian about scientific facts and moral values. Moving along the path charted by Mr. Batra will be doing a disservice to the cause of education.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/religion-culture-and-values/article6272956.ece
2,8,2014,A time for change,"External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has concluded a >significant three day trip to Nepal, which has set the template for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Kathmandu in early August. Ms. Swaraj travelled to the Nepalese capital to reignite after a gap of >23 years, the Indo-Nepal Joint Commission, the appropriate forum for taking stock of the entire gamut of India-Nepal relations. She also engaged with all important segments of the political spectrum, including UCPN-Maoist chief and Leader of the Opposition Pushpa Kamal Dahal, apart from President Ram Baran Yadav and Prime Minister Sushil Koirala. These meetings across the political divide signal an inclusive approach pursued by India in its engagement with Nepal, ahead of the visit of the Prime Minister on August 3.
Mr. Modi’s visit follows a renewed thrust imparted by the new government to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), whose importance was underscored by the presence of its top leaders at Mr. Modi’s swearing-in ceremony. Of the SAARC members, the Prime Minister has already visited Bhutan, held talks with his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif, and is now ready to set foot in the Himalayan republic. Consistent with the NDA’s approach, there is a prominent economic, specifically energy dimension, to Mr. Modi’s visit. The joint communiqué issued at the end of Ms. Swaraj’s visit specified prioritisation of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project on the Mahakali river that borders India and Nepal. The political turf has also changed significantly ahead of Mr. Modi’s visit, following domestic changes within Nepal and Kathmandu’s growing ties with China. From an Indian perspective, nurturing hopes of a broadly zero-sum foreign policy by Nepal, would be unrealistic, if not naive, despite the special political and cultural ties shared by New Delhi and Kathmandu. The timing of Mr. Modi’s visit demands a recalibration, including the exploration of an imaginative India-Nepal-China trilateral partnership, in areas such as hydropower, with India as a possible end-user. In the long run, Nepal could also become a candidate to benefit from the recently formed BRICS bank, opening the prospects of convergence between SAARC and BRICS. During her visit, Ms. Swaraj suggested a relook of the 1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship, which critics, not necessarily with total conviction, have argued has symbolised India’s “big brother” attitude. However, by demonstrating generosity and statesmanship, India may win more friends in Nepal and in SAARC, which would set the platform for a deeper relationship with Asia, which is yet to find its independent political voice, despite doing so remarkably well in the economic domain.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-time-for-change/article6272960.ece
4,8,2014,Facilitation and food,"India is receiving a lot of flak for its stance at the > just-concluded meeting of the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) General Council in Geneva with epithets such as “deal-breaker” being hurled at it. The country is being accused of sabotaging the first real agreement forged by the trade body in 19 years on trade facilitation with its rigid stance on the issue of food subsidy. An agreement on trade facilitation (TFA), which is aimed at easing customs rules and simplifying procedures, was reached at the 9th Ministerial Round in Bali in December last year after the developed world agreed to find a permanent solution to the contentious issue of stockpiling of food grains by the developing countries by 2017. The >Bali Declaration also provided for a “peace clause” whereby countries such as India could continue with their food subsidy programmes until then. India, which supports the TFA, has questioned the current limit of “trade distorting” subsidy which is 10 per cent of the value of food grains output in a year with the base year for prices set at 1986-88. Its position is that the limit does not account for inflation and currency depreciation and the base year needs to be reset to a later period. This is a fair argument as it concerns the critical issue of food security for a country that is home to a quarter of the world’s hungry.
The passage of the >Food Security Act means that the subsidy bill will bloat in the coming years and the country cannot afford to be constricted by limits that are based on flawed calculations. Politically speaking, no government can afford to be seen as compromising either the interests of the 270 million people who live below the poverty line or its farmers, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also obviously conscious that he will be facing elections in two crucial States in the next few months. The main grouse India has is that there has been little forward movement on discussing the issue since the Bali meeting even as much vigour has been exhibited in finalising the TFA. >India’s statement at Geneva clearly highlights that despite repeated requests, discussions on public stockholding of food grains never started. The strategy to use the TFA as a lever to get an agreement on the food subsidy issue was probably born out of the assessment that it would be difficult to get the developed world back to the negotiating table once the TFA was signed. Clearly, both sides are guilty of brinkmanship. Yet, all is not lost. India has signalled that it is willing to return to the table and has suggested a permanent “peace clause” until a final understanding on subsidy is reached. Extending the TFA deadline by another six months will not cause harm, especially if it leads to a final agreement on all issues.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/facilitation-and-food/article6277605.ece
4,8,2014,Rape and reality,"The gulf between statistics and substance is not easily bridged. The number of rape cases registered in the country may conceal the reality in two significant ways. First, only a small proportion of the rapes are reported at all. Secondly, a significant number of rape cases relate to consensual sex but have been criminalised by circumstances. > The Hindu’s six-month investigation into cases of sexual assault in Delhi has revealed that f >our of ten cases arose out of complaints by parents of girls who had eloped with boys. Another 25 per cent involved breaches of promise by men that they would marry their partners. And rape as it is conventionally understood, either by strangers or those known to victims in their family or neighbourhood, was seen only in 162 out of 583 cases registered in Delhi in 2013. Such cases resulted in a >higher rate of conviction. The association of rape in the popular imagination with predators lurking in dark lanes to prey on vulnerable women has led to a general belief that better policing and more stringent laws will be the solution. While it is entirely appropriate that women’s safety is given high priority, it is equally important to identify the strands of patriarchy discernible in the resort to complaints of rape at the instance of parents who disapprove of relationships, especially if these are inter-caste or inter-religious. If denial of freedom of choice to women in love and marriage is one issue, the disavowal of women’s agency is another.
Accounts gathered from complainants, lawyers and judges reveal that the protestations of women that they had consented to the act or eloped with the accused are disregarded so that provisions relating to statutory rape and abduction can be invoked to appease angry parents. Conviction is indeed inevitable if the girls involved are below the statutory age of consent. While some sympathetic judges used to exercise their discretion to hand down mild sentences, the much-strengthened penal law applicable since last year has made longer prison terms inevitable for statutory rape. This places a question mark on the wisdom of recent legislation raising the age of consent from 16 to 18, thereby criminalising teenage sexual activity. There is no balancing provision to distinguish sexual abuse of a minor, which ought to be dealt with sternly, from consensual sex between couples of a proximate age group. While making the country safer for women, society must move away from the inherent patriarchy behind the phenomenon. That means greater inter-generational dialogue and display of sensitivity by police officers and judges. >Scripted FIRs, mechanical resort to rape provisions and pressure on women to disown relationships are not the way.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rape-and-reality/article6277606.ece
5,8,2014,"For India, a mixed bag","The just-concluded >Commonwealth Games in Glasgow featured a few ‘highs’ for India, but unfortunately it also marked some new ‘lows’ for the country. While the gold medal-winning feats of >discus thrower Vikas Gowda and >badminton player Parupalli Kashyap signalled breakthroughs in these events after several decades, the news that broke on the concluding day, of >two Indian officials being arrested, was disgusting and deplorable. From an overall perspective, India slumped, not unexpectedly, to the fifth place in the medals tally from its second spot in the New Delhi Games though there were handsome contributions from the shooters, wrestlers and weightlifters. Four years ago, even as our athletes punched above their level >to post a record tally of 101 medals, the sports administrators had faced corruption charges that startled the country. Today, following the modest success by the Indian contingent, the sports administrators are once again the butt of ridicule. There is a need for the Union Government to enforce discipline among sports administrators, and for the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to view the alleged criminal conduct of its secretary-general seriously. The process of reforms in the IOA, enforced by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) last year, with backing from the Union Government, could be frittered away by misconduct of officials.
England, following its success in the 2012 London Olympics, predictably displaced Australia from its perch at the top of the medals tally gathering 174 medals in all, 58 of them gold. Australia, which had come third in 1986 and topped since then, had only 49 gold out of a total of 137. Canada and Scotland came third and fourth. Obviously, the ‘home advantage’ that saw India perform beyond expectations in the New Delhi Games was in Glasgow lost to the contingent. Pertinently, some of the shooting and wrestling events in which India dominated in Delhi were scrapped, not to speak of the >exclusion of archery and tennis from the programme, accounting for 16 of India’s gold collection in 2010. Still it was disappointing to note that no gold medal accrued for India from boxing this time and the haul in shooting was reduced. The three medallists apart, our track and field athletes fared poorly. The total gold for India this time, at 15, was the poorest since 1998 when it was seven. It was 38 in Delhi, 22 in 2006 and 30 in 2002. The preparations might have suffered a little this year for want of adequate resources and because of delayed planning. Liberal funding for foreign exposure, strict adherence to selection standards and a sense of discipline and commitment among athletes, coaches and administrators might help India fare better in the Incheon Asian Games next month.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-hindu-editorial-for-india-a-mixed-bag/article6281130.ece
5,8,2014,Cautious outlook,"A positive agrarian outlook for the next decade cannot allow any quarter for complacency in a nation that is home to the world's largest number of farmers, as also the largest number of people who face food insecurity. This would be a fairer reading of >Agricultural Outlook 2014-2023, a joint report of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Food and Agriculture Organization, with a special feature on India. The projection is for sustained production and consumption of agricultural commodities in the country, leading to increases in per capita availability during the next 10 years, while resource pressures may halt absolute growth rates. Coinciding with this phase more or less is India’s emergence as a leading exporter of agricultural products, with its trade surplus growing six-fold between 2000 and 2013 to $22 billion. All of this is a tacit reference to the rise in public investment in agriculture, massive increase in credit flows and upgradation of rural infrastructure, consequent to important corrective measures envisaged in the Mid-Term Appraisal of the Tenth Five-Year Plan. The OECD-FAO report also notes the >substantive role of India’s wide-ranging subsidies and support prices for foodgrains — an issue that has acquired immense currency in the wake of New Delhi’s stance at the World Trade Organization negotiations.
No less relevant is the allusion to a shift to diets rich in protein, sugar and fats thanks to rising incomes. The five per cent additional excise levy on aerated drinks announced in the budget should be backed by aggressive public campaigns to raise awareness of the health risks associated with the consumption of fast food, especially among poor communities. The awareness created by the ongoing public interest litigation petition in the Delhi High Court seeking a ban on these products in schools could set a critical standard nation-wide and save future generations from a rising epidemic. Whereas the global forecast for the continuation of the current run of lower prices of cereals over the short term is encouraging, prices are expected to stay higher than they were before the 2007-08 global meltdown. The demand for animal feed and biofuels would similarly exert pressure on foodgrain availability for human consumption at affordable prices. The developing countries are said to account for 75 per cent of additional agricultural output over the next decade. The FAO estimates that growth in agriculture is five times more effective in reducing poverty than growth in any other sector. Therein lies a message for the region’s political leadership and for global stability in general. The food riots of the recent past in parts of the world ought not to return ever again.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-hindu-editorial-cautious-outlook/article6281132.ece
6,8,2014,Waiting for growth to pick up,"The Reserve Bank of India’s > third bi-monthly policy statement for 2014-15 has been on entirely expected lines. The policy repo rate has remained unchanged at 8 per cent. Consequently, there is no change in the rates which are pegged to it — the reverse repo stays at 7 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the bank rate both continue to remain at 9 per cent. There has been no change in the CRR. Among monetary and liquidity measures, the only change of note — even this was anticipated — has been the reduction in the statutory liquidity ratio by 0.50 percentage points to 22 per cent. In the June bi-monthly statement, the SLR was reduced to 22.5 per cent. There are at least two reasons why the successive reductions in the SLR are significant. According to the RBI, the reduction in June was in anticipation of a recovery in economic activity. The Union Budget for 2014-15 which was presented subsequently renewed the government’s commitment to the medium-term fiscal consolidation road map. It also stuck to the interim budget’s fiscal deficit target of 4.1 per cent for the year. This opens up more avenues for bank lending to productive sectors of the economy as growth picks up. The more recent cut in the SLR is thus a demonstration of a welcome resolve on the part of monetary and fiscal authorities to work in tandem to achieve policy goals.
Reserve Bank Governor >Raghuram Rajan’s statement that the RBI is looking at newer avenues to support the real economy instead of depending on the “blunt” repo rate is pertinent. The reductions in the SLR are also seen as a move to converge towards global norms for statutory pre-emptions in banks. However, in India over the near term at least, the increased leeway that banks have may not translate into higher credit disbursements. Leading banks have invested more in SLR securities than what they are required to. Growth prospects have improved modestly. The deficit in the monsoons has narrowed recently and there has been a pickup in industrial activity. The ongoing fiscal consolidation can release resources for the private sector. Notwithstanding these and other favourable developments, the RBI has retained its April GDP growth forecast for the year at 5.5 per cent in a broad range of 5 to 6 per cent. The RBI remains committed to the disinflationary path of taking CPI inflation to 8 per cent by January 2015 and to 6 per cent a year later. The nearer term target looks achievable now, but it is critical to persist with the downward path over the medium term. Both growth and inflation are subject to many risks and monetary policy needs to adapt nimbly to the changing situation. For now, the Reserve Bank’s cautious approach is certainly justified.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/waiting-for-growth-to-pick-up/article6284747.ece
6,8,2014,A weak El Niño and the monsoon,"This year, even before the monsoon began there were concerns about how it might fare. The waters of the tropical Pacific Ocean had begun warming ominously. Moreover, there was a great deal of even warmer water below the ocean surface, suggesting that a big El Niño could be brewing. The development of such an event, with surface waters of the equatorial Pacific growing warmer, could well take a toll on the monsoon. As if to vindicate the gloomy prognostications, the monsoon got off to a bad start. Rain set in over Kerala five days late and its progress northwards to cover the rest of the country was unusually tardy. The rainfall deficit soared, and India received about 43 per cent less rain than it should normally in June. The poor rains continued into early July as well. Then the heavens opened and the second half of the month saw bountiful rains across much of the country. Consequently, the July rains were only about 10 per cent below average. Nevertheless, the first half of the monsoon ended with a cumulative rainfall deficit of about 22 per cent. That is still a substantial shortfall, and rainfall records for over a century indicate that the odds favour the monsoon ending in a drought (which atmospheric scientists typically define as a season with a rainfall deficit of more than 10 per cent).
The seasonal deficit this year could depend on how conditions in the Pacific evolve. Contrary to earlier expectations, a massive warming event now looks improbable. The change in wind patterns that typically accompany a developing El Niño and aid its growth has not hitherto occurred. Indeed, in the central Pacific, the region that has the greatest impact on monsoon rains over India, the waters have recently cooled to a slightly below average level. But the eastern Pacific remains warmer than usual and current forecasts continue to indicate that an El Niño, albeit probably only a weak one, is likely to develop later this year. An El Niño often leads to an early withdrawal of the monsoon and reduces the rainfall received in September. The extent to which that happens is likely to have a considerable impact on this year’s monsoon deficit, given the substantial shortfall from the first half of the season. A big deficit at the end of the season, however, looks unlikely at this stage. Even so, the poor rains in June and July have already affected agricultural operations, with the area under kharif crops falling by about 14 per cent when compared to last year. This year, given apprehensions of a drought that an El Niño might produce, the government has already initiated a number of measures to deal with such a situation. Being prepared for the worst must continue to be the motto.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-weak-el-nio-and-the-monsoon/article6284750.ece
13,8,2014,The Javelin challenge,"The irony in >India-United States relations is that all the right things are said about them, and all the wrong things done. So while the two countries are said to be bound by virtue of being “the world’s largest democracy and the world’s oldest democracy,” a line unfailingly included in the speech of every visiting dignitary from the U.S., the reality is a big drift in bilateral ties. As the time nears for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the White House in September, there is an apparent effort to ensure that his talks with President Barack Obama are productive. The pressure has grown on Washington to show it wants to take bilateral ties forward under Prime Minister Modi, who it had blacklisted while he was Gujarat Chief Minister over the 2002 riots. The latest endeavour came from U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who arrived in New Delhi shortly after Secretary of State John Kerry. After his meetings with Mr. Modi, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Finance and Defence Minister Arun Jaitley, Mr. Hagel pronounced himself convinced that the two sides “can transform our potential into results.” The main focus of his meetings was cooperation in the defence sector. India is the world’s largest importer of arms, and also among the biggest buyers of U.S. materiel. Since 2008, New Delhi has bought U.S. defence equipment worth nearly $10 billion and has been pushing for transfer of technology to manufacture those weapons here. Mr. Hagel appeared to concur, saying the way to transform defence ties would be to move “from simply buying and selling to co-production, co-development, and freer exchange of technology.”
Declarations apart, the U.S. has a reputation for not being very reliable on precisely this aspect of its military partnerships. No agreements were announced during Mr. Hagel’s visit. The two sides, however, agreed to activate their stillborn 2012 Defense Trade and Technology Initiative. Mr. Hagel is said to have discussed a “pilot plan” to co-produce and co-develop the Javelin anti-tank missile, manufactured by Raytheon-Lockheed Martin. A team from the company had visited India some years ago, but drew the line at transferring technology to enable the system to be built locally. It is unclear if New Delhi’s recent decision to increase the FDI limit in defence production from 26 to 49 per cent will be a game-changer. The limited hike has not received an effusive welcome from weapons contractors. A deal on the Javelin would be far dearer than the Spike, the Israeli alternative the Army has extensively tested and liked. Still, Mr. Hagel’s offer should be put to the test, to check if the U.S. is serious about taking its military partnership with India to a higher level.

13,8,2014,Space history made,"After travelling a distance of 6.4 billion kilometres since it was launched in March 2004, >Rosetta made space history on August 6 when it became the first spacecraft to rendezvous with a comet — 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, a 4.5-km-long object. The craft, which is at an altitude of about 100 km, will in the next couple of months move closer to 67P till it is about 4 km above its surface. At this altitude, the next biggest challenge will be to ensure that the lander, Philae, to be airdropped from Rosetta, lands safely on the comet. The identification of a smooth landing site to deploy the lander in November was not done in advance as little information was available about the nature of the terrain. Images collected by the craft from a distance of 285 km from the comet have suggested a ragged surface marked by “sharp-edged structures” with precipitous cliffs. It remains to be seen if the “smooth” areas seen from that height are indeed smooth when better-resolution pictures become available as the Rosetta gets closer. Unlike the Curiosity rover that is moving freely on Mars, Philae, with an array of instruments, would be anchored to the surface. Rosetta has already changed our understanding of 67P’s shape — it appears as a “double-lobed structure” with a neck connecting the two. It could have either been formed by the fusion of two comets or by differential erosion at the spot that now forms the neck.
Comets are primitive objects formed from debris left over when the Solar System was formed around 4.6 billion years ago. They retain primordial secrets — the gas, dust and organic molecules since they were created. Hence, information garnered from 67P can unlock many secrets about the birth and evolution of the Solar System and the origin of water and life on Earth. It is believed that comets had seeded Earth with water and carbon-containing molecules, particularly amino acids that are the building blocks of life. By studying materials lying 20 cm below the comet’s surface, Philae is expected to provide vital information about organic materials that are securely locked and cannot be studied from Earth. Since life on earth is comprised exclusively of left-handed amino acids, the “predominance” of such molecules in 67P would strengthen the possibility of comets’ role in seeding life on the planet of humans. Another important study is the assessment of the ratio of normal to heavy water (where one of the two normal hydrogen atoms has been replaced by the heavy hydrogen isotope deuterium) to ascertain if the comet’s ice signature matches that of water on Earth. A few years ago, the Hartley 2 comet was found to have the same signature as water; none of the other comets studied before had a similar match.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/space-history-made/article6309531.ece
14,8,2014,Ill-advised on Pakistan,"Who is the real Narendra Modi? The one that reached out to Islamabad in the first flush of his election victory, inviting Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for his oath-taking, and exchanging shawls and sarees with him for their mothers? Or the one that on Tuesday sneered that Pakistan “has lost the ability to fight a conventional war, but continues to engage in the proxy war of terrorism”? What Prime Minister Modi said is not factually wrong. Even in Pakistan there is acknowledgement that the ISI unleashed militant groups against India. But if the intention of the Modi government is to engage a problematic neighbour in talks, as conveyed by the decision only weeks ago to resume official-level dialogue, making deliberately provocative statements is not a good way to kick off. Political leaders do tend to tailor their speeches to their audience, and the Prime Minister’s remark came during an interaction with soldiers at Leh. Mr. Sharif conceivably might have made a similarly provocative remark to a similar audience on the other side. Except that he did not. Addressing a conference on national security last week, where the audience included Army chief General Raheel Sharif, ISI boss Lt. Gen. Zaheerul Islam, and other members of Pakistan’s security and civilian establishment, Mr. Sharif expressed regret that his country did not have good ties with India and said it was time to work towards achieving that.
Common sense demands that India should be doing whatever it can diplomatically to strengthen Mr. Sharif’s hands, or at the very least do or say nothing that will serve to undermine him. Mr. Modi could not have been unaware that even as he spoke in Ladakh, some 400 km across the border, in Islamabad, the Pakistan Prime Minister was preparing for a battle for his government’s survival. The cleric-turned-political adventurer Tahir ul Qadri, and cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan have joined hands and vowed to unseat Mr. Sharif. The world over, the democratically accepted way to do this is through elections. But both Mr. Qadri and Mr. Khan want instant gratification. They plan to lead a march on the Pakistani capital from Lahore along with their followers on August 14, Independence Day, and lay siege to the city until Mr. Sharif steps down. With the government locking down the capital and all roads leading to it, and the possibility of a law and order breakdown looming large, the Pakistan military is said to be weighing its options. It has no love lost for Mr. Sharif, and distrusts him particularly because he wants good relations with India. Mr. Modi’s statement can only reinforce a view in Pakistan that their Prime Minister is bending over backwards to please New Delhi, and will strengthen those seeking to dislodge him. Eventually, that can only go against the normalisation of India-Pakistan relations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/illadvised-on-pakistan/article6313922.ece
14,8,2014,Hangover of a bitter struggle,"That differences and disagreements will mark Telangana-Andhra Pradesh relations seem to have been written into the very conditions and circumstances of their coming into being. The two States have been on a collision course on all issues of shared interest ever since the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh. Concerns relating to sharing of resources and distribution of assets and liabilities were addressed in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, but regional chauvinism and competitive politics in both States have found new contentious issues to feed upon, and reopened old, settled disputes. Given that Hyderabad is to be the shared capital for 10 years, the Act grants special powers to the Governor to ensure law and order in the city. This was an extraordinary solution demanded by an extraordinary situation, and was worked into the Act that paved the way for Telangana. But Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and his Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) have been complaining of encroachment on the powers of the State. True, law and order is a State subject, but in the context of the hostilities between the governments of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, and Hyderabad being the joint capital, vesting special powers in the Governor seemed logical enough. At the time the Act was passed, the TRS must have considered the special powers for the Governor to be a minor irritant in the process of creation of Telangana. But having been voted to power, the party seems intent on making this a Centre-States issue, though all that the Centre has done now is to issue an advisory on the basis of the Act.
But the advisory over the law and order powers of the Governor is only the latest point of confrontation between the two governments. Telangana’s decision to undertake a survey of all households to eliminate those deemed ineligible for welfare benefits was also a concern in Andhra Pradesh. The fear was that it would be used to determine the ‘nativity’ of people and exclude from government schemes those seen as belonging to coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema. Earlier, the Telangana government scrapped the fee reimbursement scheme for colleges with a view to extending financial assistance to only those students whose parents were residents of Telangana as on November 1, 1956, the date a unified Andhra Pradesh was formed. While the TRS won the Assembly election on the strength of its agitation for Telangana, it cannot hope to continue to get political purchase on a regional chauvinistic plank. The governments of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh need to quickly get on with governance and concentrate on the livelihood concerns of their people.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/hangover-of-a-bitter-struggle/article6313924.ece
15,8,2014,Tentative recovery,"The economic data released this week send out mixed signals. While wholesale price inflation showed a decline at 5.19 per cent in July, consumer price inflation, which is the Reserve Bank of India’s benchmark, inched up to 7.96 per cent. Industrial growth slowed down in June compared to May. The rise in retail inflation was driven by higher food prices, mainly of vegetables and fruits. With the monsoon having made a weak start, vegetable prices shot up by 16.88 per cent in July, biting into the wallets of consumers. The present level of retail inflation is very close to the RBI’s target of 8 per cent by January 2015. The good news, though, is that it is not expected to increase further from here — an assessment based on the monsoon’s revival over the last few weeks, and the measures that the Centre has taken to combat rising food prices. The latest update from the India Meteorological Department predicts a normal monsoon in the remaining days of August and September with the possibility of a drought ruled out. Steps taken by the Centre, such as raising the minimum export prices of onions and potatoes, making hoarding a non-bailable offence, releasing foodgrains from overflowing granaries, and urging States to make changes in the APMC Act to deter middlemen, are expected to ease supply-side constraints.
Meanwhile, industrial output slid to 3.4 per cent in June from 4.7 per cent in May but it has to be seen in context. Despite the lower June figures, industrial growth in the first quarter at 3.4 per cent is a large improvement over the 1 per cent fall seen in the same period last year and the minus-0.7 per cent growth in the January-March quarter. Besides, the important segment of capital goods has rebounded in June indicating that the investment cycle has possibly begun. Only the other day, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan had expressed worries on this count, pointing out how despite two reductions in the statutory liquidity ratio commercial lending by banks had failed to pick up, indicating a lack of appetite for investment by the corporate sector. It is possible that companies are unwilling to commit investments in fresh capacity until the existing slack is fully accounted for. The RBI’s Industrial Outlook Survey of 1,293 manufacturing companies, done in May-June 2014, shows an increase in optimism and an expectation of improvement in business conditions in the second quarter of this fiscal. Similarly, the latest Consumer Confidence Survey done by the central bank shows that there are higher expectations of an increase in employment and wages. These are all clearly positive signals, but for growth to get on the fast lane we need to await the return of the “animal spirits” in the corporate sector — which seems to be absent at this point in time.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tentative-recovery/article6318988.ece
15,8,2014,Doing more on climate,"Climate change talks are poised at a critical stage before the Conference of Parties meets in Paris in 2015 to finalise a new treaty, and India’s alliances with developing countries assume significance at this point. Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar has been stressing on funds from the first world for the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and also on scaling up targets in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and its quick ratification. In line with this, >the recent BASIC (Brazil South Africa India China) ministerial meeting has once again called on the developed countries to walk the talk on funding and emission cuts, but going by past experience some advanced countries are not going to abide by this. Already Japan and Australia have scaled back their promises on emission cuts, and funds for technology transfer, adaptation and mitigation are nowhere in sight. The BASIC meet did not throw up any new thought or action plan and reiterated what the developing countries have tried to do for the last 20 years. As a pressure bloc, BASIC despite its cloak of togetherness seems a divided house, and it is perceived by some to be losing its significance in terms of climate talks. Differences in BASIC on various issues have prompted India to side more strongly with yet another group called the Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDCs), which is expected to meet soon.
While countries such as the United States are not even signatories to the Kyoto Protocol, there is a real danger that more first world nations will renege on their historical responsibility to fund capacity-building and other critical measures in the developing countries vis-à-vis climate change. Now more than ever, there is a need for India to emphasise along with other countries the need for strong commitments on emission reduction and operationalising the GCF. India has already announced a voluntary mitigation goal of reducing the emissions intensity of its GDP by 20-25 per cent over 2005 levels by 2020, but it also needs to review its commitments and, like the rest of the world, do more. The BASIC meet stressed that the 2015 outcome in Paris should be comprehensive, balanced, equitable and fair — but so far nothing has been fair in the climate negotiations. One of the BASIC countries, China, has emerged as a major emitter, and despite its emphasis on alternative energy and mitigation it still relies heavily on coal for energy. With little commitment to emission cuts or funding adaptation and technology transfer in the poorer countries, the world is moving towards a new climate treaty which seems fraught with contention already. In this light, India’s role and alliances, and its emphasis on equity and common but differentiated responsibilities, could be a game-changer.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/doing-more-on-climate/article6318991.ece
16,8,2014,Offering hope without hype,"Small things can make for big changes. In his first Independence Day address to the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid almost as much emphasis on a dirt-free India as on a Digital India. Instead of offering big-ticket reforms at one stroke, he promised changes in governance, a sharper and swifter government in the place of a bureaucratic establishment pulling in different directions. The philosophy underpinning his speech seemed to be that small steps taken quickly and taken across the country could have a greater impact than big schemes implemented slowly and patchily. “Just imagine, if 125 crore countrymen take a step forward, the country will move 125 crore steps forward,” he said, while offering to work harder than everyone else as India’s “prime servant”. Within one year, the Prime Minister intended to ensure separate toilets for girls and boys in all schools in the country. While talking of his dream of a Digital India, and of Information Technology uniting the country and the people, he articulated the need to make India’s villages and towns free of dirt. With good governance and development as his buzzwords for progress, he promised to make his government an organic unit for fulfilling the aspirations of the people. If there was one big scheme, it was the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, aimed at financial inclusion that would link the poor of the country with a bank account, and provide them a debit card and insurance cover worth Rs.1 lakh. This was part of Mr. Modi’s efforts to make technology work for the poor. If Jan Dhan Yojana was the big new scheme, the big reform was the dismantling of the Planning Commission, seen as a remnant of the Nehruvian, socialist model of governance. The change is intended to be drastic: the new institution that would replace the Planning Commission would have a new body, a new soul and a new outlook.
However, despite this push for change, Mr. Modi did not belittle the achievements of his predecessors, and he sought to recognise the contribution of all previous prime ministers and past governments to the growth of the country since Independence. Also, Mr. Modi seemed keen to move forward on the basis of consensus rather than on functioning on the basis of his party’s majority in Parliament. Even for those who feared his divisive agenda, Mr. Modi had some words of reassurance: he pointedly referred to the “poison” of casteism and communalism, which, he said, was a hindrance to progress. From the ramparts of the Red Fort, Mr. Modi certainly appeared more inclusive than he was on his campaign. If his speech, shorn of hype but full of hope, is any indication, Mr. Modi looks ready to make the transition from a skilled political orator to an able administrator.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/offering-hope-without-hype/article6321754.ece
16,8,2014,Unshackling Prasar Bharati,"No government has so far shown the will to grant full financial and administrative autonomy to Prasar Bharati, which was created by law in 1997. On paper an autonomous organisation, it largely remains a subordinate office of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The question of Prasar Bharati’s autonomy has surfaced again, with its Chief Executive Officer, Jawahar Sircar, writing to the Ministry protesting against the broadcaster having little say in its own functioning. He has contended that his suggestions on the posting and transfer of Indian Information Service officers in the news divisions of Akashvani and Doordarshan have been ignored. With electronic media organisations expanding exponentially in recent years, it may sound strange that there should be any debate now on the autonomy of public broadcasters in the country. However, it cannot be denied that public service broadcasting remains relevant because All India Radio and Doordarshan have the widest geographical spread in terms of coverage. To a large extent, its radio and television wings have been served by competent professionals, but the impression of government control remains strong. Their cultural programmes have been of high quality but news programming, though free of sensationalism, is often seen as dull and hackneyed.
Conferring administrative autonomy in such a manner that its professional head has the final authority in the recruitment and deployment of personnel in the news division will have to be a key aspect of reforming the institution. Several committees have looked into aspects of Prasar Bharati’s autonomy, but there has been very little headway in putting into practice the ideal of keeping the government at arm’s length. The first step, as noted by the latest panel, the Sam Pitroda Committee, is to start seeing Prasar Bharati as a ‘public broadcaster’ rather than as a government broadcaster. It should be run as a professionally managed body, and its oversight handed over, as the panel recommended, to a dedicated parliamentary committee. The corporation is now monitored by the parliamentary committee on Information Technology. Further, it has often been noted that the vast assets owned by AIR and Doordarshan are still under government control and it is time these were transferred to Prasar Bharati. The new government would do well to deliver on its intention to strengthen its editorial independence as well as its accountability on the lines of globally renowned public broadcasters. Amidst the changing dynamics of information dissemination and consumption, public media institutions should not suffer from bureaucratic control, but instead have infusion of skills, technology and autonomy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unshackling-prasar-bharati/article6321755.ece
18,8,2014,The right remedy?,"Parliament has spoken. By landmark legislation, it has amended the procedure by which members of the superior judiciary are appointed in India, and ended the primacy that the judiciary had accorded to itself in the appointment process. The idea, the government says, is to broad-base the appointment of judges in the Supreme Court and the various High Courts with participation from the judiciary and the executive and from among eminent persons to ensure greater transparency, accountability and objectivity in the process. The legislative venture is undoubtedly a legitimate exercise as there is wide support for the view that the time has come to replace the opaque collegium system with a transparent mechanism. However, the moot question is whether in the process any injury has been caused to the judicial limb. On the face of it, with an enabling amendment to the Constitution, and a law setting up the National Judicial Appointments Commission, the new procedure seems to have been set. There is apparent parity between judicial nominees (the Chief Justice of India and two senior-most Judges) and executive representatives (the Law Minister and two eminent persons chosen by a panel comprising the CJI, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition) in the six-member NJAC. However, any two members can veto any decision. While the veto could act as a restraint on a decision being pushed through by one bloc, it could be seen as undermining the judicial members' opinion. Also, the CJI can be outvoted by the political class when it comes to choosing the ‘eminent persons’.
Several significant aspects — the criteria of suitability of judges, the conditions for selection, and procedures on consultation with other judges and eminent advocates, and the manner of eliciting the views of the Governor and Chief Minister — have been left to regulations to be framed by the Commission. Giving the power to amend these regulations to a panel that will itself keep changing from time to time instead of being cast in law may undermine judicial independence, as the norms could be tweaked for reasons of expediency. And it hardly needs to be emphasised that the independence of the judiciary is part of the basic structure of the Constitution. The advisability of enacting the NJAC Act before the Constitution Amendment has received the requisite ratification from half the State legislatures is also under question. If the legislation fails judicial scrutiny, the question will arise whether the government was too hasty in putting together the bills. Perhaps, a process of broader consultation could have helped the cause better. Ultimately, there should be a healthy balance between having a more participative system and preserving an independent judiciary.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/national-judicial-appointments-commission-the-right-remedy/article6326266.ece
18,8,2014,Growth with dignity,"In a powerful oration titled “The Danger of a Single Story”, Nigerian writer Chimamanda Adichie deplores the damage wrought by common stereotypes of Africa. These are, in her view, deeply destructive of the collective psyche, not mere over-simplifications or misrepresentations of reality. Surely, the influence of the dominant narrative — of a land of catastrophes, conflicts, grinding poverty and, above all, of Africa as one nation rather than a continent of many countries — is already on the wane. Some of these broad questions found expression in the first summit of the United States and leaders from 50 countries of Africa recently to harness the mutual benefits of trade. Africa is among the regions that have come to be recognised for the rapid economic strides and is home to six of the 10 fastest growing countries in the world. China and India have over the past decade or so tapped into the continent’s huge natural wealth through investments in extractive industries, agriculture and infrastructure projects. Whereas the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation is the most visible symbol of Beijing’s engagement, the U.S. touts its own Power Africa initiative to boost investments in the energy sector. But China’s expressed intent to collaborate with the U.S. on mega-infrastructure projects in the region presents new dilemmas for Washington, which has for a while remained more circumspect with regard to support for big dams. But Beijing’s expanding financial clout in many parts of the developing world after the global meltdown could force a rethink of such a stance.
African leaders have raised questions concerning transparency and accountability in the operations of Chinese corporations. They have equally been peeved at the U.S. administration, which expects their governments to be more accountable with regard to compliance with human rights norms, a position Beijing derides as hypocritical. The large-scale acquisition of Africa’s fertile agricultural land by overseas investors in the wake of spikes in foodgrain prices added to the anxieties over the implications for domestic markets. Against this complex backdrop, Washington has sought to make a pitch for its own investments in technology and allied sectors by presenting them as potentially more equitable and sustainable ventures. The U.S. also views as being in its favour the absence of post-colonial resentments that tend to mar Africa’s ties with European nations. Hopes are pinned on the extension next year of the 2000 Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which now allows duty-free access to lucrative U.S. markets for textiles and petrochemical products. The U.S. has much catching up to do in Africa, where it trades less than it did before the 2007 crisis.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Growth-with-dignity/article11204234.ece
19,8,2014,An ambitious plan for inclusion,"The Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana, a major socio-economic initiative of the National Democratic Alliance government, was announced by the Prime Minister in his Independence Day speech. It is an ambitious attempt at extending formal financial services in a country where only 58.7 per cent of an estimated 24.67 crore households avail themselves of banking services. Despite several steps taken by many governments over the years, financial inclusion has remained elusive. In rural areas 44 per cent of the households and in urban areas 33 per cent of them still do not have a bank account. The NDA government has brought a degree of urgency to the scheme of financial inclusion. A few details of the government’s action plan figured in the budget speech. A Comprehensive Financial Inclusion Plan (CFIP) envisaging coverage of excluded households has been drawn up and is expected to be rolled out under the nomenclature. In its first phase, the Jan-Dhan Yojana will endeavour to provide universal access to all the beneficiaries through sub-service areas (SSA), each of them consisting of 100-150 families in a cluster of villages. Each SSA will be serviced by a business correspondent, who is now being given a pivotal role in facilitating account opening and ensuring smooth bank operations. Unlike in previous action plans, the Jan-Dhan Yojana will have as its focus households rather than geographical areas.
The other important innovation is in extending need-based credit facilities to the new account holders upon their fulfilling certain conditions. A smart card — the Ru Pay card — will be issued. Using this it should be possible for customers to operate their accounts without any external help. This would be one of the most visible manifestations of technology as a tool to further inclusion, others being money transfers through mobile telephones, e-KYCs and cash management by banks to extend their services over such wide areas. Insurance companies will be asked to offer micro-finance packages including insurance. Obviously there are major challenges. Even if operational obstacles can be overcome, there is the important question of keeping the first-time bank account holders engaged. Experience suggests that a high proportion of such accounts are hardly used after the initial enthusiasm wears off. The plan of inclusion, which is part of the Prime Minister’s vision of a Digital India, requires all-round support. The government wants to use these accounts for routing cash transfers in lieu of subsidies for essential commodities. Financial inclusion in that sense is therefore much more than extending banking services. Accompanied by an equally ambitious programme of spreading financial literacy, it can achieve many important socio-economic objectives.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pradhan-mantri-jandhan-yojana-an-ambitious-plan-for-financial-inclusion/article6329379.ece
19,8,2014,Focus on basic research,"Of the eight winners of the top awards in mathematics given away at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Seoul on August 13, the focus in the Indian media has been on three of them, the two Fields Medalists, Indian-origin Manjul Bhargava and the Iranian Maryam Mirzakhani; and the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize winner, Subhash Khot, also of Indian origin. Naturally so because, from a popular Indian perspective, the Indian-origin laureates instill a sense of pride, notwithstanding the fact that their success had little to do with the Indian educational system. The award to Dr. Mirzakhani is awe-inspiring on two counts: one, she is the first woman to be awarded this top award since it was first given 78 years ago and, two, the fact that someone from a nation which is generally perceived to discriminate against the female gender, especially with regard to education, has made that coveted grade. Their backgrounds clearly indicate how important it is, on the one hand, to have good mathematics teachers who are able to spot bright students and, on the other, to have the conducive educational environment for talented youngsters to pursue their interests and give them the necessary freedom to explore beyond the printed curriculum. If Dr. Bhargava had his mathematician-musician mother to mentor him to develop his skills — in mathematics, music and linguistics — without even letting that being hampered by minimum school attendance requirements, Dr. Khot had his mathematics teacher nurturing him and letting him spend time in his house doing mathematics, which facility the school in Ichalkaranji could not otherwise have provided.
Dr. Mirzakhani’s example has called into question the notion that Iranian society prevented girls from pursuing higher education. “While it is true that boys and girls go to separate schools up to high school, this does not prevent them from participating, say in the Olympiads or the summer camps,” she told the Clay Mathematics Institute newsletter in 2008. Tehran, in fact, has a special middle school for exceptionally talented girls, to which Dr. Mirzakhani went and whose “strong-willed” Principal enabled her to participate in the International Mathematical Olympiads in which Iran had never fielded a girl before. This, of course, does not deny the existence of an inherent attitudinal bias against women scientists in general in some societies. The Indian S&T Ministry has established a proven scheme to nurture school students with exceptional talent and also programmes for women scientists to pursue research careers. But, as Dr. Bhargava and earlier the Nobel Laureate Venkatraman Ramakrishnan noted, a change in the societal attitude towards research in the basic sciences, mathematics in particular, has to come about.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/focus-on-basic-research/article6329381.ece
20,8,2014,Over-reaction to an irritant,"Diplomacy is not a limited overs cricket match. But by >calling off the Foreign Secretary-level talks with Pakistan scheduled for August 25, the Narendra Modi government has behaved precisely as if it was that. For more than a decade now leaders of the secessionist Hurriyat have regularly met Pakistani diplomats stationed in India, as well as visiting leaders starting with General Pervez Musharraf when he came for the Agra summit in 2001. Such meetings that demonstrate Pakistan’s preference for the separatists are no doubt an irritant, but New Delhi’s usual practice had been to register an objection and move on, not letting the issue derail the dialogue process. Implicit in this approach was the realisation that engagement was the key to normalising relations with Islamabad. Also, there has been grudging acceptance on the Indian side that an India-Pakistan agreement on Kashmir needs the Hurriyat on board. For, while there is an elected government, the separatist leaders do carry a great deal of influence in the Valley on the larger political questions about the State. The Centre too has been in both official and secret talks with the Hurriyat leadership. In the light of this, the proper course would have been to express displeasure at the Pakistan High Commissioner’s invitation to the Hurriyat for consultations before the talks between the Foreign Secretaries. But to have cancelled the talks shows a shockingly inadequate grasp of history, and is short-sighted. India has called off engagement with Pakistan many times in the recent past for far more serious reasons, only to realise after each hiatus that there is no other alternative. The immediate question now is if the talks between Prime Minister Modi and his Pakistan counterpart Nawaz Sharif will take place as planned on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September.
The government has done itself no favours, as the decision is bound to add to the popularity of the separatist leaders in the Valley. Pakistan has described the cancellation as “a setback to the efforts by our leadership to promote good neighbourly relations” with India. Equally, it could prove to be a political setback for Mr. Sharif, who is already under siege. Opposition leader Imran Khan’s agitational politics have shaken the weak foundations of Pakistan’s civilian democracy. Adding to the brinkmanship are elements in the Pakistani security and political establishment that believe their Prime Minister is too soft towards India. The Modi government could only have further weakened Mr. Sharif’s position. That, in the long run, undermines the prospect of normalising India-Pakistan relations, more than the Pakistan High Commissioner’s meeting with Hurriyat leaders.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/calling-off-india-pakistan-foreign-secretary-talks-overreaction-to-an-irritant/article6332458.ece
20,8,2014,Threat to personal liberty,"The latest amendments made to the main preventive detention law in Tamil Nadu have great potential for misuse. By bringing in sexual offences and cybercrimes within the ambit of the Goondas Act, a 1982 law that provides for one year of imprisonment without bail, the State government has included crimes already being dealt with by means of stringent provisions. Further, the State has deleted the requirement that in order to be detained under this law one should be a ‘habitual’ offender. This gives extraordinary discretionary power to the executive to detain anyone accused of one crime under a host of regular and special laws. With the classes of offences constantly expanding, the availability of the preventive detention option for first-time offenders portends great danger for personal liberty. It is a fact that a Full Bench of the Madras High Court has ruled that even one offence is enough to invoke the law in certain circumstances, but incorporating it as a statutory power may violate constitutional guarantees. Further, with cybercrimes coming under its ambit, the State will have to ponder over its implications on freedom of speech and expression. The amendments also mean that the High Court will have to grapple with more habeas corpus petitions. Detention orders are invariably set aside by High Courts on technical grounds, but only after a great deal of harm is done with detainees having spent several months in jail.
‘Sexual offenders’ who may now be detained include those booked for molestation, the various categories of rape under the Indian Penal Code, and the much-debated Section 377 that criminalises homosexuality. For one thing, sexual offenders have been detained under the Act in the past, and a specific provision is not necessary. Secondly, it was only in 2013 that the sections dealing with crimes against women were significantly strengthened. The IPC provisions themselves are now strong enough as molestation, sexual harassment, stalking and voyeurism are separately defined so that offenders do not get away easily. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, is now being invoked by the police in Tamil Nadu for crimes against children. If investigated and prosecuted well, these laws are enough to meet the government’s objective. The reference to Section 377 is singularly unfortunate, as the LGBT community will be an easy target for arbitrary detention. There have been enough instances of the misuse of Section 66-A of the Information Technology Act for one to be wary of using it as a basis for preventive detention. Tamil Nadu will be well-advised to keep the amendments in abeyance as curbing crime needs efficient policing and speedy trials, not draconian laws.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/goondas-act-preventive-detention-law-in-tamil-nadu-amendments-a-threat-to-personal-liberty/article6332457.ece
21,8,2014,Controlling the party,"The influence of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh on the Bharatiya Janata Party is always greater during periods when the party is in power. While the Sangh is sometimes ready to appear twice removed from the government, it is keen to exercise control over the party’s organisational affairs. Little surprise then, the newly elected president of the BJP, >Amit Shah, chose to pack the top rung of the party with those from the Sangh. Former RSS spokesman Ram Madhav is now general secretary and ideologue Vinay Sahasrabuddhe is vice-president; four of the joint secretaries (organisation) are RSS members without much of a background of work in the party. Despite the nominal distance it maintains from the organisations of the Sangh Parivar, the RSS ensures that its writ runs where it matters: in the BJP, and in the BJP governments at the Centre and in the States. With its organisational strength, and the large number of committed cadre, the RSS is the backbone of the BJP, and not just an ideological mentor. In the 2014 general election, workers of the RSS and its affiliates threw their weight behind the BJP and contributed in no small measure to the party’s revival in States such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. It was only natural for the BJP, especially Mr. Shah who was in charge of the party’s electoral management in Uttar Pradesh, to recognise this fact and accommodate RSS leaders in the decision-making structure of the party.
What is problematic, however, is how the RSS will wield its influence in the BJP to remote-control the government. Mr. Shah enjoys a close rapport with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and it is feared he might indeed function as an extra-constitutional authority. Now, with the BJP being led by RSS hands, the party’s influence on the government can only get bigger. Decision-making may not be confined to the Cabinet or legislative bodies, but may extend to party forums and Sangh meetings. Going by the statement of RSS sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat that >Hindutva is India’s identity, the RSS’s relations with the BJP and, by extension, with the government, could raise serious concerns in the public mind, and particularly among minorities. Prime Minister Modi spoke of ruling by consensus and not by the party’s majority in the Lok Sabha, but statements such as those made by Mr. Bhagwat seeking to equate Hindutva with Indianness and Hindustanis (Indians) with Hindus can only create doubts whether the BJP intends to return to a divisive majoritarian agenda. Mr. Modi and the BJP need to distance themselves from such statements if these are not to be taken as reflective of the thinking of the ruling establishment. Otherwise, the Sangh, the BJP and the government would be widely seen as just different forms of the same entity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rss-controlling-the-party/article6335653.ece
21,8,2014,Shake-up after surrender,"The Indian cricket team’s >abject surrender in England was shocking, both for the ineptitude on display and the suddenness of its onset after a rare and famous >Test victory at Lord’s. India has now lost 13 of its last 17 overseas Tests. The fear of a return to the dark days of the 1990s, when India won just one of 39 Tests away from the comforts of home, is very real. Seemingly stung into action, the BCCI has made changes in top management. But for the moment they pertain just to the one-day squad in England. It remains to be seen what Ravi Shastri’s mandate as >director of cricket is; but with the BCCI’s history of opacity, it’s unlikely that the results of a performance review — if such a process is conducted — and a blueprint for the future will be made accessible to the followers. For long the Indian Board has been criticised for not prioritising Test cricket, for not arranging its fixtures so off-season development work can be carried on: despite a greater frequency of ‘A’ tours, few Indian batsmen have played county cricket, where they will have come up against James Anderson and Stuart Broad and the moving, bouncing ball. The manner of its addressing these matters among others will reveal if the BCCI’s recent actions are part of a commitment to improvement or mere window-dressing. It has no excuses, however, given its pre-eminence in world cricket, and its financial might.
As things stood, an inexperienced batting line-up couldn’t find solutions in testing English conditions. And the toll the collective failure took proved too much for a team which discovered it did not have the mental stamina for a five-Test series. It didn’t help that India could not call on a bowler of Anderson’s calibre to drag it back into a contest after a batting collapse. Ishant Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar showed they could summon match-turning spells, but injury and fatigue, respectively, beset them. If the phenomenon of Indian bowlers losing pace and breaking down continued, so did the tendency of the fielders to drop catches and make taking 20 wickets twice as hard. India’s opening partnership averaged 21.9 in the series, not the sort of platform Tests can be won from. Murali Vijay was the team’s leading scorer with 402 runs; a major share of that aggregate, however, came in the first two Tests. Ajinkya Rahane and M.S. Dhoni had their moments, but the failures of Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli were disheartening. Reputations are enhanced through exploits overseas, and India’s young cricketers have to find a way. They, more than anyone else, should know that for all their stardom and their success in the shorter forms of the game, Test cricket is the ultimate benchmark. In that, India has floundered.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/india-england-test-series-shakeup-after-surrender/article6335654.ece
22,8,2014,Conflicts within,"Persisting boundary disputes among the northeastern States of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Manipur and Nagaland, reflect multi-layered conflicts in the region that the formation over time of those States on ethno-linguistic lines failed to address or resolve. The most intractable among them, between Assam and Nagaland, is on the boil again. >After a round of arson and violence on August 12 attributed to armed groups from Nagaland led to the loss of nine lives and thousands of people from villages in Assam’s Golaghat district being driven to relief camps, demonstrations of protest in Assam, and some insensitive handling by the police of the volatile situation, led to further violence. On August 20, >three persons were killed in police firing in Golaghat town during protests against police high-handedness. Transport blockades called by organisations in Assam against Nagaland, are also biting hard. While claiming cross-boundary ethnic contiguity, Nagaland says a 1925 notification that transferred stretches of forests from Nagaland to Assam was biased and that they ought to have been returned in 1947. The issue was raised during the signing of the 16-Point Agreement between the Centre and the Naga Peoples’ Convention in 1960 that led to the formation of Nagaland in December 1963. Nagaland thus wants the boundary redrawn on historical lines. Indeed, the principal demand put forward by militant groups including the NSCN (I-M) relates to the creation of a ‘Nagalim’, or Greater Nagaland. Assam insists on maintaining the constitutionally done demarcation, and says Nagaland is holding 591 square kilometres of its territory. It moved the Supreme Court in 1988 seeking a permanent solution and the court appointed a group of mediators; a decision is still pending.
Clearly, this is a dispute that cannot be wished away. Neither is it one that could be allowed to descend into violence. In 1979, the Central Reserve Police Force was posted to maintain status quo on the boundary as a neutral group. Law and order along the boundary, which is divided into six sectors, is under the Central government’s charge. Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi has now accused the CRPF of failure to protect the victims. Mr. Gogoi and Nagaland Chief Minister T.R. Zeliang need to work out ways to avoid further confrontations. As has now been decided, a series of meetings should be held between the political leadership and officials from both States. Civil society groups should play a role in restoring peace. In the longer term, a solution to the issue has to be worked out. The region as a whole should be able to imagine a common future and subsume and transcend its fragmented ethnic identities.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/conflicts-within/article6339243.ece
22,8,2014,The navy and economic growth,"The commissioning in Mumbai of INS Kolkata, a formidable destroyer, has turned out to be much more than an expression of the navy’s heft to safeguard the sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. The message delivered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the commissioning had some subtle but significant doctrinal content. Mr. Modi made it clear in his address that the acquisition of more teeth by the navy was inextricably connected with India’s growth story. This focus became transparent when he stressed the importance of securing the sea lanes and the role that ships such as INS Kolkata would play to “inspire confidence to those involved in maritime trade.”
The navy is well aware of the multiple roles it is expected to perform, which are defining the development of the force. These include safeguarding the country’s energy security, as the bulk of India’s oil supplies, procured from the Persian Gulf, transits through the shipping lanes of the Indian Ocean, which has witnessed a surge in incidents of piracy in recent years. The 2004 tsunami had earlier demonstrated that the navy needs to be well-equipped to provide disaster relief not only to Indian nationals but also to people in distress in other Indian Ocean littoral states. The growing instability in West Asia is a source of major anxiety as the navy, along with the Indian Air Force and the civil aviation arms, will be put to severe tests in case a mass evacuation of Indian nationals residing in the Persian Gulf states becomes necessary. The navy is also gearing up for a role to protect offshore oil installations far away from the Indian shores, tap seabed resources, and expand a rule-based footprint that extends till resource-rich Antarctica. The commissioning of INS Kolkata has shown that the navy’s warship inductions are moving to plan, as two follow-on destroyers of this class — INS Kochi and INS Chennai — are now in the pipeline. The commissioning also highlights India’s steady gains in integrating home-grown technology in the construction and design of naval vessels. The Brahmos cruise missile — a successful product of Indo-Russian collaboration — demonstrates the acquisition of credible land attack capability. The presence of multi-function phased-array radar that can track and engage several targets simultaneously, as well as indigenously developed torpedoes, showcases impressive domestic gains in the integration of cutting-edge military technology. Yet, if the navy has to become a force multiplier to energise India’s economic growth, more attention would be required to shore up its ailing submarine fleet, coupled with a renewed focus on the development of a state-of-the-art aircraft carrier arm.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-navy-and-economic-growth/article6339245.ece
23,8,2014,Dealing with barbarism,"The execution of the American journalist James Foley by militants of the Islamic State is a shocking iteration of the group’s barbarity. Foley was a freelance reporter who had been abducted many months ago in Syria. It has now emerged that the IS had demanded $100 million to free him, and that the U.S. government refused, but made a failed attempt to rescue him. It has said it executed Foley in revenge for the >U.S. airstrikes against it in Iraq. The execution also came days after the Security Council resolution against the IS and its activities. The group continues to hold one more journalist and has warned that his fate depended on President Barack Obama’s “next decision”. From decreeing that women living in territory under its control would have to undergo genital mutilation, to the massacre of the minority Yazidis, to their latest atrocity, the IS is determined to send out the message to the world that it will stop at nothing to achieve its goal, which is to establish its writ across the Islamic world. An offshoot of al-Qaeda, but more extreme than its parent, the IS seems eager to prove its violent credentials. Yet, precisely in its barbarity lies the hope that it can be stopped. Even most Sunni Muslims in Iraq, where the IS burst on the scene in June, do not subscribe to its extremism or the violence that it espouses. Also, unlike al-Qaeda, whose ambition to propagate an ideology to the entire world through a hydra-headed organisational structure and franchisees makes it much harder to fight, the IS is — at least for the moment — a single entity, locked in its territorial ambitions.
The recent change of guard in Iraq, where >Nouri al Maliki stepped down as Prime Minister to make way for Haider al-Abadi, might be of help if the new government that is still taking shape is inclusive of the country’s minority Sunnis. The IS took birth in the violence and chaos that gripped Iraq post-Saddam Hussain. Mr. Maliki was propped up by the U.S., which helped it grow. But the jihadist group really came into its own in the Syrian civil war, and there is no denying that contributing to its dramatic rise was the U.S., which gave regional backing to all manner of extremists in the fight against Bashar al Assad’s regime. That the IS has recruited hundreds of foreign fighters is a cause for concern — dozens of Indians are also reported to have joined the group. Indian security agencies need to be wary of these jihadists re-entering the country and spreading the IS’s toxic ideology here. Foley’s execution is an attack on media freedom, but a group as brutal as the IS cannot be held to any civilised standards. India must redouble its efforts to rescue the 40 Indian workers in IS custody.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dealing-with-barbarism/article6342805.ece
23,8,2014,Humanising the law,"There are times when state and citizen are so hopelessly locked in conflict that one of them will have to give in. In normal circumstances, the state prevails. But Irom Sharmila Chanu’s 14-year-long hunger strike is no ordinary circumstance. Whatever the state does — be it arresting and force-feeding her or ignoring her demand for an end to military impunity by repealing the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, 1958 — the Manipuri activist, now 42, seems to triumph. It is a sign of the government’s defeat that it has been forced to arrest Ms. Sharmila again, two days after she was released by a court. The ostensible objective is to save her life, as she insists on continuing her indefinite fast even after her release. The authorities are on questionable legal ground in repeatedly detaining her — after the court found that she had done no crime and that the provision criminalising attempt to commit suicide is not applicable to political protests like hers — but they seem to have no choice, as she can be fed by nasal tube only in custody. The ‘Iron Lady of Manipur’ has come to symbolise the conscience of a country that probably recognises that AFSPA gives unconscionable protection to excesses committed by the Army in parts of India hit by political conflict, but is unable to abrogate, amend or dilute it. The state has been unable or unwilling to prevail over the Army, which stubbornly favours the retention of the indefensible law.
In 2005, the United Progressive Alliance regime recognised the need to amend or dilute AFSPA and appointed a committee headed by former Supreme Court judge B.P. Jeevan Reddy. The panel unambiguously recommended that AFSPA be repealed. It suggested amendments to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act that could legally tackle insurgency and conflict in areas currently notified under AFSPA. This would end the feeling among the people of the States where the law is invoked that their territories are being selectively targeted. Ms. Sharmila’s protest has so far helped keep AFSPA in the limelight; the latest episode of her release and re-arrest shines light on the desirability of retaining Section 309 (attempt to commit suicide) in the statute book. A Constitution Bench has upheld the section on the ground that the ‘right to live’ does not include the ‘right to die’, but courts have also suggested that the provision be repealed, as it is inhuman to prosecute those who attempt suicide due to depression instead of empowering them to lead fruitful lives. However, the state seems to need this provision to deal with political protesters resorting to hunger strikes. It is time the government repealed AFSPA and abrogated Section 309 to humanise the law further.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/humanising-the-law/article6342804.ece
25,8,2014,The tasks that remain,"Change, as they say, is the only constant.

This applies as much to institutions and organisations as to people, ideas and concepts. And so, when confronted with change the choices are limited to just two — change with the times, or risk being consigned to the dustbin of history. The Planning Commission, established 64 years ago, brings up the issues of time, context and environment. Between 1950, when it was established, and now, the times have changed. The then newly independent India was struggling with a damaged and rudimentary economy and needed an orderly assessment of its resources and planning for development. It is much better organised today in economic terms, and even at current rates of growth is among the fastest-growing in the world. The Planning Commission was then the vehicle that enabled the public sector to rise to the “commanding heights of the economy”; today, the private sector is the chosen vehicle for industrial growth after the tectonic shift of 1991 when licensing and controls were abolished or eased. The global environment has also changed, as has India’s place in it. In today’s globalised world, state controls over much of the economy are passé and seen as hindering enterprise. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has merely articulated what was accepted and known for the last decade and more: the Planning Commission in its original form needed to be changed.
So, what next? Centrally directed planning may be an anachronism in these days of greater federal autonomy. Yet, resource allocation among the Centre and the States and between Ministries and programmes at the Centre is an important governance activity. So are coordination, monitoring and evaluation of publicly funded projects and schemes, especially in the social sector. The executive wings of the government under the different Ministries are not equipped for such tasks. Such monitoring by Central Ministries will not be acceptable to States, especially those ruled by a party that is not in power at the Centre. And what about one of the most important roles of the Planning Commission — of being a repository of data and information on varied sectors of the economy? Ministries and government departments routinely depend on the sectoral studies and data generated by the Planning Commission. While the Planning Commission may go, the important tasks it has been carrying out will still remain to be done. At the moment, the government would seem to have decided to abolish the Commission without having a clear alternative in view to address some of its essential tasks.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-tasks-that-remain/article6347271.ece
25,8,2014,A landmark ethical clearance,"On August 11, for the first time a 12-member World Health Organization panel unanimously agreed that the use of “unproven interventions” in humans as potential treatment or prevention options for the Ebola virus disease is ethical in the West African countries of Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. The interventions would also be evaluated for safety and efficacy in the best possible clinical trial settings. But the tricky ethical issue of ensuring “fair distribution” among the affected populations and countries will be looked into later. The green signal is specific to the circumstance of this outbreak, and subject to certain conditions like “transparency about all aspects of care, and informed consent” being met. The factors that played a vital role in the WHO’s decision were the continued spread of the disease, about 55 per cent mortality rate and the lack of vaccines/drugs to prevent infection or treat the disease. As on August 22, the number of people infected with the virus was 2,615 (1,528 confirmed) and the mortality figure, 11,427. But it was the controversy over the use of an untested drug, ZMapp, on two Americans who came down with the disease that forced the WHO to look into the ethics of using it in the four countries.
Prior to the WHO clearance, there were three main reasons cited for not supplying the untested drug to dying Africans. First, the level of medical care that is necessary to monitor for any serious adverse effects that might arise after drug administration is currently not available in the four countries. The second reason was the inability of the U.S. to decide who the recipients of a limited supply of drugs should be. The third was the backlash the drug company and the U.S. would face if the experimental drug first used on Africans were to cause serious adverse effects. But the use of the experimental drug on two Americans and then on a Spanish priest brought back to his country has further eroded the goodwill that the U.S. enjoyed in the four countries. It has also heightened the affected population’s level of suspicion against national and international doctors and health workers. Even the supply of drugs to Liberia to treat two doctors just prior to the WHO debating the ethical issue may not turn out to be an effective balm to reduce the ill-will; by default or design, the WHO’s ethical clearance has preceded the use of the drugs on the two Liberians. If many unethical human clinical trials, like the one carried out in 1996 in Nigeria by an American drug company during a meningitis outbreak, seriously affected the prospects of conducting trials in Africa, instances such as this only complicate it. So it remains to be seen how successful other Ebola drug treatment trials would be.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-landmark-ethical-clearance/article6347270.ece
26,8,2014,The experiment succeeds,"The latest round of by-elections to Assembly seats will be remembered for the success of a political experiment in Bihar involving the coming together of three parties against the Bharatiya Janata Party. The results significantly moderate the idea that the BJP is at an electorally invulnerable point in its history. The Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Janata Dal (United) and the Congress have together won six of the 10 seats that saw by-polls. The BJP with its allies had swept Bihar in the recent Lok Sabha election, bagging 31 of the 40 seats. It is not in itself a surprise that parties gain from tactical tie-ups that give them the arithmetical heft that their individual stature may not fetch. However, the three parties seemed to have done some strategic thinking in bringing together their combined vote base drawn from among Yadavs, other backward classes, Dalits and Muslims and successfully presented a ‘grand secular alliance’. It has given room for these parties to claim it as a victory over ‘divisive forces’. The takeaway from the combine’s performance is that doubts whether it would work on the ground have been dispelled. These doubts arose because of the long history of political rivalry between JD(U) leader and former Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and RJD president Lalu Prasad. The BJP’s State leadership has accepted responsibility for winning only four seats, lest it be seen as a reflection on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s performance at the Centre. At the same time, it cannot be denied that the BJP had beaten alliance arithmetic in the four seats it has won. The results indicate how the battle lines will be drawn when Assembly elections are held in Bihar in 2015.
Karnataka is another State where the Congress’ performance will give the party considerable satisfaction, as it managed to wrest the Bellary Rural seat from the BJP with a handsome margin of over 33,000 votes. While retaining its seat at Chikkodi-Sadalga, the Congress managed to make inroads into Shikaripura, where former Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa’s son B.Y. Raghavendra managed to win with a relatively narrow margin of 6,430 votes. This should come as a boost for Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who faces some dissidence and is under pressure from several quarters for Cabinet posts. The BJP’s performance in Madhya Pradesh, winning two out of three seats in this round, has been mixed. It retained one constituency, Agar, while wresting Vijaraghavgarh from the Congress. The Congress wrested the Bahoriband seat from its rival. In Punjab, the Akali Dal seems to have beaten back anti-incumbency sentiment to some extent by wresting the Talwandi Sabo seat from the Congress by a big margin. The Congress retained the Patiala Urban seat.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-the-experiment-succeeds/article6350847.ece
26,8,2014,Growth-inflation dynamic,"The Reserve Bank of India’s Annual Report submitted to the union government is a statutory publication on behalf of its central board of directors. The most recent one, released last week covers the period July 1,2013 to June 30 2014 and like its predecessors deals with the macroeconomy as well the central bank’s working including financial accounts for the previous year.(2013-14). Much of the interest however lies in understanding the central bank’s views on the contemporary economic issues. The growth -inflation dynamic was bound to figure prominently as indeed it does in all RBI statements., There cannot be substantial changes in the RBI’s monetary stance between the third bi-monthly monetary review of August and the annual report. With inflation continuing to remain at high levels, the possibility of a rate cut in the near future is practically ruled out. This is very much in line with recent monetary policy statements .The RBI’s hawkish stance to counter inflation -interest rates have been raised three times by 25 basis points each since September last,-will therefore continue. Retail inflation which was coming down reversed course in July on the back of high vegetable prices. There are important upside risks to inflation .The geo political crisis in West Asia is potentially a great destabilising factor, although global crude prices have been drifting downwards recently. Revisions in domestic administered prices such as on diesel and in railway fares can exert pressure on the domestic price level. Despite these factors, the RBI feels that its inflation projection of 8 per cent by January 2015 is achievable .However, the target for 2016 at 6 per cent is subject to medium -term risks,
The RBI has retained its growth forecast for the year at 5.5 per cent, up from the below 5 per cent growth rate seen recently. There has been a revival in industrial activity and construction and the monsoon deficit has not been as substantial as expected. The government is more optimistic than the RBI, pegging growth at 5.8 per cent and improving as interest rates hopefully come down and the growth-stimulating efforts of the new government start making an impact. The differences between the government and the RBI are not as significant as it is made out to be, The NDA government has struck a harmonious chord with the RBI ,whose views not only on inflation but also on currently important matters such as infrastructure projects will count in policy formulation. Making a vision statement for the first time in the annual report the RBI lists ,among others ,an early licensing of differentiated banks -the payment banks and small banks These will play a very important role in extending financial inclusion.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-growthinflation-dynamic/article6350844.ece
27,8,2014,Blow for public integrity,"The Supreme Court verdict holding coal block allocations made since 1993 illegal confirms a long-known, but little-acknowledged malaise pervading the administration: cronyism often overshadowing merit, and systems and processes being undermined by power and influence. The sweeping nature of the finding that allocation of coal blocks through the government dispensation route as well as through a non-statutory ‘screening committee’ suffered from arbitrariness is a fierce indictment of successive governments, rendering it difficult to apportion blame on any particular party or regime. Rather, as the judgment points out, the approach was ad hoc and casual. There was no fair and transparent procedure, and this resulted in unfair distribution of national wealth. The judgment, in essence, sticks to the constitutional norms the Supreme Court has been applying since the time it cancelled 122 telecom licences in 2012 based on the finding that illegal allocation of 2G spectrum had been made. Of course, a Constitution Bench has now calibrated the law that once tended to make competitive auction the sole basis for the exploitation of natural resources, and given some policy leeway to the government to adopt alternative methods, subject to constitutional principles being adhered to. The court will deliberate on the consequences of its findings in further hearings, but it has already sent out a clear message that it will no more countenance arbitrary and illegal allocation of natural resources.
Political parties may seek to blame one another, and industry may count its losses and lament the verdict’s impact on the cost and availability of power and the cost of importing or transporting coal. Some may fret over the viability of existing projects and the fate of investments already made. They may calculate the impact on financial firms with exposure to this sector. All these factors will now be weighed by the Court when it sits again to decide whether to cancel the allocations or find a just alternative. It has clarified that its verdict will not touch ongoing probes by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate into illegalities committed in the allocation of coal blocks. The judgment also exempts 12 coal blocks linked to Ultra-mega Power Projects that were allotted on the basis of competitive bidding. Those who consider the public interest paramount and are concerned about good governance and the integrity of institutions will doubtless welcome this judgment. The tasks that remain are, first, to disgorge the windfall gains made by the players in the scam; second, to save the mining and power sectors from the consequences of the illegal allocations; and third, to bring to book those guilty of criminal conduct.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-blow-for-public-integrity/article6354219.ece
27,8,2014,"Risky, if not reckless","Scotland, which has had a separate Parliament since 1999, votes in a referendum next month to decide whether its four million voters want independence from the United Kingdom, potentially bringing down the curtains on a historic union of 307 years. The September 18 ballot will determine the need for a second plebiscite to authorise the precise terms of a separation. The Conservative and Labour parties, besides the Liberal Democrats, have been strongly opposed to the demand for Scottish independence; but not necessarily to a referendum as a means to decide the question. Arguably, had this device of direct democracy been deployed more responsibly in the past, the vote may not have become inevitable. In the event, the referendum became a reality after the Scottish National Party secured an overall majority in the 2011 elections to the Scottish Parliament on the promise of a plebiscite. Mainstream parties have relied on the recourse to a referendum as a way of dealing with intra-party divisions over Europe and, more recently, on electoral reforms. Britain’s first-ever referendum of 1975 was beleaguered Prime Minister Harold Wilson’s attempt to shore up support for the country’s accession to the European Economic Community in the wake of Labour’s vote against continuation of the membership.
The effect of an emphatic yes to stay inside was but short-lived, as the eurosceptic backbenchers gained ground in the subsequent decades. As a result, political parties were hamstrung when it came to taking difficult decisions, and London was unable to exercise its legitimate influence in the bloc. Nearly 40 years after 1975, a referendum on renegotiating the U.K.’s membership, and worse, on whether the country should quit the EU, is on the agenda of the current Conservative-led coalition. The most recent nation-wide plebiscite held in 2011 on an alternative vote to the first-past-the-post system of election for Westminster lacked genuine political backing from any party. For the Conservatives, who prefer the status quo, the vote was merely a compromise struck during coalition negotiations with the Liberal Democrats. The situation was no different for the latter, who have long championed proportional representation. The Labour party was a divided house, even though it promised voting reform in the 2010 general election manifesto. The U.K. Electoral Commission estimated a cost of £75 million for the 2011 referendum. There is also the likelihood of the subject of any plebiscite being overshadowed by more immediate concerns. The wisdom behind asking the general population for a precise opinion on a specific matter with implications over the long term is also not conclusive. The rarer the recourse to a referendum the better, is the lesson from recent history.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-risky-if-not-reckless/article6354218.ece
3,9,2014,A new sunrise,"India and Japan have enjoyed the best of relations over the decades. Yet, their trade and economic partnership has, strangely, been under-performing, belying the promise and potential. Bilateral trade at $16.29 billion in 2013-14 accounted for just 2.13 per cent of India’s total trade and barely 1 per cent of Japan’s. The low-profile trade relationship is especially disappointing considering how much Japan has to offer in terms of >investment and technology, and how much India needs both. India may be one of the largest recipients of Japanese ODA (Official Development Assistance), but when it comes to foreign direct investment (FDI), it ranks low, well behind China. Between April 2000 and February 2014, Japanese companies cumulatively invested $15.97 billion in India, accounting for just 7.46 per cent of total FDI inflows into India, which in a way epitomises the state of the economic relationship between the second and third largest economies of Asia. All this could change for the better, post-Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Japan, which seems to have breathed new life into >economic relations. Japan has said it would invest 3.5 trillion yen ($33.5 billion) in India in the next five years in the sectors of infrastructure, manufacturing, transport and clean energy, and on smart cities, all thrust areas for development for the Modi government.
To be sure, this is not the first time we have seen positive intent in the leadership of the >two Asian giants to improve trade and investment. Ever since India liberalised in the early 1990s, there has been steady interest among Japanese companies and investors — but they have often been frustrated by complicated procedures and cumbersome processes. Actually, Japanese companies willingly ceded market space in India to competitors from South Korea and China rather than deal with the red tape. It is in this context that Mr. Modi’s promises of “red carpet, not red tape”, and a special track in the Prime Minister’s Office to facilitate Japanese investments, have to be seen. Mr. Modi harped on all the right themes including the three Ds that India can boast of, namely democracy, demography and demand, while making his pitch to Japanese business. With manufacturing costs increasing in China and given the political issues between the two countries, Japanese businesses are looking to diversify, and India presents a good choice with its huge market. New projects such as those for super-fast trains and smart cities are ideal destinations for Japanese investments. The Modi government has to now move quickly to fulfil its promises of easing procedures and facilitating investment to capitalise on the optimism and goodwill generated from what has clearly been a successful visit in >economic terms.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-new-sunrise/article6373691.ece
3,9,2014,Eroding democratic gains,"The events that have unfolded in Pakistan over the last two weeks have all but wiped out the country’s small democratic gains of the last six years. A few thousand protestors under the leadership of cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, who leads the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), and a rabble-rousing cleric, Tahir ul Qadri, a Canadian of Pakistani origin, have effectively held the nation hostage, refusing to call off their agitation until the elected government of Nawaz Sharif resigned. In most democracies, such demands are settled in Parliament. Where the opposition has sufficient numbers, it may even succeed in unseating the government. Where it does not, it focusses on winning the next election. The Pakistan Army denies it but there has been much speculation >about its role in the protests from the start, fuelled in recent days by the allegations of a top PTI leader who broke ranks with Mr. Khan. In any case, the Army’s eagerness to use the situation to tilt the civilian-military balance decisively in its favour has been all too apparent. The moment that the Army chief, Raheel Sharif, spoke to >Mr. Khan and Mr. Qadri in an effort to end the stand-off will be remembered as the point at which the military gained an upper hand over the government. Since then, the Army has been urging talks between the government and the protestors and criticising the use of the police force to disperse mobs. A Corps Commanders’ conference to “discuss” the political situation cemented its position further.
The crisis itself might not have come about if Mr. Sharif had a better grip on governance. Mr. Khan’s campaign grew from a small complaint of election-rigging in a few constituencies. A simple way out would have been to address those complaints but the government let the matter drift. Despite his huge mandate, Mr. Sharif’s 15 months in power have been marked by all-around drift. He may survive this crisis for now as Mr. Khan stands politically isolated, save for support from Mr. Qadri and his following. >Tuesday’s Parliament session, at which all other political parties — opponents and allies alike — made impassioned speeches urging Mr. Sharif to stand firm against the efforts to remove him, will perhaps go down as one of the most stirring in Pakistan’s chequered history of tentative democracies. But it is already clear that continue though he might, it will only be as a much weakened Prime Minister. How much ground the military has wrested from him, especially on policies on India and Afghanistan, will become apparent only in the days to come. New Delhi called off talks last month, and Pakistan’s changed scenario may only make it more difficult for the two sides to get back to the table.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/eroding-democratic-gains/article6373692.ece
4,9,2014,Towards a skilled workforce,"With his > twin focus on jobs and growth, Prime Minister Narendra Modi seems intent on placing renewed emphasis on skill development in the services and > manufacturing sectors. In his Independence Day speech, the > Prime Minister spoke of his ‘skilled India’ mission to promote holistic development. There is no doubt that India needs to equip its youth with greater work skills. At present, the country churns out a mostly semi-literate workforce without the requisite marketable skills in a globalised world. According to a report by the Adviser to the Prime Minister on the National Council on Skill Development, among those in the 15 to 29 years age group, only 2 per cent have received formal vocational training, and 8 per cent non-formal vocational training. Against 128 lakh > new entrants to the workforce, there were only 31 lakh seats for vocational skill training. As Mr. Modi stressed in his speech, with 65 per cent of the population under 35 years of age, India will have to think of reaping the demographic dividend. However, India ought to set its sights higher than what Mr. Modi envisaged when he lamented the shortage of drivers, plumbers and cooks. The > real challenge is not to find low-paying jobs for the unemployed, but to equip those > entering the workforce with the necessary skills in a competitive environment.
By promising to enhance the skill development of India’s youth at a rapid pace, Mr. Modi spoke of forming a pool of young people who are able to > create jobs. More importantly, he also talked of a workforce that will be in a position to “face their counterparts in any corner of the world” by virtue of hard work and dexterity of hands. Capacity-building was spoken of in the global context as the ability of > India’s youth to “win the hearts of people around the world” through their skills. The importance of promoting the manufacturing sector was highlighted both in the context of creating employment opportunities and > developing a balance between imports and exports. The exhortation to multinationals to sell in any country but manufacture in India, also came in the context of putting to use the education and capability of India’s youth. For employment-led growth, for the “Come, make in India” slogan that > Mr. Modi delivered on Independence Day to have any meaning, the government must invest heavily in education and training, in research and development. Otherwise, cheap labour will remain the only attraction for foreign investment in India. Skill and talent are the results of education and training, and India must lay greater stress on its educational infrastructure before it can attain higher levels of growth. The skill set of India’s youth have to necessarily match that of the world’s best.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/towards-a-skilled-workforce/article6376894.ece
4,9,2014,Presaging a turnround?,"The Indian economy grew by a faster-than-expected 5.7 per cent during the first quarter (April-June) of the current financial year, according to data released by the Central Statistical Office last week. Most > professional forecasters had projected a rate not very much above 5 per cent. A few valid points supported their caution. The economy seemed stuck in a sub-five per cent growth trajectory for two years. That has been the longest spell of growth of less than 5 per cent in a quarter of a century. Recent > GDP growth data were therefore > hardly inspiring. For instance, the growth rate last year (2013-14) was just 4.7 per cent. During the previous quarter (January-March 2014) the economy clocked a growth rate of only 4.6 per cent and in the corresponding quarter last year, it was a full percentage point lower at 4.7 per cent. A break-out substantially above 5 per cent seemed elusive in the context of poor sentiment and policy logjams in critical sectors such as manufacturing and mining. Some important > growth stimulating measures undertaken by the UPA government in its last days — the determined efforts to unclog stalled mega-infrastructure projects, for example — have helped in reviving the economy. The new > NDA government must be credited with improving sentiment, which is expected to improve even further with the surprisingly strong economic performance in the first quarter.
Impressive as the > first quarter data have been, they still do not convincingly demonstrate the beginning of a turnaround phase in which the economy will move up in a sustained manner to 6 per cent in the year ending March 2015. One big dampener has been the persistently high levels of food inflation that have squeezed consumers and forestalled an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India. With private spending accounting for 60 per cent of the economy, that does not augur well for a sustained revival. In terms of > economic activity, the turnaround in mining and quarrying (2.1 per cent) and manufacturing (3.5 per cent) are particularly impressive as they were in negative territory last year. These sub-sectors along with electricity, gas and water supply, which posted an impressive 10.2 per cent increase have benefited from recent policy decisions and, especially in the case of mining, environmental clearances. There has been a slight decrease in agriculture growth to 3.8 per cent from 4 per cent a year ago. However, the final verdict on this year’s monsoons is not yet in, and prospects of a stronger rural economy driving growth are uncertain.

5,9,2014,A capital plan,"In choosing to build the >capital of Andhra Pradesh in the Vijayawada-Guntur region, Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu went by its central location, its proximity to the cities of Vijayawada and Guntur and the availability of land, rather than by the cost of land acquisition. The locational advantages clearly outweigh the relative disadvantage of land cost, and Mr. Naidu must have felt justified in overruling the report of the Sivaramakrishnan Committee, appointed by the Union Home Ministry to identify alternative locations for the >new capital of Andhra Pradesh . Where Mr. Naidu and the Committee agree is on the decentralised development of the State: Andhra Pradesh will now have three mega-cities and 14 smart cities, and not just one super-capital. Even while rejecting the Committee’s objections to raising a capital in the Vijayawada-Guntur-Tenali-Mangalagiri region, the Chief Minister seems to be conscious of its concerns about concentrating development in a single, large capital city. But Mr. Naidu also invoked popular sentiment to justify his decision, noting that nearly 50 per cent of the representations received by the Committee favoured the >Vijayawada-Guntur region as the best possible location. Any area >around Vijayawada would allow easier access to the capital to people from all regions of the State, and provide for more even development.
The Sivaramakrishnan Committee, while >proposing the development of a string of cities as business and industrial hubs, and the distribution of government offices across districts, went strictly by its terms of reference. The panel was particular that the development of the capital and accommodation of government offices cause the least possible dislocation to existing agricultural systems, promote environmentally sustainable growth, and minimise the cost of land and construction. But while, as the >Sivaramakrishnan Committee report says, distances are no longer a deterrent at a time of increased road and rail connectivity and modern electronic communication systems, a centrally located and easily accessible capital city is essential for smooth and speedy governance. Conversion of farmlands, displacement of people dependent on agriculture, and the cost of land acquisition and construction are serious issues, but >Andhra Pradesh needs to have a capital with important government offices in close proximity. Hyderabad will remain a joint capital only for 10 years, and the creation of the capital will have to begin soon and be completed quickly. The Vijayawada-Guntur region suggested itself, and will be ideal for the new capital once landowners are given fair compensation, and conversion of agricultural lands is kept to the minimum. Finding the resources for building the capital is not an insurmountable task.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-capital-plan/article6380442.ece
5,9,2014,Debt and default,"The action of the United Bank of India (UBI) in declaring >Kingfisher Airlines , its promoter Vijay Mallya and three other directors as “wilful defaulters” is a significant one indeed. And it is not just because of the high-profile nature of the company and its promoter. It is significant because for the first time the banking system is sending out a clear signal to borrowers with unpaid dues that it means business. A company or person is classified as a “ >wilful defaulter ” for one or all of the following reasons: it has the means to repay but is unwilling to do so; has diverted loan funds for purposes other than what they were borrowed for and has falsified earnings. No bank will lend to a company that is either a “wilful defaulter” or has on its board someone with such a tag. The implications for Mr. Mallya are, therefore, clear. Yet, Mr. Mallya has >only himself to blame for things having come to such a pass. Not only does Kingfisher, which >shut down operations in 2012, owe more than Rs.7,000 crore to a consortium of 17 banks, it also has dues to suppliers, airports, the tax department and importantly, to employees, who have not been paid salaries for several months. It is a double whammy for the banks, that also hold equity in Kingfisher which they got when the company restructured its debt in early-2011. A little over Rs.1,300 crore was converted into shares, Rs.750 crore of it into equity at Rs.64.48 a share. The current market price of the share is Rs.2.57, which makes the equity holdings next to worthless.
It remains to be seen if the other banks in the consortium, which has notable names like the State Bank of India, IDBI Bank and Punjab National Bank, will follow suit. Mr. Mallya has tried to shift the blame on to UBI for not following due process before declaring him a “wilful defaulter”, but there is no getting away from the basic fact that Kingfisher has not repaid its loans. It can only be hoped that the process of recovery of dues does not get >bogged down in the legal system , given that Mr. Mallya has said he would go to court to contest >UBI’s action . Banks are under pressure from the Reserve Bank of India to clean up their balance sheets and go after defaulters. Gross non-performing assets of the banking system at 4 per cent may not be alarming yet, but it is a cause for concern that bad loans, including restructured ones, add up to almost 10 per cent of total loans outstanding. RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan is on record as saying that promoters do not have a divine right to continue in office even when they mismanage. Clearly, an example is being made out of Kingfisher, and it is important that banks succeed in their effort to recover their dues. For too long have promoters escaped the consequences of mismanagement and default.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/debt-and-default/article6380443.ece
6,9,2014,No room for complacency,"Al-Qaeda’s declaration that it has set up a “branch” in the Indian subcontinent called Qaedat al-Jihad poses serious questions for India and the new government. For al-Qaeda to establish an >operational base in India , which has the third largest Muslim population in the world, would be to pull off something of a coup. Its failure all these years to establish a presence in this country has been attributed to India’s democracy, its secular foundations and pluralistic traditions. The government says the video recording through which al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri made the >announcement — the group’s most direct call ever for jihad in India — is genuine. Even so, the message sounds like a recruitment pitch by a group that has no following on the ground and is taking a shot in the dark. Coming soon after the pull that the Islamic State seems to have exerted on a few >Indian youth through a campaign on the social media, al-Qaeda apparently believes there is a market for jihad in India that is waiting to be exploited. The video also supports the theory of rivalry between the two groups — though the IS was born from al-Qaeda, the older organisation has denounced its offshoot and cut off all links with it. Whatever the reason for the announcement, there is certainly no room for complacency on the part of the >Indian security establishment. After the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India has struggled, largely unsuccessfully, to set up a streamlined intelligence gathering system that can also read and effectively respond to inputs from the ground. Indeed, from the ease with which the IS has been able to lure some youngsters from India, it is clear that the internal security apparatus is far from reaching that goal.
There would be no bigger mistake, though, than to treat this purely as a >security issue . The portents from the video must not be allowed to become a justification for a heavy-handed response that would end up treating members of an entire community as suspects. As recent episodes have shown, there is a worrying tendency among police forces across India to respond to terror threats or attacks by detaining young Muslim men, sometimes on the flimsiest of grounds. There is also a pattern of acting on complaints against social media content in a manner that threatens individual liberties. If al-Qaeda is on a fishing expedition in India, it is because it believes there are disgruntled sections in the Muslim community with which it can build up its base. The >Modi government’s and the BJP’s best response to the threat by al-Qaeda would be to address the causes for such disenchantment. Reining in communally polarising political rhetoric of the kind that is roiling U.P. now, would be a welcome first step.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-room-for-complacency/article6384030.ece
6,9,2014,Justice as a Socratic process,"It may appear to be a mere question of procedure, but by mandating an oral hearing the Supreme Court has imparted greater substance to the disposal of review petitions of those sentenced to death. With a finesse that has come to be the hallmark of the Court in dealing with the issue of >death penalty in recent years, a five-Judge Constitution Bench has carved out a significant exception to the general rule that review petitions need not be heard in open court, but instead may be disposed of by circulation among the judges. Faced with an earlier Constitution Bench verdict upholding the rule, Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman, writing on behalf of the majority of four judges, has adopted the only mode of reasoning by which the Bench could have allowed the prayer for an oral hearing: by making >open court hearing a constitutional requirement under Article 21 and anchoring the rule on the irreversibility of carrying out the death sentence. Secondly, the majority has concluded that oral hearing is an integral part of ‘reasonable procedure’, by considering the possibility of two judicial minds coming to diametrically opposite conclusions on the same facts and circumstances as to whether the death penalty would be warranted. The scope for >reviewing a decision that has attained judicial finality is indeed narrow, and is confined to the ground of error apparent on the face of the record. However, even the remotest chance of altering it is enough to justify an oral hearing.
Oral hearing in >review matters was dispensed with in the light of the docket explosion and a ‘baby boom’ in review petitions. Normally, given that a full trial and hearing at two appellate levels precede the resort to review jurisdiction, denying oral hearing at that stage may not violate the objective of public justice or reduce disposal to the outcome of a ‘secret conclave’. However, death sentences impinge on the right to life, which is at the apex of a rights pyramid in which personal liberty and other fundamental rights come immediately below. While the Court did not concede the plea that >all cases attracting the death sentence be heard by a Bench of five judges, it has agreed that >review petitions are often “inartistically drafted”, and disposing them of solely based on written grounds may not meet the ends of justice. It has quoted Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer with approval that “the power of the Socratic process and the instant clarity of the Bar-Bench dialogue are too precious to be parted with.” After a series of judgments expanding the Court’s clemency jurisdiction, the verdict in favour of a limited 30-minute oral hearing before a Bench of three judges will significantly enhance the value of due process in a country that, unfortunately, still retains the death penalty.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/justice-as-a-socratic-process/article6384029.ece
13,9,2014,How not to reinvent the wheel,"The declaration by Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa in an interview to The Hindu that he is prepared to talk to Tamil political parties on a meaningful process of devolution is a welcome step forward. After the Sri Lankan military’s defeat of the LTTE, it was expected that the political aspects of reconciliation between the majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamils would be easy to settle. A framework for devolution has existed since 1987 under the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution. Yet post-war, the political question has been as difficult to resolve as the human rights issues that have since surfaced. For one, as reiterated by President Rajapaksa in the interview, the government refuses to share police powers with the province, even though these are provided for by the Constitution. Powers over land have been another bone of contention, with the Sri Lankan Supreme Court ruling last year that they are vested in the central government, and not the province. Tamil parties have understandably felt that a Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) in which the ruling coalition has overwhelming representation will end up diluting the 13th Amendment further. The main Opposition parties have boycotted it. This is why the Tamil National Alliance, which is the main Tamil political grouping, has stayed away from it. What it wants as a precondition for joining the PSC is a commitment from the government that the 13th Amendment will be the starting point for deliberations, which will also take into account the recommendations of previous government-appointed committees on the Tamil political question.
The issue has been further hobbled by the looming military presence in the Tamil-dominated North. The Governor of the province, in whom much authority is vested, is a former Army General, hardly the kind of figure to inspire trust in a post-conflict situation. As well, the Tamil demand for “maximum devolution” without being specific on its idea of a lasting solution is problematic, especially as some TNA constituents are of the view that the 13th Amendment should be scratched as it is too limited in scope. What is required to break out of the impasse is an honest commitment from both sides to the possibilities for maximum power-sharing within a united Sri Lanka. What is needed equally is an unequivocal commitment by the Rajapaksa government that it is prepared to conduct a fair and credible internal enquiry against those in the military responsible for the alleged war crimes, including disappearances. An international inquiry will be definitely intrusive, but thus far the measures taken by the Sri Lankan government seem aimed more at window-dressing for the international community than at providing the healing touch.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-how-not-to-reinvent-the-wheel/article6405608.ece
13,9,2014,Neither victims nor perpetrators,"Today’s victims are tomorrow’s perpetrators; but this state of affairs is not inevitable. That is the burden of the 2014 UNICEF report, titled “Hidden in Plain Sight”. It says the physical, sexual and emotional abuse of children is so pervasive because there is a high level of acceptance around these habitual behaviours. Also, there is that level of acceptance only because such violence in fact takes place in settings where boys and girls should normally feel safe. This scenario is evidently most unfortunate, but perhaps not quite surprising. A 2013 report by the World Health Organization, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the South African Medical Research Council estimated that globally, intimate partners were behind 38 per cent of incidents of murder of women. Data from 190 countries sourced by the UNICEF study shows that violent discipline is the most common practice. Six out of ten children in the 2-14 age group are subjected to physical punishment by caregivers. Nearly one out of three adolescents has either bullied their peers or have themselves experienced the humiliation. Nearly a quarter of all girls in the 15-19 age group report physical violence and one in ten girls under 20 years are subjected to forced sexual acts. As it is often the case, the report cautions that victims of extreme violence in their early years, end up as perpetrators themselves.
Yet, there is growing evidence that this cycle of violence can be broken, the report argues, provided the lid of silence and denial is lifted. In particular, it points to the success of several interventions aimed at strengthening the child-rearing skills of parents and caregivers. Techniques of non-violent discipline to promote positive interaction between parents and children and sharing knowledge about early child development are some of the other proven strategies. Openness to imbibe novel approaches that are more in tune with modern-day life would enable communities to find parenting a joyful experience. To be sure, time-tested and humane practices have an important role in child development and are critical to the transmission of cultural values down generations. The emotional scars are the most damaging, but not to be wished away are the astronomical economic burdens, as well as irreversible health effects, of violence against children. UNICEF refers to a study in East Asia and the Pacific, which estimated the cost of maltreatment in a single year at $150-160 billion, or 2 per cent of that region’s Gross Domestic Product. Another study, in the United States, found the cost over a life-time of confirmed maltreatment in just a single year to be about $124 billion. Children deserve a better deal; and it is the adults who can make the difference.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-neither-victims-nor-perpetrators/article6405609.ece
15,9,2014,When winning is not enough,"It is not often that an opposition party comes under greater pressure than the ruling party ahead of an election. However, as >Maharashtra and Haryana prepare to go to the polls next month, the benchmark for performance is not the 2009 Assembly elections that voted the Congress to power, but the Lok Sabha election this year that saw a Bharatiya Janata Party wave sweeping through the two States. No one expects the Congress to return to power in Maharashtra or Haryana, but for the BJP, any showing that falls even marginally short of its vote share in the Lok Sabha election would be seen as a setback and as a reflection on the performance of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre. The Congress won just one of the 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana, and in Maharashtra, in alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party a total of only six of 48 seats. Clearly, the Assembly elections are for the BJP to lose. Both the Prithviraj Chavan government in Maharashtra and the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government in Haryana have little to show for their years in power, and the BJP must be hoping to ride on the anti-incumbency sentiment more than on the performance of the Modi government. In its first few months, the BJP-led government at the Centre did succeed in infusing hope among large sections of the people, but in terms of results on the ground there is little to show as yet.
In Maharashtra, the death of its strongman Gopinath Munde in a road accident soon after the Lok Sabha election has greatly reduced the BJP’s claim for the leadership of the alliance with the Shiv Sena. The national party performed much better than the regional ally in the Lok Sabha polls, and is therefore driving a hard bargain in the seat-sharing negotiations. But as in 1995, the chief ministership is likely to go to the Shiv Sena in the event of the alliance coming to power. The only difference is that the Sena supremo, Uddhav Thackeray, is likely to stake his claim instead of attempting to wield power through ‘remote control’ as his father Bal Thackeray did. In Haryana, the BJP seems to be in a better position if only because it does not need an ally to come to power. The party has truly outgrown its former ally, the Indian National Lok Dal, which, like the Congress, did not have a great record during its years in government. Thus, for the first time, Haryana could see a BJP Chief Minister if the Lok Sabha pattern of voting holds for the Assembly polls too. In both States the BJP could well record its best-ever performance in an Assembly election, but even so the party will have reasons for worry if the results pale in comparison to those in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. Sometimes, winning alone is not enough.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/when-winning-is-not-enough/article6410185.ece
15,9,2014,Outreach plans for scientists,"The decision of the Union Minister of Science and Technology to tap the talent pool of about 6,000 scientists from institutions and centres that come under the umbrella of the Department of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Earth Sciences and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research >to give lectures to school and college students is a good initiative. Scientists dedicating 12 hours a year each to engage with students to impart scientific knowledge and inculcate a scientific temper in them is bound to go a long way in attracting young talent to science and grooming them. This is a much-needed step as India, like several other countries, faces an alarming situation of steadily decreasing numbers of school students opting for science, and a lack of long-term interest among those who have chosen it. While the intent behind the initiative is good, a coordinated approach by different Ministries would be more effective in achieving the goal. Not involving scientists from the 32 institutions of the Indian Council of Medical Research and similar nodal bodies is unjustified. The lapse becomes all the more glaring as the outreach programmes are to be made mandatory and scientists’ performance is to be evaluated once every three years. As it stands, the initiative could cause resentment among the 6,000 scientists as their counterparts in institutions that come under other nodal agencies face no such compulsions. The government should act swiftly to ensure that all the scientists working in government institutions become involved in student outreach programmes. The metrics of their performance can be used to reward them while assessing their research proposals and promotions.
Several institutions and individuals in the U.S. engage in student outreach programmes and India has a great deal to learn from their experience. We should make sure that as we belatedly embark on this ambitious goal, we conscientiously avoid committing the same mistakes that have been seen elsewhere. The first and foremost pitfall to be avoided is compelling scientists to teach science by replacing teachers. Teaching should be made active rather than passive. Excellent results can be achieved when scientists guide students and teachers to do real science that is open-ended, inquiry-based and driven by a sense of exploration — which only scientists are best-equipped to offer. This will foster critical thinking and imagination and impart skills of scientific investigation. Also, it will arouse children’s curiosity and set off a series of questions prior to, during and after a project. Information and knowledge thus gained remain indelible, and science becomes fun. The Indian Space Research Organisation’s work of guiding students from a handful of engineering colleges to build satellites, which were eventually launched, is one of the best examples of imaginative student outreach programmes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/outreach-plans-for-scientists/article6410187.ece
16,9,2014,Fair deal for transgenders,"The Union Social Justice Ministry’s >move to seek clarifications and modifications to the Supreme Court’s April 15, 2014 judgment that directed that the transgender community be formally >recognised as the ‘third gender’ and accorded backward class reservation in education and employment has some validity, but it also indicates some misunderstanding of the landmark ruling. The Court had directed that the recommendations of an expert committee, formed earlier to study the problems of the transgender community, be implemented within six months in the light of its legal declaration. The government now says the committee had submitted its report on January 27 itself — months before the verdict — and that it would require more than six months to implement the recommendations. The Court would have noted its contents, more crucially, the panel’s comprehensive definition of ‘transgender’ in a manner that would not leave out anyone from that marginalised section, had it been brought to its notice in time. The Ministry has also sought to make an issue out of some observations regarding ‘transgender’ being used as an umbrella term to include lesbian, gay and bisexual individuals too. The government is right when it says giving a wider sense to the term ‘transgender’ may create needless complications, but it has failed to note that the judgment unequivocally states, not once but twice, that it is restricting itself to hijras and other variants of the term, excluding categories such as lesbian and gay.
The judgment essentially dealt with two major aspects — one, that gender identity is not a mere binary concept; and two, that a section of society is vulnerable to discrimination based on apparent non-conformity to such a binary notion of gender as well as sexual orientation. In principle, it has made non-discrimination against the entire marginalised community a constitutional norm. The Ministry may require some more time or feel entitled to a clarification or two, but it is difficult to believe that it finds the references to the LGBT community and the term ‘eunuch’ in the judgment to be major obstacles to complying with the directions. Also, it has raised a doubt whether transgenders can be straightaway declared backward when such classification is within the province of the National Commission for Backward Classes. This is hardly an insurmountable difficulty. The Commission may be approached for such an enquiry and recommendation, as the reasons to consider them backward are already set out in the judgment. The clarification petition may be an opportunity for the Court to marry its own legal declaration with the expert panel’s conclusions so that the transgender community gets the constitutional relief it is entitled to.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fair-deal-for-transgenders/article6413418.ece
16,9,2014,Disinvestment takes off,"The disinvestment programme for 2014-15 seems to have kicked off in right earnest with the Union Cabinet >clearing the sale of government stake in three major public sector companies — Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Coal India (CIL) and National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC). The sale of 5 per cent stake in ONGC, 10 per cent in CIL and 11.36 per cent in NHPC will generate over Rs.45,000 crore at the current market prices of these shares. The government had budgeted Rs.43,425 crore for the current fiscal from disinvestment and an additional Rs.15,000 crore from the sale of residual stake in already privatised companies such as Bharat Aluminium and Hindustan Zinc. A successful execution of the stake sale plan now approved will go a long way in helping Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to meet his promise of keeping the fiscal deficit at 4.1 per cent for the current year. What augurs well for the government is that the markets are now buoyant, with the S&P BSE Sensex ruling at historic highs and foreign institutional investors actively buying stocks. With a proposal to increase retail quota in the offer for sale to 20 per cent from 10 per cent currently, there is scope for greater retail participation, especially if the government offers concessions to retail investors in the offer price.
The disinvestment programme, since it began in the early 1990s, has managed to meet the budgeted targets only thrice, and the best year was 2012-13 when the government raised Rs.23,957 crore from stake sales. This will, therefore, be the best-ever year for disinvestment revenues, but there could be a couple of hurdles for the government to cross along the way. The employees’ unions at CIL are up in arms, resisting what they call the “privatisation” of the company in which the government now holds 89.65 per cent. There could be tricky days ahead in getting the unions, which have threatened a strike, on board. Such an eventuality could bring down the valuation of CIL and consequently the proceeds from stake sale. The choice of NHPC is also intriguing given that it has not been performing very well. Plagued by dues from some state utilities and delays in project execution, the company is heading for a loss this fiscal year, according to its own communication to the government. The price that the share will fetch may therefore not be optimal for the government. As for ONGC, clarity on the gas pricing policy of the government will help investors to value the company better. The downtrend in global oil prices will reduce the subsidy burden and increase ONGC’s profitability. Having got Cabinet clearance, the disinvestment department should move quickly to complete the sale process and capitalise on the current positive atmosphere.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/disinvestment-takes-off/article6413419.ece
17,9,2014,A note of caution,"Despair rarely follows euphoria this closely: within four months of having recorded its best-ever electoral performance in Uttar Pradesh, the Bharatiya Janata Party seems to be >struggling to retain its traditional bases in India’s most populous State. After taking 71 of the 80 seats in the Lok Sabha election, the party could win only three of the 11 Assembly by-elections. The BJP fared worse not only in comparison to the Lok Sabha election but also in relation to the 2012 Assembly election, in which it had finished a poor third behind the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party. Far from being able to repeat its success in the Lok Sabha election, the BJP is ceding ground to the SP even in some of its traditional strongholds. The SP, battered and bruised in the Lok Sabha polls, won eight seats in this round, netting gains at the expense of the BJP. The results from Rajasthan likewise gave the BJP little reason to cheer. Of the four seats, the party could win just one; the Congress, which won the other three, can now seriously believe it is on the comeback trail in the State where it had drawn a blank in May. In Gujarat, the BJP won six of the nine seats, but if the 2013 Assembly election is the reference point, the tally is down by three. The Congress is still playing catch up in Narendra Modi’s home-State, but the signs are ominous: the BJP is slipping in Gujarat, the State it had presented as the governance model for the rest of the country.
No one will claim that these results indicate a sudden onset of nationwide >disenchantment with the Modi government at the Centre or with the BJP as a party. But several developments have taken place in Uttar Pradesh since the Lok Sabha election, including a renewed thrust by some of the middle-rung leaders against religious conversions and the so-called ‘love jihad’, supposedly a scheme to convert young Hindu women to Islam through Muslim men professing love and marriage. The vote in the Lok Sabha polls for the BJP was a vote for change, a vote for improved governance and development. A return to the politics of polarisation was certainly not what was expected of the party. Coming after the earlier round in Bihar and Karnataka where its performance was not too impressive, these results should certainly serve as a note of caution to the BJP leadership against indulging the likes of Yogi Adityanath who specialises in making hate speeches in communally sensitive areas. The big message in this round of by-elections is that the BJP cannot take the voters for granted. People were quick to gather behind Mr. Modi’s promise of growth and development. But if he cannot deliver on his promise or if his party returns to its politics of communal polarisation, they will just as quickly move away.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bypoll-results-a-note-of-caution/article6416554.ece
17,9,2014,A historic opportunity,"Chinese President Xi Jinping arrives in India under extraordinary circumstances, when the political and economic dimensions of the international system are undergoing a profound transformation. There are distinct indicators that the era of a unipolar world, led by the United States following the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, is giving way to multipolarity, anchored also by countries that are part of the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) grouping and the G-20. Both President Xi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are fully aware of the larger geopolitical context, where emerging powers have a first-rate chance of reshaping the global political and economic architecture in more equitable terms. The two had worked closely during the BRICS summit in Brazil; their “chemistry” playing its part in pragmatic negotiations that resulted in the formation of the BRICS Bank.
Hemmed in by the Pivot to Asia led by Washington and its allies, including Japan, Australia and the Philippines, to contain the perceived rise of an aggressive China, Beijing has responded with its bold home-grown riposte — the Silk Road initiatives, that include the proposal to form the Maritime Silk Road (MSR). The Chinese are bending over backwards to assign a benign role to the MSR based on trade and investment as well as physical and cyber-connectivity among a large number of countries belonging to the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and South Asia, including India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India has already supported China’s initiative on the formation of the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar (BCIM) corridor, but would have to take a call on the MSR, at a time when China’s detractors are slamming Beijing for its alleged India-containment strategy, borrowing from the “string of pearls” theory. With its enhanced strategic autonomy, New Delhi is now well-placed to positively and deeply engage with China with confidence on a bilateral platform or within the larger collective folds of the MSR initiative and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). As President Xi arrives, Mr. Modi has a rare chance to seize the moment by stating India’s political intent of solving the border row between the two countries, beginning with solid and measurable steps to clarify the Line of Actual Control, and to root out distracting and headline-grabbing border incidents. With the two countries accounting for a collective population of 2.5 billion, Sino-Indian cooperation is based on hard-headed realism and goodwill. It can have a major impact on shifting the global balance of power, as well as on the realisation of an “Asian century” visualised ahead of Independence by Jawaharlal Nehru, during the historic Asian Relations Conference.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/xi-jinping-in-india-a-historic-opportunity/article6416555.ece
18,9,2014,Lessons from a disaster,"As life slowly acquires a semblance of normalcy in >Jammu and Kashmir, the extent of damage caused by the floods is unfolding. People who had abandoned their marooned houses or were evacuated are slowly getting back and >assessing the damage as the water level recedes. A long haul is ahead. According to industry body Assocham, the loss in terms of damage to trade establishments, hotels and restaurants, horticulture, the handicrafts sector, transport infrastructure and communications facilities may add up to Rs.5,700 crore. While traffic on the arterial Jammu-Srinagar highway has been restored partially, most other road systems are still in limbo. The ambitious Jammu-Srinagar-Baramulla railway line project has suffered setbacks. The death toll cannot be reliably determined as yet, given the number of persons who have been listed as missing. A major source of worry pertains to the possibility of spread of diseases after the water recedes. Livelihoods, including in the tourism and farming sectors, need to be restored. The number of people rescued by the armed forces and the National Disaster Response Force is close to 2.5 lakh. The armed forces and the NDRF have played a stellar role here. The Army alone deployed around 30,000 troops. Some questions have been raised about the level of coordination among different agencies, but overall it has been a creditable effort so far.
While looking at the challenges of relief and reconstruction that lie ahead, this is also the time to consider the lessons for the State from the extreme event. While there is agreement over the fact that the level of rainfall was unprecedented, intense and rather sudden, leaving little room for timely warnings, the environmental factors that underlie the tragedy need to be given a hard look. Ecological degradation caused by unplanned development and urbanisation, and failure to preserve wetlands, has played a role. Wetlands act as a sponge, and their loss is bound to have serious repercussions. A report by the Bombay Natural History Society has mentioned that the Wular lake, once spread over 20,200 ha, has shrunk to 2,400 ha. The Dal lake in Srinagar has been reduced to almost half its earlier size, to 1,200 ha. According to the Centre for Science and Environment, over the last century more than 50 per cent of the lakes, ponds and wetlands of Srinagar have been encroached upon. The banks of the Jhelum have been overrun, reducing its drainage capacity. The story is the same with the Tawi in Jammu. Flash floods in this river washed away some 400 buildings and inundated scores of colonies, many of them in breach of the Jammu Master Plan. This, then, has been a costly environmental wake-up call for Jammu and Kashmir — as it was for Uttarakhand a year ago.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lessons-from-a-disaster/article6420004.ece
18,9,2014,After the great Bengal scam,"Creating a huge political wave that threatens to wash away several political reputations is the Saradha Ponzi Scheme scam of West Bengal. More arrests are revealing scores of new suspects who took either astronomical salaries by cheque or unaccounted money in cash from Saradha chief Sudipta Sen. In the 1950s, industrialist Haridas Mundhra of Kolkata convinced the Central government to put crores of rupees of public money in his personal enterprise. But Mundhra’s mischief or Sanchayita Investments’ collection of over Rs. 100 crore in the 1980s is a pittance compared to the quantum of money involved in the most recent scam, named after the State’s beloved godmother, Saradha. The novelty of the scam lies in its sheer size. Currently, the size of the scam is estimated at a little over $1 billion, in a State that has a debt burden of more than $30 billion. But newer estimates are emerging as unknown ‘monsters’ are unearthed. The money was raised predominantly from cash-strapped peasants and daily-wage earners during the last years of CPI(M) rule and the system flourished after the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) arrived. People from every social bracket — the flag-bearers of Bengal’s intelligentsia, bureaucrats, sports administrators, media magnates, industrialists and politicians — accepted or extracted favours, depending on one’s degree of access to power. An absurd transfer of wealth — reminiscent of the drain of resources from India to England before Independence — from the poor to the rich was orchestrated in the countryside. Bengal’s nobility hailed Mr. Sen for the transfer, and the ensuing inaction of the bhadrolok made the job of the CBI relatively straightforward.
But then, the CBI’s credibility is often questioned by the very people who once ran it. Its former Directors have accused the agency of derailing investigations under “political pressure”. The present Director is under the scanner, fuelling speculation about where the Saradha probe will now head. On the political front, the AITC may well be under pressure owing to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s sudden rise, but Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is herself no greenhorn in politics. She has for now >managed to convince many people that she, and she alone, can return the stolen money. Her cadres are spreading the message that, while Ms. Banerjee’s men may have swallowed the money, she would return it, placing the individual way above the party. Such a strategy to elevate a person above the party may work, or may not work, depending on the quantum that Ms. Banerjee is able to return in the 20 months before the next Assembly election in 2016. In the run-up to that poll, the Saradha scam is bound to have a major impact. How credibly the various political parties deal with the fallout is going to influence the outcome significantly.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/after-the-great-bengal-scam/article6420005.ece
19,9,2014,Uneven recovery,"If there is one clear signal that comes out of the latest set of economic >data released on inflation, industrial growth and trade, it is this: the recovery process is on but it is uneven and still in first gear. Wholesale price inflation was down at a five-year low of 3.7 per cent in August but retail price inflation, which is the benchmark for the Reserve Bank of India, is still sticky at 7.8 per cent. Industrial output growth was almost flat at 0.5 per cent in July after a 3.9 per cent rise in June, while export growth fell to a five-month low of 2.35 per cent in August. The see-saw in >industrial output, especially of consumer durables and capital goods, clearly shows that the recovery is tentative as yet. Of course, the crucial automobiles sector is beginning to show firm signs of a turnaround with passenger car manufacturers seeing a return of demand. Maruti’s Chairman R.C. Bhargava is on record as predicting at least 5 per cent growth for the industry this fiscal and a 10 per cent growth for his own company. The positive impulses from the auto industry are encouraging because it can have a cascading impact on downstream industries such as ancillaries that host thousands of jobs. Yet, it is worrying that the capital goods industry is still not seeing a viable change in its fortunes. If anything, this indicates that companies are still not willing to commit investment in fresh capacities.
This fact is also borne out by the poor credit offtake from banks. Despite the RBI’s efforts to free up funds through the two cuts made in statutory liquidity ratio over the last few months, banks have not seen any increase in lending, which is something that RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan alluded to a few weeks ago. What lends confidence are two factors — the favourable show by the monsoon in the later half and the downtrend in global commodity prices, notably crude oil. The latter is bound to have a salutary impact on inflation and the fiscal deficit; diesel subsidy, for instance, has already been wiped out. With the next monetary policy announcement of the RBI close at hand, pressure is rising on the central bank to review its hawkish stance now that retail inflation is close to its benchmark of 8 per cent by January 2015. Dr. Rajan, of course does not seem to be in the mood to oblige, going by his remarks a couple of days ago, and rightly so. There is little point in tinkering with rates unless the downtrend in inflation is clearly established, which is not the case now. The approaching festival season will be crucial for industrial growth as purchases of durables and automobiles generally picks up during this period. That may well determine the robustness of the ongoing economic recovery.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/uneven-recovery/article6423462.ece
19,9,2014,Crippling cost of disparities,"Redressing gender imbalances in employment could remedy the current climate of sluggish global economic recovery, the Labour Ministers of the Group of 20 countries were advised last week. This is perhaps the single most significant theme in the four joint reports issued by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Bank Group and the International Labour Organisation ahead of a meeting in Melbourne. One of them dwells on the implications of the unfolding demographic transition — ageing and fall in fertility rates. Whereas shrinkage in the size of the workforce on account of ageing may vary depending on the time of superannuation, declining fertility would invariably result in reductions in the number of new entrants to labour markets. The economic case for women’s participation in the workforce could not have been stronger, the report contends. Female employment rates — the share of employed women to the total number of women in the working age population — in the bloc have seen a steady rise, reaching 60 per cent in 2012. However, there are variations of more than 10 percentage points in 15 of the 20 countries. These range from 7 percentage points in Canada to over 50 points in India and Saudi Arabia. The proportion of youth who are not in education, employment or training, at 10 per cent in many countries, is a matter of concern for India’s women.
Recovery in the G20 is also threatened because, with over 100 million people unemployed and 447 million living on less than $2 a day, consumption and investment are constrained, argues a second report. These concerns are important not merely in instrumental terms; they reflect underlying informal conditions of employment and the low quality of jobs which run counter to inclusive growth, shows a third study. Further, the G20 countries account for about 70 per cent (1.3 million) of global deaths from occupational diseases and 221,000 fatal accidents annually. Recurrent industrial mishaps in India, China, Turkey and other emerging economies in the bloc underpin the sharp discrepancies in compliance with international safety standards. Addressing each of these challenging scenarios acquires urgency; not in the least, against the backdrop of the G20 target to reorient policies to realise a 2 per cent addition to overall gross domestic product in the next five years. As the forum brings together the governments of nearly two-thirds of the world’s population, its wide-ranging initiatives could potentially transform the global response to the most pressing challenges of this century. The meeting of G20 Finance Ministers that is coming up this weekend at Cairns cannot afford to dilute the focus. As such, G20 leaders, who are set to meet in Brisbane in November, should strive to impart greater momentum to the changes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/crippling-cost-of-disparities/article6423463.ece
26,9,2014,Re-defining the engagement,"With > 35 engagements planned over five days, Prime Minister >Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States will be a whirl of events. He will take centre-stage in Madison Square Garden and Central Park, not to mention the world stage at the United Nations General Assembly, and meet, albeit fleetingly, dozens of leaders on his maiden official visit to the U.S. On the back of those, he will meet with President Barack Obama, for an opportunity to “redefine India-U.S. relations” and set the course for the next few years. But this is easier said than done. India and the U.S. have had differences over several issues for years now, from New Delhi’s insistence on >uncapped nuclear suppliers’ liability, to trade issues including food stocks and the protection of Indian pharmaceutical companies that deliver inexpensive alternatives to drugs that are either unaffordable or whose intellectual property rights are extended unreasonably after expiry. For its part, the U.S. government has justifiably felt let down over the pace of economic reforms promised by the UPA government; leading CEOs and investment bankers may well have much to say when they meet Mr. Modi over breakfast in New York. Over the past few years, India and the U.S. have also drifted apart on global issues ranging from the WTO and climate change positions to U.S. interventions in Libya and India’s refusal to back the Western call for regime change in Syria despite much pressure. India’s careful balancing act on Russian actions in Crimea also led to considerable unhappiness in Washington. As a result, the six-month-long impasse over the >Devyani Khobragade incident was as much a symptom of the ‘disconnect’ between India and the U.S., as it was of the outrage that it sparked in both countries.
Former diplomat Ashley Tellis, who has a deep understanding of the New Delhi-Washington relationship, wrote this week that the relationship has “lost its foundational moorings”. If those moorings are to be found, Mr. Modi and President Obama must spend time together, not trying to resolve every issue between the two countries but to focus instead on finding philosophical common ground. Mr. Modi’s bilateral engagements so far with >Japan, >China and the U.S. have been high on ‘deliverables’ but they have faltered when it comes to developing a shared strategic vision of the world. While garnering deals and MoUs and re-energising investor-confidence is important, more critical it is to reestablish a common understanding of the world between the two largest democracies. The former will follow the latter, and not the other way round. And this will form the road map for India and the U.S., if they are to become what President Obama promised would be the “ >defining partnership of the 21st century”.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/redefining-the-engagement/article6446664.ece
26,9,2014,Dealing with the coal burden,"The >cancellation of all but four of the coal blocks allocated in an arbitrary manner since 1993, was the only logical course open to the Supreme Court after it held the entire process illegal last month. While corporate India agonises over the development, which undoubtedly will have far-reaching consequences, it is also an opportunity to usher in a fresh, transparent means of apportioning finite natural resources. For far too long the country has been beset by a morally compromised system in which public policy is often overshadowed by power, influence and ‘connections’. Arbitrary, non-transparent and ad hoc processes have eroded public faith in decision-making. The verdict, similar to the earlier one that >cancelled 122 telecom licences allotted illegally, is an affirmation of the principle that the courts will not countenance the undesirable nexus between public office holders and big business, or anyone profiting from venality. The Court was largely encouraged to take the decisive step of scrapping all the 214 coal block allocations because the National Democratic Alliance regime took the unambiguous stand that it is capable of handling the fallout of such a sweeping measure. It has given the government and the functional mines some breathing time by making the cancellations operative from March 31, 2015. Six months on, the public sector Coal India Ltd. will step in to take over the 40 mines that are functional now and the six that are on the verge of starting operations. The Court also wants the ongoing CBI investigations to continue.
While the verdict is quite sound, some questions remain. The Court has accepted the government’s claim that it is prepared to face the consequences of the cancellation of all allocations and move forward. It has based its order solely on its faith that the government and Coal India Ltd. have all the answers. If CIL had the capability to supply the required quantity of coal of sufficient quality to all users, the need for captive mining would not have arisen in the first place. If there is a significant shortfall in supply after CIL takes over, users may have to import coal at high cost. While it has imposed an additional levy of Rs.295 a tonne on the companies, there is no guidance on the fate of the loans advanced by banks. If and when an auction is held to allocate the coal blocks in a fair manner, will the successful bidders be asked to pay for the amount spent by the earlier allottees and also take over the debt owed to banks? The future of end-use projects that have commenced solely on the expectation that these blocks would supply the coal needed for their operation is also not clear. The government will now have to come up with a plan of action to deal with the economic fallout of this extraordinary verdict.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dealing-with-the-coal-burden/article6446663.ece
27,9,2014,Showcasing ‘Make in India’,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi could not have asked for a better boost to his Make in India campaign than this: ratings agency Standard & Poor’s (S&P) has revised the outlook on India to “Stable” from “Negative”, while keeping the “BBB–” rating unchanged. One of the significant reasons for the upward revision according to S&P was that “the new government has both the willingness and capacity to implement reforms necessary to restore some of India’s lost growth potential. This is exactly what Mr. Modi appears eager to convey through his Make in India campaign, launched to a packed audience in New Delhi’s Vigyan Bhavan on Thursday. The fact that the top brass of Corporate India appeared to be in full attendance at the launch showed the seriousness with which the campaign has been received. Mr. Modi struck all the right notes, pointing out how Indian companies were forced to consider investing outside the country due to policy flip-flops and delays in clearances. In that sense, his FDI — First Develop India — was a signal to companies that his government would create an enabling environment for investment, which he expected they would reciprocate by committing their energies and investments to the country. It is also significant that he thought it fit to point out India’s low ranking as regards the ease of doing business, assuring investors thereby that he was sensitising the bureaucracy to get its act together on this critical point. The jury will be out on this issue, going by the experience of the collapse of similar efforts to untangle red tape.
It is interesting to note that the Prime Minister did not dangle incentives to attract investors, a practice that has been in vogue until now. His promise to create a ‘business-friendly’ environment is probably more appropriate in today’s context of fiscal prudence. Indeed, S&P has referred to the fiscal constraints in terms of the high subsidy burden on the government, observing that successive governments have been unable to either increase the revenue base or curb expenditure. The remarkable turnaround in the external finances of the country with the current account deficit at a low of 1.8 per cent has obviously been an important factor, along with political stability, for S&P’s outlook revision. That said, it would be wrong to be complacent on this issue and assume that the job has been done. If anything, with the growth impulse returning and the prospect of investments picking up, the current account deficit could widen in the months ahead. It is indeed imperative that the government’s actions should match its words. For now, certainly, there is fresh wind in Mr. Modi’s sails as he prepares to address the CEOs of top American multinationals in New York on Monday.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/showcasing-make-in-india/article6450220.ece
27,9,2014,Unwarranted rollback,"The National Democratic Alliance government should weigh the huge human implications of its move to curtail the reach of the world’s largest public works employment programme – schemes under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). At stake in this decade-old law for millions of rural unskilled labourers across the country is the legally enforceable right to 100 days of work a year for a minimum wage. Given the thrust on employment generation, the ratio of expenditure on labour to materials was pegged at 60-40 per cent of the total allocation. The proportion is to be revised to 51-49 per cent, according to an announcement by Rural Development Minister Nitin Gadkari. By the government’s own admission, there has been considerable underutilisation of funds meant for the materials component — only around 27 per cent in the past two years. Thus, the proposed increase in allocation for materials would necessarily eat into the share of the financing of the wage component of the MGNREGA, reducing employment generation. Apprehensions voiced by activists that the move would let loose rapacious contractors on to an arena designated to redress rural poverty may not be entirely without basis. Moreover, the decision to limit the programme to the tribal and backward districts could severely undermine its universal character, and further dilute the focus of MGNREGA.
At another level, as academic research has established, methods to improve the efficacy of the MGNREGA are strengthening the democratic process in myriad ways. Gram sabhas are proving to be vibrant bodies that undertake extensive social audits of public works. The widespread outcry to root out rampant corruption has led to routing payments through post offices and bank accounts. Further, despite the many challenges, the MGNREGA is reaching the rural poor, especially women, according to a 2012 World Bank study based on 2009-2010 National Sample Survey data. If anything, there is acute unmet demand for work under the programme in the poorest States, the study found. The benefits of the scheme to lift millions out of the below-$1-a-day level of poverty have been acknowledged by the International Labour Organisation. As a key supporting party of the United Progressive Alliance government that launched the MGNREGA, the ruling dispensation in Uttar Pradesh has no small interest in ensuring its success. Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav should facilitate the smooth conduct of the Central Bureau of Investigation probe in seven districts into alleged misuse of the funds. Above all, any rollback of schemes under the MGNREGA would hurt the BJP’s stated commitment to development.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unwarranted-rollback/article6450221.ece
28,9,2014,The long road to justice,"The conviction of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in the disproportionate assets case by a Special Court in Bangalore is a significant vindication of a vital constitutional principle — that the rule of law be upheld for all citizens including persons in high public office. Too often have members of the political class managed to get away with the abuse of power, betraying the trust of the people who voted them to office. Ms. Jayalalithaa is the first serving Chief Minister to be convicted under the Prevention of Corruption Act; before her only a handful of political leaders have had to face jail terms in corruption cases. But this conviction did not happen as a matter of ordinary legal course. At every stage, attempts were made to obstruct and delay the judicial process. It is commendable that the prosecution and the judges involved in this case stood up to the pressures and upheld the principles of justice and fairness. The case was moved to Bangalore in 2003 after the Supreme Court found several attempts to subvert the trial during Ms. Jayalalithaa’s earlier term starting in 2001. Yet, despite the protracted and tortuous course that the legal process took in this case, justice seems to have been finally done.
However, more important than bringing to justice persons abusing public office is establishing systemic checks to prevent abuse of power and influence-peddling. In the last two years or so, there has been a popular upsurge against corruption in high places. While Parliament was forced to take steps to put in place a national anti-corruption institution, the Lok Pal, the judiciary has taken the lead in this regard. But the time taken for the completion of this marathon trial — 18 years — is too long even for a case of this magnitude. To deal with corruption in public life, the country’s requirements are two-fold: a more effective legal framework to prevent the abuse of power, and procedural reform that would limit the duration of cases without adversely affecting the right of the accused to a fair trial. Saturday’s verdict has had some unfortunate repercussions. Incidents of violence were reported from several parts of Tamil Nadu. Whoever succeeds Ms. Jayalalithaa as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu must show statesmanship and political maturity, and ensure the maintenance of law and order without allowing AIADMK party cadre to spill their rage on the streets, directing violence at public property and ordinary citizens. Extra precautions must be taken to prevent any violence escalating into attacks on Kannadigas on account of the verdict being delivered by a court situated in Karnataka. Ms. Jayalalithaa still has avenues for appeal open to her, and Tamil Nadu should not be allowed to descend into a spiral of violence and destruction.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-long-road-to-justice/article11152861.ece
29,9,2014,Kashmir keeps turning up,"There has seldom been a time when the domestic politics of India and Pakistan have not intruded into efforts to normalise bilateral relations. When Nawaz Sharif spoke at the United Nations about a plebiscite in Kashmir, the Pakistan Prime Minister was not so much addressing India as he was audiences back home. Mr. Sharif has not yet emerged fully from his battle for survival against Imran Khan. The cricketer-turned-politician is now planning to widen his protests for Mr. Sharif’s resignation. The doggedness with which Mr. Khan is seeking to topple Mr. Sharif, and the parallel demands for regime change by Tahir ul-Qadri, a maverick cleric with a large following, have further weakened Pakistan’s democratic moorings. The Pakistan Prime Minister’s tense relations with the Army for a host of reasons — his determination to punish former Army chief Pervez Musharraf for the 1999 coup, and his avowed desire for friendly ties with India, to cite just two — have compounded his insecurity. There is no doubt that the New York speech was a move by Mr. Sharif to blunt criticism by his opponents and detractors that he has been soft on India, and an effort by him to buy some peace with the Army. Also, the Modi government’s abrupt cancellation of the Foreign Secretary-level talks last month in retaliation for the Pakistan envoy’s discussions with Hurriyat leaders in Delhi, did not help Mr. Sharif’s domestic situation. The demands on Kashmir that he pressed at the General Assembly were those he had not raised for years, at least not since the historic 1999 Lahore Declaration, to which he and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee were signatories.
The two sides seem dangerously close to turning the clock back on Kashmir, wiping out the progress made on the issue in the intervening years, when — if the principal actors of the period are to be believed — it was “a semicolon away” from resolution. The challenge now before India and Pakistan is to pull back before rhetoric hijacks the debate. That can be done only by restoring the dialogue, not by keeping a finger on the pause button, as India has done. It is encouraging that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his speech at the General Assembly, avoided a slanging match with Mr. Sharif, and instead reiterated India’s desire for “serious dialogue” with Pakistan in an “atmosphere free of violence”. That Pakistan remains eager to grasp the offer was evident in the conciliatory remarks made to The Hindu by Sartaj Aziz, adviser on foreign affairs to Mr. Sharif, after Mr. Modi’s speech. Enough opportunities for dialogue have been lost already. India and Pakistan cannot risk the dangers created by a vacuum in diplomacy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/india-pakistan-relations-kashmir-keeps-turning-up/article6455094.ece
29,9,2014,Paths to realignment,"Vaulting ambition and deep desperation are very different states of mind, but they could sometimes lead to similar kinds of action. If the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiv Sena parted ways because of their high stakes in Maharashtra, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party charted out their separate courses because they had little to lose in any case. Soon after the saffron alliance came apart, the NCP broke away from the Congress, throwing the electoral contest to the Assembly wide open. The Shiv Sena could not compromise on the post of Chief Minister for its pramukh Uddhav Thackeray, and on its status as the senior partner of the alliance; the BJP needed to spread its wings in Maharashtra to make the most of its Lok Sabha election victory. Neither was thus risk-averse in a high-stakes play, and the alliance could not hold. As for the NCP and the Congress, they had lost fighting the Lok Sabha election together, and going without an alliance in the Assembly election must have seemed a low-risk, worthwhile experiment in an otherwise hopeless game. The BJP was eager to eat into the Sena’s support base; and even if the best-case scenario of the party coming to power on its own does not materialise, there is always the option of reviving the alliance with the Sena post-election. The NCP surely thought its chances were better in a five-cornered contest with the BJP, the Shiv Sena, the Congress and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena than in a polarised battle. The NCP would also have calculated that, in the event of a hung Assembly it could make the most out of the few seats it was likely to win if it were free of the encumbrances of a pre-poll alliance with the Congress.
While the 2014 Assembly election is now an opportunity for the parties to test their individual strengths, alliance-free elections are surely not going to be the norm in Maharashtra. Realignments are likely soon after the election, once the parties have subjected their pre-poll aspirations to a reality check in the Assembly election. Just as important as the question of who would form the next government are little matters waiting for resolution. Is the BJP now stronger than the Sena? Will the MNS replace the Sena as the BJP’s ally? Is a BJP-NCP alliance possible? Is the Congress at its lowest point in Maharashtra? In the long term, Maharashtra 2014 might be remembered for the answers to these questions, no matter which party or combination of parties happens to form the government. At the very least, Maharashtra 2014 might separate the contenders from the pretenders, and reassess the fragmentation of the vote that followed the splits in the Congress and the Sena. If not mergers, the post-election scenario will certainly witness realignments.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bjp-and-shiv-sena-in-maharashtra-paths-to-realignment/article6455095.ece
30,9,2014,Calm on the frontiers,"The shadow of the latest bout of tensions on the Sino-Indian border has been lifted, setting the platform for focussed engagement between the two neighbours on a broad spectrum of issues. The breakthrough was announced in New York by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj following her talks with her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. The forces from the two sides will now pull back to their September 1 positions before the crisis erupted in the Chumar sector in Ladakh, along the unclarified Line of Actual Control (LAC). The withdrawal by the two militaries to their original positions will provide an opportunity to re-visit what Ms. Swaraj correctly observed was a “very historical” visit to India by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Both sides deserve credit for resolving the flare-up with maturity and resolve. The resolution of the standoff confirmed the robustness of the Border Defence Cooperation Agreement (BDCA) reached last year, which, by setting the detailed protocol for addressing a border crisis, allowed the two militaries to conduct an uninterrupted and successful dialogue. Prime Minister Narendra Modi deserves to be congratulated for stating publicly and plainly the necessity of settling the border, while showing great warmth in welcoming the visiting President. So does President Xi, for repeatedly pointing to the “big picture” during the visit, implying that the relationship that has the power to transform Asia cannot be held hostage to an unsettled border. While the crisis has been blown away, the time to rejoice has still not arrived, as the incident underscores the urgency of clarifying the LAC, and boldly striking a permanent deal on the Sino-Indian frontier. This will not be possible unless there is a decisive but carefully negotiated give-and-take process on territories along the border, requiring both sides, including public opinion in the two countries, to fully understand that historic accomplishments of this magnitude are never realised with a zero-sum mentality. Nevertheless, with the latest tensions defusing, the focus needs to shift to an interlocking agenda that has begun to emerge on the Sino-Indian horizon. Hemmed in by Washington’s doctrinal push for an “Asia Pivot”, the Chinese are looking for an Indian endorsement for the 21st century maritime Silk Road. Membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation is also on offer. But Ms. Swaraj has pitched India’s aspirations higher by discussing the urgency of UN reforms, which includes India’s permanent membership to the United Nations Security Council. While they seek common ground, a typically Asian diplomatic dance, based on quid pro quo and powered by a common economic agenda may be just about to unfold.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/india-china-border-tensions-calm-on-the-frontiers/article6458587.ece
30,9,2014,Fighting the fires they lit,"Armed with an overwhelming parliamentary endorsement, the British government has joined the United States-led coalition of countries that have been conducting aerial bombings of regions in Syria and Iraq under the control of the Islamic State (IS). The territorial expansion of the regime in Iraq appears to have been halted, at least for the present. Last August the very same Parliament had roundly rejected Prime Minister David Cameron’s proposal that Britain intervene militarily in Syria in retaliation for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s alleged use of chemical weapons against anti-government Syrian forces. Clearly, much has changed in the space of a year. The frenetic growth of the latest and most fierce avatar of jihadist terrorism in the Iraq-Syria region, the rapid export of its ideology to the young and disaffected in Britain and Europe who are joining its fighting forces in droves, the barbaric forms of punishment it employs against its critics, and its access to staggering financial resources — through oil from captured oilfields, and even the plunder and sale of a vast reservoir of antiquities in northern Syria — has given it a presence and strength that poses a direct threat to the region and beyond. Indeed, the protection of the United Kingdom from IS-sponsored acts of terrorism topped the list of reasons Mr. Cameron advanced in his speech to Parliament in justification of British air strikes against IS bases in Iraq. Crafted to win the support of the Labour opposition, the carefully worded motion seeking approval for armed intervention promises that British aircraft will not bomb Syria, and there will be no British “boots on the ground”.
Of a well-considered military plan, a mission-aim, a pullout strategy and a timeframe there was little evidence in Mr. Cameron’s speech; even less so the signs of any political and diplomatic vision of positive intervention. The brutal instances of beheading by IS activists of western journalists and aid workers captured on video and circulated on social media might well turn out to have been a bait by IS to draw the West into a war which in turn could feed an even more virulent brand of jihadism. However, Version 2014 of the Iraq story is an outcrop of Version 2003, when the western alliance declared war against Iraq on the concocted premise of the presence of weapons of mass destruction, destroying a once-prosperous society. This fanned sectarian and religious divides in the country, and created a bubbling groundswell of popular hatred of western governments. Today the same military alliance is struggling to douse the fires that it set 11 years ago — and it may end up stoking them.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/uk-military-intervention-in-syria-against-islamic-state-fighting-the-fires-they-lit/article6458589.ece
1,10,2014,The chosen one in Tamil Nadu,"Tamil Nadu enters a new phase of governance with O. Panneerselvam being sworn in as head of the government under exceptional circumstances following the conviction of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in a disproportionate assets case. Other than the changes necessitated by the absence of Ms. Jayalalithaa, his Cabinet is essentially the same with the Ministers retaining the portfolios they held previously. Policies and programmes will likewise see continuity, and the government will largely be run in the name of Ms. Jayalalithaa by Mr. Panneerselvam. But the very fact that real power is no longer with the Chief Minister, but with a person convicted in a corruption case, could have a telling effect on the way the government is run. And if Ms. Jayalalithaa remains in prison for some length of time, matters will be more complicated for Mr. Panneerselvam and his government. Important issues will likely be referred to her, and she will, in effect, emerge as an extra-constitutional authority running the government via remote control. Not surprisingly, Mr. Panneerselvam, who had served as Chief Minister for over five months in 2001-02 after the Supreme Court quashed Ms. Jayalalithaa’s appointment as Chief Minister, was chosen more for his loyalty than for his administrative acumen or seniority in the party hierarchy. During his previous stint, Ms. Jayalalithaa, who was acquitted in the Tansi land deal case (that led to her electoral disqualification) a couple of months after she was forced to demit office, was available for constant consultations. If Ms. Jayalalithaa is not out of prison soon enough, Mr. Panneerselvam will verily be clueless when confronted with politically sensitive issues.
How quickly the judicial process decides on the issues of suspension of sentence or stay of the conviction itself will be critical and Mr. Panneerselvam’s second term could well last longer than his first. The very structure of the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam does not allow for a strong second line of leadership, and the party and the government will necessarily look up to Ms. Jayalalithaa for guidance. If governance is not to suffer, Ms. Jayalalithaa will have to find a way where her advisory role could take on an official status. In the unusual circumstances in the State, remote control without a formal role will affect the administration of the State. In the last few days since the conviction, many of the Ministers have spent more time in Bangalore than in their own offices. What Ms. Jayalalithaa needs now is legal help, not political support, which she has in plenty, going by the recent Lok Sabha election results. The Ministers would serve her cause better by concentrating on governance than in organising political protests.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/after-jayalalithaa-conviction-o-panneerselvam-the-chosen-one-in-tamil-nadu/article6462526.ece
1,10,2014,A policy of status quo,"The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) decision to maintain status quo on interest rates is on expected lines. The overall environment is uncertain as yet with domestic economic recovery being uneven and with an upside risk to inflation from food prices consequent to a deficient monsoon. The near-term signs are favourable for a dip in headline inflation thanks to the sustained fall in global oil prices that have been passed on to consumers by the government, and the relative stability in the foreign exchange markets. The medium-term picture, though, is still hazy with a number of unknown variables, and the RBI is obviously not willing to risk its projection of 6 per cent inflation by January 2016 going astray. It is clear that the central bank will do whatever is necessary to ensure that the line is not crossed. The current account deficit is projected to remain well under control though non-oil, non-gold imports in the April-August period have risen to the highest level since March 2013. With credit growth remaining well below deposit growth and the impact of the government expenditure programme kicking in, liquidity has not been a problem in the market. The policy stance, therefore, appears to be one of caution tinged with optimism on the short-term economic variables.
What should be a cause for worry though is the sluggishness in credit offtake which is forcing banks to lower deposit rates, in turn affecting senior citizens who live off interest income. State Bank of India recently cut rates on some tenors to maintain its margins and it is likely that other banks will follow suit. The RBI has also maintained its projection of 5.5 per cent growth in GDP for this fiscal while pointing out that growth could slow down “mildly” in the second and third quarters before picking up pace again in the fourth. With the picture on agriculture not very clear at the moment and industrial output dipping in July after a good show in the couple of months preceding that, the central bank’s caution on growth prospects is understandable. Going forward, the critical determinant of the sustenance of the recovery would be resumption of investment activity. Forget new projects, even if the stalled ones resume in right earnest there would be a positive impetus to growth. The fall in oil prices which has wiped out under-recovery in diesel has given the government much-needed elbow room in managing the fiscal deficit. If the disinvestment programme proceeds apace — and at this point in time it does appear to be doing so — then there is room for justifiable optimism on the government meeting the challenging target of a 4.1 per cent fiscal deficit this year. Of course, these data will be critical inputs for the RBI to reverse direction on the rate cycle.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/reserve-bank-of-india-policy-rates-a-policy-of-status-quo/article6462527.ece
2,10,2014,Deepening relationship,"After a hectic, often frenetic five days in the United States, it is time to take stock of the achievements of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit. To begin with, the welcome he received, both in New York and in Washington, has firmly closed the door on a most awkward situation in bilateral ties: that of India voting in a leader proscribed by the U.S. Mr. Modi has been received at every level in the U.S., and if the Obama administration didn’t revoke the visa order, the gesture of President Obama right at the end to accompany Mr. Modi to the Martin Luther King Memorial came as a poignant signal that the U.S. genuinely wants to move ahead with India’s newly elected leader. Secondly, U.S. business, clearly disaffected by the difficulties they face in doing business with India, have also signalled its desire to renew investments. The fact that the two countries issued a vision document, the two leaders penned a joint op-ed, and then came out with a comprehensive 3,500-word Joint Statement, speaks volumes for the breadth of discussions between them in a short period. Yet, while the three documents contain all the parts of the relationship, they fail to convey the whole.
On issues where the countries agree, such as defence and energy, they show only incremental progress, without any big announcements. On issues where the countries differ, like the nuclear deal, trade and WTO, they seem to have deferred negotiations, indicating that no progress was made in resolving them. In that context, even the renewal of the strategic partnership, and reference to “joint and concerted efforts” to dismantle terror groups including al-Qaeda, Lashkar-e Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, the D-Company, and the Haqqanis” do not indicate any particularly new action or formulation. The statements seem most opaque when it comes to spelling out a shared worldview for India and the U.S.: while referring obliquely to China’s aggression in the South China Sea, ‘global crises’ like the situations in Iraq and Syria, and cooperation in Afghanistan, and a confounding, long reference to North Korea (DPRK), they list no action or step that the two countries hope to take together. And while both sides made it clear ahead of the talks that the U.S. would request, and India would discuss, the possibility of joining the anti-ISIS coalition, there is silence on where those discussions led. On all fronts of the ‘comprehensive dialogue’, that is, eight issues including energy, health, space, women’s empowerment, trade, skills, strategy and security, Mr. Modi’s visit successfully brought India-U.S. ties, that were faltering for a few years, back on track. But in order to reach the finish line, Mr. Modi and Mr. Obama will need a clearer enunciation of their shared vision for the road ahead.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/modi-us-visit-deepening-relationship-between-india-and-united-states/article6466507.ece
2,10,2014,Afghanistan’s change of guard,"The new President of Afghanistan, Ashraff Ghani, and Abdullah Abdullah, the country’s ‘chief executive officer’ — a new post that is to evolve into a prime ministership in two years — have their work cut out. Their swearing-in was billed as the first peaceful transition of power in Afghanistan’s history, but there is little peace. Two suicide attacks in Kabul claimed seven lives on Wednesday; a suicide bomber struck near Kabul airport on the day of the swearing-in; and, just a week ago the Taliban, more confident as U.S and NATO troops withdraw, launched a fierce assault not far from the capital, in Ghazni province. The peace process that began under the presidency of Hamid Karzai has stalled. The Taliban want to rule Afghanistan; they are hardly interested in negotiating power-sharing deals to participate in a government they consider imposed by the West. The main challenge before Mr. Ghani, a former World Bank executive and one-time Finance Minister in the Karzai government, is nothing less than to ensure peace in a country with a raging insurgency, repair an economy that is dependent on international aid, even as he crafts a foreign policy that has to take into account the demands of half a dozen regional powers, including Pakistan, and countries beyond. Mr. Karzai, eager towards the end of his term to get rid of the pro-West tag that was attached to him, had been reluctant to sign an agreement allowing some U.S. troops to stay on after the drawdown by end-2014. Mr. Ghani has quickly drawn the line under the previous government — among his first actions as President was to ink the long pending Bilateral Security Agreement and Status of Forces Agreement.
Compounding the difficulties is the tenuous political agreement between Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah that ended the post-election deadlock. Mr. Abdullah had refused to accept his defeat in the presidential run-off against Mr. Ghani, accusing him of electoral fraud. After nearly six months of bitter negotiations, Mr. Ghani agreed to share power with Mr. Abdullah in a U.S.-brokered deal that has brought together two leaders of opposed ethnicities — Mr. Ghani is Pashtun while Mr. Abdullah is Tajik. New Delhi, which was rightly wary of Mr. Karzai’s overtures to the Taliban, must support and encourage Afghanistan’s new leadership, but in truth it is Pakistan, with its continuing lifeline to the Taliban, which holds the key to the stability and survival of the new political arrangement. That in turn is crucial to achieving long-term peace in Afghanistan and ensuring the region’s security. Unfortunately, both will be elusive until Pakistan, especially its security establishment, is able to draw the right lessons from its own pathetic internal security situation to realise that an unstable Afghanistan goes against its own interests.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/afghanistans-change-of-guard/article6466506.ece
9,10,2014,Corruption and the courts,"If there is a larger message in the Karnataka High Court’s refusal to grant bail to former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, it is that the judiciary will treat corruption among public servants with greater seriousness than ever before. In normal circumstances, an appeal against a four-year prison term by a person who is not expected to flee from justice may have been admitted as a matter of course and the sentence suspended without much ado. However, in the light of Supreme Court decisions describing corruption as a violation of human rights that leads to “systematic economic crimes”, and a “serious malady undermining the very health of the polity”, the High Court has chosen to place corruption cases on a different footing altogether. It cites a ruling that says a convicted public servant should be deemed to be corrupt until exonerated by the appellate court. And it also says suspension of sentence should not be an automatic event, but a relief that should be granted only if adequate grounds exist. The grant of post-conviction bail, undoubtedly, is not the same as one given in the pre-trial stage, when there is a presumption of innocence. In addition, early disposal of the appeal may be offered as an alternative to interim relief. It is in this backdrop that Justice A.V. Chandrashekara has chosen to overrule the Special Public Prosecutor’s stand that conditional bail may be granted to Ms. Jayalalithaa and others, and hold that there were no grounds for granting any relief. It is indeed a major setback for Ms. Jayalalithaa, who will have to move the Supreme Court for immediate relief.
In terms of corruption jurisprudence, the judge’s order is in tune with the spirit of a series of Supreme Court verdicts. In recent times, the apex court has removed the protection from immediate disqualification enjoyed by convicted legislators, fixed a time-limit for grant of sanction for prosecution of public servants, directed early completion of trials involving lawmakers and struck down discriminatory provisions that required government clearance for investigating cases involving bureaucrats above a certain rank. The High Court has also shown itself to be immune to the political clamour for Ms. Jayalalithaa’s release in Tamil Nadu. Workers and supporters of the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam had their reasons for publicly demonstrating loyalty to and sympathy for Ms. Jayalalithaa, but incidents of violence and protests that inconvenience the general populace will do nothing at all to help her legal battle, and, instead, could hurt her politically in the long run. Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, who made an earnest appeal for calm, should ensure that the limits of democratic protest are observed and law and order is maintained.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/corruption-and-the-courts/article6482125.ece
9,10,2014,Keeping Ebola at bay,"Concerns over Ebola have escalated after the United States and Spain reported their first cases of the disease diagnosed within their borders. A traveller from Liberia, a West African nation where the disease is rampant, was found to be harbouring the disease-causing virus several days after arriving in Dallas. In the case of Spain, a hospital nurse involved in the care of a sick priest repatriated from Sierra Leone, another West African nation where the outbreak is continuing, has caught the virus. Given Ebola’s sinister reputation, there have been strident demands in the U.S., including from Congress, for measures to reduce the risk of infection being brought into the country. In response, American officials have said that measures to screen arriving airline passengers would be put in place. (India has already introduced such arrival screening.) As it is, countries where Ebola transmission is ongoing are expected to carry out exit screening of all persons departing from their airports, seaports and major land crossings. Using temperature monitoring systems and a questionnaire, the three West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, which are the worst-affected, have checked about 36,000 airline passengers in the past two months. Only 74 of them had fever and three displayed other worrisome symptoms, but none of those individuals turned out to have Ebola, say U.S. health officials. It remains to be seen if screening passengers on arrival will actually reduce of risk of the virus getting in. Those infected can take between two and 21 days to show symptoms of the disease, and, as happened with the Liberian who was diagnosed in Dallas, that may not occur before they set out on their journey.
The Obama administration has refused to entertain ideas of blocking the entry of those coming from the affected countries. If the U.S. were to adopt such a seemingly extreme step, other nations would doubtless follow suit. As it is, the outbreak has been a colossal calamity for three of the world’s poorest nations, requiring a massive international response to the resulting humanitarian crisis. Isolating those countries for any extended period will only add to their hardship and hamper the ongoing international efforts to provide assistance. India and other countries untouched by Ebola must, however, be ready with response plans should an infected person turn up on their shores. The ability to quickly diagnose and isolate such cases, ensure rigorous infection control in healthcare settings, and track down and monitor an infected individual’s contacts are essential. Nigeria and Senegal, West African countries that saw imported cases, were able to stop the virus from spiralling out of control. Good planning holds the key to getting the better of Ebola.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/keeping-ebola-at-bay/article6482126.ece
10,10,2014,Brightness at night,"This year’s Nobel Prize for physics awarded to Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano of Nagoya University in Japan and Shuji Nakamura of the University of California at Santa Barbara, goes beyond recognising their invention that is of “greatest benefit to mankind”. It befittingly rewards them for their perseverance and tenacity and for daring to “challenge established truths”. With red and green light emitting diodes (LEDs) already available, there were feverish efforts by many industries and institutions across the world to invent a blue LED; a combination of red, green and blue produces white light. But there were almost insurmountable challenges that had to be overcome, and most scientists dropped out of the race midway. The first major practical difficulty to be overcome was growing high-quality gallium nitride crystals using a suitable substrate. Dr. Akasaki and Dr. Amano, who worked as a team, and Dr. Nakamura used diverse approaches to achieve this. The duo finally tasted success in 1986 even as others moved on to different materials; Dr. Nakamura produced it four years later. Since the gallium nitride crystal is by default n-type layer with a surplus of electrons, the laureates had to create a p-type layer (holes that are electron-deficient). Working against all odds, the two teams finally succeeded in creating the p-type layer and hence a blue LED. They also created heterojunctions with multiple layers to improve the efficiency of blue LED.
If the arrival of brighter fluorescent lamps in the 20th century reduced electricity consumption compared with tungsten lamps, the advent of compact fluorescent lamps led to a further substantial drop in electricity consumption. However, LED technology has made all the other lamp technologies redundant with the superior brightness per wattage that it offers; the white light produced by LED has become a game-changer in lighting technology. Unlike the other lighting options, where a certain proportion of the electricity is converted into heat and is wasted, LED technology allows for direct conversion of all electricity into light, thereby increasing efficiency. With nearly 20 to 30 per cent of electricity worldwide being used for lighting, the widespread use of LEDs will lead to significant gains. Besides being energy-efficient, LEDs are environment-friendly as no mercury is used to make them. Currently, blue LED is used to produce red and green light by exciting phosphor. But dynamic control of colour composition can be achieved by using LEDs of all the three colours; this may happen in the future. In about two decades after blue LED came into being, it has revolutionised white light production. It remains to be seen if any another path-breaking technology can ever displace the LED.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/brightness-at-night/article6485732.ece
10,10,2014,An unsustainable course,"The precipitous decline in the population of wild animals should serve as a clear warning to humanity that it is living beyond its means. The Worldwide Fund for Nature and the Zoological Society of London recently reported that the number of wild creatures on earth has plunged to half of what it was four decades ago; in the case of some classes of animals, the loss is staggeringly high. Turtle populations, for instance, are estimated to have declined by 80 per cent. It is the developing world that should be particularly concerned at the data on animal populations: habitat degradation, pollution, and unsustainable extraction of natural resources in the emerging economies are robbing them of biodiversity that is essential for human well-being. Impacts of climate change pose a new threat to flora and fauna in these countries. Significantly, some of these nations are also the biodiversity hotspots that harbour an extraordinarily large number of species — new ones continue to be discovered every year even as old ones disappear. These trends show that vital needs such as fresh water, clean air and benign climate patterns are threatened, and there is a need for urgent action.
Governments in the global north and south must commit themselves to the full implementation of treaties and conventions on protection of wild animals and habitats if the erosion is to be stemmed. They can achieve this partly by strengthening the Convention on Biological Diversity which has, under the Aichi targets, resolved to increase the protected areas of the world from 13 per cent to 17 per cent of land by 2020 and to prevent the further loss of known threatened species. At the same time, restraints would have to be placed on commercial extraction of marine resources such as fish, to give depleted stocks time to regenerate. It is evident that with every passing decade, the capacity to trawl the seas on an industrial scale and harvest a wide variety of species is outpacing the natural cycle for rebuilding their stocks. More sustainable methods to grow food on land and in captive areas have to replace the unbridled exploitation of nature. There is hope that good conservation strategies will stem or even reverse the 40 per cent declines witnessed in key wild animal populations. The challenge is very real for India as it struggles with habitat loss and rising demand for energy and natural resources. It must resist the temptation to open up its last remaining forests and wetlands to commercial exploitation and encroachment if it is to safeguard ecosystem services such as water and food. The emphasis should be on restoration of habitat and an end to pollution through strict enforcement of environmental and forest laws.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-unsustainable-course/article6485734.ece
11,10,2014,Public funds and image-building,"The use of government advertising as a tool for political propaganda, especially during election time, has been a key concern in many democracies. Given the role of the state in India as a controller of the fortunes of many publications dependent on advertising revenue, it is inevitable that in the name of disseminating information about government performance and programmes, many a regime makes use of official advertising to drive home politically loaded messages, focus on personalities and give the impression that huge allocations of budgetary resources and framing of policies and schemes are solely because of particular leaders. The lack of guidelines relating to the content of government advertisements works against the public interest in two ways: firstly, public funds could be misused by releasing information and announcements in a politically partisan way so that the gains of publicity rebound to the ruling party or a reigning leader; secondly, the generous use of advertisements as an incentive to select media houses in return for favourable coverage. While in normal circumstances ruling parties tend to use advertising as a site for self-glorification, in the run-up to elections it could be a form of electioneering that is free of cost. The Supreme Court, which appointed a three-member committee last April to frame appropriate guidelines, will soon consider the panel’s report. As an institution that has been keeping a close watch on the purity of the election process, the court is making a serious effort to ensure that public funds are not used for partisan ends.
In its short but meaningful report, the panel, comprising jurist N.R. Madhava Menon, former Lok Sabha Secretary-General T.K. Viswanathan, and senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, has recommended that advertisement material be objective and not directed at promoting the ruling party’s interests. The recommended guidelines bar lapses in political neutrality and the projection of a positive impression of the party in power or negative impression of those critical of the government. The panel has counselled against mentioning the party in power by name and attacks against the views of the opposition. It seeks to prohibit party symbols, logos or flags, or any links to websites of political parties and politicians. The panel disfavours use of government advertising aimed at favourable coverage for the party or person in power. If these guidelines are accepted by the Supreme Court and laid down as law, they could serve as effective curbs on the misuse of the government’s advertisement machinery. That day will mark one more step in preventing the misuse of public office for partisan ends, as well as in protecting the purity of the electoral process.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/public-funds-and-imagebuilding/article6489478.ece
11,10,2014,Bringing clarity to online retailing,"The recent ‘big billion day’ mega sale offer by online retailer Flipkart saw a virtual stampede in cyberspace, and elicited angry posts on social media by irate shoppers. The massive customer response no doubt helped Flipkart hit the 24-hour sales target inside of 10 hours. With frustrated online buyers giving vent to their ire on social networks, Flipkart founders came out to issue a public apology for the technical glitches and also for their failure to anticipate the discount sale-induced rush into their site, which crashed several times on sale day. Predictably, the Flipkart sales fiasco has renewed the demand for regulation of online retailers. Discounts are not peculiar to the online trade, though. Festival season-eve extravagant offers are only to be expected, and usually done either to liquidate stocks or create brand awareness. Flipkart and similar online retailers have adopted a marketplace model, where they play the role of a facilitator by providing platforms for sale. In their cases, such offers appear to be intended to ‘buy sales’. Gross merchandise value (GMV) is a key to the valuation of any e-commerce site. How the massive customer discontent impacts GMV run rate in the coming days and valuation for Flipkart is for the founders to figure out. On the face of it, such competitive price-cuts benefit consumers. On a larger canvas, however, these can have serious repercussions not just for the overall health of industries across the value chain but also for society as a whole.
The Flipkart sale experience has raised the issue of how sustainable huge discounts, at times even below cost, can be and how widespread their reach is. It has, not surprisingly, brought the focus yet again sharply on the need to develop a retail ecosystem that prospers without disturbing the social fibre. Consumers need to be wary of such practices as marking prices up and then offering large discounts. Purely from this point of view, one needs to examine the business of retail as it exists today, and as it is set to evolve in the context of the increasing propensity among modern youth to make their purchases online. A host of issues related to retail — from deep discounts to taxation and investments, among others — must be addressed in a composite way so that the retail experience fosters a healthy ecosystem, which rewards all stakeholders suitably and fosters a culture of healthy competition. More than anything else, retail needs an industry tag. That will help define the ground rules, and demarcate the operational areas for trade. Surely, this will go a long way in bringing a sense of clarity, fairness and responsibility among players across the entire retail canvas.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bringing-clarity-to-online-retailing/article6489480.ece
13,10,2014,"Childhood, peace and development","The >Nobel Peace prize for 2014 has been awarded to two South Asian activists in the field of child rights, Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi. The first is a thoughtful and fearless teenager who, despite deadly opposition, >lit a path to learning and liberation for girls in Pakistan. The second is a 60-year old campaigner from India who has worked to liberate children from the shackles of compulsory labour and bondage. In choosing them, the Nobel Committee may appear to have chosen unusually. Malala is, at 17, the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner ever, and Mr. Satyarthi a relatively unknown name outside the region and his field of work. However, the Committee’s choice has been hailed as both bold and necessary. It has sought to underscore a crucial but widely disregarded prerequisite for development and peace in our times, namely, the responsibility of nations to provide the means of formal education, leisure, safety, and care for all children. As this year’s citation says, “It is a prerequisite for peaceful global development that the rights of children and young people be respected. In conflict-ridden areas in particular, the violation of children leads to the continuation of violence from generation to generation.” Growing up in the Swat Valley of Pakistan under the brute rule of religious bigots opposed to education for girls, Malala grasped the link between school education — and particularly education for girls — and larger social change early in life. How an outspoken child fought a public campaign for the right to education, surviving even an attempt on her life, is well known. She continues to lead the battle for girls’ education from her current location in Birmingham in the United Kingdom.
>Mr. Satyarthi, a founder of Bachpan Bachao Andolan (Save Childhood Campaign), has led the rescue of over 78,500 children from bondage. He gave shape to the Global March Against Child Labour, a coalition of national campaign groups. He too sees education as the key instrument for the liberation of children from poverty, exploitation and neglect. In his pioneering work on child labour and school education in India, the late political scientist Myron Weiner wrote: “Modern states regard education as a legal duty, not merely a right: parents are required to send their children to school, children are required to attend school, and the state is obliged to enforce compulsory education ... This is not the view held in India. Primary education is not compulsory, nor is child labour illegal.” The Nobel Peace Prize this year recognises the crucial links among child rights, labour, and school education and, in doing so, recognises one of the most fundamental prerequisites of a better tomorrow for millions of children everywhere.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-nobel-peace-prize-childhood-peace-and-development/article6493939.ece
13,10,2014,"Caste, clan and compromise","For the Bharatiya Janata Party, the stakes in this week’s Assembly elections in Haryana are considerably lower than in the case of Maharashtra. Haryana is smaller both in terms of size and population, and by way of resources and revenue. And, the risks in a strategy of fighting the elections without a major ally are conceivably lower too. Unlike in Maharashtra, the BJP does not have to compete with a former ally for the same ideological space. While the break with its long-time ally, the Shiv Sena, in Maharashtra is certain to leave festering wounds that might not heal quickly, the end of the alliance with the Haryana Janhit Congress is of no great political import. The alliance in Haryana was more opportunistic in nature, forged as it was on the basis of vote-bank arithmetic than on the strength of a common, long-term ideological vision or political programme. The challenge for the BJP now is to build on its Lok Sabha success — when it projected itself as a viable alternative to the Congress at the national level — and emerge ahead of the others in an election fought more on local issues, caste affinities, and clan loyalties. Until now, the BJP had been content to ally with regional parties that traced their ideological roots to the Congress, such as the Indian National Lok Dal, the Haryana Vikas Party and the Haryana Janhit Congress. For the first time, the saffron party, boosted by its successes in the Lok Sabha election, seems to be in a position to make a strong pitch for power on its own in Haryana.
The politics of religion might not work in Haryana, but the BJP is banking not on the appeal of its Hindutva ideology but on the failure of the politics of caste and clan that seems to drive the INLD, the HJC and the Haryana Jan Chetna Party. Given the fragmented nature of the Haryana polity, where regional satraps hold sway in their own geographical fiefdoms, the BJP might have to factor in a situation where it falls short of a majority in the 90-member Assembly. Unlike in a Lok Sabha election, in the lower democratic tiers, caste and clan could play a more decisive role. The saffron party cannot afford to be as averse to a post-poll tie-up as it was to a pre-poll alliance with the HJC. The go-it-alone strategy that the BJP adopted in Maharashtra and Haryana is part of its long-term ambition to make greater inroads in States where it had been dependent on allies so far. But after the elections, if the results so require, the party might be more than willing to make the necessary compromises in the interests of immediate power. With the Congress still in disarray, and INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala back in jail to serve the remainder of his sentence in a corruption case, the BJP might be the biggest beneficiary in the first-past-the-post electoral system.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-caste-clan-and-compromise/article6493940.ece
14,10,2014,The art of memory,"The world outside France wondered who >Patrick Modiano was after the French author was awarded the >Nobel Prize in literature last week. The 69-year-old author, who is well-known in France, a country where he has been often compared to Marcel Proust, has been largely unknown to non-French readers. This is because despite having written more than 30 novels and children’s books and screenplays, few of his works have been translated into English. But, as the Swedish Academy’s previous Permanent Secretary, Horace Engdahl, once said: “The purpose of the prize is to make them [writers] famous, not to tap them when they are famous.” Mr. Modiano’s work has stemmed mostly from the complexities of his childhood. His father was an Italian Jew who did not wear the yellow star when Jews were being deported, and instead came closer to organised crime gangs with ties to the Gestapo. His mother was a Flemish actress whose heart, as the writer once described, was so cold that it made her lapdog leap through the window to death. The French writer Clemence Boulouque told The New Yorker: “Modiano has returned again and again to the same themes: the pull of the past, the threat of disappearance, the blurring of moral boundaries, ‘the dark side of the soul.’” As for writing, as Mr. Modiano put it, “It’s something natural, it’s something that’s part of my life.”
In his writing career spanning almost 50 years, Mr. Modiano has shunned publicity and the media limelight, and like many of his works, has remained a mysterious character to his readers. This has led to the origin of the French term “modianesque”, used to describe a mysterious person or situation. In some of his interviews the writer has suggested that writing is not something that brings pleasure to him but is more of a burden from which he cannot set himself free. He compares it to driving in fog when one doesn’t know where one is going, but nevertheless one has to go on. Mr. Modiano’s work often deals with his Jewish origin and the period of Occupation. In a 2010 interview to France Today, Mr. Modiano said: “After each novel, I have the impression that I have cleared it all away … but I know I’ll come back over and over again to tiny details, little things that are a part of what I am. In the end, we are all determined by the place and the time in which we were born.” It is this quality that the Nobel Prize committee recognised, describing it as “the art of memory with which he has evoked the most ungraspable human destinies and uncovered the life-world of the occupation.” Unlike the detective Guy Roland in his best-known work, Missing Person, Mr. Modiano doesn’t have the luxury of losing his memory. But even if it had, he would always attempt to find it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-patrick-modiano-the-art-of-memory/article6497581.ece
14,10,2014,The freedom to marry,"The move from decriminalising homosexuality to granting legal status to gay marriages may seem a simple and logical step. After all, the quintessentially liberal principle is that all people ought to be treated with equal respect and without discrimination in every matter. This dictum would apply equally to the question of marital preferences as with sexual orientation. But contemporary history tells a more complex story. The United States Supreme Court last week gave assent to same-sex marriages in five States. It did so by declining to hear challenges to earlier appeals to court rulings. Since the relevant circuit courts also have jurisdiction in six more States, the latest decision is in effect expected to allow marriages among homosexuals in a majority of States — 30 of them. This seeming surge in political and judicial support is a far cry from the situation that existed just a decade ago. Thirteen States amended their constitutions in 2004 to ban same-sex marriages, reacting to Massachusetts’s move to allow them. They were echoing the spirit of the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defined the institution of marriage as a union between man and woman. It further authorised States that banned such marriages to withhold recognition to gay couples from other States where this was legal.
But then, two Supreme Court rulings last year repudiated the view that a world where gays and lesbians were wedlocked was an affront to heterosexual marriages — a view that was espoused by social conservatives and religious groups. In one ruling it struck down the 1996 legal provisions as being unconstitutional and violative of the Fifth Amendment protection of individual liberty, and denial of equal benefits to same-sex couples. In the other, the court nullified the ban on gay marriages in California, which, incidentally, was the first State to overturn the ban on inter-racial marriages in 1948. A number of States have since lifted the ban on same-sex marriages, including the five States that have now won the court’s backing. Globally, 17 countries — predominantly European ones, besides two from Latin America — have ended the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriages and consequent social and legal benefits. While The Netherlands was the first to do so in 2001, Britain, France and Brazil amended their laws suitably last year. Iceland’s Johanna Sigurdardottir was the world’s first openly lesbian Prime Minister, between 2009 and 2013, and was the country’s longest-serving member of Parliament. Freedom and equality, it is fairly obvious, eventually and inexorably lead to a gender-neutral stance on many social questions that may have been settled by convention in the past.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-freedom-to-marry/article6497584.ece
21,10,2014,Fuelling reform,"It was a long-awaited reform measure but when the Narendra Modi government eventually deregulated diesel pricing on Saturday, the timing, in the backdrop of falling global oil prices, was just perfect. With oil companies wiping off the under-recoveries on diesel and going into surplus, the government could sweet-coat what is essentially a bitter pill with a cut in retail price of the transportation fuel. While consumers may rejoice over the benefit now, they need to be conscious of the fact that when the wheel of global oil prices turns into an up-cycle once again, the domestic retail price of diesel will go up. That is also when the government’s commitment to the reform measure will be tested. In a deregulated regime, oil companies will adjust diesel prices at periodic intervals to reflect the prevailing international price of oil, just as they do now in the case of petrol. This is as it should be. Subsidies, including on diesel, have been exerting tremendous pressure on government finances, leading to a widening fiscal deficit. The 2014-15 Budget had projected a subsidy burden of Rs.2,46,000 crore, of which petroleum subsidy accounted for Rs.63,500 crore. Thanks to falling oil prices in the last few months and deregulation of diesel now, the petroleum subsidy is expected to be substantially lower than the budgeted level, thus easing the burden on the fisc.
The Modi government has also done well in deciding to deposit the subsidy on cooking gas directly into the bank accounts of consumers. The government should do the same for kerosene subsidy as well given that leakages are the highest there, but only after ensuring that no deserving recipient is left out. The new Jan Dhan accounts could be used for this purpose. With petroleum subsidies now being addressed, the focus should shift to reducing fertilizer subsidy, which is about the same quantum as that on petroleum. Meanwhile, in the other major announcement on Saturday, the government finally addressed the contentious issue of domestic gas pricing which has been hanging in the balance since the start of this year. The formula has been tweaked to curtail the increase envisaged under the Rangarajan formula by over two-thirds thus containing the final base price to $5.61 per million metric British thermal unit. The government has done well in granting a premium to gas produced in ultra-deep water, deep-water and technologically challenging areas as production costs will be high but the fine print that provides details on premium calculation has to be read closely before a final assessment is made. The point, ultimately, is to balance the interests of consumers who desire the cheapest price, and of producers who would want their costs covered fully and topped by a decent margin.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fuelling-reform/article6520305.ece
21,10,2014,Loosening tobacco’s deadly grip,"A few months after steeply increasing taxes on tobacco products, the government has come up with another much-needed measure to contain tobacco consumption. Thanks to a recent amendment to the Cigarettes and other Tobacco Products (Packaging and Labelling) Rules of 2008, pictorial warnings are all set to achieve the desired results. Beginning April 1, 2015, all tobacco products will carry a pictorial warning and text message that occupy at least 85 per cent of the front and back of a package. The pictorial warning alone will take up 60 per cent of the space and the written message the remaining 25 per cent. With this change, India will catapult itself to the No.1 position in the world, alongside Thailand, on the international ranking based on the area dedicated to the warning. Aside from more than doubling the statutory warning area on a package from 40 to 85 per cent, both sides of a package will carry the warning; currently, it is displayed only on one side. In contrast to the completely ineffectual pictorial warnings now being used on cigarette packets and chewing tobacco pouches, the chosen images can at once shock and educate consumers of the risks of tobacco use. By also mandating that images be rotated every 12 months, the government has ensured that India follows the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control labelling requirements in letter and spirit. Incidentally, the pictorial warning that is currently being used has remained the same since December 2010 with just one rotation after it was introduced on May 31, 2009.
The use of pictorial warnings turns the power of packaging on its head — from building and reinforcing a brand, packages become a vehicle for increasing awareness about tobacco’s health risks. It is proven beyond doubt that the use of graphic images along with written messages has the potential to significantly deter people from taking up the habit and also prompt existing users to cut the amount of tobacco consumed and even quit smoking. Tobacco companies are well aware of the power the pictorial warning wields and how much it could affect their bottom line. They may well, on grounds of the health of the industry and the livelihood of the workers, seek to get the government to dilute the amendment. After all, the industry had successfully gone through the process before; it had persuaded the previous government to backtrack on nearly every provision till the warnings became ineffectual. How well the government resists such pressure will show how determined it is to win the war against tobacco. Since one million people in India die each year because of tobacco use, the government should not sacrifice proven and obvious health benefits at the altar of commercial advantage.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/loosening-tobaccos-deadly-grip/article6520303.ece
22,10,2014,Moving fast on coal allocations,"The Centre has done well in moving quickly to clean up the mess in the coal sector following the >Supreme Court’s cancellation of the allotment of 214 blocks. The cancelled blocks will be reallotted through an e-auction and an ordinance will be promulgated shortly to facilitate the transfer of the mining land from existing owners to the new ones who emerge successful from the auction. The most interesting part of the ordinance relates to the enabling provision in it that will allow the government to allot coal mines to private companies for commercial exploitation. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley would not term it as denationalisation of the coal industry and held out the assurance that the interests of Coal India would be protected. Yet, the fact is that the enabling provision confers powers that can be exercised when the need arises. India, which has 301 billion tonnes of coal reserves — among the highest in the world — imported 174 million tonnes last year, spending $20 billion of precious foreign exchange largely because of the limitations that monopoly producer Coal India has in increasing its output. Allowing private players into commercial mining of coal will not only fetch much-needed investment, including FDI, but also help increase production to meet the country’s needs. Of course, the caveats to this are that it should be done after due regulatory safeguards are built in and the impact on the environment is taken into account.
Meanwhile, the government has protected the >interests of State and Central utilities by assuring them of allotments outside of the bidding process. While an e-auction will lead to transparency, it is most likely that it will also push up acquisition costs for successful bidders. This is especially because some of them are already operating downstream projects such as cement, steel and power plants and will be keen to reacquire the mines that they have forfeited by the apex court order. While these companies will be allowed to bid in the >e-auction, they will not get the right of first refusal over the mines that they are already operating, which is the right thing to do. The higher mine acquisition costs could push up prices for consumers unless the availability of coal increases simultaneously. The tricky part of the e-auction exercise will be in the valuation of the land and assets of the forfeited owners which will be done by a committee. This could turn out to be contentious and needs to be handled with utmost transparency. The Centre also needs to be commended for passing on the proceeds from the auction to the States where the mines are located. Thus, States such as Jharkhand, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Odisha will get a much-needed revenue boost.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/moving-fast-on-coal-allocations/article6524242.ece
22,10,2014,A balancing of interests,"The range of measures Prime Minister Narendra Modi passionately spelt out at the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Shramev Jayate programme on labour reforms reads like a road map to his Independence Day invitation to multinational corporations to ‘ >Make in India.’ The most significant of them all is the move to simplify the cumbrous current inspection processes, including by allowing enterprises the convenience of self-certification of documents. The random inspection process that is to be set in motion is expected at one stroke to cut through administrative red tape involving some 1,800 labour inspectors. Indeed, the removal of arcane procedural hurdles could curb rampant corruption and improve overall efficiency. But this is a bold policy shift for a country where a culture of industrial safety is woefully lacking. The system of inspections should be effective and should ensure that the protection of thousands of human lives is not compromised in any manner. The 2007 Minneapolis bridge collapse in the United States, the fires at Bangladesh’s garment units and the December 1984 gas leakage in Bhopal were all linked to a greater or lesser degree to the lack of proper inspections.
The digitisation of data on thousands of firms to facilitate a single-window system of compliance with various labour and social security laws is a laudable initiative. In particular, the friendly provident fund facility to unfreeze a whopping Rs. 27,000 crore of hard-earned savings and the >portability of PF account numbers across employers is a reform long overdue. These conveniences are consistent with the welcome increase in the Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS-95) up to Rs.1,000 — from the earlier Rs.300 — announced in the Union Budget. It is another matter that the Bharatiya Janata Party had canvassed for an enhancement of the pension to Rs.3,000 prior to the last Lok Sabha election. Evidently, the politically sensitive nature of these >labour reform measures — even within the BJP-affiliated trade union bodies — was not lost on Mr. Modi. Only a few months ago, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh opposed the Rajasthan Government’s amendments to the Contract Labour Act that sought to create flexibility for employers. Thus, Mr. Modi’s announcements were carefully couched in a conciliatory and accommodating tone that the new measures would be no less beneficial to workers. If protracted delays of the past to obtain clearances hurt productivity, they also caused an adverse impact on the interests of the workforce. Mr. Modi’s plan to draft a band of technology ambassadors to showcase the quality of existing vocational training programmes in India is well-conceived. There is no gainsaying the need for more such institutions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-balancing-of-interests/article6524241.ece
24,10,2014,The tasks of governance,"It is not often that a first-time legislator gets to be Chief Minister. In Haryana, Manohar Lal Khattar was chosen by the Bharatiya Janata Party for the top job not for his legislative experience or administrative expertise, but for his organisational skill and political savvy. Mr. Khattar joined the BJP from the ranks of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, where he was an active pracharak, and was put in charge of the party’s affairs in several States in the last two decades. In Haryana, his inputs went into the BJP’s making and breaking of alliances with some of the regional parties — the Haryana Vikas Party, the Indian National Lok Dal and the Haryana Janhit Congress. With every new alliance the BJP grew stronger, until in the latest Assembly election it found the confidence to fight on its own. At least some of the credit for the party’s growth in the State at the expense of its allies should go to Mr. Khattar. In many ways, this is a reward for Mr. Khattar, a form of recognition for his efforts to overcome the BJP’s weaknesses in Haryana. It is also an expression of gratitude by the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah team to Mr. Khattar for his having worked closely with them. Mr. Modi was himself an organisation man before he became Chief Minister of Gujarat, and he would have seen Mr. Khattar as embodying some of his own abilities that go beyond mere tact and rhetoric.
In choosing Mr. Khattar over other aspirants, the BJP also signalled that it was not getting into the game of playing the Jat card in Haryana. Jats constitute a dominant caste group in the State, and large sections of them now form the backbone of the Indian National Lok Dal led by Om Prakash Chautala, which finished second behind the BJP. But for the BJP, as for the Congress, the support base is more diverse, and the choice of Mr. Khattar reflects this fact. As is the normal practice in the BJP, the candidature was proposed and endorsed by the principal rivals for the Chief Minister’s post. While State party chief Ram Bilas Sharma proposed his name, Captain Abhimanyu was among those who seconded the proposal. Mr. Khattar will now have to shift his focus to governance from political manoeuvres. Haryana is a small State, but the challenges for the new government are formidable. Food security, employment opportunities, rural development and prevention of female foeticide are issues that cry out for attention — more than cow slaughter or free pilgrimages, which too figured in the BJP’s election manifesto. Mr. Khattar in office is soon going to realise that expanding the support base as an Opposition party is easier than consolidating it as a ruling party. After the smooth takeover, he must focus on governance and meeting the expectations behind the mandate.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-tasks-of-governance/article6528266.ece
24,10,2014,For an inclusive pitch,"Pope Francis famously asked last year: “If a person is gay and has goodwill, who am I to judge?” Last week, it almost looked like the Catholic Church, led by the first Pope in a thousand years from outside Europe, was set to make a bold transition, or at least make a beginning in that direction. The Church seemed set to change its views on homosexual acts, which it used to consider “intrinsically disordered”. A new Vatican document indeed acknowledged that homosexuals had “gifts and qualities to offer”. Then it raised a rhetorical question, whether the Church could accept gay people and recognise the positive aspects of same-sex couples. It also displayed a merciful tone towards Catholics in “irregular situations” such as cohabitation of heterosexual couples who are either unmarried or have had only a civil marriage. Although it was essentially a working paper presented before a Synod in Vatican City, it was prepared by a group hand-picked by the Pope, and the Synod itself was specially called by him. Given the reactions that the move quickly evoked from among Church conservatives, it was clearly way too early to conclude if this indeed would mark a breakthrough: one of the critics spoke of “betrayal of Catholic parents”. Although the document used less judgmental and more compassionate prose than ever seen earlier, it did not signal any change in the Church’s doctrinal stand on homosexual acts or gay marriage. The bishops’ final report that came at the conclusion of the Synod did water down some of the progressive ideas and language, but it will remain the topic of reflection among Catholics across the world ahead of a more definitive Synod in 2015.
Meanwhile, other vital questions, such as those relating to the Church’s stand on contraception, abortion and even priestly celibacy in the context of a rash of paedophilia charges against clergymen in different countries, remain. The issue of giving adequate opportunities to women in the Church is another fractious issue. While ruling out women’s ordination, Pope Francis has been quietly insisting on, and prevailing upon his key functionaries, to appoint more women to positions of influence within the Vatican, in turn paving the way for the trend to catch on across the hierarchy. He has also sent out clear signals that the Church should grapple with its bugbears — rather than seek to sweep them under the carpet. It appears to be the case that a battle is raging for the soul of the Catholic Church. The question is whether the values of progressive liberalism should not guide the Church today, for the Christian faith is not all about moral perfection but about mercy and redemption. Pope Francis is going to prove how immensely difficult it is to walk in the shoes of the fisherman.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/for-an-inclusive-pitch/article6528267.ece
25,10,2014,Terror in Ottawa,"Canada is no stranger to terrorism. Unprecedented as the attack on its Parliament building might appear — it has even been described as “the end of Canada’s innocence” — the country has had long experience of terrorism, from well before any other Western nation. In 1970, the Quebec Liberation Front kidnapped a British diplomat and the Canadian Labour Minister in a two-month-long episode that saw Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau send the army into Quebec and suspend civil liberties. The year before, FLQ had set off a powerful bomb at the Montreal Stock Exchange. In 1985, an Air India plane that took off from Montreal exploded mid-air, killing all 329 people on board, most of them Canadian citizens of Indian origin. Canadian investigators held the Canada-based Khalistani group Babbar Khalsa responsible. The gun attack on the House of Commons, in which a lone gunman slipped into the thinly guarded Parliament building and opened fire after killing a guard at the nearby war memorial, recalled the incident in which a deranged soldier killed three people in the Quebec National Assembly in 1984. Though the motives of the gunman, who was shot dead by a Parliament official, are not clear, Canada is understandably nervous, particularly as only two days before the latest attack two soldiers were run over near Montreal — one of them died — by a man driving a vehicle who investigators suspected to be a jihadi inspired by the Islamic State. Links are being drawn to the Canadian Parliament vote earlier this month to participate in the United States-led military campaign against the IS in Iraq and Syria, but there is no evidence yet that there was a larger conspiracy behind either of the incidents.
It is inevitable that Canada will now become more security conscious. Prime Minister Stephen Harper has described Wednesday’s incident as a terrorist act and pledged that the country would not be intimidated. Speaking in Parliament a day after the attack, Mr. Harper called for a tougher anti-terrorism law. In fact, new legislation giving more powers, including for preventive detention of terror suspects, to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, was already on the anvil and was to be introduced on the day of the attack. It appears the government might now make all efforts to fast-track this. In countries that live under the shadow of terrorism, including home-grown terror, citizens know only too well that anti-terror measures usually involve the curtailment of individual freedoms. As well, it is all too easy for such measures to turn into a security backlash against members of one community. It is in everyone’s interests that Canada, which has a large immigrant population, including a large Muslim population, ensures a measured and sensitive response.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/terror-in-ottawa/article6530857.ece
25,10,2014,Ebola and lessons from Nigeria,"In late July this year, the international airport in the bustling Nigerian metropolis of Lagos received an extremely unwelcome visitor. A man from Liberia, a West African nation where Ebola is rampant, had been caring for his sister when she came down with the disease. Refusing to stay in quarantine, he had taken a flight out of the country and brought the deadly virus to Africa’s largest city, a major air, sea and land hub in the region. In Lagos, with a population size similar to that of Mumbai and a large slum population, there was the frightening possibility of the virus spiralling out of control. The city’s “dense population and overburdened infrastructure create an environment where diseases can be easily transmitted and transmission sustained,” commented a journal paper on the outbreak that ensued. The potential for a dangerous conflagration increased when a close contact of the Liberian man secretly slipped out of quarantine and went off to seek medical treatment in Port Harcourt, Nigeria’s oil hub. The doctor who treated him died of Ebola later and was found to have had an alarming number of high-risk contacts with various people. Yet, thanks to the rapidity with which the Nigerian government acted, the virus has been snuffed out. “Nigeria is now free of Ebola virus transmission,” the World Health Organization declared categorically on October 20.
Nigeria’s resounding success comes as a useful antidote to the fear evoked by the desperate situation in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone where Ebola is still out of control. Africa’s most populous nation has now shown that even when a traveller brings the disease in, developing countries can, with quick and decisive steps, stamp out the virus. As has been demonstrated in Ebola outbreaks that occurred in earlier years, the key lies in swiftly identifying and isolating infected persons, tracking down all their close contacts and meticulously monitoring those individuals for signs of infection. Nigeria utilised trained personnel, technology and management methods put in place to control polio outbreaks, to trace contacts and look for Ebola cases. Altogether, nearly 900 contacts were located. It is worth noting that ultimately the country reported only 19 confirmed cases, many of the victims healthcare workers, several of whom acquired the virus from the Liberian man before he was diagnosed with Ebola. Seven of the confirmed cases died, giving the Nigerian outbreak a case fatality rate of 40 per cent, substantially lower than the 70 per cent estimated for the ongoing outbreaks in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Other nations, including India, must learn from Nigeria’s achievement.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ebola-and-lessons-from-nigeria/article6530858.ece
27,10,2014,Another round of elections,"Kashmir is still recovering from the devastation of the recent floods; the State and Central governments are still involved in relief and rehabilitation operations. But extraordinary as these circumstances are in the Valley, deferring the Assembly election in Jammu and Kashmir was never an option before the Election Commission. Any postponement of the election process would only have added a political dimension to the administrative crisis in the State, stretching further the already strained capabilities of the National Conference government. Chief Minister Omar Abdullah appeared to have been motivated by the rationale of his own political survival when he mooted the deferring of the election in order to better deal with the flood crisis. In view of security considerations — militancy in Kashmir and Maoism in Jharkhand — the polls are spread over five phases beginning November 25 and ending on December 20. As in the Lok Sabha election, in J&K, the People’s Democratic Party is expected to eat into the vote share of the National Conference, and the Bharatiya Janata Party may again raid the Congress strongholds. The break-up of the NC-Congress alliance is of little consequence, and the interest in the election is whether the Congress would win enough seats to remain a player for power in the post-election scenario. The PDP and the Congress have been partners in government before, and in the event of a fractured mandate in J&K, another political churning is quite likely.
In Jharkhand, the question is whether the BJP will be able to repeat its performance in the Lok Sabha election and get a majority of its own. After having won 12 of the 14 Lok Sabha seats, the BJP is the overwhelming favourite. Although the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha is at present in alliance with the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the three parties might go their separate ways in the Assembly election. Differences over seat sharing aside, the parties are by no means natural allies. Jharkhand has seen several combinations of parties in power, and the JMM, especially, has shown a readiness to make friends with any party for the sake of sharing power. The Congress and the RJD have stakes in Bihar too, but the national party might see little merit in playing the role of a junior partner in a JMM-led coalition in a low-stakes election. For the BJP, it is important to keep up the winning momentum. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP is now a centralised organisation. Just as he and his core team take credit for every success, they will be conscious that the blame for a defeat too will lie on them alone. But that seems to be a situation very much to the liking of Mr. Modi who is not averse to risk-taking.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-another-round-of-elections/article6535464.ece
27,10,2014,A Herculean challenge,"The process of relief and rehabilitation in the devastated north coastal districts of Visakhapatnam, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram in Andhra Pradesh has just begun. The challenges seem huge. Even the extent of damage from cyclone ‘Hudhud,’ which knocked out the region two weeks ago has not been fully assessed. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an aerial survey, visited the ravaged port city of Visakhapatnam and announced an interim relief of Rs.1,000 crore. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu camped in Vizag for the first few days to ensure that rescue and relief operations were launched swiftly. He has ensured that within three days, power supply was restored in Vizag city. The neighbouring towns too got back their supply within a week. By October 31, power supply should be fully functional in the affected areas. Temporary shelters have been provided to lakhs of people rendered homeless. Essential commodities were rushed, and free rations distributed. Considering the extent of devastation, caused entirely by nature’s fury, the people have also been very understanding. But their patience cannot be taken for granted. The rehabilitation process has to move forward to tackle the major problems of housing and livelihood, and both these challenges cannot be easily overcome.
Mr. Naidu has appealed to the people, philanthropists and corporate India to contribute generously to this massive exercise to rebuild not just Vizag, but also the entire region that still remains vulnerable to cyclones. Given the fact that Andhra Pradesh faces a huge revenue deficit of about Rs.16,000 crore, and still suffers from the pangs of what he calls “unscientific bifurcation,” rehabilitation has to be a multi-pronged effort. The Centre, State, trade and industry, and philanthropy — including from the expatriate community — should join hands to make this happen. Rehabilitation should look at housing, infrastructure, restoration of livelihood, attending to the damage to industrial infrastructure — especially the major public sector undertakings in and around Vizag — and create durable assets. The funds will have to be used to create infrastructure that can stand up to such severe cyclones so that these exercises do not become a recurring feature. The assessment of damage to the PSUs such as the steel plant, and to the naval facilities has been completed, and the Central and State authorities are taking up the unenviable task of evaluating the devastation caused to the agriculture sector. Compensation to farmers and a time-bound plan to restore the livelihood of both farmers and fisher folk demand priority. The Northeast monsoon has just begun and the government has to be watchful to prevent any further calamity in this region.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-a-herculean-challenge/article6535465.ece
28,10,2014,The return of Ms. Rousseff,"In more ways than one, the re-election of Brazil’s President Dilma Rousseff for a second consecutive term in Sunday’s dramatic run-off represents a replay of the political script in Latin America. The narrative is one where the region’s heads of state usually hold office for successive spells, at times even beyond the stipulated two terms, by means of tinkering with the Constitution. Yet that does not tell the full story of an electorate that is easily forgiving of their leaders. For the repeated massive electoral mandates equally confirm popular faith in the stewardship of the region’s leftist parties, despite the economic challenges facing these countries. The term anti-incumbency seems almost alien to the Latin American lexicon. The verdict received by Ms. Rousseff for another four years would appear above all to be a measure of the popularity of the social protection programmes of the centre-left Workers’ party during its 12-year rule. Such a reading is borne out by the response from Brazil’s vocal and impatient middle classes, who rallied behind the two opposition candidates right through the poll campaign.
During the first-round poll on October 6, it was the popular environmentalist Marina Silva who consistently defied predictions of a surge in support for the incumbent. It was her eventual elimination that pitch-forked Aécio Neves of the centrist Brazilian Social Democracy party — never in the reckoning until then — into the race. Similarly in the run-off, Mr. Neves came within three percentage points of the winning margin. Evidently, the ripples that Ms. Rousseff’s party felt in the run-up to the polls over corruption scandals in the big state oil refineries did little to dent the party’s pro-poor image. Nor was the state of the economy in recession enough to sway voters away. Brazil, as with other countries of the region, may have nearly reached the end of the commodities boom of recent years. The President has, in her second term, some deft balancing to do to retain the support of her political constituency, while formulating policies to ensure macro-economic stability. A new beginning could well be in the offing. During the campaign and after her victory, Ms. Rousseff has acknowledged egregious wrongdoing in the state-owned Petrobras, where she had for a time served as a director. Greater transparency could further enhance Brazil’s growing global economic and political clout. Latin American leaders have emerged as robust champions of democracy with a strong egalitarian thrust. They could do more to safeguard these values. The best of intentions may not justify the erosion of basic institutions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-the-return-of-ms-rousseff/article6538740.ece
28,10,2014,Bold proposals on climate deal,"The bold proposals that form the European Union’s (EU) new climate deal set the tone for the best bargain for a global agreement in Paris next year. The decision to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 40 per cent by 2030 is ambitious in comparison with the 8 per cent reductions on a 1990 baseline under the Kyoto Protocol. The EU was the lone participant from among the industrialised nations. Last week’s move follows through on the offer made at the 2013 Warsaw United Nations Conference on Climate Change where countries agreed to make voluntary GHG emissions curbs in a post-Kyoto scenario. The mainstay of the overall EU strategy would be the much-touted emissions trading system (ETS). It currently covers over 11,000 power and industrial plants and airlines and about 45 per cent of the total GHG emissions within the bloc. Sectors within the ETS would contribute 43 per cent reductions and those outside 30 per cent by 2030. Other decisions include non-binding commitments to raise the share of renewable sources to 27 per cent in the total energy consumption and an equal proportion to the deployment of energy efficient technologies. The EU deal is subject to similar commitments that may be made by other countries at the Paris summit next year.
With some national capitals from Poland to Portugal pleading special circumstances and others pushing to expand caps into new sectors, the deal was significant for the distance covered than what remains to be done. The European Trade Union Confederation, which represents about 60 million workers, has criticised the targets as too low, that potentially could take away a million jobs created in a low-carbon economy. At the same time, with an eye on the 2015 climate summit, the Prince of Wales’s Corporate Leaders Group backed by over 50 companies representing 4.5 million employees worldwide have advocated a robust EU climate and energy policy. This is a sign of convergence of interest between industry and employee bodies that would be crucial to clinch a global pact in Paris. The record of the Kyoto Protocol shows that countries with a pre-existing high technology base did not achieve the highest emissions reductions, perhaps in view of their lock-in effects. It was the transitional economies of the states of the former Soviet Union that registered impressive reductions. Here may be a lesson for emerging economies such as India to make strategic decisions with an eye on opportunities for the future. The failure of the Copenhagen 2009 summit would undoubtedly temper expectations among EU leaders about a global deal. But Washington has travelled some distance since then and climate sceptics are on the back foot these days. There is thus real potential for progress.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-bold-proposals-on-climate-deal/article6538741.ece
29,10,2014,A positive move,"Boosting the nation’s defence preparedness, the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) has cleared a set of much-delayed defence deals, worth Rs.78,000 crore. In line with the ‘Make in India’ mantra, the focus was on indigenisation in addressing critical equipment shortages. The Navy can heave a sigh of relief with the sanction for six new conventional stealth submarines under Project 75I, all to be built in a single shipyard in India. At Rs.50,000 crore, this will be the largest-ever domestic ship-building contract. A committee set up by the DAC will identify the eligible shipyard from among five public sector and two private shipyards within eight weeks for issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP). Project 75I was promulgated under the ambitious “30-year submarine construction plan”, approved by the Cabinet in 1999 to build 24 conventional submarines. But not a single submarine has been inducted till date and the induction of Scorpene submarines has been repeatedly delayed.
In another significant decision, the government has decided to go ahead with acquiring Israeli-built Spike Anti-Tank Guided Missiles, a third-generation fire-and-forget system, to equip the infantry with 300-plus launchers and 8,000-plus missiles, along with transfer of technology worth Rs.3,200 crore. This effectively nixes the U.S. offer of producing the Javelin in India and further co-development of fourth-generation Javelin for use by the armies of both countries. Given that the U.S. lobbied hard with New Delhi, this is sure to cause heartburn in Washington. Both the systems have been extensively field-tested by the Indian Army, and opting for Spike is a pragmatic decision to save time and money as the acquisition had already been delayed by two years. If things go as per plan, the deadline of the Army to induct the new missiles by 2017 should be met. In all, about 40,000 missiles are required to equip the Army’s 382 infantry battalions and 44 mechanised regiments. The decision not to go ahead with the Javelin also reflects concerns relating to the extent of technology transfer by the U.S. In contrast, Israel has a long record of being a trusted partner. The co-development would also have meant an end to the indigenous Nag ATGM project. The Midget submarines for the Navy will boost the capacity of marine commandos to undertake special missions behind enemy lines, and likewise the other deals represent significant capacity additions. The decision is without doubt a positive movement with respect to the urgently needed modernisation of the three services. For this there is an immediate need to reform the procurement process, which after several revisions is still cumbersome and opaque. The real test is to ensure timely completion of the process in a transparent manner, adhering to the set deadlines.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-a-positive-move/article6542028.ece
29,10,2014,Going by medical evidence,"The reaction of the Governors of New York and New Jersey to the Ebola threat reflects their lack of understanding of the nature of the disease, and utter disregard for the need to institute well-thought-out public health policies that are based on sound medical advice and clear evidence. In a knee-jerk reaction, both the Governors on October 24 made it mandatory to quarantine for 21 days even asymptomatic people returning from the three Ebola-stricken West African countries if they had come in direct contact with people suffering from Ebola. Illinois soon followed suit. As a result, an American nurse returning from Sierra Leone was placed under quarantine. The policy was hurriedly introduced after Craig Spencer, a New York-based doctor who had treated patients in Guinea, tested positive for Ebola. Facing a barrage of criticism and an uproar, the Governors revised the policy in less than 72 hours to allow asymptomatic people to be quarantined at home for 21 days with twice-daily monitoring; those being monitored will be allowed to interact with family and friends. Despite the revision, the policy remains more restrictive than the requirements put out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Beginning October 27, the CDC’s updated guidance requires direct and active monitoring by public health officials once a day along with follow-up monitoring over phone for a period of 21 days for all travellers returning from the three disease-hit countries. It also calls for restricted public activities and restricted long-distance travel, but there is not a word on quarantining asymptomatic persons.
Unlike airborne diseases such as flu and tuberculosis, people can get infected by the virus only when they come in direct contact with the body fluids of an Ebola patient. Infected people remain free of symptoms and do not transmit the virus during the incubation period of two to 21 days. It is obvious that the panic-stricken Governors went overboard with their policy that had no scientific basis whatsoever. The direct fallout of their irrational policy would have led to a further reduction in the number of health workers volunteering to tackle the outbreak in the three African countries. Already the number of health workers volunteering to work in these countries is disproportionately small compared with the magnitude of the problem. While monitoring must be a top priority, allaying the fears of people by creating more awareness should be given equal importance. The U.S. has much to learn from the way Nigeria handled the Ebola situation and rid itself of the disease recently. A massive awareness programme along with tracking and surveillance was the way Nigeria tackled the situation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-going-by-medical-evidence/article6542030.ece
30,10,2014,Tough talk as tactic,"After having striven hard to emerge as the single largest party in Maharashtra, the Bharatiya Janata Party seems intent on preserving its newly gained advantage vis-à-vis former ally Shiv Sena: the party is continuing with the tough posture it adopted during the pre-election seat-sharing talks. The go-it-alone tactic for the Assembly election was finalised as part of a long-term strategy, and the BJP is in no mood to surrender its lead over other parties, especially the Shiv Sena. Excessive concessions in terms of ministerial berths would have nullified the gains from the success of the gamble the party took in contesting the election without a major ally. The BJP could not afford to be seen as bowing to pressures from its allies. One of the reasons why the Congress came across as weak and ineffectual during the United Progressive Alliance’s years in power was the unreasonable pressure exerted by its allies on the government. Evidently, the BJP does not want to repeat the same mistakes, especially when it has a majority of its own in the Lok Sabha. The tough talk with allies was also a message to the electorate: the party would not give in to unreasonable demands of allies for the sake of power. With the Nationalist Congress Party offering unconditional support, the BJP had the luxury of driving a hard bargain with the Sena. Of course, sooner or later the NCP too would demand its price for the support, but for now the BJP is hoping to play the Sena against the NCP.
When Devendra Fadnavis takes oath as Chief Minister on Friday, he will still have to balance the Sena and the NCP with some help from the BJP’s national leadership. The NCP, which was part of the previous government led by the Congress, and which was attacked by the BJP during the campaign as corrupt, is unlikely to be accommodated in the Ministry. A weakened and chastised Sena, shorn of its pretensions to being the biggest party in Maharashtra, is what the BJP is hoping to accommodate in its government. But the very fact that the BJP is going ahead and staking claim to form the government without tying up an agreement with the Sena, shows the party’s new-found confidence. But unlike the BJP-led government at the Centre, the Fadnavis government will have only limited room for manoeuvre, dependent as it is on the support of other parties. Whether as opponent or ally, the Sena is not easy to deal with. Mr. Fadnavis would do well to concentrate on the growth and development plank, giving a boost to commerce and industry, leaving the political management to the party leadership. That is the best way to skirt contentious issues such as statehood for Vidarbha, on which the BJP deliberately maintains an ambiguous stand.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-tough-talk-as-tactic/article6545461.ece
30,10,2014,A new bank for Asia,"A little more than a year after it was broached, a new multilateral bank in Asia — the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) — was born last week in Beijing, signalling in the process the failure of hectic lobbying by the United States against the move. The bank has 21 signatory- countries, with India being the only major backer apart from China; the rest are the smaller economies of Asia. The event was not without its share of drama as Australia, Indonesia and South Korea pulled out apparently under pressure from the U.S. Yet, it may not have been easy for them, as statements from some of their diplomats show. The three countries, which have extensive trade dealings with China, seem to be still torn between safeguarding their relations with the Asian giant and not displeasing the U.S. It should surprise no one if they decide to take the plunge after watching from the sidelines how the bank develops. The AIIB, along with the other new China-based institution, the BRICS Bank, represents the first major challenge to the U.S.-led global economic order and the 70-year uncontested reign of the Bretton Woods twins. In a way, the IMF and the World Bank have only themselves to blame if they find their dominance under threat, because the seeds of the new bank sprouted from either their inability or unwillingness, or both, to meet the growing funding needs of Asia.
As per the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) assessment, Asia needs on an average $800 billion of investment in infrastructure annually between now and 2020. Against this, the ADB, dominated by Japan which is also a founding member, lends no more than $10 billion a year for infrastructure. With the American-dominated World Bank and the Europe-led IMF also remaining hamstrung, the need for a multilateral body to finance the growth region of the world was real. The ADB has been cautious in its comments, and understandably so; it can do with support for infrastructure lending, yet needs to safeguard its turf. India, with its participation, has lent heft to the AIIB, which would otherwise have been seen as a Chinese bank backed by membership from lightweight countries of the region. India, which will be the second largest shareholder in the bank, should work with China to ensure that best practices are followed in projects for procurement and materials and in terms of labour and environmental standards. While there is without doubt a geo-political angle to the founding of the bank — which is natural, given that the economic balance of power is shifting to Asia — care should be taken to ensure that it does not become the driving factor in the bank’s functioning. The bank should do what it has been founded for — fund Asia’s infrastructure.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-a-new-bank-for-asia/article6545463.ece
31,10,2014,Ending the impasse in Delhi,"With the Supreme Court setting a deadline for Lt. Governor Najeeb Jung to exhaust the possibilities of forming a government in Delhi, the political impasse in the National Capital Territory is bound to end soon. After Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal stepped down as Chief Minister in February, the Assembly was kept in suspended animation without any immediate prospect of a popular government being put in place. The BJP was unable to form a government, and the AAP was unwilling to do so with outside support from the Congress; the end result was that there was no forward movement in the efforts to have an elected government in Delhi. While the AAP was impatient for a fresh election, apprehensive as it was of attempts by the BJP to win over its MLAs, the BJP, having failed to get the numbers, seemed to be waiting to get the timing right for a fresh election. Quite rightly, the Supreme Court noted that President’s Rule could not “go on forever” with the Assembly in suspended animation.
Given the numbers in the Delhi Assembly, it is unlikely that Mr. Jung’s efforts to ensure the formation of a government would yield any result. The BJP is unlikely to get offers of outside support, and even a minority government headed by the party seems a remote possibility. Understandably, many of the BJP’s MLAs do not want another election so soon. Going by the results of the Lok Sabha election, the BJP as a party is likely to do well if an election were to be held any time soon. But not all the MLAs are looking forward to spending more time and money to retain the seats they won just a year ago. Now that by-elections to three constituencies have been called by the Election Commission, the BJP would ideally like to wait for the results before ruling out the possibility of forming a government. But with the Supreme Court beginning to show impatience, a fresh election may have to be held sooner than later. The AAP, which during its 49 days in power took quite a few populist measures, must be hoping the voters still retain some goodwill for the party. If it failed to repeat its Assembly election success in the Lok Sabha election, this was because voters felt it did not stay the course and took the exit door at the first opportunity. In pushing for a fresh election before the Supreme Court, the AAP must be calculating that the voters would give it another chance. Delhi was supposed to be its launch pad for a national foray, but after having failed miserably in the Lok Sabha election, and having stayed away from both the Maharashtra and Haryana Assembly elections, the AAP seems to have whittled down its ambitions. The party will have to get its Delhi act right first, before it does anything else.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-ending-the-impasse-in-delhi/article6549321.ece
31,10,2014,Giving new life to Aadhaar,"The imperatives of governance have a tendency to make political parties think differently once they are in power and revisit earlier misgivings. Nothing illustrates this better than the Narendra Modi government’s decision to go ahead with the ‘Aadhaar’ scheme aimed at giving unique identification numbers to residents. The Bharatiya Janata Party had on some occasions in the past voiced its reservations about the viability and desirability of the scheme and questioned the legal basis of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) set up by the previous United Progressive Alliance regime. Many had questioned the lack of statutory basis for the project, voiced concern over the security implications of the possible enrolment of non-citizens, and argued that collecting biometric data without enabling legal provisions violated constitutional rights. However, the Modi regime views the scheme as a possible means to meet its own policy goals. It appears to have come round to the view that having a unique identification number may improve efficiency and targeted delivery of services. The Home Ministry has in a letter to the States come out in support of the Aadhaar scheme, saying it is a sound way of authenticating beneficiaries of government schemes and services.
The NDA government is now targeting universal coverage of the entire country under the Aadhaar project by June 2015. Latest statistics show that as many as 70 crore Aadhaar numbers have been issued, making it the world’s largest biometric database, and that over 50 crore people are yet to be covered. The government will have to reckon with multiple challenges before it can translate its policy goal of using authentic identification as the driving force behind delivery of benefits and services. The scheme is under challenge before the Supreme Court, and by an interim order the government has been restrained from making Aadhaar numbers mandatory for availing any benefit or service. To overcome the judicial challenge, the government needs to put in place a sound legal framework. This requires provisions for digital identity protection and steps to ensure that different kinds of personal, demographic and biometric data are truly disaggregated and do not fall cumulatively in the wrong hands — transnational databases, for instance. Secondly, the physical process of enrolling people with both demographic and biometric data remains cumbersome, and it needs to be made simpler and more accessible. Thirdly, the government must always preserve alternative means of identifying individuals and verifying their addresses so that a particular form of identification does not become restrictive or mandatory.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-giving-new-life-to-aadhaar/article6549322.ece
1,11,2014,An outrageous penalty,"The death sentence imposed on five Indian fishermen by a Sri Lankan court for drug trafficking has added an unfortunate dimension to relations between the two countries. The issue has roiled Tamil Nadu, where it is being seen as one more atrocity by Sri Lanka against the State’s fishing community. The Government of India has said the fishermen are innocent and plans to help them appeal the sentence. The five were arrested mid-sea in the Palk Bay region in November 2011 and tried for being in possession of heroin. Three Sri Lankans have also been sentenced to death in the same case. Irrespective of the merits of the case, the sentence seems unduly harsh, especially considering that the men had no previous record of being involved in the narcotics trade. Moreover, there is no instance of Sri Lanka handing down this punishment in any other case of drug trafficking over the last many years. In any case, capital punishment for a drug offence goes against all humane norms. While the two countries have a treaty on transfer of prisoners under which an Indian serving time in a Sri Lankan prison can be repatriated and complete his sentence in an Indian jail — and vice versa — it does not cover those sentenced to death, unless the sentence is commuted. But there are still strong reasons to hope that Sri Lanka will not carry out the sentence. For one, in keeping with its Buddhist traditions, the country has not carried out a judicial execution since 1976. For nearly three decades, though Sri Lankan courts awarded the death penalty in many cases, in every instance the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. In 2004, the country decided to implement death sentences once again, but to date no execution has taken place. A process of appeals is also available to the fishermen, first in the Court of Appeals, then the Supreme Court, and finally to the President, who has the power of pardon.
While the final outcome may well be positive, the entire episode is a setback in other ways. First, it will complicate efforts to find an early resolution to the issue of how fishermen on both sides can live and pursue their livelihoods without hurting each other’s access to scarce marine resources. Secondly, with political and public passions in Tamil Nadu running high, attitudes against Sri Lanka are certain to harden in the State. In the past, hardline Sinhala ideologues and politicians across the Palk Strait have fed off Tamil Nadu’s anti-Sri Lanka sentiments. With Sri Lanka now in its presidential election season, there is reason to be concerned about the vitiated atmosphere. In the best interests of both countries, the issue must not be turned into fodder for political mileage.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-an-outrageous-penalty/article6553150.ece
1,11,2014,Going beyond disclosure,"Confidentiality in tax matters is both an essential part of due process in preliminary proceedings and a necessary ingredient for international cooperation in curbing evasion. However, it cannot be used as a pretext to avoid a proper investigation into details that other countries have shared with it. This is the message from the Supreme Court’s intervention that compelled the government to submit a list of 627 names in a sealed cover. The court, in deference to the principle of confidentiality on which international cooperation in tax evasion issues is premised, has not made any disclosure but has forwarded the names to the Special Investigation Team appointed by it for a further probe. In hindsight, it may appear a redundant exercise, as the government had also submitted the same list to the SIT as early as in June. However, it appears that insufficient progress has been made since then, and the court is possibly justified in believing that unless it monitored the probe it may be delayed unduly. Chief Justice H.L. Dattu has clarified that the court would not have asked for the list but for an application by the government seeking modification of earlier orders passed in the same matter.
Given the zeal shown by the Bharatiya Janata Party in the run-up to the election in promising that it would bring back fabulous sums of money parked in foreign bank accounts, there was a legitimate expectation that the authorities would aid the SIT in a quick and efficient probe. However, governance has its own limitations, and a better understanding of the confidentiality requirement has led to a more pragmatic approach to the issue. The present regime is right in stressing on its international obligations and not wanting to jeopardise future cooperation on tax matters from various countries, which was the stand of the UPA government as well. Apart from an inter-governmental agreement with the U.S., India also plans to adopt a multilateral agreement with 46 other countries. It hardly needs iteration that nothing should be done to undermine such efforts to put in place trans-border mechanisms to curb evasion. For, the identification and prosecution of all those who hold unaccounted money in overseas accounts is more important than the immediate public disclosure of some names. Meanwhile, it should not be forgotten that not all black money is abroad. Much of it is within the country, especially in sectors such as real estate, higher education and mining. A recent report of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy estimates that the ‘black economy’ in India may constitute 75 per cent of its Gross Domestic Product. A raft of policy measures and diligent monitoring are needed to bring down this illegal edifice.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-going-beyond-disclosure/article6553149.ece
3,11,2014,With and without the Sena,"Two steps forward, one step back. The Shiv Sena’s post-election process of rapprochement with the Bharatiya Janata Party is not only slow, but is also getting to be painful for both sides. After Sena pramukh Uddhav Thackeray was persuaded to >attend the swearing-in ceremony of Devendra Fadnavis as the BJP’s first Chief Minister in Maharashtra, the two parties were expected to conclude a power-sharing agreement quickly. But the Sena was unwilling to give up its claim for the deputy chief ministership; it not only wanted at least a third of the ministerial berths, but also key portfolios. Actually, much more than the composition of a coalition ministry is at stake: the two former allies are trying to >redefine the terms of their political engagement at every stage of the negotiations. Following the bitter parting of ways over seat sharing prior to the election, the BJP and the Sena are fighting for the same political space. Any political concession could have consequences beyond the number of ministers and the nature of portfolios. With the Sena winning 63 seats to the BJP’s 122, the 1:2 ratio for ministerial berths suggested itself. But the deputy chief ministership, which is of great symbolic value, and key portfolios such as home, finance and urban development, are still sticking points. The Sena clearly wants to use its share in power to expand its political clout. Mr. Thackeray knows the BJP outmanoeuvred him during the seat-sharing negotiations and the break that followed, but he is not ready to play the role of a junior partner for all time to come. The power-sharing, if it happens, will only be part of a strategic retreat before the Sena seeks to establish itself as the dominant political player in Maharashtra.
For the BJP, keen as it is to leave its own stamp on the government, giving in to all of the Sena’s demands would amount to surrendering some of the gains it made by contesting the election on its own. Of course, the party has the luxury of the “unconditional support” offered by the Nationalist Congress Party. But beyond using this offer of support to pressure the Sena further, the BJP would not want too close a relationship with the Pawars. The NCP, accused of scams during its years in power, was one of the targets of attack for the BJP during the campaign. That only a core team of the BJP took oath, and that Mr. Fadnavis retained a large number of portfolios, including home, urban development, housing and health, are indications of the national party’s readiness to keep the doors open for the Sena. Whatever the party decides, it will be doing so with the full knowledge that life with the Sena will be as difficult as life without the Sena.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/with-and-without-the-sena/article6558110.ece
3,11,2014,Voting procedures and participation,"The Republicans are striving to wrest control of the Senate in the United States mid-term elections on Tuesday. But there is a contentious battle raging, that could potentially disenfranchise thousands of voters, a not so good augury for an otherwise vibrant democracy. Since 2010, all of 21 States have put in place voting restrictions, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. The Supreme Court, by a narrow majority in 2013, delivered a verdict that invalidated a clause in the 1965 Voting Rights Act that requires States with a record of discrimination to obtain federal clearance before changing electoral procedures. This is the same law that the court had upheld in the past, the Congress renewed last in 2006 and President George W. Bush assented to. To be sure, the judges last year did not question that the risk of racial discrimination in voting may still be real. Rather, they would like remedial legislation to be rooted in the country’s current circumstances — as reflected in increased minority voter turnout in many States and the two-term election of a first black President.
Against the backdrop of 2013 and ahead of the mid-term polls, Republican-ruled states want to enforce laws that they argue are intended to protect the integrity of the electoral process. These statutes require registered voters to bring some form of photo identification to the polling stations. Some States have also reduced the early voting period — which was designed as a measure to encourage and enhance participation — with an eye on reducing costs. Opponents have won challenges in federal courts on the ground that these laws disproportionately affect voters from minority communities and that the degree of fraud may not warrant stringent voting curbs. The Supreme Court’s two interim orders in October, to block the Wisconsin voting law and allow that of Texas, have not clarified the position. It may not seem unreasonable for voters to be asked to present one of many photo identifications at the polls. But to deny voters who have already registered for the franchise for want of any documentation militates against the spirit of a mature democracy. This is a fundamental question for a country whose core objectives in foreign policy remain the promotion of democracy and the rule of law around the world. These could well be some of the considerations before Congress as and when it revisits this landmark legislation that goes back to the time of the civil rights movement. Republicans and Democrats should rise above narrow partisan political interests to secure the protections for the country’s large minorities. Individual liberty, as well as equality, are at stake here. The world will be watching as Washington votes on Tuesday.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/voting-procedures-and-participation/article6558112.ece
4,11,2014,The real enemy at the gates,"The >suicide bombing at the Wagah border in Pakistan is a tragic, and sadly ironic, reminder that it is not India that is the enemy at its gates. Forces within Pakistan are actively tearing down the country. More than 60 people were killed in Sunday’s attack, and at least three sets of militants have rushed to own responsibility for the carnage — a group called Jundullah that was responsible for the Peshawar church bombing in September 2013, and two rival factions of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Jundullah, which is also a part of the TTP, claimed it carried out the bombing in retaliation for the Pakistan military’s ongoing operation Zarb-e-Azb in parts of North Waziristan. The country has been on high alert for the last few days, as the month of Muharram has annually seen a spurt in suicide and other terrorist attacks targeting Pakistani Shia. But clearly, Pakistani intelligence agencies were also not ruling out non-sectarian attacks at this time. Wagah, an important base for the paramilitary Rangers who guard the India-Pakistan border, was listed in recent Pakistani security alerts as vulnerable. Stopped by guards at the entrance to the large area that comprises the border check post, the suicide bomber blew himself up in the midst of civilians, most of them visitors streaming out after the flag-lowering ceremony at the border gates. Three Rangers were also killed. The Pakistani Police have quickly arrested 21 people in connection with the incident, and investigations will no doubt continue. What confronts Pakistan, though, is the absence of a coherent policy or clear narrative on Islamist extremism and militancy. The military operation in the northwest seems aimed more at ensuring that by the time U.S. troops pull out of Afghanistan at the end of this year, Pakistan would have subdued the TTP enough not to be bogged down in firefighting the blowback within, and is freer to pursue larger strategic ambitions in the region. Many militant organisations continue to thrive, particularly those with a marked anti-India agenda.
The explosion was close enough for it to be heard and felt on the Indian side. No Indian was hurt in the bombing. On Monday, the two sides held a low-key flag-lowering ceremony, and the Pakistani side even allowed visitors. But the limited overland >trade between the two sides has been halted temporarily. The Samjhauta Express train service between Delhi and Lahore has also not been interrupted. The attack a few metres from the border should be a reminder to India that a stable Pakistan is in India’s interests. The incident also underlines that in order to convey Indian concerns about terrorism emanating from Pakistan, there is no option but for Delhi and Islamabad to talk.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/wagah-border-blast-the-real-enemy-at-the-gates/article6561569.ece
4,11,2014,Protecting children in schools,"Extremely disturbing incidents of sexual assault on children inside school premises have been reported in quick succession from Bengaluru. Two cases were reported in the month of October alone and at least nine such cases, including extreme cases of rape, have been reported during this year. The victims include a girl as young as three. While media coverage may have led to increased reporting of such incidents, it must be pointed out that attention came to be focussed on the issue after cases were reported from upmarket English medium schools. There is a fear that cases in schools catering to the poor may not even come to light. Sexual abuse of children is not restricted to schools and often goes unreported in several venues across the country. A comprehensive survey conducted in 2007 by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India, found that 53.22 per cent of over 12,000 children interviewed had faced sexual abuse. The survey suggested that schools constitute a relatively safer environment and most abuses are perpetrated by family members, including parents. Till March this year, 400 cases have been registered under the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO) and over 12,000 cases of rape of children were registered in 2013 under Section 376 of the IPC. These statistics underline the enormity of the issue, which needs to be addressed in its entirety.
However, following the incidents in Bengaluru, the public debate is over safety in schools. Improving safety measures and fixing vicarious responsibility on school managements are important, but there are deeper concerns that need to be addressed. Even as the number of schools are growing, there are hardly any systems to verify the antecedents of staff members, and this has at times let even habitual offenders come in close contact with children. Schools need to scrutinise their teaching and non-teaching staff more closely. Improving awareness over what constitutes sexual abuse as defined by law is essential. It is also important to counsel parents and teachers to actively encourage dialogue with children and make them aware of any dangers and report such incidents. Even basic protocols on the time and place of contact with a child by staff members are not followed in most schools. Making the law enforcement authorities more sensitive to dealing with such cases is another major challenge, and often the psychological impact of such cases on the victims, parents and other children is not addressed seriously. These are issues that need to be dealt with sternly and swiftly at the national level. The concern is not just that these cases have been reported in one city, but the fact that they may be going unreported in several others.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/protecting-children-in-schools/article6561570.ece
11,11,2014,Addressing competing demands,"Prime Minister >Narendra Modi’s first expansion of his Council of Ministers has his unmistakable imprint, with some difficult allies firmly put in their place and immigrants from other parties rewarded. In his quest for as coalition-free a government as possible, Mr. Modi evidently intends to use the BJP’s impressive electoral mandate to minimise the role of tantrum-throwing partners. And so, the Shiv Sena’s demand for a second Cabinet berth at the Centre and key portfolios in the Maharashtra government in exchange for its support were brushed aside, even as Suresh Prabhu from that party, an administratively experienced if politically marginal leader, was inducted into the BJP on Sunday morning and sworn in as Railway Minister hours later. Ex-Congress veteran Birendra Singh, who joined the BJP before the Lok Sabha polls, has been given not just Cabinet status but the key portfolios of rural development, panchayati raj, drinking water and sanitation. Ram Kripal Yadav, who defeated RJD boss Lalu Prasad’s daughter in Bihar on the BJP symbol — after being denied the RJD ticket — is now a Minister of State. Inderjit Singh Rao, who exchanged the hand for the lotus before the elections, had become an MoS with independent charge in the first round itself.
The expansion also reflects the fact that “minimum government” does not always produce “maximum governance”: the government has acquired 21 fresh faces, taking the strength of the Ministry to 66, as some overburdened senior Ministers have been relieved of additional responsibilities. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has shed defence, Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad law, Shipping and Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari rural development, and Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar information and broadcasting. Of course, in acknowledgement of Mr. Jaitley’s status as Modi confidant and his skills as a communicator, he will also steer the I&B Ministry. The choice of new entrants also points to competing demands of inducting talent, increasing geographical and caste representation, and addressing the BJP’s core Hindutva constituency. If the entry of former Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar as Defence Minister, the Harvard-educated Jayant Sinha as MoS for finance and Mr. Prabhu mark infusion of talent, the Ministry’s social composition has been enhanced — four more Brahmins, three of whom are in the Cabinet, two Jats to compensate for a non-Jat Chief Minister in Haryana, and more OBCs and Dalits. The only woman to be included, Niranjan Jyoti, is a saffron-clad sadhvi. And the controversial Giriraj Singh, a Bhoomihar from Bihar, had endeared himself to the new dispensation when he declared that all those who did not like Mr. Modi should just go to Pakistan.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-narendra-modis-new-cabinet/article6584156.ece
11,11,2014,Still plagued by accidents,"The Indian Navy continues to be accident-prone — after a brief respite. Last week, >an auxiliary ship sank off the Visakhapatnam coast. This tragedy claimed the life of one sailor while four personnel were deemed missing. This is the second incident in a fortnight after >INS Kora, a missile corvette, was scraped by a merchant ship near Vizag and suffered minor damage. After the latest incident, the Navy is left with just one Torpedo Recovery Vessel. Since August 14 last year, when an onboard explosion sank INS Sindhurakshak, a Kilo-class submarine that was berthed in Mumbai, there have been 15 accidents. In fact, an accident on another submarine, INS Sindhuratna, on February 26 cost the Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral D.K. Joshi, his job: >he resigned owning moral responsibility. The resignation caused a major shuffle in the Navy’s top brass and >the new chief, Admiral R.K. Dhowan, ordered a review of procedures and later stated that the causes of all the incidents had been thoroughly analysed. But the trend has not been arrested, and now it seems the lessons learnt were incomplete. The problem is across-the-board. Submarines, front-line warships and support ships alike have suffered accidents. This suggests systemic lapses, be it in maintenance, acquiring spares or non-adherence to standard operating procedures. Besides, it is essential to take note of Admiral Joshi’s recent comments about his inability to take routine maintenance and procurement decisions for his force. This hints at bureaucratic overreach and a crisis of confidence between the bureaucracy and the military.
It is paradoxical that a Navy that is operating about 180 ships and inducting large modern platforms is plagued by issues of maintenance and spares. In the global context, this does not bode well for a force aspiring to be a blue-water Navy and to establish itself as a net provider of security in the region. It is widely acknowledged that the Indian Navy is a pre-eminent force in the Indian Ocean region. And many navies in the region are looking to the Indian Navy for support and leadership. It comes as no surprise that of late naval diplomacy has become a major thrust area in New Delhi’s diplomatic outreach and the Navy has been extending training and maintenance support to many nations. A dubious safety record at home will raise serious apprehensions in the minds of other nations about the country’s credibility and capacity. Whatever the reasons, these incidents are unacceptable. Mere assurances of review and reorientation will not help maintain the Navy’s image as a professional force if such accidents keep happening. Precious lives, expensive platforms as well as the larger credibility of the Navy and the nation are at stake. It is time for some honest introspection and course-correction.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-indian-navy-ships-accident/article6584157.ece
12,11,2014,List of good intentions,"As many of his predecessors have done, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju has unveiled another >draft aviation policy, which he hopes to implement by next year. It is more of a broad statement of intent, without going into the specifics. Mr. Raju has touched upon all the major issues and problems faced by the sector, but has not exactly come up with solutions. It may not be fair to expect the Minister to just wave a magic wand and resolve all the issues that have plagued the aviation sector over the decades. But this is perhaps the best time for the NDA government and Mr. Raju to take some bold initiatives and address all the pending problems. New airlines are coming into being and people are realising the benefits of air travel, but there are several major obstacles for the airlines to grow and be profitable. What takes the cake is the announcement of yet another committee or panel to look afresh at the future of Air India, which has remained the country’s big white elephant for too long. Something drastic needs to be done, and done quickly, before crores of rupees of public money go down the drain. Given its condition, there can be no suitors for a strategic partnership, and listing it on the stock exchange may end up as a disaster. The government has to make up its mind about privatisation, sooner than later.
The need of the hour remains the growth and development of airports. While Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru have shown the way on PPP models, the Airports Authority of India’s (AAI) projects in Kolkata and Chennai have been disasters. The Aviation Ministry has to set this right and get a private partner to redeem these airports, besides strengthening and developing smaller airports for the existing and new airlines to operate. The ravaged Visakhapatnam airport and a ‘real’ airport for Vijayawada must be at the top of his priorities. The AAI may be a profitable enterprise, but it needs to be corporatised and restructured in order to make it efficient. As far as the airlines are concerned, the cost of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) is the major concern, as it contributes to over 40 per cent of the cost of operations. The recent drop in global crude prices and consequently of ATF provides some relief. But Mr. Raju has to work with the Finance Ministry and the State governments to rationalise taxes, basically VAT, to reduce the burden. The advent of GST may solve this problem, as and when it comes into being. Since the Minister has promised to firm up the policy by January and get it through the Cabinet, the civil aviation sector as a whole hopes that he will work on the specifics and come up with a time-bound, implementable framework that will not only help all segments of the aviation business but also protect the interests of passengers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-aviation-policy-by-ashok-gajapathi-raju/article6587606.ece
12,11,2014,The continuing polio challenge,"Polio has bounced back with a vengeance in Pakistan. Compared with 53 cases reported during the period January to September last year and 54 in 2012, there have been 174 cases during the corresponding period this year. As on November 5, all of 235 cases have been recorded, the highest-ever in the past 15 years; there were 558 cases in 1999. With a sharp spike in the numbers, Pakistan has turned into a bigger polio reservoir, accounting for 80 per cent of the world’s cases. The Taliban militants’ role in preventing nearly a quarter of a million children in North Waziristan from being vaccinated against polio over the last two years has marked a severe setback to the country. The repercussions of a fake Hepatitis B immunisation programme carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency in Abbottabad in 2011 are also there for everyone to see. If lack of trust in polio immunisation efforts already existed in the community, the militants exploited the fake programme to exacerbate distrust. The exodus of virus-carriers from the region to the rest of the country in June this year has greatly increased the risk of transmission. But the good news is that none of the regions remains inaccessible to health workers. Yet, there is a monumental task ahead for the polio programme in Pakistan as no province is free of the disease; even cities such as Karachi and Lahore have recorded a few cases this year. “The polio programme [in Pakistan] is a disaster. It continues to flounder hopelessly, as its virus flourishes,” notes a recent report of the Independent Monitoring Board.
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has just set an ambitious goal of ridding the country of polio in six months. Aside from collective action by all actors, there has to be an immediate, transformative change in the polio programme for Pakistan to get anywhere near disease-elimination. As November to May is a low-transmission season — the virus is the least active and the vaccine most effective during this time — a great opportunity exists now to tame the virus. As the Type 1 virus spreads quickly, is tenacious and is the most difficult to get rid of epidemiologically, vaccination coverage should be 100 per cent; herd immunity is the least in India and Pakistan. It should also explore the option of giving at least two polio shots to children in addition to the oral polio drops. The double-vaccination strategy can greatly boost immunity and reduce the number of oral drops campaigns needed. With the Pakistan virus paralysing children in Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, the possibility of it emerging in India is real. India, which has been polio-free for over three years, cannot lower its guard till such time as polio is eliminated from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the three polio-endemic countries.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editoiral-on-polio-challenge-in-pakistan/article6587607.ece
13,11,2014,Tarnished victory in Maharashtra,"Ahead of its floor test in the Maharashtra Assembly, it was clear that the 13-day-old Devendra Fadnavis-led government would >win its vote of confidence, even though with 122 MLAs the BJP was 22 short of a majority. The 41-member-strong Nationalist Congress Party had indicated from the start that it would abstain from voting, an act that, by reducing the effective strength of the House, would have ensured the BJP government a safe passage. By the time voting day came, the NCP had gone a step further in agreeing to vote for the government, and that would have given it a margin of 19 votes. Yet, on Wednesday the BJP chose to allow its victory to be tarnished — even undermined — by refusing to agree to a division, or an actual head-count: instead, despite vociferous protests by members of the Congress and the Shiv Sena, some of whom entered the well of the Assembly, the minority BJP government won its confidence motion through a voice vote. The question then arises: if the BJP could have anyway won through actual counting of heads, why would it opt for a voice vote, one that has much less legitimacy, and that too at the very start of a five-year term?
It is hard to believe that the BJP, buoyed by the continuing popular sentiment in its favour, lacked the confidence to go for an actual vote. More plausible is that the BJP did not wish to be seen as taking support from the NCP, a party that it targeted sharply not just through the election campaign but in the years that it was in the opposition, for gross acts of corruption. If the NCP, that had presided over the Irrigation Ministry for a decade, for instance, was seen as responsible for a financial scandal that reportedly ran into thousands of crores of rupees, forcing NCP leader Ajit Pawar to resign from the post of Deputy Chief Minister, there were other scams that NCP leaders such as Sunil Tatkare and Chhagan Bhujbal were accused of. For the BJP to be seen now as taking support from a party that has been so closely associated with graft in the name of providing a “stable” government, its leaders possibly felt, would cast a shadow over its promise of providing good governance and a clean and transparent administration. But, in the weeks ahead, the Fadnavis government could find it hard focussing on the job at hand, with the Sena accusing it of “strangling democracy” and the Congress warning that it would not allow any business in the Assembly to be conducted till the government obtains a fresh trust vote, and threatening to bring a no-confidence motion against newly-elected Speaker Haribhau Bagade who overruled the demand for division. The new government may have to face a vote on the Governor’s Address, for which it will have to marshal its forces again. Clearly, not a propitious beginning.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-trust-vote-in-maharashtra-assembly/article6591700.ece
13,11,2014,"Needed, a wider debate","The Gujarat government’s new law making >voting compulsory in local body elections will surely attract judicial attention, as it expressly raises the constitutional question whether citizens, qualified to be electors, can be compelled to vote when they do not wish to. The idea of making voting compulsory in response to declining voter turnout in successive elections has been debated for many years, but so far this country has not been able to make up its mind on such a far-reaching measure. The principal objection has always been that voting in a particular way, or even refraining from voting, is a matter concerning the freedom of expression. Even though the right to cast one’s vote is only a statutory right, the Supreme Court has recognised that the act of choosing one candidate over another falls under the freedom of expression guaranteed in Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. It is as a complementary or auxiliary right flowing from this fundamental right that it held that voters had a right to know the background of candidates so that they can exercise their right in an informed manner. Therefore, there is little doubt that the Gujarat Local Authorities Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2009 will impact on this fundamental right. Former Governor Kamla Beniwal had declined to give her assent and returned the 2009 Bill to the Gujarat government for reconsideration in 2010 on the same grounds, observing that “forcing voters to vote is against the principles of individual liberty”.
The Gujarat Assembly adopted it again in March 2011. Once again, Ms. Beniwal did not give her assent. It has now received the assent of Governor O.P. Kohli. According to the statement of objects and reasons, “… due to low turnout of voters to discharge their duty by exercising their right to vote, the true spirit of the will of the people is not reflected in the electoral mandate.” It says that if a voter failed to vote for reasons other than those permitted in the rules, he may be declared a “defaulter voter”. However, the penalty has not been spelt out and it may find a place only in rules to be framed in future. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party considers it a revolutionary measure, while the Congress has opposed it. The amendment includes a provision to fix the reservation for women in local bodies at 50 per cent, a provision that nobody objects to. While Gujarat has the right to adopt laws in tune with the aspirations of its own people, legislation such as this with far-reaching consequences is best adopted after evolving a wider consensus. As far as general voting principles go, it is relevant to see what Section 79(d) of the Representation of the People Act says: that “electoral right” includes the right “to vote or refrain from voting at an election”.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Needed-a-wider-debate/article11006673.ece
14,11,2014,Targets that endanger lives,"It is at once sobering and shocking that the sterilisation procedures (laparoscopic tubectomy) carried out on 83 women at a camp in Pendari village of Chhattisgarh’s Bilaspur district on November 8 ended up >killing 11 women and leaving 69 others ill, some of them critically. In another such sterilisation camp held in Guarella in the same district on November 10, one of the 56 women sterilised has died and 12 remain in critical condition. Even as the precise cause of the tragedies is being investigated, what is abundantly clear is that the standard operating procedures were thrown to the winds. It is appalling that a single doctor and a health worker carried out the procedures on all the women in both the camps. According to a 2008 document dealing with standard operating procedures for sterilisation services in such camps, a surgeon can carry out no more than 30 tubectomies using three laparoscopes on a given day. Even a team with additional surgeons, support staff and instruments can at the most conduct 50 procedures a day. Even if more than one laparoscope was used, the detailed procedure of decontaminating and cleaning the laparoscope prior to disinfecting it for 20 minutes would have made it impossible to conduct 83 procedures in less than five hours at Pendari and 56 procedures at Guarella in such a short time. It is an irony that though laparoscopic tubectomy is a bloodless procedure, many women in the Pendari camp went into haemorrhagic shock due to excessive blood loss. Along with anaesthesia and drugs given to women, the needle of suspicion points to sepsis arising from the use of contaminated laparoscopes.
Sadly, rules will continue to be flouted and deaths will be the order of the day as long as the lethal combination of pressure to meet sterilisation targets, “compensation” amounts given to women and payment to doctors on the basis of numbers, are in place. Making it worse is the undivided attention the government has been giving to sterilisation as a means of achieving by 2020 the Millennium Development Goal on reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health. This comes out clearly in a letter sent out on October 20, 2014 by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to the Chief Ministers of 11 “high focus States.” The “compensation” and payment made to all the parties have been increased for these States. Already, the number of sterilisation procedures carried out in India is disproportionately high compared with other family planning measures such as the use of intrauterine devices. If the accredited social health activists (ASHA) are under pressure to mobilise women for sterilisation, the increased focus on the 11 States would mean that women in these States are even less likely to be counselled and informed of safer contraceptive methods to choose from.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-women-death-in-bilaspur-due-to-sterilisation-process/article6595787.ece
14,11,2014,Rivals turn the tables on climate,">Wednesday’s deal between the world’s two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases (GHGs) raises the prospect of a robust international agreement in Paris next year. Although the two countries account for over one-third of global GHG emissions, the U.S. and China have for the best part of the last 20 years been hostage to economic arguments to act decisively on global warming. Now, the U.S. has promised to cut emissions by an extent of 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025, which would mark a near-doubling of the current pace of reductions. As for China, President Xi Jinping has pledged that the country’s emissions would peak by around 2030; by that time, solar and wind power would account for 20 per cent of overall energy sources. This is based on projections of a slowdown in economic growth, a phase-out of obsolete power plants and a rise in the share of renewables. In the absence of further details, environment experts and activists remain unsure of the full implications of the latest agreement. But the political significance of the agreement is clearly beyond doubt. The latest announcements represent a huge advance over the entrenched positions held by the two countries until recently. Washington did not ratify the lone legally-binding global pact to cut emissions — the 1997 Kyoto Protocol — as it opposed the view that developed and developing countries had differentiated responsibilities on countering global warming. Beijing was exempted from the requirements of the Protocol in view of its status as a developing country.
The proposals presented by the U.S. and China follow the announcement last month of a 40 per cent reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 for the entire European Union. Together, the package from these three main players would create the momentum for other major high carbon footprint countries to come up with matching commitments ahead of upcoming talks in Lima and a final deal in Paris. Notable among these are India, Indonesia, Australia and Brazil. In the meantime, President Barack Obama would have to sell the deal to a Republican-dominated Congress, with its share of climate-sceptics. The leaders of the Group of 20 countries meeting in Brisbane this weekend should act on their commitment to reduce subsidies for the further exploration of oil, gas and coal. The September 2014 report of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate also makes a strong case against the prevailing high subsidies regime. Beijing and Washington should exert their considerable clout to realise this objective at the earliest. Such an effort would be consistent with their pledge to increase reliance on renewable energy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-deal-between-us-and-china-on-climate-change/article6595788.ece
22,11,2014,Unprecedented indictment,"The good thing about the tenure of Ranjit Sinha as Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation is that it is drawing to a close in the next few days. And when he exits the country’s premier agency, in which many have reposed faith for the competent investigation of sensitive cases, he would have contributed a substantial share to the erosion of its credibility. From letting the Law Minister vet a status report meant solely for the Supreme Court, to maintaining unauthorised contact with suspects under investigation, Mr. Sinha repeatedly let down his agency, the dignity of his office and the cause of justice. The Supreme Court’s order directing him to keep away from the investigation into the 2G spectrum cases is unprecedented. The charges relate to interference in the administration of justice, attempts to derail the investigation from within, and arbitrary removal from a probe team of officers deemed uncomfortable. Seeking to help those accused of corruption and delaying the filing of the charge sheet in the Aircel-Maxis case were among the charges levelled against him by the NGO, Centre for Public Interest Litigation. The Bench headed by Chief Justice H.L. Dattu has found the charges ‘ prima facie credible’ but, in the interest of protecting the agency’s reputation it has refrained from pronouncing a detailed order. However, it is now for the government to ascertain the exact magnitude of Mr. Sinha’s misdemeanours and take appropriate disciplinary action.
The conventional narrative that the CBI is a ‘caged parrot’, that is, an institution struggling to assert its autonomy in the face of political pressure, was turned on its head by Mr. Sinha. Under him, there were phases when the agency appeared to be pliant by choice, willing to serve causes other than justice. If at all considerable progress was made in several matters, it was due to judicial monitoring and prodding, the diligence of conscientious investigators and prosecutors, and the vigilance of activists. It was in the fitness of things that the Supreme Court also recalled its earlier order seeking the disclosure of the name of the whistle-blower who brought out details of Mr. Sinha’s residential visitors. It rightly concurred with Anand Grover, Special Public Prosecutor for the 2G case, that once information supplied by someone is deemed credible, there was no need to disclose the informant’s identity. Mr. Sinha’s exit, which will be more propitious if advanced by a few days by his resignation, will provide an opportunity to operationalise recent reforms relating to the CBI Director’s appointment contained in the Lokpal Act. But it cannot be forgotten that law provides but the bare bones for justice, and it is people who give it soul and substance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/cbi-ranjit-sinha-unprecedented-indictment/article6622339.ece
22,11,2014,Crime in the name of honour,"The deployment of ‘honour’ is an intense form of social control on women, a disciplining of the body. Families, communities, gossiping neighbours snooping for acts of ‘dishonour’ — what one wears, how one talks, evasions, embraces — all mapped out by that penetrating gaze. All these transgressions are met by the patriarch’s voice with some form of violence or the other. The more extreme forms of transgression, such as inter-caste and inter-religious relationships, are met by the punishment of death. This week, Bhavya, a college student in Delhi, Yadav by caste, was >strangled to death by her family for eloping with Abhishek, a Punjabi. The Supreme Court has come down heavily upon such crimes. In Krishna Master (2010), the Bench observed that “wiping out almost the whole family on the flimsy ground of saving the honour of the family would fall within the [principle of] rarest of rare cases evolved by this court”. The honourable judges may condemn it in an emphatic voice, yet this voice fades within homes where the dictum, ‘honour thy father’, prevails.
A number of international laws including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, specifically address honour crimes. The Law Commission of India responded with the draft of a Bill that prohibits social condemnation of such marriages, and proposed to reverse the presumption of innocence, treating the accused guilty until proven innocent. However, the heart of the problem is in the conflict between indefensible customary practice and state law. At an academic conference in 2005, Sooraj Singh, the pradhan of a khap in Haryana, remarked that the caste panchayats enjoyed ‘divine rights’ to adjudicate marriages. “We cannot allow love marriages… we do not recognise court marriages either.” The challenge arises because honour crimes stand at the confluence of competing spheres — customary practices, criminal law and international law. For instance, the Supreme Court, in Lata Singh (2006), affirms the freedom to marry as per individual choice, yet “individuality” and “choice” take very different forms in customary practices wherein choice may be less individual and more filial and even communal. Caste complicates the issue further. Dr. Ambedkar endorsed inter-caste marriages on the basis of the reasoning that it would end the feeling of caste and separateness. These crimes in the name of honour have been strongly condemned by the broader society, yet they are rampant across the country. Much as people may protest on the streets, within homes the ‘curse of honour’ persists and a culture of tolerance lets horrific practices slip in, in the name of honour. Leaders across different fields — political, religious, social — and of civil society need to work to change the mindset that perpetrates prejudice.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/crime-in-the-name-of-honour/article6622337.ece
24,11,2014,Stepping out of the shadows,"It is rare that a single bilateral invitation conveys as much as Prime Minister Modi’s invitation to U.S. President Obama to be the chief guest at the Republic Day parade does. To begin with, the invitation corrects an anomaly, that has meant that America is the only world power never to have had a dignitary grace the occasion that Russian and Soviet leaders, as well as leaders of France, the U.K., Japan and China have, over 64 years. Secondly, the invitation signals that the India-U.S. relationship is now stepping out of the shadows on all aspects of bilateral relations: economic, political and military. In the past 23 years since India opened up its economy, trade with the U.S. has grown by 1000 per cent, and according to figures given by the Defence Minister in Parliament this August, the U.S. is now India’s biggest defence supplier. Add to this the deep people-to-people ties, built mainly by the more than three million Indian-Americans in the U.S., and thousands of students who graduate from American universities, and the visit will be what one diplomat described as an “open and honest acknowledgement of the relationship’s reality”.
Thirdly, the invitation, and its acceptance by the White House, signifies a much larger move on the world stage, a “coming out” of India and the U.S. with the ties they now share. For the past few months, Mr. Modi’s travels and public speeches have indicated a primacy to the United States that previous governments had stopped shy of giving. Some of the hesitation was owed to an unspoken suspicion of the U.S. felt in India’s establishment. It was this feeling of mistrust that guided much of the criticism of Mr. Manmohan Singh’s tenure during negotiations over the India-U.S. civilian nuclear deal, and spills over into issues of WTO and agricultural subsidies, as well as intellectual property rights. The concerns are also influenced by historical relations: the U.S.’s support to Pakistan during the Bangladesh war, its support of the Mujahideen and then the Taliban to defeat the Soviet Union in the Afghanistan war, and its refusal to take a position during the Kargil war. It would seem both levels of concerns are now in the past, and put aside by the Modi government as it embarks on a new course of relations with the U.S., including engagements with its strategic allies in the region, Japan and Australia. It may be in reaction to these developments that two other significant moves have been seen in India’s neighbourhood — the recent reachout by China to Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Afghanistan, and by Russia to Pakistan with a new defence cooperation agreement. Even as India now prepares to celebrate its shared values with the U.S., the larger meaning of President Obama’s forthcoming visit has clearly not gone unnoticed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/stepping-out-of-the-shadows/article6627431.ece
24,11,2014,Strengthening care of the newborn,"Tamil Nadu has come to realise in a most tragic manner the high mortality risk faced by preterm babies (those born before 37 completed weeks of gestation), and its unfinished task of saving these lives. Of the 13 neonates who died recently in district hospitals in Dharmapuri and Salem, five were preterm. Both preterm and low birth weight babies have died of the usual causes, such as respiratory distress syndrome, intrauterine growth restriction, birth asphyxia and sepsis. Incidentally, with 27.3 deaths per 1,000 live births, the State has achieved the WHO’s Millennium Development Goal 4 of reducing the number of deaths in children younger than five years, well before the December 2015 deadline. It can further reduce the number of under-five deaths by adopting a two-pronged approach of bringing down the number of babies born preterm and providing crucial care to such babies during the most critical phase. There is a compulsion to adopt both measures simultaneously as birth complications in preterm babies are among the leading causes of neonatal (0-27 days) deaths. Of the estimated 15 million babies born preterm annually across the world, over 3.6 million are in India; of them, over 3,00,000 die each year. Globally, one million preterm babies die every year. According to an October 2014 study published in The Lancet, during 2013, for the first time, preterm birth complications became the leading cause of death in children under five, across the world.
Though there are several reasons for preterm delivery, the common, preventable causes are early induction of labour, teenage pregnancy, multiple pregnancies, diabetes and high blood pressure. In a commendable move in July 2013, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare authorised auxiliary nurse midwives to administer a pre-referral dose of antenatal corticosteroids to women and injectable antibiotics to babies for suspected sepsis. Since immaturity of the lungs is one of the main reasons for preterm baby deaths, the steroid administered before delivery can vastly improve lung maturity. Similarly, the Ministry’s focus on the well-proven and cost-effective kangaroo mother care in health facilities and at home after discharge can greatly improve survival rates of preterm and low birth weight babies. These measures can potentially save many preterm babies (32 to less than 37 weeks of gestation) even in the absence of expensive incubators and ventilators. There is no reason why Tamil Nadu cannot set these as standard health practices at all its public health centres and hospitals. The lives of at least some of the 13 babies could probably have been saved had the State already adopted them. These deaths should prompt the government to act swiftly.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/strengthening-care-of-the-newborn/article6627432.ece
25,11,2014,Carlsen reigns supreme again,"Five-time world chess champion Viswanathan Anand’s bid to regain the title was foiled in Sochi, Russia, with a game to spare. The gifted young Norwegian, Magnus Carlsen, produced a result similar to the one seen in Chennai last year when he dethroned the genial Indian in his own backyard. But unlike the clash last November, the latest war of the pieces for the crown was closely fought, with the valiant Anand gaining praise from the chess world. He was far more proactive in his approach and not intimidated by the strongest player on the planet. Anand bounced back immediately to avenge the defeat suffered in the second game. There were times when he made Carlsen look vulnerable if not outright beatable. The Norwegian did admit to being inconsistent in the 12-game match that he won after emerging stronger in the penultimate encounter. It was equally true that Anand had his chances in Game 6 where he failed to capitalise on one of Carlsen’s rare blunders, and in Game 11 where he went for an unequal exchange when he could have held the game with careful play. Anand’s positive intent was hard to miss, and Carlsen described the match as “much tougher than last time”. He said: “I am happy and relieved. I’m very happy with the way I pulled myself together.”
Devastated after the loss of the title last year, Anand earned the right to challenge Carlsen by winning the Candidates tournament in March this year. He went on to claim the prestigious Bilbao Masters title to show that his form was far better than it was 12 months ago. Carlsen, on the other hand, had been performing a shade below his own lofty standards. Therefore, going by the form of the two players, the match was expected to provide much closer battles — and it did. The decisive difference between two of the finest players in the cerebral sport was Carlsen’s ability to deal with pressure and complications better. It was not often that Carlsen yielded much ground, but whenever he did so, Anand failed to cash in on the opportunity. At key moments, Carlsen proved stronger than Anand. Though the difference between the players’ performance was marginal, Anand’s mistakes proved decisive while Carlsen’s less-than-optimal moves went unpunished. To the 23-year-old’s credit, he dealt with the game-turning moments better than Anand did at age 44. If Carlsen thought Anand ran him close till the end, the Indian was gracious after the match. “I have to admit Magnus was superior. His nerves held up better. All things taken into account, he just played better,” said Anand. Whether the Indian maestro will get another chance to challenge the Norwegian, remains to be seen. But age is certainly not on Anand’s side.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/carlsen-reigns-supreme-again/article6630587.ece
25,11,2014,For peace in the Garo Hills,"The Garo Hills region of Meghalaya has faced turmoil for years with multiple militant groups fighting what are essentially turf wars, their eyes primarily on the spoils from the extortion of coal mine operators. Among the 10 groups at work, the Garo National Liberation Army (GNLA), less than five years old, has been particularly brutal in its actions. In the third such attack within a year targeting police personnel, GNLA militants killed two policemen in a blast in the South Garo Hills district last week. The GNLA’s patently unrealistic demand has been for the creation of a separate state of Garoland. The claim put forward by the GNLA’s parent outfit, the Achik National Volunteer Council (ANVC), which was born in 1995, and its splinter group, the ANVC (B), was the creation of ‘Achik Land’, comprising the Garo Hills region and parts of Assam. Eventually, they scaled it down to the strengthening of the Garo Hills Autonomous District Council (GHADC). An agreement signed in New Delhi on September 24 in the presence of Home Minister Rajnath Singh and State Chief Minister Mukul Sangma — that the GNLA opposed — has now laid the ground for the disbanding by next month of the ANVC and ANVC (B): the former had signed a tripartite ceasefire agreement with the State and the Centre in 2004.
The latest agreement, which provides for enhanced autonomy for an expanded GHADC — elections to its current number of 29 seats are due to take place early in 2015 — goes some way in meeting regional aspirations. Among other things, it seeks to ensure enhanced autonomy and powers for the body. The Centre has agreed to extend a special package for the socio-economic and educational development of the area and the rehabilitation of surrendering militants. But this represents only partial progress, and nobody expects the low-intensity run of militancy to wind down so easily. Yet, with one significant chunk of militants out of the way, based on a coordinated approach with and active support from the Centre the State should move vigorously to deal decisively with the remaining terror-mongers in a time-bound manner. Over the last few weeks, several cadres belonging to different outfits have either surrendered or been nabbed, following stepped-up operations by the security forces. Putting down the militancy in Meghalaya — which has a 445-km boundary with Bangladesh — with a firm yet sensitive hand should serve as a strong message to all insurgent groups in northeastern India. This message should be that negotiations over reasonable demands will be their only option. At the same time, any nexus between politicians and militants to gain political mileage — as has often been alleged by some leaders — should be rooted out, so militancy gets no leeway in the sensitive region.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/for-peace-in-the-garo-hills/article6630589.ece
26,11,2014,Sweet and sour for Ms. Banerjee,"Soon after Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s astounding performance in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the general feeling was that she was “clearly riding a tiger”. Her confidence-building speech last Saturday promised retaliation, which indicated that she was desperate to rein in the BJP, the quasi-Opposition in the State. This very well could be the time for her to recount mistakes and answer questions a leader owes her electors. Why did her party cadres attack and pressure the Left Front supporters to such an extent that they joined the BJP? Why did she align herself totally with the minorities to polarise the State? Why did she not question her colleagues as they siphoned public money through Ponzi schemes? Why brand all critics as ‘Maoists’, and of late as ‘rioters’? The ‘whys’ are many and the answers are definitely blowing in Bengal’s pre-winter wind. But then again, Ms. Banerjee has assumed the role of an unpredictable leader-incarnate and the party does not have any committee at a higher level to monitor or regulate her. Which means she has a free hand to shelve, scrap or amend existing policies at will, as in the case of her amendment last week of the Land Reform Act to relax norms on landholdings in order to develop mega-township projects.
Likewise, Ms. Banerjee may unpredictably divert all available funds to build roads and health-care facilities till the Assembly election of 2016, seeking to ensure victory. The BJP may not be in a position to counter such projects. She has another advantage. Previous election results have established her firm support base in rural West Bengal, if not always in urban areas. Because of her anti-privatisation policies, which her managers have failed to highlight, Ms. Banerjee enjoys rural support at the cost of waning corporate backing. Perhaps now she needs to recall the early days of the Left Front government, when the Communist Party of India(Marxist) — through its organisational network — managed to convince half of West Bengal that the State was being discriminated against by the Centre and the ‘ruling elite’. On the other hand, the CPI(M) pushed its pro-poor programmes, which changed the lives of the rural poor — the real vote base. Even though Ms. Banerjee does not have any more land to distribute, she can address poverty. Hence, emulating the Left Front may not be a bad strategy, particularly when her celebrity- supporters have branded her a ‘neo-communist’, and she has in any case lost the ‘big capital’. While the BJP’s house is still not in order in the State, though the party is growing, Ms. Banerjee needs to ‘retaliate’ strategically, shunning violence and connecting with the people: it would seem that she retains her main strength of being able to connect with the masses.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sweet-and-sour-for-ms-banerjee/article6633492.ece
26,11,2014,A far too liberal Act?,"The law pertaining to juvenile crimes has come under the scanner yet again. Last week, a Supreme Court Bench comprising Mr. Justice Dipak Misra and Mr. Justice U.U. Lalit described the punishment for juveniles committing serious crimes as being “far too liberal” and urged the Attorney General to suggest that the government have a relook at the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 (JJ Act). These comments arose in the context of adjudicating a crime that was committed 24 years ago by an accused who is now about 40 years old, and who has been appraised by the Supreme Court as having been a juvenile aged 16 years while committing the crime. Section 7A(ii) of the JJ Act states that if the court finds a person to be a juvenile on the date of commission of the offence, the case shall be immediately sent to the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB). The judges were of the opinion that if the accused, now a 40- year-old man, were presented before the JJB, he would be punished with an “admonition” or direction for “group counselling”, which would be “too liberal” and hence “an exercise in futility and a travesty of justice”.
There are three brief comments in response. First, the constitutionality of the JJ Act insofar as it allows all children to receive the benefits of the juvenile justice system irrespective of the gravity of the offence has been upheld by the Supreme Court in Salil Bali (2013) and Subramanian Swamy (2014). Hence, the issue of amending the JJ Act at this point is a purely policy or legislative issue, not warranting judicial intervention. Second, the interpretation of Section 7A of the JJ Act was settled in Jitendra Singh. Accordingly, cases such as this are to be sent to the JJB as the appropriate authority. Moreover, because judicial delays are common in our system, often the accused is much older by the time he/she is presented before the JJB, leading to a peculiar situation which no doubt needs to be resolved. But this too is a fault in our institutional design rather than a gap in the JJ Act per se. Third, there are several misconceptions about the rate of juvenile crimes in India. For instance, Mr. Justice Misra observed: “In a population of 1,000, one per cent may be juveniles who commit rape and murder. But even this one per cent can be a menace.” These statistics seem grossly overestimated. The National Crime Records Bureau report states that juvenile crimes comprise only 1.2 per cent of the total number of crimes in India, and that 65 per cent of them are property-related crimes such as theft, while just about 5 to 8 per cent constitute serious offences such as rape and murder. Although media reportage of juvenile crimes might have increased, this may not mean that instances of juvenile crime as a whole are in themselves increasing.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-far-too-liberal-act/article6633494.ece
27,11,2014,The demographic challenge,"The rhetoric on the capacity of countries to reap the so-called demographic dividend cannot mask the more complex reality of a not-so-young world in 2014, and non-uniform patterns of growth. About a quarter of the world’s population — 1.8 billion — is in the age-group of 10-24 years, according to the latest United Nations Population Fund report. In 1950, the proportion was higher, at almost a third of the global total, at 721 million. The 10-24 age segment has thus declined overall, while it has more than doubled in absolute terms during the period. This means that in theory, people in this age bracket, their number larger than China’s population, can hope to live longer, be better fed and educated, do decent jobs and earn adequate incomes. In concrete terms, this segment would swell the share of the working-age population — those between 15 and 64 years — over the next few decades. But here is the catch. Nine out of ten people, or 89 per cent, in the 10-24 age-group live in less developed countries, says the UNFPA report. Most people who are alive today are below 30 years of age. In 17 states, 15 of them from sub-Saharan Africa, one half of the population is under 18 years. One in three girls in the developing world is married before reaching 18, raising the risk of early and perhaps unintended motherhood among children and hampering the realisation of their full potential. One in seven HIV infections occur during adolescence.
According to the World Bank, last year there were 100 dependants (those below 15 years and above 64 years) for every 100 people in the working age in Angola. The ratio was even higher, at 103, for Chad; for other states in the conflict zones of sub-Saharan Africa, the figures were in the 80s and more. Whereas India’s age-dependency ratio has ranged in the 50s per 100 working population between 2010 and 2013, China has stayed in the mid-30s during the corresponding period. India’s higher ratio underscores the extent to which social protection measures would have to be strengthened for both the components to ease their mutual interdependence and enhance the quality of life. Alongside measures to boost growth and attract multinational corporations in the manufacturing and services sectors, Prime Minister Narendra Modi must take up massive public-funded programmes in basic education, health care and vocational training, with a thrust on building a clean economy. Only then could the current younger age profile of the population prove advantageous. The demographic dividend refers to the potential among countries to increase economic growth by taking advantage of the changing age structure in the population. Clearly, a great deal remains to be done to realise this potential.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-demographic-challenge/article6636885.ece
27,11,2014,Moving towards consolidation,"The announcement of the merger of >ING Vysya Bank with Kotak Mahindra Bank could not have come at a better time. With a pro-reform BJP government at the Centre, expectations are running high. Coming as it did at a time when reform talk is getting louder, the proposal to amalgamate these two not-so-big but fairly well-run private banks has raised expectations of a wider consolidation in the Indian banking field. Does this merger plan signal the shape of things to come in the highly fragmented banking industry? No doubt, the convergence of self-interest was the initial trigger in this instance for the eventual decision to merge. Nevertheless, the two banks are also acutely aware of their limitations given their size and restricted geographical presence. Once it fructifies, the merger will push the resultant bank to the fourth slot in the private banks category. The merger instantly offers the consolidated entity a larger customer and client base. Also, the larger entity will be in a position to provide enhanced product offerings to its constituents. This merger initiative is no less due to the market dynamics which demand a large enough scale to drive business efficiency in an intensely competitive global environment. Viewed from this point of view, the merger sets a whole new trend. The M&As (mergers and acquisitions) that had occurred in this sphere since 2000 were mostly among unequal players, and were not voluntary, to say the least. These two banks would do well now to quickly resolve issues arising out of their technological and cultural diversities to make the merger a meaningful value-creation exercise.
If consolidation is to be truly meaningful, public sector banks (PSBs) must wake up to the reality now. More often than not, they echo their political masters’ preferences of the moment. Given that they dominate the Indian banking field, much of the NPA (non-performing assets) woes of the industry are the direct consequence of the inherent inefficiency that seeps across the entire PSB canvas. Not surprisingly, the PSBs are under tremendous stress in terms of cost, governance and efficiency. Business and practical prudence suggest that they should focus on service efficiency. They have constraints aplenty in terms of cost structure, scale and governance culture. Since the government is the major shareholder, it requires more than mere statement of intent from the political masters to drive a larger consolidation in the Indian banking field. The unfolding scene on the global stage, increased regulatory requirements, stringent governance stipulations, tighter provisioning norms and fresh competition have all combined to force Indian banks to think of mergers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/moving-towards-consolidation/article6636887.ece
28,11,2014,Racism and law enforcement,"A grand jury’s exoneration of Darren Wilson, the white police officer who on August 9 shot dead an unarmed teenager on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, sent shock waves across the United States this week. The fact that 18-year-old Michael Brown died violently on the streets of the quiet St. Louis suburb and no one will be held accountable for his death has left Americans of all colours once again searching their souls for answers. Some of them made their anger known to the world. Thousands took to the streets across major cities, braving the likelihood of yet another heavy-handed crackdown by the police and the National Guard. In Ferguson, the rage spilled over and took an ugly turn as gunfire erupted across the night, dozens of buildings and police cars were set ablaze, and looters had a free run in parts of the city. President Barack Obama reiterated his muted call for calm on all sides, but had clearly not sensed the mood of collective anguish that was engulfing the African-American community, or did not wish to confront the questions that they were asking: why had a behind-closed-doors grand jury that was 75 per cent white decided that there was no probable cause to take the case to trial? Why was police officers’ use of deadly force, especially against minorities, considered an acceptable practice?
The Brown-Wilson case holds up a mirror unto the troubling state of race relations in America. First, it is only the latest in a long list of flashpoints triggered by law enforcement brutality towards unarmed African-Americans, including the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin (17) and the videotaped 1991 beating of Rodney King, both cases in which the accused officers were acquitted. Second, it shows how public prosecutors or other government officials may manoeuvre juridical proceedings in a manner that renders a plaintiff victory effectively impossible. Since the verdict was announced, the St. Louis County Prosecutor, Robert McCulloch, has come under fire for his decision to use a grand jury in this highly sensitive case, thus precluding a transparent and exhaustive trial involving detailed cross-examination. Third, the imprint of the racist stereotyping of African-Americans amongst police officers, which was arguably evident in the testimony of Mr. Wilson, has a wider echo in terms of relatively higher incarceration rates. The searing racism in the U.S. has often made it an uncomfortable place for minorities, as it was for Muslims, Sikhs and even Hindus in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks. African-Americans of all backgrounds, however, face a daily, ongoing threat to their lives and security, given the toxic mix of historical prejudice and law enforcement’s gun culture.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/racism-and-law-enforcement/article6640403.ece
28,11,2014,A matter for concern,"The death of Phil Hughes, three days before what would have been his 26th birthday, has left the cricketing world shattered. In an induced coma after being hit on the head by a bouncer during a first-class Sheffield Shield match in Sydney on Tuesday, the Australian batsman succumbed to his injuries on Thursday. All Sheffield Shield matches in play were abandoned, as was the second day of the Test between Pakistan and New Zealand in Sharjah, offering a sense of how acutely the tragedy was felt across the cricketing community. The game, stripped of its relevance for the moment, had to pause. Hughes was that rare modern-day cricketer, a competitor genuinely liked rather than merely respected. Despite his prodigious rise from a banana farm in New South Wales to the stardom of Test cricket — where, just 20, he made twin centuries in a famous win in South Africa — Hughes, by all accounts, retained an unaffected, self-effacing air. The reactions that poured in captured the shock of a people struggling to come to terms with the freakishness of it all. As sports physician Peter Larkins told The Australian, “It’s really a matter of millimetres and the bad luck of the actual site of the impact.’’
It’s too early to estimate the effect of the incident on cricket’s future. For the present, in the immediate aftermath, everything else pales into insignificance. But it has made the game and everyone who plays and follows it more keenly aware of the very real danger the cricket ball represents. So well-armoured and protected by modern gear made of new material does the batsman and the close-in fielder appear these days that fatalities on the field of play seem inconceivable. As former England captain Michael Vaughan wrote in The Telegraph (U.K.), “With all the equipment and protection we have nowadays I never felt that anything drastic … could happen to me.” And for the most part, protective equipment holds up very well and continues to improve. But as helmet-maker Masuri admitted, last year’s model, which Hughes was wearing, does not offer as much protection to the back of the head and the neck as their latest helmets. There will no doubt be a review of helmet design and an increased emphasis on helmets in junior cricket, welcome steps both. The psychological aspect will be harder to address. Sean Abbott, who delivered the ball to Hughes, has been offered professional support and counselling by Cricket Australia, as have all others who have requested it. But when Australia and India begin their Test series next month, a series Hughes was a contender to play in, what reaction will the first bouncer evoke? Cricket may not be the carefree game again, even with new, space age protective gear.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-matter-for-concern/article6640404.ece
5,12,2014,No room for complacency,"Maoist guerrillas struck again this week, killing 14 personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force in Chhattisgarh, their biggest attack so far this year. It came just a few days after Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh claimed that the day was not far when his State would become “Naxal-free”. While it is a fact that the Naxals have been on the back foot in the last few months, to dismiss their strike capability would be a mistake, as the attack on the CRPF men has proved yet again. The sustained security operations in the Red Corridor may have shrunk the Naxals’ area of influence, but they still hold sway in large swathes of land where the presence of the state is close to zero. Also, they are very motivated, and their knowledge of the local topography is much better than that of the security forces. On the other hand, the CRPF personnel, who are at the forefront of the anti-Naxal operations, have to struggle against too many odds and thus become easy prey to such attacks.
For years, governments refused to acknowledge the fact that the Naxalite problem had its roots in the socio-economic deprivation that has existed in large parts of central and eastern India. While that acknowledgment has reluctantly come, at least partially, on the ground it is very often being treated as a pure law and order problem. A strong law and order component is an essential part of the overall strategy, but it should not be the only component. As the recent sterilisation-related tragedy in Chhattisgarh showed, the poor and marginalised tribal people in the entire region have little to thank the administration for. Instead of bringing in development, the state has brought more violence into their lives. The Naxalites have also treated them as pawns in their fight against the state. As a result, the people of this region are caught between the devil and the deep sea. The core issue is to bring about improvement in the lives of the tribals. The government says it cannot bring in development due to the presence of the Naxalites. But as and when they are gone, will the government be able to ensure that the civil administration brings about changes in the region? The sterilisation tragedy was a demonstration of administrative callousness. With the current government’s thrust on industry and the core sector, Chhattisgarh and the other affected States may well see a rapid increase in activities such as mining. That will only add to the misery of the tribals, with their land and forest and water resources suffering further damage. Mining is no doubt necessary, but care should be taken to ensure that mining activities are carried out with enough sensitivity to the needs and concerns of the people living there, and not in callous disregard of their interests.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-room-for-complacency/article6662320.ece
5,12,2014,The season’s resonance,"The rare but reassuring instance of a large turnout of youngsters in Chennai at Hindustani vocal recitals organised under the aegis of the National Centre for the Performing Arts recently also raised some broader issues of relevance that go far beyond this annual year-end music season in the city. Aficionados and patrons often mildly agonise over meagre attendance at concerts. They may well be right. They may want to draw comfort in the fact that classical music is no longer an exclusive preoccupation of the classes. Whether that was always the case in this country is itself arguable. For the roots of the Carnatic and Hindustani styles of music go back to the bhakti tradition, the movement from below that swept across the length and breadth of pre-colonial India. In our times, Indian cinema, corporate sponsorships, the democratic process, and the search for cultural identities under globalisation have contributed to preserving this broad continuity. The year-end music season is unprecedented in its mix of numbers, variety, depth and range of classical music and dance, and the pattern of performances by top artistes, lecture-demonstrations, discussions and debates among musicologists pioneered by The Music Academy has kept the music and dance tradition not only alive but also refreshed and enriched it over the years.
The common refrain among teenagers and young adults is that this genre of singing belongs to a bygone era, qualified somewhat when the names of celebrity musicians are associated with a particular tradition of singing. The pioneering work of the pan-Indian Society for the Promotion of Indian Classical Music and Culture Amongst Youth (SPIC MACAY) stands out for this reason. To be sure, there are a good many performing musicians — vocalists and instrumentalists alike — from among the younger generations. The point rather is that there is not enough of a following for classical music among non-musician youth today. With the result, youngsters are noticeably missing when it comes to simply taking time out to listen to others perform on stage. The enthusiasm of children who exhibit their talent on reality television shows also deserves mention. But here again, the inculcation of a taste for the arts means a good deal more than the mere acquisition of technical knowledge and craftsmanship. It obtains in the discovery of the subliminal powers of music. The entrapments of an instrumentalist approach to life may not be the most conducive to this end in the fine arts. Indian classical music is, above all, a product of the composite culture of this land. To lay emphasis on the distinctness of different styles of singing may not be inappropriate, but that should not be at the expense of recognising the shared foundations and intermingling of different traditions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/chennai-music-festival-the-seasons-resonance/article6662321.ece
6,12,2014,Friends again in Maharashtra,"After weeks of tough talk and posturing over Cabinet berths and portfolios, the >Shiv Sena, for all its efforts, appears to have got very little from the Bharatiya Janata Party. The Sena joined the Devendra Fadnavis government without its major demands being met; the party will not have a deputy chief minister, nor will it get the home portfolio. For sure, the BJP needed the numbers of the Sena as the “unconditional support” of the Nationalist Congress Party, a scam-tainted foe-turned-friend, was neither reliable nor desirable. But the cushion of the NCP’s support came in handy for the BJP during its negotiations with the Sena. Out of power for 15 long years, the Sena was under pressure from its own middle rung to join the government. There was also the fear of desertion from its ranks of MLAs and a rush to the BJP, clearly a party on the rise in Maharashtra. Moreover, a total break with the BJP would have made its continuance in the BJP-led government at the Centre untenable. After all, unlike in Maharashtra, the BJP had a majority of its own in the Lok Sabha and the Sena was a crutch that could be thrown away. Indeed, the Sena was the loser when it sought to link its participation at the Centre to sharing power in Maharashtra. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was unmoved by the regional party’s decision to withdraw its nominee from the list for last month’s >expansion of the Union Council of Ministers, and, in a snub, included a Sena dissident, Suresh Prabhu, after enrolling him in the BJP.
However, the patch-up between the two saffron parties will constantly be under strain, not only because of the bitterness of the last few months, but also because of their competing ambitions. The Sena is now playing second fiddle to the BJP because it has no other choice, but sooner or later the party would want to recapture its lost space as the premier Hindutva party in Maharashtra. The two parties parted ways before the Assembly election because the BJP was unwilling to concede the Sena’s demand to declare its pramukh Uddhav Thackeray as the chief ministerial candidate of the saffron alliance. Despite the beating it took in the election, the Sena will, therefore, not be reconciled for too long to remaining a junior partner of the BJP in Maharashtra. Just as the patch-up was an event foretold, given the way the numbers fell in the Assembly after the election, so too strains and counter-pulls in the alliance are inevitable. The Sena and the BJP can be in the government together for a long while, but when the next election comes they may have to take a hard decision to either go together or part ways. It is to be hoped that their fight for the same political space would not hamper governance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/friends-again-in-maharashtra/article6665678.ece
6,12,2014,Reason for hope,"People familiar with the chequered history of Iran’s nuclear programme cannot but view with hope the further extension until June 2015 of the current round of talks between the original five nuclear weapons-states and Germany (P5+1) vis-à-vis Tehran. The new deadline is the second since the November 2013 temporary deal, which paved the way for Iran to open its nuclear infrastructure to international inspections and brought the country relief from sanctions to a substantial extent, mainly in terms of oil export revenues. The tortuous record on the nuclear imbroglio was initially marked by Iran’s willingness to cease uranium enrichment following mediation by Britain, Germany and France. But a blatant refusal by the Bush administration to respect Iran’s right under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to strengthen its civilian energy capacity stoked a predictable nationalistic backlash. Washington’s stance subsequently received sanctity through a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and former British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw are on record as saying that the dispute could have been long resolved but for the influence of geopolitics in the Middle East.
The credibility of the current negotiations has been enhanced considerably with the Obama administration’s readiness to recognise Iran’s legitimate interests as a state-party to the NPT. This is not to deny the existence of fundamental disagreements. One is Tehran’s demand that a final deal include the immediate and permanent withdrawal of crippling economic sanctions. The U.S. and its partners are unwilling to concede, insisting rather on a reduction of operational centrifuges to a point that it would take at least one year for Iran to generate weapons-grade uranium to produce one nuclear bomb. The other is the pressure building up in the Republican-dominated U.S. Congress to further step up sanctions because of the failure to reach a final agreement. But then, the Iranian leadership has set its political stakes on the removal of these economic obstacles, against which there is growing discontent among even the pro-western sections of the population. Conversely, Washington and its allies, including Britain, would like to exploit this mood to build bridges with a state they see as being relatively stable in an otherwise volatile region. For countries of the subcontinent, as also the non-nuclear weapons-states, the stand-off over Iran testifies to the continuance of a major irony in the unequal global nuclear bargain. That irony is that, except Germany, Tehran’s adversaries are themselves nuclear weapons-states countenanced by the discriminatory NPT. Herein lies the hurdle to disarmament.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/irans-nuclear-programme-reason-for-hope/article6665679.ece
8,12,2014,Complex challenge in Kashmir,"The sense of satisfaction over the unprecedented voter turnout in Jammu and Kashmir, of more than 71 per cent in the first two phases of elections on November 25 and December 2, has been set back by a series of terror strikes in the Valley. The five-phase elections in the State is in a crucial stage now, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to address his first election rally in the Valley on Monday. Even those who are opposed to the elections understand the popular mood in favour of them and had avoided targeting voters so far. The attacks at four different places that claimed the lives of 11 security personnel and two civilians, were therefore intended to target India and question its narrative of normalcy in the Valley. The attackers came across the border from Pakistan, which has always maintained that Kashmir is the core issue to be resolved between the two countries. Immediate and concrete issues such as roads, electricity, drinking water and employment are important to the people of J&K, as anywhere else, and the people hope that participating in a democratic process would help. To consolidate this positive turn, New Delhi must appreciate other dimensions of Kashmir politics, and acknowledge that there are multiple stakeholders involved. Peaceful elections and wider people’s participation are signs of a positive churn, but this is also the time for India to be sensitive to, and engage with, the multilayered and complex questions of Kashmiri aspirations, rather than wish them away.
The Indian response to the violence must not amount to falling into a trap laid by those for whom the goals are instability and strife. Frequent ceasefire violations along the border, cross-border terrorism, and frozen bilateral talks have led to a deterioration of India-Pakistan relations in recent months. India called off talks objecting to Pakistan engaging with Kashmiri separatists. Both countries must take note of Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq’s offer, made during an interview to this newspaper, to wait before immediately resuming talks and being involved in negotiations. Preconditions and ultimatums will help neither India nor Pakistan. New Delhi must find a partner in the new government that will come to power in J&K, with whom it must talk about the State’s material and political aspirations. New Delhi must also engage those who are not participating in elections; after all, India has made peace with a long list of insurgent groups. History is presenting an opportunity in the Valley and it should be seized, not squandered the way the people’s mandate in 2008 was. Six terrorists from across the border must not decide the course of a democratic country.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/complex-challenge-in-kashmir/article6670327.ece
8,12,2014,Arbitrary curbs on creativity,"The Delhi High Court recently upheld an order of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting prohibiting transmission of programmes over the television channel ‘Comedy Central’ for 10 days, for broadcasting “obscene” content “denigrating women”. On November 28, the Supreme Court stayed the High Court order until further hearing. The Ministry over the past few years has issued several such warnings, advisories and orders of prohibition of content in exercise of its powers under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995. This legislation was enacted in “light of the haphazard mushrooming of cable television networks… which was perceived in many quarters as a ‘cultural invasion’ since the programmes were predominantly western...” In its Annual Report 2011-12, the Ministry claimed to play the role of “looking after the interests of women and children who are vulnerable to [the] pervading impact of satellite television”. The Act prescribes a vague set of standards relating to good taste, decency, obscenity, content denigrating women and children and so on, which broadcasters must not breach. In enforcing the Act, the Ministry set up an Inter-Ministerial Committee chaired by its Additional Secretary, with representatives from other Ministries. The IMC, on receiving complaints, gives its recommendations to the Ministry for action. The Broadcasting Content Complaints Council is a self-regulatory body that also issues directions or refers cases to the Ministry for further action.
To give examples of the Ministry’s orders, out of a list of hundreds: the TV channel Bindass was ordered to run an apology scroll for seven days for telecasting obscene visuals in the programme, ‘Emotional Athyachar’; TLC received warnings for programmes such as ‘Get Out’, ‘Bridget’s Sexiest Beaches’ and so on, for obscene content; Star World and FX received warnings for obscene visuals in ‘Dexter’, ‘Two and a Half Men’, ‘How I Met Your Mother’, ‘Mad Men’, and so on. ‘The Wonder Years’ received an advisory because the show “lacked good taste and decency and [was] child denigrating”. It may be noted that both the IMC and the Ministry pass bureaucratic orders without due regard to creative freedom and the modern ethos on constitutional issues of free speech and expression, with minimal interference from the judiciary. Therefore, there is little oversight or transparency in this process. Second, the criteria for making value judgments on the content, such as in terms of decency, good taste and vulgarity, are vague and open to misuse by those keen on parochial cultural policing. Lastly, the Ministry’s rhetoric of regulation seems to be predominantly protectionist and paternalistic in approach. Such governance tends only to curtail rather than enhance creative freedom and choice.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Arbitrary-curbs-on-creativity/article10934644.ece
9,12,2014,Unanswered questions,"The key takeaway from the meeting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had with State Chief Ministers to discuss the contours of the new body that will replace the Planning Commission was this: that power and planning should be decentralised and States should be empowered to plan, design and manage schemes based on what fits them best. This is a point on which consensus appeared to have emerged even as the Chief Ministers diverged along party lines over whether the existing body should be revamped or be replaced with a new one. The decision to offer a greater say to States in planning and managing schemes seems to have been born from Mr. Modi’s own experience as Gujarat Chief Minister when he made presentations to the Plan panel and felt the need for a better platform to articulate the views of his State. In line with this consensus, Chief Ministers would be included in the body on a rotational basis to give it a federal character. Mr. Modi’s remark on ‘bottom to top’ planning is a comment on how New Delhi cannot tailor the development plans of States as each State has unique needs and problems. A second point that appeared to have gained recognition was that expertise and knowledge resided as much outside the government, if not more so, and that these needed to be tapped by roping in the private sector into the new body.
There is, however, not much clarity on the traditional role of the Planning Commission, including its job of sitting in on expenditure committee meetings. Will it mean the end of the planning process itself? If not, who will formulate and monitor the annual and five year plans as the Commission was doing? Sunday’s meeting also failed to tackle the issue of who will allocate and transfer funds from the Centre to the States for Centrally-sponsored and Plan schemes, with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley stating that further consultations would be held on this issue. The Planning Commission has also been a veritable think-tank producing studies and policy reports that different Ministries relied upon in their decision-making. The body was staffed largely by academics and bureaucrats at the top, and an attempt to enlist expertise from the business sector did not go very far. If the new body has to be a public-private think-tank, as the Prime Minister seems to want it to be, it should have the ability to attract top-drawer talent and also network with research bodies and universities in India and abroad. Interestingly, unlike the existing Planning Commission, the new body is likely to have a statutory role, giving greater weight to its functions and powers. At this stage, many unanswered questions remain, and a great deal more of conceptual thought needs to go into the making of the new body that is to come into being by the end of January.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unanswered-questions/article6673581.ece
9,12,2014,New satellite takes wing,"India has a new bird in the sky — the communication satellite GSAT-16 that was successfully launched aboard Europe’s Ariane 5 rocket in the early hours of Sunday. GSAT-16 has 48 transponders, the largest number thus far on a communication satellite built by the Indian Space Research Organisation. It will join a constellation of 10 satellites that form the Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system. Its transponders, operating in various frequency bands, will provide much-needed augmentation of the existing 188 transponders on the INSAT system that broadcast television programmes, provide educational and tele-medicine services, carry telephone conversations, and relay data. In addition, close to 95 transponders have been leased on foreign satellites, principally to meet the needs of Direct-To-Home (DTH) television channels. Vikram Sarabhai, who founded the country’s space programme, had the farsightedness in the 1960s itself to recognise how important communication satellites and the services they provide would be to a developing nation. It was a vision that his successors turned into reality, with the first of the indigenously-built INSAT satellites being launched in July 1992.
After the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) became available in the mid-1990s, the country has not had to look abroad to launch its remote sensing satellites. That transition has yet to happen with communication satellites. The current Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) has hitherto been trouble-prone, and the version equipped with an indigenous cryogenic stage replacing an imported Russian one made its first successful flight only in January this year. Even if the GSLV becomes a reliable launcher like the PSLV, it can only carry communication satellites weighing up to about 2.2 tonnes. ISRO has already launched considerably heavier communication satellites on the Ariane 5, including the GSAT-16 that weighs close to 3.2 tonnes. Launching these satellites abroad is expensive. The price tag for the GSAT-16 comes to about Rs.900 crore. Of this, the foreign launch costs come to around Rs.560 crore — not including insurance. Had the next-generation GSLV Mark III, which can take four-tonne communication satellites, been operational, that launch might have cost only about half as much. But the cryogenic engine for the upper stage of the Mark III is still being developed. The rocket’s first experimental launch, scheduled for later this month, will therefore be a suborbital one to test its flight characteristics through the atmosphere. ISRO expects to have the Mark III’s cryogenic engine and stage ready in two years’ time. The sooner that happens, the better.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/new-satellite-takes-wing/article6673583.ece
10,12,2014,One book for India,"Union Ministers and senior leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party seem to thrive directly or tangentially on controversies related to religion. In proposing that the Bhagavad Gita be declared a ‘national scripture’, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj was not setting off a debate on what, if anything at all, should be India’s national scripture. She was, instead, trying to prepare the stage for a communally polarised political debate on a Hindu religious scripture. As a secular democracy, India cannot possibly adopt as its national scripture a book revered by any one religion. None will dispute with Ms. Swaraj when she says the Bhagavad Gita helped her to handle challenges as India’s External Affairs Minister. What is up for debate is not the content of the Bhagavad Gita, not the aesthetics of its slokas or the relevance of its precepts. What Ms. Swaraj calls into question is the secular nature of India, whether a holy book of one religious community can be imposed as the national book of Indians of all faiths. To argue, as BJP vice-president Dinesh Sharma did, that the Gita is not a religious book, but is meant for the whole of humanity, is rather disingenuous. Irrespective of the extent of its secular appeal, the Gita, a part of the Mahabharata, is a Hindu text associated with Lord Krishna, and cannot qualify as a national book.
That gods and goddesses should not be invoked as part of the national ethos was made clear even at the stage of the framing of India’s Constitution. Indeed, when a suggestion was made to begin the Preamble of the Constitution “in the name of God”, there was strong opposition from many members of the Constituent Assembly, including several who considered themselves believers. As one member who argued against invoking God in the Preamble put it, “such a course of action is inconsistent with the Preamble which promises liberty to thought, expression, belief, faith and worship to everyone.” Freedom of conscience that is guaranteed under the Constitution includes the right to practise any or no religion, and seeking to elevate a sacred scripture of any one religion as India’s national scripture is tantamount to undermining the secular basis of the Constitution. While it might be too early to demand that the Narendra Modi government deliver on its promises of development and growth, there is little doubt that some of the energies of the new government are getting drawn to old, divisive issues. That not just junior ministers but even a senior leader should make such a communally divisive suggestion is disturbing. If indeed there is a felt need to hold up one book as a national book, then it should be the country’s Constitution, and nothing else.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/one-book-for-india/article6676859.ece
10,12,2014,No room for complacency,"Though India is one of the six countries where the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) is considered endemic in poultry and several places in Kerala are favourite destinations for migratory birds, the State remained outbreak-free until recently. But on November 20, Kerala was robbed of that status when two outbreaks in ducks occurred in Alappuzha and Kottayam districts, with the virus killing over 20,000 birds. Incidentally, this is just the second instance of H5N1 outbreak in South India; the first outbreak occurred in October 2012 in the Central Poultry Development Organisation near Bengaluru. Most of the outbreaks since 2006 have been in West Bengal and the northeastern States, primarily due to cross-border transport of infected birds from Bangladesh, a hot-spot for H5N1 outbreaks. The H5N1 virus has infected seven people and killed one in Bangladesh between 2003 and 2013. For now, culling of nearly 260,000 birds in the villages where the outbreaks occurred, together with intensive surveillance in a 10-km radius around the epicentre of the outbreak have prevented the spread of the virus. But there is an overwhelming need to continue the intensive surveillance as ducks have been infected. Domestic ducks, which have long been recognised as one of the primary reservoirs of the virus, are responsible for the spread and outbreaks of H5N1.
According to two studies published in the journal Veterinary Research in June 2013 and November this year, unlike in the case of chicken, disease presentation in ducks depends on the H5N1 subtype and the bird species; the way the immune system responds to the virus infection in the two birds is vastly different. As a result, while most subtypes of H5N1 cause severe disease in chicken and kill nearly all of them, even clinical manifestation of infection is absent when certain species of ducks are infected with particular virus subtypes. Unlike chicken, which die, ducks not only turn out to be perfect hosts for the virus to survive but also provide an ideal environment for diversity to emerge through genetic reassortment of the virus. As of now, H5N1 infection in humans is “sporadic” and human-to-human transmission has not been reported. But a lethal reassortment of the virus can change all that. Hence, the death of thousands of diseased ducks and the prompt culling are reassuring steps. Now that the spread of the infection has been stopped, at least temporarily, concerted efforts should be directed at finding out the virus subtype and the duck species. The need to investigate if other duck species have been infected and for continued surveillance cannot be overstated, especially since duck-rearing is widespread in Alappuzha district.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/No-room-for-complacency/article10937392.ece
11,12,2014,When travel is unsafe,"December and Delhi have made news for the wrong reasons once again. It is for another instance of rape that underscores the lack of safety for women on the streets of the capital, especially those availing of some sort of transportation service. The failure of policing and regulatory regimes that are at the core of the latest incident — in which a 26-year-old woman was raped by a taxi driver with a long but suppressed history of sexual offences — once again demonstrates that the national outcry that followed the Delhi gangrape of December 2012 has been in vain. The government introduced amendments to criminal law to strengthen the mechanism to prosecute sexual offenders, and there have been subsequent instances of stringent punishment being awarded by trial courts in rape cases. However, authorities and systems continue to ignore the need for specific measures to improve women’s safety in public spaces. As in the case of the December 2012 incident, the latest instance reveals an appalling lack of visible policing in large parts of Delhi, a city of vast distances and many lonely stretches. There may be much less scope for opportunistic crimes against women if there is the fear that a police post, vehicle or check point is not far away, but this does not seem to be the case in the national capital where human predators seem to enjoy virtual impunity. It is common for an incident of crime to stretch for over half an hour without any intervention.
On the regulatory side, the lesson from the earlier crime — that a crackdown is needed on transport vehicles that ply without due licences and clearances in the capital — has obviously not been learnt. It has now occurred to the administration that web-based taxi-hailing services do not have regulations that govern them or licences to operate. Uber, which operates as an app that links a customer with one of thousands of cabs plying in the city, has been suddenly banned after it emerged that the offender in the present case is attached to it. The company clearly failed to exercise due diligence regarding the driver’s background as it seemed to have accepted an address and a certificate produced by him without further verification. At the same time, the incident raises questions about the need for a new set of regulations to cover web-based services that eschew physical assets in their business model. Fixing liability on such a service provider without allowing the entity to wriggle out of it by describing itself as an ‘aggregator’ rather than a provider is the current challenge. Taxi services offered under a brand imply a certain assurance of safety and reliability, and regulators need to devise systems to ensure that. Making available safer public transport to women at all times should be an urgent task for transport authorities.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/when-travel-is-unsafe/article6680011.ece
11,12,2014,Moving ahead on railway stations,"In its first Railway budget, the BJP-led NDA government had focussed on passenger amenities and inviting private participation in the modernisation of infrastructure. While putting Meghalaya on the Railway map recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spelt out a scheme to privatise and modernise railway stations. He said 10 to 12 stations will be taken up under the programme to significantly upgrade passenger amenities and make them akin to airport terminal buildings. The thought is not new, nor is the attempt to upgrade major stations. Similarly, the plan to leverage the extensive extent of railway land available has been talked about for years, without much progress being made. Commercial utilisation of railway land could be very profitable, but needs to be done with caution to prevent exploitation or corruption. Now that the government has decided to allow 100 per cent FDI in Railway projects, the Ministry, now under a new Minister, the reform-minded Suresh Prabhu, should work on the details to roll out the programme. The first step will have to be the identification of stations across the country, deciding on what exactly the private sector or partner can do, and the sensitive issue of levying user charges. In any scheme of privatising public space, the question of user charges comes in, and it needs to be addressed in conjunction with the extent of investment and the kind of facilities provided in these stations.
When Mr. Modi spoke of trains running underground and commercial buildings coming on top of that space, the reference must be to the metro rail and stations in major metropolitan centres. What is more pressing is raising standards and facilities at existing railway stations in key cities such as New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Thiruvananthapuram, Ahmedabad, Allahabad and Patna, to name a few centres. These are the stations that are old and call for urgent modernisation. In a limited way, the zonal railways have been enhancing amenities such as display boards, seating arrangements and catering facilities, providing in some stations even Wi-Fi. There is so much scope for a significant leap forward in the matter of amenities: these should include retiring rooms, waiting rooms, toilets, electric cars and wheel chairs for the aged and physically challenged, and, above all, maintaining cleanliness. Even where the Indian Railways has tried to provide some of these facilities, there is just no upkeep or maintenance. The area of cleanliness and maintenance is one to which the Railways need to pay immediate attention. The earlier the Railways start finalising this scheme and implementing it, the better. It should not be allowed to go the way of earlier plans.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/moving-ahead-on-railway-stations/article6680010.ece
12,12,2014,Moving forward on insurance,"The Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, which aims to increase the flow of foreign investment into the capital-starved insurance industry, is now just a step away from getting into the statute books. The Bill was first introduced in Parliament way back in 2008 but failed to receive support from parties across the political spectrum, including from the BJP, which now heads the government. The Rajya Sabha select committee, which went into the provisions in detail and whose report was tabled in Parliament on Wednesday, has recommended a 49 per cent composite cap on foreign investment while retaining the condition that management and control of the company has to remain in Indian hands. With the Cabinet quickly adopting the amendments suggested by the select committee, the stage is now set for the Bill to be introduced in the Rajya Sabha where despite the Congress’s support the Bill is not likely to have easy passage. The Congress has hinted that it would like to delay the Bill at least until the Budget session in order to make the government ‘sweat’, as one party member has said. In effect, the party wants to do to the BJP what the latter did to the Congress on the same issue when it was leading the government.
Political games aside, the adoption of the Bill is expected to open the tap for the flow of foreign investments into the insurance industry as foreign players have been waiting for the increased limit. Backed by a higher level of ownership, foreign companies would also be willing to share technical expertise with their Indian partners. The 49 per cent cap will include both foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment. Though this might disappoint those who would have liked the entire limit to be appropriated for FDI, the fact is that there are not too many companies that are profitable and mature to list on the stock markets. The scope for FII investment is therefore limited. As the committee has rightly observed, incremental foreign investment should ideally be used to increase the capital base rather than to buy out local promoters who might want to liquidate a part of their stake. Segments such as health insurance require sharp focus, and the market is also big given that the social security system is weak in the country. The committee has done well in not agreeing to lower the limit of paid-up capital from Rs.100 crore for health insurance players; a lower threshold would have made it easy for non-serious players to enter the sector. Expansion of the insurance industry is also important for the development of the infrastructure sector as the industry is typically a provider of funds for long-term investment. This augurs well for the BJP government’s focus on developing infrastructure.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/moving-forward-on-insurance/article6683398.ece
12,12,2014,Mr. Mani’s untenable position,"With a case of corruption now registered against him, Kerala’s Finance Minister K.M. Mani should resign from the Cabinet instead of continuing to protest his innocence in the face of escalating allegations. Mr. Mani, the leader of the Kerala Congress (M), a key constituent of the ruling Congress-led United Democratic Front, is entitled to his hope and faith that he would be proven innocent in the probe being conducted by a special cell of the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau. But political propriety demands that he step down, and not give room for suspicion that he could misuse his office to scuttle the investigation. The case, registered after a preliminary inquiry into the allegation and recording of the statements of several people including Mr. Mani, is that the Finance Minister had accepted Rs.1 crore as bribe from the Kerala Bar Hotel Owners’ Association for help in the reopening of bars in the State. For Mr. Mani to take cover under the argument that in the past similar cases had been registered against several Ministers in the State is unacceptable. If people’s confidence in the government is not to be shaken, Mr. Mani will have to step aside till his name is cleared in the investigation.
The UDF government headed by Oommen Chandy is functioning with a razor-thin majority, and there is some concern that these allegations might possibly have something to do with attempts at toppling the government. The KC (M) has in the past switched allegiance from one front to another, and the party remains in a position to bring down the government. Some of the KC (M) functionaries see the political insecurity of a section of the Congress leadership as being behind the troubles of Mr. Mani. But, whether or not Mr. Mani was framed by his political rivals will be known only at the end of a comprehensive investigation into the charges of bribery. There is little to be gained by floating conspiracy theories of devious political machinations, and playing the injured victim. Chief Minister Chandy is in no position to dictate terms to Mr. Mani or the KC (M). But the longer he takes to act decisively on this issue, the sooner he will surrender the political advantage to the opposition Left Democratic Front, which is spearheading an agitation on this very issue. Mr. Chandy might be buying time, but doing nothing in the face of such serious allegations against one of his senior colleagues is certainly not an option. One of the reasons the Congress lost power at the Centre was its unwillingness to drop Ministers of allied parties facing corruption. If Mr. Mani will not go on his own, Mr. Chandy will have to show him the door.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mr-manis-untenable-position/article6683399.ece
13,12,2014,Testing times for India-Russia ties,"With 20 agreements worth billions of dollars signed in one day, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to India was a productive one. The deals touched most of the fields India and Russia cooperate on, from oil, energy and infrastructure to military training, even as the two countries set a bilateral trade target of $30 billion between them by the year 2025. What is more, the opening of India’s rough-diamond procurement policy by Prime Minister Narendra Modi will mean Mumbai can dream of becoming a worldwide hub for the industry. Finally, President Putin’s offer of 12 nuclear reactors is the clearest and most welcome indicator yet that Russia does not share the concerns of other suppliers about India’s liability laws. However, there is no denying that the old lustre of the India-Russia friendship has dimmed somewhat, and many of the affirmations in the “Druzba-Dosti” joint statement of friendship they issued seem problematic. Even before his arrival in Delhi, President Putin’s decision to decline the offer to address a joint session of Parliament indicated that all is not well in the relationship. The problems seem evident: Russia has watched with displeasure as India has diversified its military imports, especially when it comes to helicopter and aircraft purchases.
The slide is not recent, and last year a senior Russian official had made the country’s displeasure clear when he demanded India treat Russia as an “old partner”, calling the decision to buy fighter aircraft and missiles from France, the U.S. and Israel “illogical and unfair”. For its part, India was outraged by the Russian decision to lift its embargo on defence sales to Pakistan, and the first-ever Russia-Pakistan framework agreement that was finalised last month. Given that India still maintains about 70 per cent of its defence inventory from Russian hardware, and is one of Russia’s biggest buyers, the unhappiness on both sides may not change the equations of dependence between them, but it must be addressed. In this context, it is significant that Mr. Modi said the relationship with Russia would remain India’s “closest relationship” and it would be the “most important defence partner”. It is increasingly important for New Delhi and Moscow to reassure each other in spheres other than the commercial ones of defence, energy and trade. Given Russia’s growing isolation from the West, and India’s growing closeness to the U.S. — President Barack Obama’s visit is coming up in January 2015 — their relationship is bound to be challenged in many ways. The U.S. State Department’s statement criticising the India-Russia deals gives a glimpse of those challenges already, and the assurance in Mr. Modi’s tweet will likely be tested further in the coming months: “Times have changed, our friendship has not...”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/testing-times-for-indiarussia-ties/article6686788.ece
13,12,2014,"Fight poverty, not conversion","Is the practice of religion a deeply private affair, confined to values and belief systems at the level of the individual, or is it an open community activity, carried out in the public domain with social participation? Does one person’s right to practise his or her religion come in conflict with another person’s right to propagate his or her religion? These are only some of the questions that have come up following attempts at mass religious conversions by politically affiliated outfits. The right to choose a religion of one’s choice is fundamental to the freedom of religion, but as the Supreme Court has held, the right to propagate a religion does not include any ‘right’ to convert other people. The December 8 ‘conversion’ of scores of Muslim families to Hinduism created a political furore for more than one reason. Mass conversions from one religion to another are usually political in nature, and they almost always create tensions between the two communities. Such conversions by themselves are not problematic unless there is evidence of force or fraud. But opposition parties saw in the exercise another attempt at communal polarisation by Hindutva outfits with ideological affinity to the Sangh Parivar and the BJP. Moreover, many of the political opponents of the BJP were alarmed at the efforts to lure poor Muslim slum-dwellers with state-conferred benefits such as ration cards. While material inducements for religious conversion, even if morally abhorrent, are not rare or illegal, the opposition saw the government as being complicit in the effort by the organisations involved in the mass conversion to link state benefits to a ‘return’ to Hinduism.
Predictably, BJP leaders have turned the debate over this latest round of conversions into an opportunity to revive the demand for banning all forms of religious conversion. However, the issues arising from the Agra conversions have nothing to do with religious conversion per se, which are unexceptionable, but with communal politics and discrimination on the grounds of religion in extending state benefits. Many of those who were ‘converted’ have returned to Islam saying they agreed to convert on the promise of material benefits, but this is no argument against the original conversion. Actually, at the heart of this conversion narrative in the Agra slum are issues of poverty and deprivation, and not religious succour. Conversion from one religion to another, whether of individuals or clusters of families, whether they result in social tensions or not, is of no real concern so long as there is no force or fraud involved. Those who want a ban on conversions on the basis of material inducements should instead concentrate on fighting poverty and deprivation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fight-poverty-not-conversion/article6686789.ece
15,12,2014,Political response to a legal battle,"A political offensive is no substitute for a legal defence. With senior members of her party under pressure from the Central Bureau of Investigation on charges of involvement in the Saradha Ponzi scheme scam, Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is trying to portray the entire issue as a conspiracy by the Bharatiya Janata Party and the government it heads at the Centre. Following the arrest of State Transport Minister Madan Mitra, Ms. Banerjee must have known it would not be enough to merely play the innocent victim; but she seems to have gone too far in trying to discredit the whole investigation and attribute motives to the CBI. Unlike what Ms. Banerjee would like others to believe, Mr. Mitra was not arrested for sharing a dais with Saradha Group chairman Sudipto Sen. The charges against him are serious, and involve misappropriation of funds collected from subscribers to the scheme. These are not based merely on some photographs that show Mr. Mitra and Mr. Sen together. To argue, as Ms. Banerjee did, that Prime Minister Narendra Modi too should be arrested on the basis of photographs showing him alongside Sahara India chairman Subrato Roy, who is now in jail for failing to refund depositors, is to make nothing more than a petty political point. If Trinamool leaders are to get out of the legal troubles they are in because of the Saradha scam, they will need to do much more than engage in political counter-attacks. Even as political tactics, making noise in Parliament, and organising protests in Bengal will not take the Trinamool very far if its leaders do not face the allegations head-on and are not cleared after due investigation.
That the Chief Minister chose to back her arrested colleague almost reflexively, is certainly problematic. Mr. Mitra might indeed be a valued Minister and party colleague, but the proper course for her would have been to wait till the courts cleared him of all charges before pronouncing him innocent and rushing to his side in support. True, Ms. Banerjee is entitled to give Mr. Mitra the benefit of the doubt till he is proven guilty, but debunking the entire investigation without sufficient cause is no way to show solidarity with a colleague in trouble. The BJP, which is witnessing rapid growth in West Bengal, is sure to make political capital out of the Saradha scam, but Ms. Banerjee should not mix her political battles with the legal woes. Mr. Mitra will have to mount a legal defence, and not rely on the Trinamool winning its political battle with the BJP. Ms. Banerjee is free to say that the arrest is illegal and unconstitutional, but this is more in the nature of pointless political rhetoric than a serious legal challenge.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-political-response-to-a-legal-battle/article6691223.ece
15,12,2014,A step toward humanisation,"Finally, a ritualistic burial is to be given to Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, the ‘living-dead’ law that has haunted India’s criminal justice system for decades. Taking a step towards a more humane law, the Union government has decided to repeal Section 309 with overwhelming favour from a majority of the States. Under Section 309, an attempt to commit suicide is punishable with simple imprisonment up to one year and/or a fine. Anachronistic in its approach, this law dealt with those in agony by holding up medical help through procedural delays and then penalising them rather than rehabilitating them through counselling and care. Over the years, this law has seen a tumultuous journey of contestations, to and fro, between retention and suspension. In an early attempt to repeal it, the Rajya Sabha had passed the IPC (Amendment) Bill, 1978, but the Bill lapsed as the Lok Sabha was dissolved in 1979. Later, the Supreme Court, in P. Rathinam (1994), stated that the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution included the “right not to live a forced life”, thus holding the provision unconstitutional. But subsequently, in Gian Kaur (1996), a five-judge bench overruled P. Rathinam, upholding the validity of Section 309. Gian Kaur stated that sanctity of life was a significant aspect of Article 21, and “by no stretch of imagination can extinction of life be read to be included in protection of life”. Similarly, the Law Commission of India in its 42nd Report (1971) recommended the repeal of Section 309, while in the 156th Report (1997) recommended retention, based on Gian Kaur.
The Commission’s 210th Report (2008) again recommended a repeal of the law, which was favourably reiterated in Parliament and decided upon recently. Globally, a significant historical factor aiding the penal law against suicide was perhaps the condemnation of suicide by institutional Christianity. St. Augustine called suicide “an unrepentable sin”, while for St. Aquinas, suicide was “unnatural”. This ethic found its way into English common law in the mid-13th century, and suicide remained an offence in England until 1961. No wonder that the 42nd Report of the Law Commission relied, inter alia, on Manusmriti, that holds suicide circumstantially permissible, to recommend the repeal. In resisting the repeal, Bihar urged caution, saying suicide-bombers would no longer be covered and deterred by law. This is however a minor concern because there are several anti-terror laws to deal with such situations. Madhya Pradesh believed that the repeal would dilute Section 306 dealing with abetment to suicide. But this claim overlooks the Gian Kaur decision that stated that “Section 306 enacted a distinct offence which is capable of existence independent of Section 309”.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-a-step-toward-humanisation/article6691224.ece
16,12,2014,A weak agreement saves the day,"The ‘Twentieth Conference of the Parties’ of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ended in Lima on December 14, as the negotiations >extended by two days beyond schedule. The Paris 2015 deadline for finalising an international agreement on climate change fuelled a sense of urgency at these talks. There was some optimism ahead of the conference, with the U.S.-China deal in November being considered a breakthrough and the European Union coming on board making serious commitments to cut emissions. But this hope soon fizzled out as rifts between ‘developed’ and ‘developing’ countries became deeper. In a familiar dialectical movement, the shift from hope to impasse eventually led to a last-minute deal, thus saving the talks from failure. The document that was finally agreed upon, calls for a commitment from all parties to an “ambitious agreement in 2015 that reflects the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities” (CDR). It “urges” developed countries to provide financial support to developing countries to meet their “ambitious mitigation” goals. The agreement urges parties to take national pledges by finalising their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) by November 2015. However, the agreement is criticised for being a “watered down” and “lacklustre plan”, leaving all political issues unresolved. But Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters, “We’ve got what we wanted.”
The ‘developing versus developed country’ schism was at the centre of the debates. In trying to dilute this binary, wealthy nations like the U.S., and those of the EU argued that emissions from developing countries are consistently rising and they need to commit to more serious emission cuts. But India accused them of watering down the CDR principle envisaged in earlier agreements. The EU strongly favoured a review process to ensure accountability for the pledges made but China immediately blocked it, on grounds of national sovereignty. India stuck to its conventional position that the developed countries should shoulder a bigger burden as they are responsible for the problem in the first place, while poverty alleviation would continue to be India’s primary concern. India may have demonstrated concern about climate change issues and rightly asserted the need to balance environment with socio-economic concerns. Yet, before it is too late, the nation has to acknowledge that its emissions are rising dangerously. Instead of always passing the burden onto others, it has to take responsibility for its actions. India has to make a pragmatically determined national pledge in Paris next year, backed by stronger domestic policies and a shift to clean, renewable energy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-weak-agreement-saves-the-day/article6694858.ece
16,12,2014,Damning indictment of CIA,"The report by a Senate committee of the U.S. Congress that said the Central Intelligence Agency used inhuman and cruel methods on terror suspects is damning enough, but it would not have served its purpose if those who carried out the torture and authorised it get away scot-free. Many of the methods mentioned have been in the public realm. It is well known that under a programme of ‘rendition’, the CIA was spiriting away suspects to countries where U.S. laws on interrogation would not apply, such as Syria, Thailand or Poland, and subjecting them to techniques such as waterboarding. Yet, the report is shocking in its detail of these and other “enhanced interrogation techniques”, including one described as “rectal feeding”. CIA employees who questioned the techniques were overruled. Torture led to the death of at least one suspect and caused permanent physical damage to others. At least 26 of those subjected to the methods had been wrongly detained. Put together by Democrat members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, the report was released after five years of work. It concludes that the EITs resulted in no vital intelligence, and refutes suggestions that they led the CIA to Osama bin Laden. The White House and the CIA made several efforts to stop the report from coming out. Committee chairman Dianne Feinstein has said she was swayed at times by the argument that it might give an upper hand to forces that were out to destroy America, but that she realised her country would stand taller for accepting that it had done wrong. Ms. Feinstein pushed it out just before the Democrats hand over control of the Senate to the Republicans.
Predictably though, the report has seen a partisan divide, with Republican members rejecting it. It has also spurred many to come to the CIA’s defence, including a former head of the agency, and former Vice-President Dick Cheney, who authorised many of the brutal techniques. He said last week that he “would do it again in a minute”. President George Bush, in whose administration these practices came to acquire currency, also defended them. The U.S. has always been accused of double standards when it comes to human rights, of preaching from the rule book to other countries, while proceeding to ignore those rules itself. That accusation is bound to grow louder. President Barack Obama, who had prohibited torture by an executive order in 2009, has acknowledged the CIA’s methods had done “significant damage to America’s standing in the world and made it harder to pursue our interests with allies and partners”. It is going to stay that way as he is unlikely to be able to punish the perpetrators.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/damning-indictment-of-cia/article6694857.ece
17,12,2014,India’s ban on Islamic State,"Quickly after the >arrest of a youth from Maharashtra upon his return from Iraq where he underwent some training as a fighter for Islamic State, and the >dramatic arrest thereafter of an engineer in Bengaluru for posting on the microblogging site Twitter material that praised IS and its actions, Home Minister Rajnath Singh has told Parliament that “as a first step”, India has >banned the group. A resolution by the United Nations Security Council in August had called on UN member-states to take “national measures to prevent fighters from travelling from their soil to join the groups reiterating obligations under previous counter-terrorism resolutions to prevent the movement of terrorists, as well as their supply with arms or financial support”. The Intelligence Bureau had also recommended a ban on IS a few weeks ago, but New Delhi had held itself back until now as sections within the government argued that doing so might drive sympathies for the group in India underground, if any have taken hold, and that this would be a far more dangerous situation. Moreover, the group had no known operations in the country. Also, with IS holding 40 Indian hostages, the government did not want to take any step that might endanger their lives. These are valid concerns. But the government has also had to think on its feet while dealing with IS-related situations that have been thrown its way. Investigators have been hard put to determine the specific laws IS returnee Arif Majeed and tweeter Mehdi Biswas are alleged to have broken, and have finally booked them under a law that prohibits waging war against an “Asiatic ally” of India, and another that prohibits support to a terror group.
Clearly, the Centre also appears rattled after the >siege at a café in Sydney, where the hostage-taker, believed to be acting on his own, sought to associate himself with IS, the Iraq-based Sunni group — even though he was an Iranian-origin Shi’ite whose motivations may not have been political. Two hostages and the gunman died in the incident that paralysed Australia with fear and uncertainty for a whole day. The incident showed that even lone wolves can cause serious damage, and that there is no room for complacency. Mehdi too was possibly acting on his own but projected his influence across the globe through the Internet to the extent that many believed he was an IS spokesman. While the concerns around banning IS in India will remain, how such a ban will address the challenge posed by the Internet needs to be watched for implications for free speech on this medium. What is certain, though, is that the existing law under the >Information Technology Act is woefully behind the times, both in terms of addressing security concerns and protecting the rights of users.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-indias-ban-on-islamic-state/article6698321.ece
17,12,2014,Opportune time for reform,"The BJP-led government is proceeding apace to rein in petroleum subsidies, which have been a major fiscal headache for successive governments. First, it turned to the task of wiping out under-recoveries on diesel and >freeing its pricing. Secondly, the direct benefit transfer scheme for cooking gas is >being rolled out across cities. Another recent step is the decision to >do away with the supply of subsidised kerosene through the public distribution system (PDS). Just as in the case of cooking gas, the idea behind stopping subsidised kerosene supply through the PDS is to ensure that subsidies are targeted at those who deserve them and that leakages are plugged. It is estimated that as much as 40 per cent of the subsidised kerosene supplied through the PDS is diverted, mainly to adulterate diesel. The government’s decision to stop PDS supply appears well-founded. According to 2011 Census data, kerosene is no longer a fuel of choice for cooking but is used mainly for lighting. Cooking gas has replaced kerosene in urban and semi-urban areas as per the Census; biomass is the cooking fuel of choice in rural areas, with less than 2 per cent of rural households using kerosene as a medium. Armed with these findings, the government now wants to move to a cash transfer system for rural households that deserve subsidy.
The move will help the government cut down kerosene subsidy to about a fifth of what prevails now. According to data from the Petroleum Ministry, kerosene subsidy, shared between the government and the oil companies, was Rs.31,250.47 crore in 2013-14. This will come down to Rs.5,852.14 crore in the next year following the latest move. The decision, while helping to cut the Central budget deficit, shifts the onus to the States, which will now have to identify households that use the fuel for lighting. The choice will be between direct transfer of cash subsidy to these households on a regular basis, or upfront subsidy for them to install solar lighting systems. With the kerosene subsidy issue thus addressed, the government should now turn its attention to cooking gas subsidy. The fuel is also used by the middle-class and the rich who do not deserve the subsidy. With oil prices sliding, the time is opportune for the government to align cooking gas prices to the market without much pain being felt by consumers. Those found deserving of subsidy can be taken care of by the direct cash transfer mechanism. The time is also ripe for the government to attempt some serious reform of the pricing policies of the oil companies, which are rather opaque at this moment. The policy of linking pricing of fuels such as petrol, diesel and cooking gas with their respective landed costs needs review.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-opportune-time-for-reform/article6698319.ece
18,12,2014,"Soft targets, hard questions","The world saw terrorism’s darkest face on Tuesday. The cold-blooded >killing of 132 students and nine staff members in a school in Peshawar has left the entire world shaken at the terrorists’ determination to find ever softer targets and notch up higher levels of brutality. There could not have been a more vulnerable place than a school, or more defenceless targets than children. Yet, even in a place used to terrorist acts, even after the >Taliban targeted a 15-year-old girl called Malala Yusufzai two years ago, if parents continued to send their children to school, it was because they thought terrorism had already plumbed such depths that nothing worse could happen. They were proved tragically wrong. Going by the accounts of those who were inside and fortunate to live to tell the tale, the six men who entered the school were merciless, going from classroom to classroom hunting for those still alive. The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan have claimed responsibility for the act, describing it as revenge for the Pakistan Army operation against them in North Waziristan and other parts of the north-western frontier region. The bombing campaigns by the Pakistan military in those regions had claimed civilian lives, and the Taliban have said they carried out the school bloodbath because they want the Army to feel the same pain. The Pakistani Taliban are evidently hoping to bring public pressure on the Army to call off operation Zarb-e-Azb entirely.
Pakistan’s response to this outrage will be crucial to its own future, and to the peace and stability of the region. After an all-party meeting, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said that the military operation would go on until the last terrorist was eliminated. Army chief General Raheel Sharif has also stood firm. But it will take more than a drive against a select group of militants to root out terrorism. Decades of active encouragement by the Pakistani state and its security establishment to terrorism aimed at Afghanistan and India have engendered a high level of tolerance within sections of the Pakistani military, polity and society for such non-state actors. Only those with blinkers would believe that there are “good” and “bad” Taliban, that it is all right for the Lashkar-e-Taiba to run free and recruit for jihadi missions in India but it is unacceptable for Taliban to strike inside Pakistan. Lifting a moratorium on hangings, as Prime Minister Sharif has announced, is not going to stop terrorists. Unless the change comes in what Pakistan describes as its “national ideology”, in effect a fusion of religion with national security, militancy will continue to haunt the country. The widespread revulsion over the school massacre provides an opportunity to craft a new ideology that does not confuse terrorists with instruments of national security.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-soft-targets-hard-questions/article6701691.ece
18,12,2014,The cost of convenience,"Despite several committees constituted by the Union government highlighting the many problems posed by thin, non-biodegradable, single-use plastic bags, and a body of evidence also indicating their ill-effects, the government emphatically stated recently that there would be “no ban on manufacture and use of plastic bags” in the country. But such a ban is already in place in a few States. Unfortunately, the other viable alternative of levying charges or raising taxes to curb its use was overlooked. The stand taken by the government is in stark contrast to the European Union’s decision. In a commendable move, EU member-states decided last month to cut the number of lightweight plastic bags consumed per person in a year. The member-countries would either limit the number of bags used to 90 per person a year by 2019 and 40 bags by 2025, or charge for all bags by 2018. Even in a country where plastic manufacturers constitute a powerful lot, in September this year California decided to ban single-use plastic bags from July 2015; though many cities have a similar ban, California is the first State in the U.S. to do so. Several countries that have either banned it or made it chargeable have seen a precipitous drop within a short time in the number of thin bags used. For instance, in 2002, Ireland witnessed a 95 per cent reduction in plastic bag litter once tax on such material was levied. It is proven beyond doubt that mandatory charge on single-use bags is a potent tool to reduce consumption. There is no reason why India cannot look at this option. After all, reducing litter should be the first goal under the Swachh Bharat Mission.
For a few minutes of convenience, people mindlessly turn to single-use plastic bags, apparently oblivious to its persistence in the environment, both on land and in the oceans, for hundreds of years. Besides ending up in landfills or as litter in all possible places, they very often clog drainage systems and even prevent the recharge of groundwater aquifers. The bigger ramification is the death of cattle and a huge number of marine animals every year due to plastic bag ingestion. The production process is energy-intensive. It is for these reasons that in 2012 the >Supreme Court observed that in the absence of tough measures, the “next generation will be threatened with something more serious than the atom bomb”. It is strange and surprising that in a country where reuse and recycling are part of the ethos, the rampant use of disposable plastic bags has become second nature. At a time when solid waste management even for biodegradable waste is non-existent, it is naive to think of ever managing single-use bag waste.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-the-cost-of-convenience/article6701694.ece
19,12,2014,A significant achievement,"It has been a glorious year for the Indian Space Research Organisation. The successful >launch of Mangalyaan into Mars orbit on September 24 on its maiden attempt was the crowning glory. On December 18, the space organisation followed it up with another stupendous success with the first experimental >launch of a GSLV Mark III vehicle and the safe splashdown of an unmanned crew module in the Bay of Bengal off the Andaman and Nicobar Islands after re-entry into the atmosphere. These two achievements best exemplify the maturing of the Indian space programme and its capability to take the country’s space missions to greater heights. The experimental flight of Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III carrying a Crew module Atmospheric Reentry Experiment (CARE) as its payload is remarkable for a few reasons. Unlike Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) launches, GSLV launch history has been trouble-prone. Making it all the more challenging is the fact that the GSLV Mark III vehicle is heavier, taller and more advanced than others. The rocket has the capability to put into orbit communication satellites that are as heavy as 4 tonnes — twice as heavy as the ones that are currently carried by GSLV rockets. Once the new vehicle becomes fully operational, India may well stop relying on other countries to launch satellites weighing up to 4 tonnes. The space organisation is confident of launching in two years a developmental flight of this vehicle with a fully operational cryogenic engine.
Thirty long years after Rakesh Sharma became the first Indian to travel into space aboard a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft, India has now come a step closer to realising its long-held dream of sending humans into space, with the successful test flight of GSLV Mark III and the safe splashdown of the unmanned crew module. The capsule performed as expected after re-entry into the atmosphere and, remarkably, decelerated to 7 metres a second before splashing into the Bay of Bengal. This is the first time India had ever tested the deployment of parachutes for deceleration. But more than understanding the re-entry characteristics of the crew module, the primary objective of the current mission was to test the new design of the rocket, particularly at the time of lift-off and passage through the atmosphere. The fact that there was little deviation from the flight path during its entire course till it reached an altitude of 126 km, was proof that the two large solid boosters fired simultaneously at take-off. Also, the vehicle withstood the atmospheric loading as it travelled through the atmosphere. Tall and heavy rockets encounter greater atmospheric loading than smaller vehicles.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-a-significant-achievement/article6704982.ece
19,12,2014,Rise in global inequality,"The findings from the latest International Labour Organisation report on real wages point to a mix of proactive initiatives and policy paralysis in different contexts. The study notes that continuing deceleration in the growth of global real wages and discriminatory pay gaps based on gender and nationality could sharpen household income inequalities. A most striking finding is that labour productivity growth outstripped increases in real wage between 1999 and 2013 in the advanced economies. The consequent flattening of wage rises in these countries in the last two years is therefore no surprise. Globally in 2013, wages adjusted for inflation grew on average 0.2 per cent less a month than in the year before, to 2 per cent. Dashing hopes of a return to the pre-crisis rates of 3 per cent in 2007 are significant regional variations in wage increases. The world average for the preceding two years drops by nearly a half if the progress achieved by China is discounted. The nearly 6 per cent growth in real wages for Asia and Eastern Europe, vis-à-vis the less than 1 per cent increase in Latin America and the Caribbean, point to sharp regional variations.
The distribution of wages also significantly influences differing levels of inequality. Wage gaps and job losses accounted for a 90 and 140 per cent increase in inequality in Spain and the United States respectively. These are countries among advanced economies with the maximum increase in inequality between the top and bottom 10 per cent of the population. Conversely, more equitable paid employment accounted for 87 and 72 per cent reduction in inequality between the high-end and low-end segments in Argentina and Brazil respectively. Admittedly, an increase in wages would impact on the cost of production, profitability and competitiveness of firms. But at the macro-level, wage stagnation also feeds into a decrease in domestic consumption, investment and exports. Clearly, the current ‘cut off your nose to spite your face’ approach to policy-making has to give way to more constructive means of mitigating inequalities to sustain economic growth. Based on its effectiveness in the developing and advanced countries, the ILO recommends that a minimum wage floor should be set in a manner that balances the needs of workers and their families with broader economic factors. Collective bargaining is the other key institution that has a proven record of narrowing wage inequalities, subject of course to the extent to which employees are covered under such bodies. Moreover, the cumulative cost of inequality to growth is by no means insignificant. This has been borne out by studies of educational attainments among the economically disadvantaged sections.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-rise-in-global-inequality/article6704983.ece
20,12,2014,Many faces of terrorism,"A day after the Taliban massacre of schoolchildren in Peshawar, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said his government would not rest until the last terrorist was eliminated from Pakistan. He further promised there would be no distinction made between “good” Taliban, the code for militants used by the Pakistani establishment for strategic purposes in the region, and “bad” Taliban, for those who attack the Pakistani state. The bail granted by an anti-terrorism court in Pakistan to Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi is an immediate setback to that promise. Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency in its charge sheet described Lakhvi as the mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai attacks and “a commander of the Lashkar-e-Taiba”. Indian investigators have said he was among those directing the Mumbai terrorists on the phone from Pakistan. Coming as it did when Pakistan was still reeling from the Peshawar outrage, and less than 24 hours after its political leadership expressed a new resolve and determination against terrorism, the bail to Lakhvi has understandably shocked India. The let-down has been greater because India, led by its government, had come together in an unprecedented demonstration of solidarity as Pakistan grieved for the children killed in Peshawar. The Indian Parliament, which just recently passed a resolution against the school attack, has now passed a resolution against the bail order. The thin silver lining is that the Sharif government plans to appeal the bail, and that instead of walking free, Lakhvi has been detained for three months under the Maintenance of Public Order law.
More than five years have passed since the court proceedings in the Mumbai case began in Pakistan. The trial has suffered, from lacklustre prosecution with the lawyers citing security fears, frequent disruptions due to transfer of judges, and political rhetoric about “insufficient” evidence supplied by Delhi, as well as the demand for “proof”. All this while, Hafiz Saeed has become increasingly visible, and is allowed to hold public rallies and mobilise people and funds for his organisation, which makes no secret of its desire to see “rivers of blood” in India. Altogether, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that Mr. Sharif’s words may count for nothing when it comes up against entrenched and powerful actors, including the security establishment, the administrative and legal bureaucracy, and the judiciary. But prevail he must, as must other Pakistani voices demanding an all-out change in the policies Pakistan has followed. India must put aside its shock and anger at the grant of bail to Lakhvi and stand by these voices solidly, for it is they that give hope of peace between the two countries and stability in the region.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-many-faces-of-terrorism/article6708752.ece
20,12,2014,When leaders lead,"Both U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raúl Castro must be commended for doing things their predecessors failed to do in establishing diplomatic relations between their countries. With their decision, negotiated secretly over the past two years with the help of the Vatican and the Canadian government, restrictions on travel, banking and business will be eased, as prisoners held in both countries are repatriated. President Obama has also promised to push for an end to the trade embargo with Cuba through Congress, whose permission he needs to re-establish full relations with the estranged Caribbean neighbour. Relations between the U.S. and Cuba were snapped after Mr. Castro’s revolutionary brother Fidel Castro seized power in 1959 and established a communist state, nationalising all assets. The U.S.’s attempt to depose Fidel Castro, famously called the “Bay of Pigs invasion”, failed in 1961. Since then, the two countries have wasted no opportunity to hurt each other’s interests, unevenly matched as they were. The U.S. was unable to get other countries to back its sanctions against Cuba, while Cuba has obviously suffered economically for its isolation, even as its economy took a severe downturn after the collapse of its ally, the Soviet Union, in 1991 and the withdrawal of subsidies by Russia subsequently.
Since 2008, after Fidel Castro handed over charge to Raúl Castro, the country embarked on a series of economic reforms, and amongst other important changes opened a channel of negotiations with President Obama. Mr. Obama still has some heavy lifting ahead of him: the Republicans, who count the Cuban refugee community in the U.S. amongst its supporters, have already announced they would oppose the move. With their decision, announced simultaneously in Washington and Havana, the two leaders have chosen to put the dominant narrative of rancour and hypernationalism aside in favour of what Mr. Obama said was in the best interests of both countries. India has done well to immediately extend its greetings to both countries on the decision. New Delhi may do even better to heed Mr. Obama’s reasoning for this “most significant change in U.S. policy”, which hits closer home, especially for Mr. Modi, India’s first Prime Minister born after Partition. Both the U.S. and its smaller neighbour Cuba, said the U.S. President, had been hardly “well served by a rigid policy that is rooted in events that took place before most of us were even born”. The Nobel Prize-winning American author Ernest Hemingway, who lived in Cuba for years, famously wrote: “Every man’s life ends the same way. It is only the details of how he lived and how he died that distinguish one man from another.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-when-leaders-lead/article6708753.ece
22,12,2014,Cautionary signals,"The Mid-Year Economic Review for 2014-15 is >realistic in its projection of 5.5 per cent growth during this fiscal. Economic data released last week on industrial output, trade deficit and inflation clearly show that the growth impulse is still weak and that the economy is yet to attain a steady state. The 4.2 per cent fall in industrial output recorded in October has raised doubts over the strength of the ongoing economic recovery. October, being a festival-season month, ought to have seen a rise in manufacturing to meet demand for goods, but output, especially of consumer goods, dipped. However, trade data for November showed a rebound in non-oil, non-gold imports — machinery imports were up by 20.32 per cent — indicating that the dip in industrial output in October may be an aberration and that November could throw up better numbers. Corroborating this assessment is the fact that the auto industry had a good month in November with car sales rising by 9.52 per cent. But in the same month, the trade deficit widened to an 18-month high due to a surge in gold imports driven by lower duties, a fall in international prices and festival season demand. Notably, the deficit widened despite a contraction in the crude oil import bill by $1.26 billion, or 9.73 per cent.
Though export growth recovered to 7.27 per cent in November after a fall during October, from hereon the going is likely to be tough for exporters given the uncertain global environment caused by falling oil prices. Petroleum products exports, which account for a fifth of India’s total exports, dipped by 14.15 per cent in November, reflecting the difficult market conditions abroad. Though it is not time to worry yet, the government and the Reserve Bank of India need to monitor the trade data closely and prepare to take corrective action on gold. What should worry policymakers is the fact that fresh investment, which is critical to the revival of growth, is just not happening. The Mid-Year Economic Review refers to how private investment is not picking up, and to make up for this it suggests that public investment should accelerate. This is easier said than done given the sorry state of government finances. The Review notes that there is likely to be a revenue shortfall of Rs.1.05 lakh crore during this fiscal due to overestimation in the Budget and slow revival. Indeed, meeting the fiscal deficit target of 4.1 per cent is going to be rather tricky in this backdrop. In the short term, therefore, it is difficult to see public investment as a saviour. It may at best be an option to consider in the medium term, and that is assuming there are no setbacks in the next year or two. The only way forward now is to encourage and support private investment — for which the government and the RBI need to work together.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/midyear-economic-review-201415-cautionary-signals/article6713252.ece
22,12,2014,Turbulent skies,"There cannot be a happier kind of resolution to the > tribulations of the low-cost airline SpiceJet, than for it to come up for sale and be taken over by one of its co-founders. It is still too early to say whether Ajay Singh and his group of investors will actually take control of the airline, even as the major stakeholder, the Sun group and Kalanithi Maran, are ready to sell their stake. For now, the airline has got a 15-day, Rs.600-crore lifeline from the Government of India and a deal may well be worked out. Over the past few months the airline has been facing a serious financial crisis, even giving rise to the question whether it will also go under like Kingfisher. It has not been able to pay salaries on time, pay the oil companies for fuel, or the airports for landing and other facilities. Several flights have been cancelled each day, while some passengers have complained that fares have not been refunded. And many cost-conscious flyers had booked tickets much in advance. Last week, the airline was virtually grounded, before the Centre extended a lifeline much to the chagrin of the banks and oil companies that had extended credit and were now being asked to throw good money after bad. The oil companies are insisting on a cash-and-carry arrangement. While nobody wants the airline to sink, it was a regular commercial loss that the airline had to deal with. The basic question that arises is this — should the government use its influence over banks and their resources to bail out a sick airline after the experience of Kingfisher, which remains grounded since 2012? That is why a sale of the airline may well be the best solution.
For all this, SpiceJet shares held market attention for a while when investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala bought 7.5 million shares in late-November. But on December 5, the stocks began a downward slide when the airline was barred from selling advance tickets beyond a month. It is estimated that SpiceJet needs nearly Rs.2,000 crore to recover and stabilise its operations. Its managers have taken the line that even the major promoter, the Sun group, cannot find enough resources to pump in right now. If Mr. Ajay Singh and the other investors can pump in fresh capital and assure the oil companies and airport administrators of stability in the medium term, it could be a win-win formula. In the present competitive environment, running a low-cost airline remains a major challenge. It is now the peak tourist season and fuel costs have dropped significantly; no airline can afford to miss the business opportunity. Because of the SpiceJet crisis, the other airlines have marked up their fares substantially over the past week to cash in on the holiday season demand, but reports of the airline being up for sale have moderated the rising trend.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/spicejet-management-change-turbulent-skies/article6713254.ece
29,12,2014,When the sea came home,"Ten years cannot wipe out memories of the wall of water that wrecked human life and property, with Banda Aceh on the Sumatran coast bearing the brunt of the earthquake and a series of tsunamis in the Indian Ocean region in 2004. The death of loved ones and the loss of livelihoods and homes still haunt survivors in 14 countries, and the world continues to grapple with the magnitude of the event that was only overtaken a few years ago by the tsunami-earthquake combination that hit Japan and caused a meltdown in some nuclear reactors at Fukushima. Residents of Banda Aceh rebuilt their lives, and in India too, which lost over 10,000 people to the calamity, rehabilitation has been an ongoing engagement. India set up a warning system in 2005 and upgraded it to a state-of-the-art Indian Tsunami Early Warning System two years later at the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services in Hyderabad. It has the capability to issue tsunami bulletins within 10 minutes of a major earthquake in the Indian Ocean.
Also see: >Tsunami: 10 years later
Advance warning is as important as disaster preparedness for calamities of such magnitude. Odisha learnt a lesson from the super cyclone in 1999, but earlier this year cyclone Hudhud devastated the coastal city of Visakhapatnam which, ironically, is one of the two cities in the country gearing up for a pilot climate-resilient plan. Both the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2007 and the Ministry of Environment had said there would be a high likelihood of the intensity of cyclonic events increasing on the eastern coast of India. A working paper on coastal cities prepared by The Energy and Resources Institute says it is highly pertinent to start climate-proofing infrastructure and services and to assess sea-level rise, combined with other factors such as storm surges, cyclones and changes in precipitation patterns. According to the IPCC, the coastal areas face multiple risks related to climate change and variability. India has 130 towns and cities in 84 coastal districts, and according to the Planning Commission the rise in sea level has been in the range of 1.06 to 1.75 mm a year over the past century. The latest report by the World Meteorological Organization says that in early 2014, global-average measured sea-level reached a record high for the time of the year. The meltdown at Fukushima prompted reactor design changes, and with each devastating incident the world gains fresh knowledge in hindsight. But that may not be enough to save humanity from the intensity of recurring calamities. Science is quite firm that extreme events will increase over the years, making anticipation and preparation imperative. That is the least that countries can do to save their populations from devastation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-indian-ocean-tsunami-10th-anniversary/article6732969.ece
29,12,2014,Revitalising the Railways,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s clarification that there was no question of >privatising the Indian Railways may not have been wholly necessary. But, to dispel a rumour campaign that it was being privatised, Mr. Modi used the ‘good governance’ platform from his Varanasi constituency to drive home that message. The fact remains that the government and the Railways badly need private and foreign investment in the system. The kind of resources needed to take up ongoing projects and also launch ambitious ones such as the dedicated rail corridor and bullet train services, cannot be met by public sector funding alone. That is why the Prime Minister has been looking to Japan and China to provide both technological and financial support to some of these projects. Equally important was the reiteration of the plan to set up four Railway universities across the country. These will specifically cater to the needs of the railway system and provide readily employable candidates in various disciplines. The focus of the railway universities could be very specific, be it the electrical, mechanical or signalling fields, to mention a few. It will take some time for the Railways to do the basic homework, identify the locations and courses, and complete the formalities to start these institutions, which could also look at upgrading the skills of existing employees and providing them opportunities to acquire higher qualifications.
Internally, the Railways is constantly trying to raise more funds and increase earnings from both freight and passenger fares. But a rather unpopular move in recent months has been the dynamic pricing of fares and the premium-rate Tatkal tickets. In October, the Railways unveiled premium Tatkal ticketing, under which 50 per cent of the tickets going through the travel-eve Tatkal window was brought into a dynamic pricing package. While 10 per cent of tickets in the ordinary second class come under Tatkal, up to 30 per cent in the sleeper and higher classes are brought under it. Only e-ticketing is allowed, agents cannot book these tickets, and individual identity document numbers have to be provided online and produced during travel. About 80 popular trains were brought under this scheme. What is more, for the holiday season now, the Railways have introduced special premium trains based on the dynamic pricing policy. The chief problem with the premium scheme is that it keeps the ordinary passenger who books tickets at the railway counter, out of the system: those without Internet access cannot utilise this option. Notably, in its first Railway budget, the BJP-led NDA government raised passenger fares by 14.2 per cent across the board. Even last year, without the dynamic fares, the Railways earned about Rs.1,000 crore through the Tatkal scheme.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-privatisation-of-indian-railways/article6732970.ece
30,12,2014,Many faces of terror,"Sometimes, terror is its own purpose. Militant groups with an identifiable cause often claim responsibility for their acts or choose their targets carefully. But those behind Sunday’s low-intensity explosion in Bengaluru that indiscriminately targeted ordinary people in a crowded public place have chosen to remain anonymous so far. The bomb blast, which claimed the life of a woman from Chennai who was on a visit to Bengaluru, was clearly intended to spread fear and set off panic, rather than send any specific political message. The aim seems to have been to create a feeling of insecurity among the city’s residents, and invite greater, harsh policing. This is not the first time >Bengaluru has been subjected to a terror attack of this nature. Such low-intensity blasts are suspected to be the handiwork of local networks of extremists with limited material resources and logistics support. Investigators see similarities with the blast on board a Bengaluru-originating train arriving at the Chennai Central station, in which activists of the Students Islamic Movement of India, who escaped from the Khandwa jail last year, were believed to be involved. While it is too early to pinpoint responsibility, the fact remains that India-based terror modules have chosen Bengaluru for repeated attacks. While New Delhi and Mumbai have seen attacks with the involvement of organisations from across the border, most of the explosions in Bengaluru have been traced back to Indian groups such as those of Abdul Nasir Maudany or Al Umma or the Indian Mujahideen. The exception was the shooting at the Indian Institute of Science during an international conference, exactly nine years ago, which was carried out by Indians supposedly with links to the Laskhar-e-Toiba.
Whether the blast was intended to protest the >arrest of the pro-Islamic State tweeter in Bengaluru, would be known only after further investigation. But, Bengaluru, a city with a large floating population, with workers drawn from different parts of the country, is surely growing too big and diverse for conventional policing. True, it is difficult to prevent terrorists picking soft targets. Intelligence inputs on the possibility of such attacks are usually vague and non-actionable. A separate intelligence information cadre, as proposed by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, could help in data surveillance, and in tracking online activities of suspects, but whether this could in itself help prevent similar attacks on soft targets is another matter altogether. The Bengaluru police, which have had remarkable success in apprehending the perpetrators in these attacks, might need to adopt problem-oriented policing to prevent terror crimes with a greater level of success.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-bengaluru-blast-and-terror-attacks/article6736033.ece
30,12,2014,Disquieting developments,"The new Ukrainian Parliament’s overwhelming vote last week in favour of the country opting for membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) is a contentious signal from a pro-western government to further cement Kiev’s strategic ties with the West. The decision reverses the country’s policy of non-alignment with any political and military grouping, codified under former President Viktor F. Yanukovych in 2010. Instead, it paves the way for Ukraine’s strong military and strategic engagement with European powers and the United States. Eventual entry into the military alliance may still take years. But the current context of the continuing separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine lends the legislative step a provocative edge, from a Russian standpoint. Moscow has characterised Ukraine’s move as confrontationist; one that is consistent with its decade-long and stout opposition to the eastward extension of the military alliance. The Russian stance is also in sync with influential thinking in the aftermath of the disintegration of the Soviet Union that grew sceptical of the relevance of NATO in a post-Cold War scenario. Whereas the disbanding of the Warsaw Pact followed the emergence of the new democracies in the former Eastern Europe, NATO has continued to expand in the more than two decades since.
Clearly, Kiev’s latest move cannot be viewed in isolation. Earlier in December, both Houses of the Congress adopted the Ukraine Freedom Support Act with the avowed objective of countering threats from Moscow to the territorial integrity of the Slavic nation. The Russian response has been the establishment of the Eurasian Economic Union with Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan to promote regional trade. The Kremlin came under criticism for the annexation of Crimea following a referendum earlier this year. Its alleged role in aiding Ukrainian separatist groups with military equipment has since remained in the spotlight. Meanwhile, the United Nations said last month that nearly a thousand people have been killed since September 2014 when the ceasefire between the Ukrainian forces and separatist rebels came into force. Besides, the months-long conflict has claimed a few thousand lives. Moreover, the number of people who have registered as displaced by the conflict has risen by over 50 per cent to 460,000 in the same period. In the absence of swift and concerted diplomatic initiatives to address the scale of the humanitarian tragedy, the region runs the risk of prolonged instability. That is in the interest of neither Russia nor the western powers. Kiev’s overtures at this juncture to join NATO would merely raise the rhetoric and deepen mutual suspicion.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-ukraine-voting-in-favour-of-nato/article6736035.ece
31,12,2014,Impropriety of ordinance,"By promulgating ordinances within days of the winter session of Parliament coming to a close, the Narendra Modi government has shown that it is not averse to repeating what his party would have considered a constitutional impropriety, had it been done by a Congress government. The power to issue ordinances is normally to be exercised to bring in urgent legislative measures when Parliament is in recess. It is not one to be resorted to merely because the government of the day lacks a majority in the Upper House or is unable to break a deadlock in Parliament. However, it is seen that inefficient floor management, fear of facing a House in which the incumbent party does not have a majority, and a reluctance to make pragmatic concessions across the floor in the interest of sticking to its legislative agenda are the main reasons for prolonged deadlocks. It is a situation rich in irony as the BJP had often questioned the United Progressive Alliance government’s promulgation of ordinances in close proximity to a parliamentary session. As in the case of the impasse in the Rajya Sabha that occasioned the ordinances recently issued to make legislative changes in the coal and insurance sectors, logjams are often the result of the government’s aversion to resolving issues raised by the Opposition. The Bharatiya Janata Party’s justification for exercising the President’s legislative power is that it had to avoid any further delay in the e-auction of coal blocks; and that raising the cap on foreign direct investment in insurance from 26 per cent to 49 brooked no further delay. And it has now approved yet another ordinance to amend the land acquisition law when there appears to be no urgent need to do so.

On the flip side, it is a fact that the combined opposition, which outnumbers the ruling party and its allies in the Rajya Sabha, was determined to stall the proceedings until the demand that the Prime Minister himself make a statement on the ongoing ‘reconversion’ drive organised by affiliates of the Sangh Parivar was met. Mr. Modi could have intervened at least once to clear the air on allegations that his government was conniving at the controversial ghar vapsi programmes across the country. For a government committed to undoing the ‘policy paralysis’ of the previous regime and revitalising economic reforms and good governance, his regime has shown notable reluctance to rein in fringe Hindutva elements that do not seem to care for the government’s growth and development objectives. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s claim that the promulgation of the ordinances signify the government’s commitment to reform is questionable. An easier way to demonstrate its commitment to reform would have been to create conditions conducive to getting the Bills passed in the House.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-ordinances-passed-in-winter-session-of-parliament/article6739284.ece
31,12,2014,Another tragedy in the skies,"Two full days after an AirAsia aircraft on a flight from Surabaya in Indonesia to Singapore went missing, rescue teams have >found pieces of debris and the bodies of at least 40 of the 162 passengers and crew who were on board. This brings to a fairly quick end the suspense and speculation over the fate of the aircraft after it suddenly went off the radar. Reports point to similarities with an Air Algérie flight that disintegrated on impact after facing turbulent weather in the skies over Mali, while on its way from Burkina Faso to Algiers in July this year, leaving all 116 passengers and crew dead. Here, rescue missions from the neighbouring countries were immediately pressed into service — by air and by sea — from Sunday morning. Unlike the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH 370 that vanished mysteriously during its flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March, the AirAsia flight did contact radio control in Indonesia seeking permission to climb to 38,000 feet from the 32,000 level it was flying, to avoid thick clouds. But that permission was not granted because of traffic in the skies. Nothing more was heard after that, which is why the control managers in Indonesia and aviation experts feel the aircraft was caught in a storm and perhaps plunged into the sea. When debris was sited by aircraft naval ships rushed to the scene, to find the bodies too.

AirAsia has had a fairly good safety record since its founding over a decade ago. Similarly, the Airbus A320 is known to be a sturdy aircraft, with a load of safety features. So it could not have wilted so easily. The fact that there was no distress call, and only a request for a deviation, remains the bottom line of this suspected tragedy. Again, unlike the Malaysian aircraft that had deliberately taken a significant detour and could have plunged into the deep southern Indian Ocean, the AirAsia aircraft could have been lost only in the Java sea, since its flight path was across the sea from one island to another. That limited the area of search, which has now proved successful. The families of the victims — a majority of whom were Indonesians — waited in suspense till the debris was located. Then came news of bodies being found, shattering what little hopes they had. What remains to be done is to get to the cause of the tragedy. This can be done only if the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder are recovered in time. Aviation safety experts say 2014 was a relatively safe year in the skies, with about eight major disasters involving nearly 900 lives. Cold statistics are no comfort for the families of the passengers of the AirAsia flight, and it is imperative that what happened, and why it happened, be unravelled fully.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-airasia-flight-tragedy-and-aviation-safety/article6739285.ece
