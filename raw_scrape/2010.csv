1,1,2010,Addressing the vulnerability,"At a time when the prospects for civil aviation industry seemed to be looking up, the failed attempt to blow up a Detroit-bound transatlantic Northwest Airline flight last week has come as a rude shock. A 23-year-old Nigerian was able to slip through the security net at the Amsterdam airport and get on to the flight with explosives, later identified as PETN (pentaerythritol). It is by a stroke of luck that he failed — he sustained serious burns in trying to ignite the explosive and was overpowered by the crew and fellow passengers. Airport security was the final line of defence that he had breached. Based on information, he had some months ago been noted as a potential terrorist to be watched but American security agencies had failed to follow up and bar him from flying into the U.S. In addition to addressing the questions raised by the intelligence failure, the U.S. administration has also sought to tighten airport security. Obviously, there are still certain explosives and chemicals — they include plastic explosives — which cannot be detected in the existing security checks at airports. One suggestion that has emerged is the introduction of mandatory whole body scan at major airports, especially for flights bound for the U.S. Nigeria, in fact, has placed orders for these scans at its four major airports, and no international passenger will be allowed to board a flight without going through this check. Many European airports already have this facility, but the check has not been made compulsory as yet.
In 2001, after a failed “shoe bombing” incident, when a passenger attempted to blow up a plane with explosive-laden shoes, American airports made it compulsory for all passengers to remove their shoes and put them through the scanner. Chemical explosives, small quantities of which are enough to blow holes through the aircraft with disastrous consequences at high altitudes, have posed a major technological challenge to airport security. Special scanning for chemicals and physical search are currently in use but they are time-consuming and involve additional cost and delays. The airlines too seem worried at the prospect of security measures and terrorist threats keeping passengers away from international flights. If the coming year was expected to see a turnround in the fortunes of airlines, the latest incident and the Nigerian suspect’s warning that more bombers were heading for the U.S. have come as dampeners. Technological developments may well make security screening at airports quicker and non-intrusive, but that is for the medium term. Meanwhile, no effort must be spared to make the screening as thorough as possible even at the cost of some inconvenience and delays.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Addressing-the-vulnerability/article16835552.ece
1,1,2010,Inevitable delay,"Given the complexity involved in conceptualising and implementing the Goods and Services Tax (GST), it is becoming clearer by the day that the scheme cannot be introduced by April 1, 2010, as originally proposed. An overwhelming majority of States have expressed themselves in favour of a less rigid time frame. The Centre has not yet brought before Parliament the legislation to amend the Constitution without which the GST cannot be put in place. More basically, the Centre and the States are yet to reach a consensus on what the goods and services tax rates should be. The Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers has come out in favour of a dual structure. The Centre and the States will have their own laws and rates, and there will be a multiplicity of rates for goods and services. More recently, there have been suggestions favouring a combined GST across the country, incorporating the tax rates of both the Centre and the States. The National Institute of Public Finance and Policy has said the combined GST could be around 17-18 per cent. This is substantially higher than the 12 per cent combined tax rate — five per cent for the Centre and seven per cent for the States — proposed by the 13th Finance Commission recently. The Commission has also recommended the creation of a safety net for the States with a corpus of Rs. 30,000 crore to be funded by the Centre over five years.
The sharp difference in the rates proposed by the two expert bodies indicates, more than anything else, the difficulty in working out a revenue-neutral tax rate that will be fair to all the stakeholders. At this stage, there is no clarity on whether it will be possible to subsume all the indirect taxes into the new levy. The administrative costs involved, including those for the development of crucial technology inputs, have yet to be calculated. Although there are major hurdles to be crossed before a consensus can be arrived at, the time has come to educate all the stakeholders on the merits of the GST, which is not a new tax but only an improvement over the prevailing consumption tax systems at the Centre and in the States. At present, there is a value added tax (VAT) at the manufacturing stage on goods and a separate tax on selected services at the Centre, and a VAT up to the retail stage at the State level. Tax bases at the Centre and in the States overlap and, despite the input credits given at various levels, there is considerable cascading that distorts tax incidence and makes manufacturing non-competitive in many cases. The GST is expected to expand the tax base and reduce distortions by eliminating input taxes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Inevitable-delay/article16835223.ece
2,1,2010,Anodyne blueprint,"In the summer of 2007, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh promised Jammu and Kashmir’s people a “blueprint for a new future.” Late last month, retired Supreme Court judge Saghir Ahmed released the summary of that blueprint — and sparked off protests across party lines. Made on behalf of a working group set up by the Prime Minister in 2006 to consider measures for strengthening the relationship between the Union of India and Jammu and Kashmir, Justice Ahmed’s recommendations are less-than-substantial. Among other things, he has called on the Prime Minister to set up a mechanism to restore J&K’s autonomy “to the extent possible.” He has also recommended that the people of the State be allowed to decide whether Article 370 should be made a permanent feature of India’s Constitution or, alternatively, abrogated — neatly sidestepping the divisions on the issue. There are no serious recommendations on how sub-regional aspirations are to be met. In short, the suggestion is that the State and central governments decide the questions the working group was set up to consider!
But the anodyne findings aren’t the reason most major parties are protesting. It is that the Working Group’s members had little say in shaping the recommendations that have been made in their name. Justice Ahmed last met the members of the Working Group on September 3, 2007, when each party made a presentation on its position. Members came away from the meeting believing there would be further discussion. Instead, they learnt about the recommendations from the newspapers. The loudest protests have come from the Bharatiya Janata Party but other parties, ranging from the People’s Democratic Party to the Communist Party of India (Marxist), have also made it clear they are less than happy. Only the National Conference has backed the report, claiming, for reasons not immediately apparent from the text, that it vindicates the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly’s 2000 call for maximal autonomy. In his address at the third roundtable conference on April 24, 2007, Dr. Singh pointed out that New Delhi’s efforts to initiate an inclusive dialogue on Jammu and Kashmir had raised hope for the State’s future and underlined the need to “keep this process moving forward.” Now the government finds itself in the curious position of negotiating with Islamist-led secessionists — but not engaging the elected representatives of the State’s people. It is not too late to do a course correction and restore the legitimacy of a promising process by resuscitating the inclusive dialogue Dr. Singh promised would shape the future of the State.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Anodyne-blueprint/article16835365.ece
2,1,2010,Looking back on the pandemic,"The year that has ended saw the world coming to grips with a new influenza pandemic after an interval of 40 years. It was not the much-feared H5N1 bird flu virus. Nor did outbreaks begin in East Asia, as was believed to be likely. Instead, the first human cases appeared in April on the other side of the globe. Thereafter, in a world interconnected by rapid air travel, the new virus showed up in country after country. By June, the World Health Organisation officially declared the start of the flu pandemic. Analysing the viral genome, scientists swiftly established that it had jumped to humans from pigs and possessed a mix of human, pig, and bird flu genes. Mercifully, the novel H1N1 strain has been quite unlike the one that set off the catastrophic 1918 pandemic. Swine flu, as the new virus is commonly called, infected many millions of people around the world during 2009. But the vast majority recovered easily. One key difference is that while seasonal flu predominantly kills the old, the new virus has proved life-threatening to younger people too. Pregnant women and people with chronic health conditions have been particularly at risk. Even healthy youth have sometimes fallen victim. Autopsies carried out on some of those who succumbed in New York showed that the pandemic strain was damaging cells all along the airway, including deep into the lungs. Bacterial co-infection greatly increased the risk of developing severe disease.
WHO’s assessment is that the true number of fatalities from the H1N1 virus worldwide was higher than the approximately 12,200 reported because many deaths would not have been recognised as flu-related. U.S. health officials recently estimated that 50 million Americans (a sixth of the country’s population) caught the disease, 213,000 needed hospitalisation, and nearly 10,000 died of the disease. In India, a young man who flew in from New York in May became the country’s first officially confirmed case. Three months later, the virus claimed the life of a Pune schoolgirl. Since then, more than 840 laboratory-confirmed deaths have been reported from various States. In South Asia, according to a recent WHO update, influenza activity continues to be intense, particularly in northern India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Although the moderate impact of the pandemic was the “best possible health news of the decade,” the world health body’s Director-General Margaret Chan has cautioned that it would be prudent to continue monitoring the virus’ evolution for another year. By focussing minds and resources, the pandemic has left the nations of the world better prepared to deal with global health emergencies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Looking-back-on-the-pandemic/article16835364.ece
4,1,2010,"Still waiting, after 25 years","It will come as cold comfort to the victims of the November 1984 massacre of Sikhs in Delhi, Kanpur, and other cities that “official sanction” to prosecute Sajjan Kumar in one of the last pending cases against him has finally been given. A Congress strongman in Delhi, Mr. Kumar has been prosecuted before and let off by the courts because of the weakness of the case mounted by the Delhi Police. From the word go, the police subverted all cases stemming from the 1984 killings with the same degree of commitment to the rule of law that it displayed during the three days murderous mobs were given a free hand to wreak ‘vengeance’ on innocent Sikhs for the dastardly assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards. Dozens of murders spread across a vast area were listed in omnibus First Information Reports and details mixed up and confused in such a way that their use in subsequent investigations and prosecutions was next to impossible. Mr. Kumar evaded indictment for years with the help of the political establishment and a surprisingly benevolent judiciary. When he was eventually indicted, he presented as star defence witnesses the very police officers who authored one of those FIRs. This, coupled with the fact that numerous prosecution witnesses “mysteriously” turned hostile, led to his acquittal in the most serious of charges. That matter is now on appeal.
Will the ‘Rathore effect’ — the widespread public revulsion at the ease with which influential persons get away with heinous criminal acts — force the authorities to mount a proper effort to bring a key player of November 1984 to justice this time around? Or will his forthcoming trial for lesser offences like inciting communal hatred get caught up in labyrinthine procedures? Mass killings of the type and scale of November 1984 or Gujarat 2002 take place partly because an effective immunity from proper investigation and prosecution attach to them. Indian law and judicial process treat these incidents as ‘ordinary’ rather than genocidal crimes, which require special rules and procedures for prosecution. Crucially, Indian law does not assign command responsibility to those at the top of the administrative pyramid who have both the knowledge of the mass killings taking place and the ability to stop them but do nothing to intervene. This is the yardstick for culpability in modern international humanitarian law. The incorporation of this principle in India will surely have a salutary deterrent effect. Sadly, the proposed Communal Violence Bill lacks this essential element and is so riddled with other infirmities that it will be next to useless in protecting innocent citizens from targeted mass violence.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Still-waiting-after-25-years/article16835654.ece
4,1,2010,The future of cinema?,"Ever since 1895, when the Lumiere brothers staged the first paid public screening of a film, the trajectory of cinematic art has been twinned with technological advancement. The first patent for a 3D movie process, which creates an illusion of depth, was filed around the same time. But it wasn’t until the 1950s that the ‘golden era’ of 3D or stereoscopic filmmaking began — a short flowering with mixed results. After shooting Dial M For Murder in this format, Alfred Hitchcock was famously unimpressed, remarking that 3D was a “nine day wonder — and I came in on the ninth day.” The release of James Cameron’s stunningly successful Avatar demonstrates that 3D today has no resemblance to its earlier, primitive avatars. By combining stereoscopic effect with cutting edge digital production technologies, the truck-driver-turned-director has left audiences gasping at the technical wizardry in his visually breathtaking interstellar epic located in a faraway planet with fantastical creatures, exotic flora and fauna, and an endearing race of blue-skinned humanoids called the Na’vi. Cameron dreamed of making such a film before Titanic, which did anything but sink, grossing a record $1.8 billion and sailing to a record-equalling 11 Oscars in 1998. If he waited so long, he says it was because technology needed to catch up with his vision.
In Cameron’s hybrid world, where actors and computer-graphics characters flit in and out of live environments and those created by computerised imagery, illusion and reality are merged to produce a stunningly photorealistic experience. Avatar’s innovations include a new form of performance-capture technology, which created computerised images of the Na’vi from real facial expressions and movements of actors, and a new and more nimble 3D camera, designed by his team, which allowed Cameron to film his actors live in the virtual world. Avatar’s over-earnest storyline is prosaic and somewhat disappointing. But will it change the way we watch films? It’s hard to say, but it is certain to provide a fillip for stereoscopic cinema, which is in the midst of a strong resurgence. Against six in 2008, an estimated 40 3D films are in various stages of production. Last year, there were about 1,500 3D-equipped screens in 30 countries, a number that has already quadrupled and is set to grow rapidly. One reason for the excitement about stereoscopic cinema is that it is less vulnerable to the threat of piracy: you need a cinema hall and polarised glasses to enjoy a 3D film. Cameron has shown that the leap in technology provides a giant leap in the movie-watching experience.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-future-of-cinema/article16835649.ece
5,1,2010,Sharper focus on security,"When Nigerian terror suspect Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab boarded the Detroit-bound Northwest Airlines Flight 253 at Amsterdam, he was already in the least-restrictive, 550,000-person Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment database of the United States National Counterterrorism Centre. As a result of what President Obama candidly described as “a mix of human and systemic failures,” Abdulmutallab’s name never moved from there to the 4,000-person no-fly list, nor was his multiple-entry U.S. visa revoked. The botched Christmas-day terror attack occurred despite the Central Investigative Agency receiving information last November from Abdulmutallab’s father regarding the terror risk that his son posed; further the National Security Agency had intercepted, in August, al-Qaeda chatter in Yemen on a terror plot involving a Nigerian. The implied inter-agency coordination failures have sparked a sharp debate on national security, mostly along party lines. The Republican opposition, undoubtedly mindful of the mid-term Congressional elections in November, has called into question Mr. Obama’s track record against terror, with former Vice President Dick Cheney saying that the President was “trying to pretend we are not at war.” The White House hit back saying, “Seven years of bellicose rhetoric failed to reduce the threat from al-Qaeda and succeeded in dividing this country.”
Yet there is a danger in dismissing specific Republican questions as opportunistic or irrelevant political posturing. President Obama would do well to take the queries seriously, especially given that the attack was foiled by circumstance rather than any prior intelligence. For example, it was fair to ask, as Representative John Boehner of Ohio did, what exactly is the administration’s “overarching strategy to confront the terrorist threat and keep America safe”; or to criticise, as Republican of the House Intelligence Committee Peter Hoekstra did, the lack of follow-up action when data on Abdulmutallab became available months ago. Some of these arguments may also paradoxically undermine the Republican campaign: Democrats have been quick to point out that it was House Republicans who voted this year against a $44 billion bill financing additional airport security measures. In particular, there is a strong case for using full-body scanners at airports — devices that would have detected the materials Abdulmutallab carried — subject to privacy concerns being addressed. Against the backdrop of intelligence lapses and coordination failures is the spectre of a shift in the balance of Congressional power after the November elections. A new Congress that is less overwhelmingly Democratic is likely to keep up the pressure on President Obama to address security concerns more rigorously.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Sharper-focus-on-security/article16573221.ece
5,1,2010,Skewed against the States,"The report of the 13th Finance Commission (TFC) has not been made public but it is obvious that it will be comprehensive, encompassing, besides its core area of tax sharing, critical issues such as fiscal consolidation. The Commission was constituted in 2007. In August 2008, the government, faced with the charge of persisting with opaque accounting practices — specifically in treating the burgeoning petroleum and other subsidies as “off-budget” items — asked the TFC to suggest a revised road map with “a view to maintaining the gains of fiscal consolidation through 2010 to 2015.” That additional point of reference has since become critically important in the context of the stimulus packages involving more spending by government. The government is still undecided about the timing of withdrawing the stimulus packages but will obviously be influenced by the TFC’s recommendations. Another area in which the Commission will have a substantial say is in the design of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The TFC has already made it known that it favours a revenue-neutral, single GST, preferably at 12 per cent, arguing that the relatively low rate will lead to better compliance and boost the GDP by as much as 1.5 percentage points.
The focus of the TFC’s report will be on correcting the growing imbalance in the sharing of tax resources by the Centre and the States. According to a recent estimate by the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, States raise 34 per cent of the consolidated tax revenues but incur 58 per cent of the expenditure. Further, a significant part of the States’ expenditure is tied to the central expenditure on schemes launched by the Centre. In that category are some of the flagship schemes in the social sector, which has received enhanced budgetary allocation this year. Moreover, since 2003-04 the Centre has been transferring funds directly to the implementing agencies at the district, even village-level, bypassing the State exchequer. Also, the backward States rich in mineral wealth feel discriminated against in the matter of royalties. The TFC can be expected to have addressed these and related issues. But over the years Finance Commissions have been constrained by three factors: expansion in the terms of reference beyond tax devolution; restriction of its scope to non-Plan expenditure; and the emergence of multiple agencies in making transfers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Skewed-against-the-States/article16835832.ece
6,1,2010,Doing good for science,"On the one hand, there is the vision of India emerging as a major scientific and technological power in the world. On the other, there is the fear that the strains and limitations that are all too visible in the country’s education and science system could cause it to stumble badly. At a time when rich nations and fast-growing developing countries alike are looking to ensure that science and its associated technological benefits become the bedrock for future competitiveness, India cannot afford to fall behind in this race. In the seven years up to 2007, research publications from India rose by about 80 per cent, noted a recent report from Thomson Reuters; it added that if this trajectory continued, India’s productivity would be “on a par with most G8 nations within 7-8 years and overtake them between 2015-2020.” Inevitably, comparisons are made with neighbouring China. China’s spending on science has risen so rapidly that it is now just behind the United States and Japan in terms of gross expenditure on R&D. It has increased its share of the world’s researchers from 14 per cent in 2002 to about 20 per cent in 2007, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. China has over 1,000 researchers per million inhabitants while India has only one-seventh of that.
“We have worked hard to do what is good for science,” observed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh when he inaugurated the Indian Science Congress at Thiruvananthapuram recently. “We also know that we need to do much more because scientific capability is what will determine our ability to overcome the challenges which lie ahead.” The Eleventh Five Year Plan, which started in 2007, has quadrupled the outlay on education and trebled governmental investments in science and technology in comparison with the Tenth Plan. But it must not be a matter of simply churning out more science graduates and Ph.Ds. Encouragement and support for young scientists and enthusiastic students to engage in frontline research that interests them is vitally important. Good teachers, fellow students, and facilities are the necessary ingredients for producing good scientists, observed Nobel laureate Venkatraman Ramakrishnan when he addressed a large gathering in Chennai recently. Quoting Dr. Ramakrishnan, the Prime Minister spoke of the need to “liberate Indian science from the shackles and deadweight of bureaucratism and in-house favouritism.” The Scientific Advisory Committee to the Cabinet and the Science Advisory Council to the Prime Minister are reported to have made a number of recommendations for reducing the red tape. India needs to move quickly on a number of fronts if it is to take its rightful place in the firmament of global science. It is certainly time for action and measurable outcomes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Doing-good-for-science/article16836088.ece
6,1,2010,Turnaround in foreign trade?,"It would be premature to think of a sharp turnaround in India’s foreign trade based on just one month’s figures. However, given the continued fall in both imports and exports for nearly 12 months in a row, the trade figures for November 2009 released recently by the Director-General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics, give room for optimism, especially in exports. In that month, exports at $13.19 billion were 18 per cent higher than a year ago ($11.16 billion). Imports too have fared better, registering only a modest 2.6 per cent decrease, which is in sharp contrast to the double-digit decline witnessed through the current fiscal year till October. Positive export growth helped along by the decline — though slower — in imports resulted in the narrowing of the trade deficit to $9.69 billion, as against $12.32 billion in November 2008. While as a rule, a narrower trade deficit ought to be welcomed, the circumstances leading to it matter as much as the trade figures for one month. Even over an eight-month period, April-November 2009, exports and imports on an aggregate basis are well below the levels during the corresponding period of the previous year. Exports are down by 22 per cent and imports by over 27 per cent. The overall trade deficit during this period stands at $66.18 billion, down from over $100 billion the previous year.
An urgent task before the policy-makers is to help sustain the positive trend in exports over the remaining months so that the annual target of $165-170 billion is achieved— the same level as in 2007-08. The decline in exports was due to the sharp fall in demand in the principal overseas markets — the United States, the European Union, and Japan. With the worst of the recession behind them, these countries would be able to import more from India. Export organisations have urged the government to continue extending support, particularly for the labour-intensive export segments such as leather, handicrafts, gem and jewellery, and agro-industries. A strengthening rupee has been another area of concern for the exporters but the scope for intervention by the Reserve Bank of India is limited at this juncture. A fall in both oil and non-oil imports has contributed to the continuing decline in imports. Petroleum prices have remained relatively low since October last year, though they have been rising more recently. The drop in non-oil imports by nearly 24 per cent till November is a cause for concern, reflecting as it does the lower investment in capital goods.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Turnaround-in-foreign-trade/article16836087.ece
7,1,2010,Create congenial atmosphere,"The recent meeting of Andhra Pradesh’s recognised political parties convened by the central government might have failed to produce anything remotely resembling a ‘consensus’ on the Telangana issue. Yet, as Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram has made clear, there is no acceptable alternative to the democratic process of holding consultations to narrow down and resolve differences on vital issues — by exercising leadership, showing accommodation and goodwill, and maintaining peace and harmony. No reasonable person can disagree with Mr. Chidambaram’s prescription that “children must go to schools and colleges, people must be allowed to carry on their normal day-to-day activities, the government must be able to focus on development and the welfare of the people” and that it is in the interest of all sections of the people of the State that “peace and harmony prevail while the consultations take place.” The immediate imperative is the cooling down of passions and an end to the agitations, bandhs, acts of unruliness, and violence that have brought south India’s largest State virtually to its knees. To their credit, the eight participant-parties have agreed on this vital point in a signed statement. This should encourage the central and State governments in their efforts to find a way out of the impasse within a “reasonable time frame.”
The problem today is not so much that the major political players are divided on the issue of breaking up Andhra Pradesh and forming Telangana State. It is that A.P.’s three leading political parties, responding to the popular mood, are regionally split on this highly emotive issue. True to form, the State Congress has been unable to make a stand, thus bringing the national party leadership in the direct line of fire. The two leading opposition parties, the Telugu Desam Party and the Praja Rajyam, which supported the demand for a separate Telangana right up to December 7 and did a volte face thereafter, have a special responsibility in helping the central and State governments restore normalcy and work towards a solution. Fortunately, all the major parties other than the Telangana Rashtra Samithi have stakes in all three regions of the State — coastal Andhra, Rayalaseema, and Telangana. Fortunately, no party is in a position to exploit the present crisis and it must be recognised that the TRS showed responsibility by participating in the New Delhi consultations. Apprehensions expressed by some parties about Naxalite infiltration of the Telangana movement are relevant but this factor must not be exaggerated to cloud the issues. The democratic process of consultations on the future of Andhra Pradesh can be constructive and fruitful only if it moves away from an all-or-nothing framework and intelligently seeks common ground by addressing the practical issues and complications, including the future of Hyderabad.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Create-congenial-atmosphere/article16836282.ece
7,1,2010,Encouraging high-speed trains,"It is no exaggeration to say that the recent launch of the world’s fastest train service in China ‘signals the future.’ Its significance lies not merely in the impressive fact that it touched a record speed of 350 km an hour and shrunk distances but in its spotlighting how such trains can become a serious alternative to short-haul flights and long distance road travel. This assumes further importance in the light of the imperative need to cut carbon emissions urgently. Although high-speed trains, which exceeded 250 km per hour, were successfully launched as early as 1964 in Japan and adapted in France in 1981, they were not extensively explored. For many years, infrastructure and capacity improvement projects were limited to building more domestic airports and roads. High-speed trains tend to emit only one-fourth and one-third of CO 2 per 100-passenger-km that aircraft and private cars do respectively. For the relevant distances, they also offer faster door-to-door connectivity than flights. They substantially improve inter-city travel options. Places as far as 800 km can be reached within an affordable time of less than three hours and this is a compelling reason to promote this energy-efficient mode of travel. As more and more passengers shift to such trains, congestion at airports and roads can be reduced and the spaces released can be efficiently used. High costs can no longer be held against high-speed trains.
The Indian Railways have recently announced that they have plans for 12 high-speed corridors with trains operating at a speed of 250-350 km per hour. As late entrants, they have the opportunity to leapfrog, learning from the successful experiences of other countries and aiming to go beyond increasing speeds. Safety must be the top priority. Japan has shown that this is possible as well as necessary for the success of the system. European countries have demonstrated that it is essential to develop the intra-city transport network and integrate it with the system so that the ridership can increase and travel can be seamless. Improving the stations, instituting sensitive pricing, and putting in place an accessible ticketing system are equally important. High-speed trains can facilitate balanced regional urban development and this is of special relevance to Indian conditions. With careful planning, urban growth can be shifted to and induced in mid-size towns connected by these trains and further crowding of large metropolitan cities avoided.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Encouraging-high-speed-trains/article16836281.ece
8,1,2010,Insensitive and in denial,"The fatal stabbing of 21-year-old Nitin Garg and the recovery of the burnt body of a Punjabi youth have re-ignited the debate about the safety of Indian students in Australia. Coming in the wake of a spate of attacks on Indian students over the past year, they are certainly disturbing. In addition to condemning the attacks and indirectly raising questions about the effectiveness of the steps taken by the Australian authorities, the Government of India has issued a restrained travel advisory asking Indian students Down Under to take “basic precautions in being alert to their own security.” Regrettably, the official reaction in Australia, at the federal as well as the state level, has been less than satisfactory — a reaction wrapped around denial. Australian officials have busied themselves in discounting the possibility that racism could be a significant cause for Indian students being targeted. At a time when precious young lives have been lost and emotions are running high, it is poor consolation and bad diplomacy to be told that the number of attacks has been exaggerated or that Indian students are soft targets because they live or work in rough neighbourhoods. This kind of insensitivity was reflected in acting Foreign Minister Simon Crean’s remark that such incidents happen not only in Melbourne but also in “Delhi and Mumbai.”
It is possible that many of the attacks on Indian students in the Melbourne area are opportunistic rather than racial. But virtually ruling out racial motivation in advance of a proper police investigation of two brutal murders against a distressing background of attacks suggests that the authorities are making light of a serious problem. The Australian government needs to address, at the highest political level, the growing feeling among Indian students that their concerns about racial violence are not being addressed sincerely. This is against the background of a rise over the last few years in the number of attacks against the Indian community, as evidenced by the Victoria police’s own data. Not surprisingly, visa applications from Indian students — who constitute the second largest foreign student contingent in Australia, after Chinese students — have shown a 46 per cent decline. This will certainly worry a nation where the higher education industry has emerged as the third largest export, valued close to $14 billion. Australia has built its reputation as an attractive educational destination by offering a variety of courses, good value for money, and the promise of a friendly environment. Its government needs to be firmly reminded that efforts to tackle an unacceptable series of attacks on young Indians can be undermined by a stance of defensiveness, denial, and insensitivity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Insensitive-and-in-denial/article16836488.ece
8,1,2010,Defending the whales,"The accomplished oceanographer Sylvia Earle said: “You must love it before you are moved to save it.” That is true as much for whales and their cetacean kin as it is for the vast oceans. After suffering shocking losses from mindless killing during the 20th century, whale populations are on the path to recovery. Most countries — the exceptions are a few led by Japan — have adopted a strong conservationist stance towards whales and dolphins. The foremost priority today is to close the loopholes in the 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling. The key provision under the whaling convention that enables countries to kill whales is the sanction for scientific research. There is general agreement that little science has emerged from the annual hunts, while the meat is allowed to be sold freely. A suggestion was made at the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) last year in Madeira that the ban on commercial hunting should be lifted, as it is ‘counterproductive.’ The outgoing IWC chairman, William Hogarth, informally advocated a controversial policy of sustainable, regulated hunting. But such a view prioritises the narrow concerns of a small group of countries, often based on reactionary cultural notions, over enlightened international opinion that favours a science-based conservation framework.
Whaling massacres at least 1,500 of the great animals in an average year. There are many other less visible lethal threats that need to be addressed urgently. Ship strikes, pollution, net entanglement in fisheries, loss of food sources and man-made sonar and oil-drilling noise — all harm whales. In the case of the giant humpback whale, which is found in greater numbers in the southern hemisphere, only two per cent of the original population is believed to have survived at the time of the implementation of the moratorium. Happily, over the last two decades, their numbers have bounced back. These early positives reinforce the need for a strong framework to mitigate the gamut of threats to whales. Moreover, this arrangement should be no less rigorous than conservation actions for land animals. It is heartening that Australia and New Zealand will soon be launching non-lethal research on whales in Antarctica. This step can potentially produce enough scientific evidence leading to a full ban on killing of whales in the name of science. It can also be a model for all countries in the study of the life and behaviour of intelligent species that some see as the great apes of the sea.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Defending-the-whales/article16836494.ece
9,1,2010,Image and reality in Kashmir,"Early this week, President Asif Ali Zardari promised legislators in Pakistan-administered Jammu and Kashmir that he would honour his father-in-law’s promise to wage “a thousand year war” to seize territory claimed by the country from India. On Wednesday, as two jihadists holed up inside a Srinagar hotel battled police personnel, India’s media were quick to cast the fighting in similarly apocalyptic terms. Barring that it took place around the corner from the offices of Srinagar-based television stations, there was little to distinguish the incident from dozens of similar fire engagements that regularly take place in the State. In fact the news from Jammu and Kashmir for the most part is heartening. Comprehensive official data are yet to be released, but the authoritative South Asia Terrorism Portal has estimated that 55 civilians, 78 security force personnel, and 244 terrorists were killed in the State in 2009 — the lowest figure since 1990. The figures show just how ill-founded the claims that J&K is a war-zone now are. The United States recorded 5.4 homicides per 100,000 population in 2008. In J&K last year, there were 3.7 terrorism-related deaths per 100,000 population, including combatants.
Policy-makers will, hopefully, continue to draw their lessons from the empirical picture — not television images. There is clear justification for nudging the peace process forward by continuing with careful reductions in troop levels across the State. In addition to cuts in the presence of the Central Reserve Police Force, two divisions of troops were recently withdrawn. In all, more than 30,000 troops have been pulled back since Prime Minister Manmohan Singh took office. It would be dangerous, of course, to lose sight of the real threats that lie ahead. Last month’s attempted assassination of pro-dialogue secessionist Fazal Haq Qureshi demonstrated that Pakistan-based jihadist groups, as well as their patrons in that country’s military establishment, remain hostile to peace. Pakistan’s failure to dismantle the infrastructure of jihadist groups has led to continued infiltration across the Line of Control. Last year saw a year-on-year increase in infiltration for the first time since 2002, with an estimated 106 terrorists crossing over in 433 recorded attempts. (There were 342 reported infiltration attempts in 2008.) However, last year’s infiltration levels were nowhere near the 1,373 bids recorded in 2003. Pakistan, it is also true, has so far refused to commit itself to the five principles for a resolution of the dispute arrived at between secret envoys appointed by Prime Minister Singh and former President Pervez Musharraf. Given the turmoil in that country, it is unlikely that any political dispensation will gift its opponents political capital by making concessions on J&K. But even then, there are signs of hope. Few noticed the key small print in President Zardari’s speech: that the thousand-year-war he spoke of would involve not guns, but “pen and mouth.” India must do all it can to encourage and reciprocate this spirit.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Image-and-reality-in-Kashmir/article16836675.ece
9,1,2010,Autonomy for Maharatnas,"The government’s decision to allow greater operational and financial freedom to the public sector companies that qualify as ‘Maharatnas’ — a new category that will have higher performance criteria than applicable to the existing ‘Navratna’ — is a step in the right direction. The process of speeding up decision-making in government-owned enterprises began in 1997 when nine companies were identified as eligible for the exalted status — hence the appellation ‘Navratnas.’ Subsequently nine more joined the group. Now, the Maharatnas, to be picked from these companies according to more stringent norms, will get much greater freedom in making financial and managerial decisions, such as top appointments and investments in joint ventures up to a ceiling of Rs.5,000 crore. The expectation is that, taking advantage of these enhanced decision-making powers, the Maharatnas will show better results and the other Navratnas that do not qualify now will be motivated to do better and make the grade.
It is obvious from the very concept of the scheme that the selection criteria must be stiffer than for the Navratna. But it appears that the government has raised the bar rather too high. To qualify, a public sector company will have to be listed on the stock exchanges with a minimum public float as prescribed by SEBI. Apart from a strong international presence, it should have a minimum turnover of Rs.25,000 crore and an average net annual profit of Rs.5,000 crore or more over the last three years. This means, only about a third of the Navratnas may qualify. The insistence on public shareholding is significant in that it recognises that the outside shareholders can have a positive influence on the functioning of a public enterprise. A major shortcoming, however, is that the policy has said nothing about removing some basic constraints under which the government companies are working — such as vigilance oversight and audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. Accountability to Parliament through the controlling ministries is no doubt important, as is the issue of broader accountability to the people as a whole. But the enterprises need to be insulated from unwarranted bureaucratic and political interference in the name of accountability and allowed the freedom necessary for efficient functioning.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Autonomy-for-Maharatnas/article16836674.ece
11,1,2010,Voting without borders,"At a time when India is courting People of Indian Origin from various parts of the world — people who are, by definition, foreign citizens — it is anomalous that most of its citizens living abroad are disallowed from casting their votes. This disenfranchising of Non-Resident Indians is a serious infirmity in the electoral process, something that has been repeatedly pointed out by the NRIs as well as civil rights activists in India. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s hope that Indian citizens living abroad will be able to vote in the next general election promises to redress a longstanding grievance and terminate a blatantly discriminatory provision in the electoral law. Under Article 19 of the Representation of the People Act 1950, only those “ordinarily resident” in a constituency are eligible to be registered in the electoral rolls. Since most NRIs either study or work abroad, often for extended periods, they lose their status as ordinary residents under Section 20 of the Act and are liable to be struck off the electoral rolls. As for those who remain on the electoral rolls, by virtue of not being struck off before the next revision, the only way is to cast a ballot in person, which means returning home (which may not quite be home).
This is not simply an unreasonable provision; it is an utterly iniquitous one. Under the Conduct of Election Rules 1961, the ordinary NRI is excluded while various classes of people are given the facility to cast absentee or postal ballots. They include not only ‘special voters’ such as the President, Vice-President, Governors, and Union and State Ministers, but also ‘service voters,’ a category that includes armed forces personnel and staff in diplomatic missions. A number of countries, from the United States and Canada to Argentina and the Philippines, make it possible for their overseas citizens to vote. The Government of India must waste no time in reintroducing the Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill in Parliament. The Bill, which sought to amend the RP Act 1950, by inserting a sub-section that classifies citizens who take up “employment, education or otherwise outside India” as ordinary residents, was introduced in the Rajya Sabha in 2006. Evidently it made a number of political interests uneasy, so it was referred to a parliamentary standing committee and the Union Law Ministry has been ‘examining’ it ever since. The facility to vote must be seen not as a favour done to ordinary Indian citizens living abroad — but as their right. Once the conceptual and legal shift takes place, the Election Commission of India will need all the time it can get to set up necessary mechanisms to allow them to vote in 2014.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Voting-without-borders/article16836962.ece
11,1,2010,Don’t Pakistanise Yemen,"Yemen, a second-tier preoccupation for terrorism trackers in the west until Christmas day 2009, has now been elevated to the highest-risk category. According to John Brennan, President Obama’s counterterrorism advisor, it was Anwar al-Awlaki, a Yemeni cleric of the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), who helped radicalise, train, and equip Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to attack Northwest Airlines Flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit. Other terror attacks that are being attributed to the Yemen-based AQAP include the November 2009 killing of 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, by United States Army major Nidal Malik Hasan; and the August 2009 assassination attempt on Prince Mohammed bin Nayef of the Saudi royal family. The most unmistakable sign of a spike in the perceived terror threat from Yemen was the temporary closure of the embassies of the U.S., Britain, and France in Sana’a this week. These threats to western interests have come on the back of the U.S.-Yemen allied offensive against AQAP in parts of Sana’a and in Abyan, al-Jawf, and Shabwah provinces.
The joint military operations of December reflect a growing yet tenuous bond between Washington and Sana’a. Financial assistance is of course at the heart of the relationship. The U.S. is expected substantially to increase the $70 million in security aid it provided Yemen last year. Its development assistance is poised to reach $120 million over three years. But these levels pale into insignificance compared with the $2 billion that neighbouring Saudi Arabia provides. As the U.S. and Saudi Arabia pump and more funds into Yemen in pursuit of their own foreign policy goals, there is a risk that they will ignore an important fact: political power in the country is still significantly beyond the control of its government, headed by President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Not only is the President embattled with conflicts involving Shia Houthi rebels in north Yemen and discontented secessionists of the south; his authority is further undermined by dwindling oil reserves and allegations of corruption against his administration. However, it is President Saleh’s occasional tolerance of Sunni jihadists and his past reliance on them in his fight against the northern Shiite rebels that must be most worrying for Washington. In this fraught polity, ever-increasing surges of American aid will distort the domestic balance of power and deny Yemenis the political space they need to resolve these complex issues. In turn, the U.S. may itself pay a heavy price for the Pakistanisation of Yemen.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Donrsquot-Pakistanise-Yemen/article16836961.ece
12,1,2010,Not exempt from public scrutiny,"The decision of the full bench of the Delhi High Court comprising Chief Justice A.P. Shah, Justice Vikramjit Sen, and Justice S. Muralidhar confirming that every citizen has the right to obtain information provided by the Supreme Court judges and held by the Chief Justice of India is a welcome blow for transparency and accountability in the higher judiciary. This was the third in the series of legal challenges to such disclosure mounted by the Supreme Court — it had earlier contested the issue before the Central Information Commission and a single judge of the Delhi High Court. The case related to the information on the disclosure of assets of judges to the CJI as required under the 1997 resolution passed by all the judges of the Supreme Court. What the RTI applicant sought was not even the contents of the declaration but merely if the judges had furnished the information required under the 1997 resolution. The reluctance to provide even this information was indeed inexplicable, particularly in the context of the court laying so much store by transparency and accountability for public officials and mandating the disclosure of assets of candidates contesting elections, for instance. Before the Delhi High Court bench, the Supreme Court raised the technical contention that the 1997 resolution had only moral force and declaration of assets was not information held under any law to which the RTI Act would apply. It also argued that the CJI held such information in a fiduciary capacity and in confidence and could not be made to disclose it.
The Delhi High Court rejected both these arguments, pointing out that the 1997 resolution passed unanimously by the judges themselves was considered binding. It also held that the CJI was not acting in a fiduciary capacity but was holding the information by reason of his office, and in any case the content of the declarations was not sought. It is significant that the court also sought to place the right to information on a higher constitutional footing of the fundamental right to freedom of expression under Article 19(1)(a) and not just on the RTI Act. The decision marks the close of one chapter that saw the unusual spectacle of the Supreme Court canvassing its case before the High Court and losing — an outcome that should strengthen public perception of the independence of the high court. Stranger still would be the Supreme Court taking up its own case on appeal from the Delhi High Court decision. Bowing to the public opinion, the Supreme Court made public the declaration of assets of all its judges on its website and the issue raised in the case has been addressed substantially. The gains from such transparency would be squandered if the court were now to use its authority to insulate itself from public scrutiny.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Not-exempt-from-public-scrutiny/article16837321.ece
12,1,2010,Crisis of Indian hockey,"Indian hockey has reached its nadir. The boycott of the training camp by players demanding their “due” has paralysed the game’s administration, with 45 days left for the World Cup in Delhi. Monetary remuneration is a complex issue. Hockey might have brought India eight Olympic gold medals but for decades it was an amateur sport. Even today, hockey fails to appeal to big sponsors. What hurts players most is that even when good sponsorship deals are struck, their rewards are negligible and payments erratic. Hockey India, a mechanism created by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) that is yet to be formalised in a democratic election, has remained apathetic to players’ concerns. When the International Hockey Federation (FIH) accorded recognition, it was on the understanding that the national body would be formed by November 2009. The deadline was extended in view of the difficulties encountered in merging associations in each State. But the insistence of Hockey India’s affiliation panel on a mandatory endorsement of the State Olympic Associations led to controversies. The threat of legal action by a few delayed the constitution of the voters’ list. The FIH and the Sports Ministry saw the necessity of nominating observers for holding fair and free elections. The FIH named a senior vice-president, Antonio von Ondorza, and Union Sports Minister and former Chief Election Commissioner M.S. Gill tasked the former legal advisor to the Election Commission, S.K. Mendiratta, with the responsibility of ensuring that democratic norms were observed. The delay in granting affiliation to Punjab triggered a heated debate. This obliged the Ministry to issue fresh guidelines, one of which stipulates that the Returning Officer should be an independent nominee, preferably a retired High Court or district judge.
The takeover of hockey administration after India failed to qualify for the 2008 Olympiad is yet to produce tangible benefits. The quality of governance by the IOA-led Ad Hoc Committee and then by Hockey India has been appalling. The dismal record of 2009 speaks to this. India has tumbled to the 12th place in world rankings, the lowest ever, and missed for the first time a podium finish at the Asia Cup. Indian hockey needs to be liberated from unelected power brokers. A command structure that is competent, democratic, and transparent in its functioning and gives primacy to the raising of standards and the welfare of players must be formed in the elections scheduled for February 7. The FIH and the Sports Ministry hold the key to this.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Crisis-of-Indian-hockey/article16837320.ece
12,1,2010,The life of cities,"Cities, which already host half the world’s population, are predicted to absorb nearly all of the growth of population over the next three decades. The concentration of humanity in relatively small spaces brings with it enormous environmental challenges, particularly in the low-income and middle-income countries. Among many factors that influence the quality of the urban environment, biodiversity is arguably the least appreciated. It is welcome, therefore, that the key role played by biodiversity in providing a host of ecosystem services to people is being emphasised during 2010, declared as the International Year of Biodiversity by the United Nations General Assembly. In the cities, green areas reduce pollution and improve the quality of air; wetlands break down waste and recycle it; and parks and woodlands with their colourful flora and fauna help city-dwellers connect with nature in their backyard. City governments must reflect on the ways in which the negative impact of urbanisation on biodiversity can be minimised, and biodiversity enhanced. As conurbations and megacities grow, nature-provided commons such as air, water, and green areas need to be zealously protected. Cities occupy less than three per cent of the world’s land surface and their activities can be regulated. On the other hand, the number of cities with a population of over a million is increasing rapidly, leaving a disproportionately large ecological footprint on natural resources extracted from elsewhere.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-life-of-cities/article16837102.ece
12,1,2010,Showcasing the auto industry,"The Delhi auto expo has showcased India’s growing stature in the automobile industry, especially in the small car segment. The signs of growth have been clearly visible for quite some time. A year ago, the Tatas launched the Nano at the same venue in a brilliant display of value engineering and commitment to a time schedule to produce a car at below Rs.1 lakh ($2500). The Delhi fair, which attracted leading automakers globally, seems set to equal such as those held in Frankfurt, Geneva, and Tokyo. Ten new models, including three for the first time in the world, were launched. There are at least two factors that have helped India become an attractive destination for the auto industry worldwide. The first is the growing size of the domestic market. Though the first modern passenger car, Maruti 800, came in the mid-1980s, the country had to wait for another decade and a half before it could truly enter the modern automobile age. Since the early 1990s, the world’s leading automakers like Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Toyota and Honda, apart from several others, set up manufacturing bases here. The domestic passenger car market has grown rapidly, recording a 250 per cent increase over the past decade. Significantly, exports are also rising — around 13 per cent of the domestic production is sold abroad.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Showcasing-the-auto-industry/article16837103.ece
13,1,2010,Seizing the moment,"For most of the past four decades, India and Bangladesh have been distant neighbours, separated by distrust and suspicion despite their visceral connections of geography and ecology, language and culture, economics and politics. There have been periods of acute stasis and also moments of hope, when a basic transformation in the relationship seemed possible. But never before has the overall situation been quite as propitious as it is now. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is in his second tenure as the head of the United Progressive Alliance government and the position of India as a growth pillar in South Asia and the world means the logic of regional integration is more compelling than ever before. In Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina Wajed is once again Prime Minister, this time with a majority so convincing that she need not keep looking over her shoulder to second guess what the Bangladesh National Party of Khaleda Zia might say or do in response to the improvement in bilateral ties with India. Notwithstanding the benign domestic political situation the Congress and the Awami League find themselves in, the governments have a two-year window to bring about a fundamental shift in the structure and content of the bilateral relationship before electoral compulsions kick in once again. And judging by the success of Sheikh Hasina’s recent visit to Delhi, a fine start has been made.
India has promised a $1 billion line of credit to Bangladesh and a pruning of the negative list of Bangladeshi products that are denied preferential access to Indian markets. It has also agreed to push for better border connectivity so that bilateral trade can increase, and Teesta water sharing has been flagged for discussion. On its part, Bangladesh has dropped its opposition to granting India transit rights. The Agartala-Akhaura rail link will now be developed, creating the potential for railway freight to be sent from Kolkata to Tripura and thence to the rest of the North-East via Bangladesh. On the security front, Dhaka demonstrated its willingness to accommodate Indian concerns by facilitating the handover of ULFA leader Paresh Barua. All this suggests that both countries are serious about opening a new chapter. But one ought not to minimise the challenges that lie ahead. One test will be whether India is prepared to allow Bangladeshi garment manufacturers preferential market access. Another will be its willingness to craft agreements on the equitable sharing of all river waters. As the bigger economy, India needs to go the extra mile in giving a boost to its neighbour’s economic potential, especially considering that Sheikh Hasina has moved so far in addressing longstanding Indian requests on transit.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Seizing-the-moment/article16837518.ece
13,1,2010,On a strong wicket,"The rupee touched a 16-month high of Rs.45.34 against the dollar on Monday, January 10. The trend of rupee appreciation that began in March-April 2009 has accelerated in the new year. The rupee gained almost three per cent in less than 10 working days. In the middle of the previous week, the rupee breached the Rs.46 mark. The Indian currency’s strong showing is in line with the strengths exhibited by most Asian currencies recently. Between December 31 and January 6, the Korean won moved up from 1164.000 to 1136 in relation to the dollar, and the dollar also lost ground against the Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht. The yen moved up rather sharply from 93.02 to 92.20. In a broad sense, the strength of the Asian currencies is attributable to the relatively robust turnaround of their economies in the post-recession period. In contrast, the recovery in the United States has been tepid as well as uneven. The currency markets saw a mild rally in dollar when reasonably positive employment data emerged during the first week of December. However, the unexpectedly large unemployment figures released at the end of the month accentuated the depreciation of the dollar. It is no surprise that economic news from the U.S. continue to have such a major influence on other currencies even after the global crisis. All talk of replacing the dollar as the world’s reserve currency has proved to be premature and the American currency retains it pre-eminent position in international trade and currency dealing rooms.
In India, the recent gains by the rupee are attributed to a spurt in foreign institutional investment (FII). During 2009, FII flows were estimated at around $17.5 billion. The volume, below the peak in 2007, is high enough to signal a revival of interest in India. There is every likelihood that these flows will swell or at least be sustained as long as returns from India are seen to be higher than in the developed world. A recent statement by the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman ruling out monetary tightening for now is positive news for stock markets: cheap dollar funds will continue to be available for investment abroad. The Reserve Bank of India has not intervened so far probably because a continuous mop up of dollars will mean a large accretion to reserves. Also, domestic liquidity that is already high will increase manifold, fuelling inflation expectations. The strong rupee hurts exports, now recovering after a long period of decline. The forthcoming monetary policy statement will make clear how the balance is to be struck among the conflicting objectives.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/On-a-strong-wicket/article16837517.ece
15,1,2010,Haiti devastated,"Haiti, a small, impoverished Caribbean nation, is slowly coming to terms with the calamitous earthquake of January 12, which measured 7.0 on the Richter scale and was followed by several powerful aftershocks. The toll on human life is estimated at 45,000-50,000 by the Red Cross. With reports of hundreds of bodies piled high outside mortuaries and hospitals, and survivors sleeping among the dead for a fourth successive night, rescue efforts face a big challenge. Most heart-rending is the plight of children, who comprise over 40 per cent of the population of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Haitian President René Préval described the loss of life and the near-total infrastructural damage as “unimaginable,” adding that parliament, the national palace, the tax office, schools, hospitals, and the main prison had collapsed. The damage was heightened by the fact that the quake struck the densely populated area around the capital, comprising nearly three million people in rudimentary slum dwellings that entirely lacked earthquake-resistant construction.
The response of the international community to the terrible humanitarian crisis has been empathetic: the United States has promised $100m, 3,500 troops, and 2,200 marines to help with relief efforts; Britain has pledged £6.15m; France, Spain, and China have joined the effort, sending funds, supplies, and manpower. India must do its part, coming up with a generous assistance package. Yet there are severe problems in reaching aid to the people. While relief efforts are focussed on the immediate tasks of rescuing trapped survivors and providing them with the basics, the post-disaster agenda in the months ahead will be about helping them piece together their shattered lives. The recovery plan must also address the larger challenge of institution-building in one of the most misgoverned and politically volatile nations in the western hemisphere. External, especially U.S., involvement must not exacerbate instability in the coup-laden, dictatorship-prone politics of Haiti. If this troubled nation is to cope better with natural disasters — an imperative given its proximity to the Pacific Ring of Fire -- democracy and responsive governance must take root. Only then will it be possible to lift Haitians out of crippling poverty and rebuild the country’s wrecked infrastructure. In particular, it is vital that future housing construction is in line with best practice in earthquake-proofing -- for example using the lessons on retrofitting structures that came out of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake -- and Haiti’s institutional capacity for disaster response is upgraded.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Haiti-devastated/article16837732.ece
15,1,2010,Inclusive heritage cities,"There is a lesson or two for Indian cities in the United Nations Development Programme’s initiative to conserve the Rimac neighbourhood, a World Heritage site, of Lima in Peru. This is perhaps the first time a conservation project is attempting to improve, in a major way, the “precarious conditions” of the poor who inhabit a historical area. Continuous neglect has turned the two-century-old core of Lima, known as the ‘City of Kings,’ into a blighted area. The challenge was to preserve the historical character without displacing the poor migrant residents. Consistent pro-poor efforts have paid off and legislation was recently adopted to confer property rights on the residents of Rimac. This UNDP initiative has the potential to change entrenched opinion that views heritage as an elite preserve and approaches conservation as a way of gentrifying a place. Conservation is problematic when the sole and obsessive concern is to keep the buildings in museum conditions and ‘beautify’ the area. It turns worse when the poor are either directly evicted or the value of the site is so enhanced that the rentals and property prices increase manifold, forcing the residents to leave. Rimac, which demonstrates that conservation can be made inclusive, is a worthy development alternative.
Much like Rimac, old cities in India suffer from crumbling infrastructure, poor housing conditions, and inadequate investment. Delhi’s Shahjahanabad, the ‘Walled City,’ is a case in point. Most parts of this once-celebrated Mughal city are now notified slums and about 570,000 (2001) people live in appalling conditions. The focus must be on improving the living conditions of the inhabitants and helping them make the place their own. As efforts at places such as Rimac and Luang Prabang (in Laos) show, this can be achieved by conferring property rights on long-term poor residents, providing targeted credit with affordable interest rates, and extending free technical services to restore houses. Where needed, limited modification of structures can be permitted to accommodate small commercial enterprises, since heritage areas cannot be isolated from employment-generating activities and opportunities to improve income levels. Ferrare in Italy, which has about 140,000 inhabitants and 100,000 bicycles, demonstrates that a conscious attempt to develop non-motorised transport infrastructure within historical cores can be successful. When such measures are supported by an equitable transport policy, the connectivity with the rest of the city improves and heritage cities become better places to live in.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Inclusive-heritage-cities/article16837731.ece
17,1,2010,Maintaining the momentum,"The index of industrial production (IIP) figures released last week point to a continuing growth momentum. During November 2009, the annual IIP growth rate touched 11.7 per cent. The mining and manufacturing sectors grew at 10 per cent and 12.7 per cent respectively. The cumulative growth for the eight months from April to November stands at 7.6 per cent over the previous year. The numbers clearly show that the recovery is broad-based, a point more tellingly corroborated by the performance of specific industries. As many as 14 out of the 17 groups have shown positive growth in November, with “transport equipment and parts” registering a phenomenal 38.3 per cent.
These statistics also find support in anecdotal evidence. For instance, in passenger cars and two- and three-wheelers, India has become a significant player, which is reflected in the high growth recorded under ‘transport equipment.’ The turnaround in exports after a long period of decline should augur well for manufacturing. From a “use-based” standpoint, it is obvious that consumer spending on durables and non-durables is on the rise. With just over a month to go before the union budget, and less than two weeks before the usual review of the monetary policy, attention has turned on a strategy for exiting from the stimulus packages and on the question whether there will be any monetary tightening. The government and the Reserve Bank of India would do well to take the cue from countries that have been cautious about withdrawing the stimulus before the return to a robust growth path is clearly established.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Maintaining-the-momentum/article16838113.ece
18,1,2010,A great life (1914-2010),"Diminutive Jyoti Basu, who outlived most of his contemporaries, was a man of immense political stature, one of India’s most illustrious leaders and statesmen of the past century. His charisma was undisputed and at the mass level, he was certainly the best-known face of communism across the land — transcending the regional limitations of the Left’s base and influence. Reputed for his integrity and straightforwardness, for his clear-sightedness and work ethic, and for his decisiveness in governance, he was a master of civilised — if, at the core, uncompromising — discourse. He was respected and listened to across the political and ideological spectrum on key policy matters, national and international. Mr. Basu’s record as independent India’s longest-serving Chief Minister (June 1977-November 2000), who led the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Left Front to the first five of its seven successive Assembly election triumphs, is unlikely to be bettered for a long time to come. The highlights of his legacy as Chief Minister are land reforms, which benefitted millions of sharecroppers and other peasants and helped consolidate a rural class base that proved quite unbeatable over three decades; the democratisation of panchayati raj institutions; the establishment of the Haldia petro-chemical complex; the creation of an atmosphere of communal harmony and secularism across a large State; and political stability of a new kind. There were significant under-achievements in the fields of education and public health and in terms of industrial development. But Mr. Basu was not one to cover up deficiencies or shortcomings and in the last decade of his life, he spoke candidly about what might have been achieved during his 23 years at the helm — had there been the necessary understanding backed by a concentrated effort.
The foundations for Mr. Basu’s distinction were laid much before he became one of the country’s most important Chief Ministers. An educated and sophisticated man, trained in Britain to be a barrister, he joined the Communist Party when it was illegalised, worked in the trade union movement and in mass organisations, faced state repression, and was schooled in tough struggle before emerging as one of the top leaders of the Communist movement — and after the split, as one of the founding members of the CPI(M)’s nine-member Polit Bureau. A byword for courage and steadfastness, he was also famous for his cool; he brushed off assassination attempts, which brought about no noticeable change in his style of mass politics. Some CPI(M) leaders — most importantly, E.M.S. Namboodiripad, B.T. Ranadive, and M. Basavapunniah — distinguished themselves as exponents and developers of Marxist theory. Some others — most importantly, P. Sundarayya, Promode Dasgupta, and Harkishan Singh Surjeet — contributed specially to party-building and organisational affairs. Mr. Basu’s great strength was in another domain — where theory, vision, polemic, and the ideological characteristics and organisational resources of a revolutionary movement encountered the challenge of working with the masses and winning them over. His genius lay in this immensely difficult interface, where many an ideal, many a leader, and many a political ambition has failed to achieve notable success. CPI(M) general-secretary Prakash Karat was certainly not being hyperbolic when, in his tribute, he singled out Mr. Basu for teaching Communists “how to work and serve the people in parliamentary forums in order to bring about changes in public policy” and declared “there will be none like Jyoti Basu again.” It is indeed the end of a heroic era and The Hindu shares the nation’s grief over this great loss.
Clarification
The Editorial, ""A great life (1914-2010)"" while explaining how Jyoti Basu confronted the challenge of working with the masses and winning them over, mentioned, besides Basu, the names of six of the nine members of the first Polit Bureau of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The names of two members of the Polit Bureau - P. Ramamurti and A.K. Gopalan (AKG) - were left out.
Ramamurti's contribution was largely in building up a strong trade union movement. He was the first general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU). As Member of Parliament, he played a significant role in enacting several labour-related laws.
Freedom fighter and Marxist, AKG, worked in both peasants' and industrial workers' organisations. He also played an active role in Dalit uplift. He led the party in Lok Sabha for over two decades. He headed a march of the unemployed from Cannanore (now Kannur, in Kerala) to Madras (now Chennai).",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-great-life-1914-2010/article16838890.ece
19,1,2010,The truth about Mumbai matters,"For over a year, the bodies of nine men have been lying in a mortuary next to Mumbai’s Sir Jamshetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital — just a short walk from the buildings and streets where they killed 166 women, men, and children on November 26, 2008. The bodies are a ghoulish reminder that the whole truth about who was responsible for the horrors of that night is still elusive. Pakistani investigators, dossiers they submitted to India make clear, have been unable to establish the identity of the men who controlled the assault team, using satellite phones and voice-over-internet protocol connections — one of whom, an investigation by this newspaper revealed last week, was probably an Indian. Key suspects, including Lashkar-e-Taiba commanders Sajid Mir and Muzammil Bhat, are still at large. We do not know who selected the facilities to be attacked, although evidence gathered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation suggests the targets were identified well before Pakistani-American jihadist David Headley was despatched to garner the videotape to familiarise the members of the assault-team with their targets. We do not know why the attack was delayed beyond September 2008, when the Central Intelligence Agency first passed on warnings to India of an imminent attack. We do not even know the names of seven of the nine men whose bodies lie in the morgue.
There are many reasons why we must have answers to these questions. Justice for the victims, of course, is the first reason. But there is also a larger issue. India-Pakistan dialogue ought not to be held hostage to the fate of the Mumbai investigation, yet unless New Delhi is persuaded that Islamabad is serious about acting against terrorist groups targeting India from its soil, the odds are that any dialogue will be scarred by suspicion. Further, the process is likely to be undermined by future terrorist attacks. Pakistani investigators have had in their custody for a year three men they say played a key role in planning the attacks — Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, his deputy Mazhar Iqbal, and electronics expert Abdul Wajid. Yet they do not seem to have discovered that Headley had carried out reconnaissance in Mumbai and was in the process of planning further strikes in New Delhi and Pune. Investigations by journalists suggest that Lashkar camps are up and running in Pakistan. All this has fuelled suspicion that such jihadist groups enjoy the support not just of rogue elements in the state, but of the institution of Pakistan’s armed forces. India must do all it can to initiate meaningful dialogue and thus strengthen democratic forces in Pakistan. But any peace process will rest on sand unless Pakistan finds the will and the resolve to act against the enemies of peace operating from its soil.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-truth-about-Mumbai-matters/article16838191.ece
19,1,2010,There goes the sun!,"Over millennia, humans have woven myths, legends, and superstitions around solar eclipses. But this phenomenon occurs only because the moon is just the right size and far enough from earth to block out the sun when all three bodies are appropriately aligned. All solar eclipses are, however, not the same. Since the moon’s orbit is elliptical, not circular, its distance from earth varies, apparently changing its size in the sky. So while people in northern India witnessed a total solar eclipse in July 2009, this time it was an annular eclipse. The moon did not cover the entire disc of the sun and it did not get as dark as during a total solar eclipse. In India, the eclipse could be seen by people in the southern parts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. An annular eclipse was last seen from this country in November 1965. If the plane of the moon’s orbit were not slightly tilted, solar eclipses would be occurring at every new moon. There are, in fact, between two and five solar eclipses in any given year but these are visible from different parts of the globe.
But that was not good enough for scientists. In 1715, the British astronomer Edmond Halley published the first prediction of the path of a total eclipse. Since then, scientists have been travelling to the far corners of the world, telescopes and other equipment in tow, to take advantage of the natural phenomenon. Their work has resulted in some major advances. In August 1868, the French astronomer Pierre Jules Cesar Janssen camped in tobacco fields in Guntur in coastal Andhra Pradesh to make his observations. His work led to the discovery of an entirely new element, helium, which derives its name from the Greek word for the sun. Data from a 1919 eclipse validated a prediction of Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity that the sun would bend the light from stars. A total solar eclipse remains a major opportunity for studying the sun’s corona, its outer atmosphere that is ordinarily not visible. Such investigations are not possible during an annular eclipse. The Indian Space Research Organisation is, however, using sounding rockets fired from Thumba near Thiruvananthapuram and Sriharikota as well as balloons and ground-based equipment to look at changes that could occur high up in the atmosphere during the eclipse. Most important of all, the eclipse is a rare opportunity for millions of people to behold a grand spectacle and learn some science in the process.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/There-goes-the-sun/article16838192.ece
20,1,2010,The Afghan quandary,"Monday’s brazen attack by the Taliban in the heart of Kabul and the manner in which they were repulsed underline two contradictory aspects of the present state of affairs in Afghanistan. First, Islamist extremists maintain the capacity to mount major operations against the Hamid Karzai government not just in outlying areas of the country but in the capital city too. Second, the Afghan security forces are more than capable of defending themselves against the Taliban provided they have the necessary training, equipment and leadership. While supporting the U.S.-led military intervention in Afghanistan, India has always held that the only force capable of stabilising the situation and maintaining peace and stability over the long haul is the Afghan National Army (ANA) and police. The Indian government is one of the largest providers of civilian assistance to Afghanistan and is also involved in training the Afghan police. A limited number of ANA officers have come to India for training but the United States has baulked at New Delhi doing more with the Afghan army for fear of inviting a Pakistani backlash. Yet, the U.S. and its allies have done little so far to bring the ANA up to the level required to deal with the challenge posed by the Taliban, and the bulk of combat operations is left to the western coalition.
In the run-up to next week’s Afghanistan conference in London, there has been a lot of discussion on what the beleaguered nation’s neighbours can do to help. A few days ago, the foreign ministers of Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan met to try and forge a common position. India, too, has been in consultation with all players, including the U.S., whose AfPak envoy, Richard Holbrooke, met with External Affairs minister S.M. Krishna on Monday. Barring Pakistan, virtually everyone believes Islamabad’s twin-track policy towards terrorism is at least partly to blame for the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan. The U.S. is acutely aware of the subterranean links of the Pakistani military with the Afghan Taliban, the Hizb-e-Islami and the Haqqani network but seems unwilling to do anything about this. To the extent to which Islamabad is motivated by strategic competition with India over Afghanistan, the Indian leadership should make it clear that it seeks nothing but peace and tranquillity across the Durand Line. India’s interests are three-fold: trade, transit, and security. Afghan territory should never again become a safe haven for anti-India elements. None of these concerns is incompatible with Pakistan’s legitimate interests, which India recognises. In London, the international community should tell Pakistan to stop looking at Afghanistan as a zero-sum game with India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-Afghan-quandary/article16838422.ece
20,1,2010,Oldest four-legged animals,"Our understanding of when fishes evolved into tetrapods — animals with a backbone and four limbs — and began to walk on land needs radical revision. A study published recently in the journal Nature provides convincing evidence that the first vertebrates started walking nearly 385 million years ago — about 18 million years earlier than previously thought. There is already sufficient evidence that land vertebrates evolved from fish when the fins first became lobe-shaped without digits. Fishes with lobe-fins are considered transitional forms that gradually developed into vertebrates with limbs. The latest discovery — footprints of unknown creatures that were as long as 2.5 metres — from rocks in a disused quarry in southeast Poland confirms the fish-tetrapod transition theory. The footprint tracks resemble the early tetrapod fossils.
The discovery has resulted in two major scientific reassessments of the transition. First, the age of the footprint tracks is ten million years earlier than the oldest known transitional fishes called elpistostegalians (such as tiktaalik roseae). This would mean that transitional fish forms and those with limbs coexisted for a certain period of time. The discovery highlights the fact that elpistostegalians were neither the early transitional forms of fish-vertebrates nor a short-lived ‘transitional grade’ between fish and tetrapods. They were at best “late-surviving relics rather than direct transitional forms,” to quote the editorial summary in Nature. Secondly, the discovery builds a strong case for reassessing the environmental setting of the transition. The impression that the transition took place in seasonally flooded environments of rivers is no longer valid. The footmark tracks studied in Poland are from rocks formed in a marine environment — a tidal flat environment and/or a lagoon. According to the authors of the study published in Nature, an intertidal environment would have provided a ready food source twice a day. Although no body fossils of the tetrapods are seen in the quarry rocks, the discovery suggests that any further search for body fossils should be in such marine environments; footprint tracks in the absence of body fossils are difficult to interpret with full confidence. The footprint tracks highlight the fact that fossils recording the early stages of vertebrate evolution (predating both the elpistostegids and those seen in Poland) are missing. The study cautions that “the timing of the fish-tetrapod transition is best regarded as uncertain.” The evolutionary tree of early tetrapods will be sketchy as long as this gap remains unfilled.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Oldest-four-legged-animals/article16838421.ece
21,1,2010,A step in the right direction,"At last, the Union Human Resource Ministry has decided to act against the Deemed-to-be-Universities (DUs) that have not met the prescribed standards and norms. It has informed the Supreme Court that 44 DUs stand to lose the status in the light of the findings of the committee headed by P.N. Tandon that went into the functioning of the 126 DUs across the country. They were found to suffer from serious deficiencies and aberrations, with many of them being run as family enterprises. In the case of another 44 DUs, which do not face imminent de-recognition, notices will be issued requiring them to rectify the defects perceived in their organisation, infrastructure, or management. Tamil Nadu has the dubious distinction of hosting as many as 16 of the DUs to be divested of the recognition. Many of the delinquent institutions started, initially, as medical or engineering colleges and then launched arts and science colleges to boost their overall student strength and ultimately get the ‘university’ tag of the ‘deemed’ variety. Flawed, if not dubious, management practices and admission of students beyond the limit determined by the norms seem to be the two major factors that invited de-recognition.
HRD Minister Kapil Sibal has held out the assurance that the two lakh students in these DUs will not be adversely affected and they will be able to get their degrees. The Ministry has said these institutions will be re-affiliated to their respective universities. It is for the government to ensure that the transition process is swift and smooth. Ever since Mr. Sibal took over, there have been serious moves to stem the rot in the higher education sector. Over the past decade, there had been a proliferation of deemed universities, mostly in the southern States, thanks to the clamour for the DU tag that gave managements a great deal of functional autonomy. These DUs even succeeded in persuading the government and the University Grants Commission to let them drop the appellation ‘deemed’ and call themselves ‘universities’. Now, the report of the Tandon committee and the United Progressive Government’s favourable response to it hold the promise of a salutary change in the situation. The HRD Ministry needs to go far beyond the de-recognition move and bring about systemic changes in professional education. For instance, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) is crying for an overhaul in its functioning, especially in the sanctioning procedures and norms applicable for engineering colleges. On the medical education front, there is a strong and urgent case for expansion so as to keep pace with health care needs of the community.

21,1,2010,Readying for the Games,"The frenetic pace of construction activity towards meeting the October 3 deadline for the Commonwealth Games has left Delhi looking like a battlefield. Delhiites have coped, mostly uncomplainingly, with the rubble, dust, trenches, and traffic snarls in the hope that less than nine months from now, they would be residents of a world-class city that Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit keeps promising. At the same time, there is a constant query from the public and the media: will Delhi be ready? Those unaware of the workforce of thousands, toiling sometimes in three shifts a day at the height of winter in a race against time to complete the infrastructure, might be sceptical. There is no need to panic yet. Two of the main venues will be completed next month to host international competitions in shooting and hockey. All other venues, except those for athletics and swimming, should be ready by March 31, according to projections. The concerns expressed by the Games Co-ordination Commission over delays in the completion of the athletics and swimming stadiums are, however, genuine. They demand urgent attention from the authorities.
In recent weeks, apprehensions have been expressed in Australia and England over the security risks — with some anonymous senior Whitehall officials quoted as saying there was “virtually no chance” of an England team coming to the Delhi Games in October. Mike Fennell, president of the Commonwealth Games Federation, has rightly taken a dim view of this. In an interview to The Times, he has warned England that there could be repercussions for the London Olympics if it stayed away from the Delhi Games. “A country that wants to host an event,” he has pointed out, “should think how other people will then view the security risks in their own country. The fact is there is always a security risk. Everybody has to make their own decisions but if you don’t go [to Delhi] I suggest you don’t travel anywhere in the world.” Financing the Games remains a major challenge. The Organising Committee has been slow off the blocks with its merchandising plans; as against a target of Rs.1,700 crore needed to pay back the government ‘loan’ of Rs.1,620 crore, it has so far managed to mobilise only about Rs.500 crore in sponsorship deals and television rights. The Committee has also had to work overtime on the technology and operations front. Plans to tackle the notorious Delhi traffic need to be put to test urgently. Finally, although multi-discipline Games are not supposed to be dependent on a few superstars for their success, there will be disappointment if several top-ranked athletes, including Usain Bolt, do not turn up.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Readying-for-the-Games/article16838666.ece
22,1,2010,A humiliating non-auction,"Celebrity-owners of the Indian Premier League cricket franchises have brought glamour and drama to the player auctions of the last two years. But this year's bidding for cricketers had an added element of farce: not even one of the 11 players from Pakistan, the current world champion in the Twenty20 format, was bought by any of the eight franchises. While rookie cricketers were bought for staggering sums, world class players such as Shahid Afridi and Umar Gul, who have shone in the T20 version of the game, found no takers. In the absence of encouraging signals from the Indian government or the Board of Control for Cricket in India, the owners of the franchises were not convinced that the Pakistani players would be able to get the necessary clearances. However, the government now says that apprehensions over the issue of visas were ""completely misplaced,"" and points out that visas were issued at short notice to 17 Pakistani cricketers in December-January for the IPL 2010 auction. There were of course heightened security concerns, amid fears that right-wing elements such as the Shiv Sena might disrupt matches involving Pakistani players in Mumbai. In any case, the team-owners were risk-averse and took the lazy way out.
Understandably, the snubbed players and the Pakistan Cricket Board have taken offence at the mishandling of the auction. Under IPL rules, at least one franchise will have to show interest in a particular cricketer for him to be included in the auction. So what changed between January 6, when the final list of Pakistani cricketers was cleared, and January 19, the day of the auction? If doubts over the availability of the 11 players in the context of visa- and security-related uncertainties were the reasons for this strange situation, the proper course would have been to exclude them from the bidding pool and honestly state the non-cricketing reasons for such exclusion. Instead, those running the IPL and the owners managed to humiliate the Pakistani cricketers, some of whom had played an important part in the success of IPL-I. Such is the unpleasantness created by this non-auction that Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik saw in it an indication that India was ""not serious about the peace process"" while Sports Minister Ijaz Jakhrani spoke of hurt Pakistani pride and giving a fitting reply to India. These may be exaggerated emotional reactions but there is no denying that sport, within its limitations, can serve as an effective way of promoting people-to-people contacts in problematical circumstances. Now that the damage has been done, the BCCI as well as the government authorities must do their best to see that the fall-out from this unedifying episode is contained within IPL-III.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-humiliating-non-auction/article16838872.ece
22,1,2010,Obama in trouble,"A year on from the cold winter day when Barack Obama was sworn in as President of the United States, he must be wondering where it all went wrong. On Tuesday, his party suffered a serious setback in a Senate seat election in Massachusetts, a defeat that might scuttle his defining project of reforming the healthcare system. A relatively unknown Republican state legislator, Scott Brown, defeated the Democratic candidate, state attorney-general Martha Coakley, to snatch the seat occupied by Edward Kennedy for nearly half a century until his death in August 2009. This loss puts an end to the 60-seat majority the Democrats enjoyed in the Senate, essential for avoiding filibusters by the Republican opposition. Healthcare reform is particularly vulnerable because Congress is poised to reconcile two versions of the reform bill, awash with differences, of the House and the Senate. The Massachusetts defeat puts tremendous pressure on Democrats to either get the House to accept the Senate version as it stands, thereby avoiding further debate in the Senate, or get the Senate to create a budget reconciliation bill based on the House's amendments, which could then be passed with a simple majority. In either case, there is likely to be intensified intra-party wrangling - the very style of politics that Candidate Obama made such a show of eschewing.
The loss in Massachusetts mainly reflects President Obama's declining approval ratings, which have already come down to 50 per cent. Mr. Obama now admits that ""we lost some of that sense of speaking directly to the American people."" If so, he must spend his second year in office doing two things. First, instead of temporising and constantly seeking the middle ground on issues of great import, he must be venturesome and battle it out. He must learn to act in the spirit and style of a great helmsman-in-crisis, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, on issues of vital concern to ordinary people - unemployment, healthcare, recovery from a demoralising economic crisis, and of course counter-terrorism. With a lot of hard work and some luck, there should be some positive results to show in the Congressional elections of November 2010. Secondly, Mr. Obama must, reprising his inspired presidential campaign, reach out to ordinary Americans, square with them on whatever his game plan is and the obstacles to realising it, infuse in them hope - and give them real reasons for believing that this is not going to end up as a one-term presidency.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Obama-in-trouble/article16838873.ece
23,1,2010,Lessons from the YSR crash,"The weather was bad, visibility was poor; there was a technical snag in the helicopter; and the attention of the pilots was distracted for six vital minutes as they searched for correctives in the Flight Manual. The official investigation into the crash of the Bell-430 helicopter flying Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy in September 2009 has stuck the blame on some of the typical reasons that have made helicopter flying in this country extremely risky. The pilot had not gone through the mandatory recurrent simulator training due three months earlier, the State government did not have adequate manpower to maintain the helicopter, and most crucially the helicopter was flying in weather that was hardly appropriate. It had been cleared for Visual Flight Rules, which means the weather must be clear enough for the pilot to see where he is going; yet the weather at the time was bad enough to warrant flying only by instrument. The craft was simply not equipped for that. The question that still needs an answer is why the pilots took off (or were asked to take off) even when they knew the weather en route was adverse. The report has not thrown enough light on this aspect of the tragedy.
There have been 54 helicopter crashes in India since 1990, a depressingly high casualty rate given that there are just about 250 of them flying today. The politician and the industry tycoon need to risk such rides because they get him or her quickly to places that do not have airports for fixed wing aircraft to land. Helicopters can set down even in a small clearing with the minimum facilities. Yet it is precisely these advantages that turn lethal for their safety. There being no instruments at these often makeshift helipads, precise local weather data are seldom available to the pilots as they land; often there is also no monitoring by or guidance from an air traffic controller sitting at a nearby airport; and when they land there may be no engineering facilities at all. The human factor is not to be taken lightly: pilot errors have been blamed by accident investigators for more than half the number of crashes. At the heart of this issue is the inadequacy of training facilities - there is no full-fledged simulator in the country to train helicopter pilots as there are for fixed-wing aircraft - and of mechanisms to monitor the proficiency of pilots at regular points in their career or the safety record of the companies operating the helicopters. These are all shortcomings that have been pointed out time and again; correctives are known, yet not put in place. Rajasekhara Reddy was not the first VIP to perish in a helicopter crash; he will not be the last either given the abysmal safety record of helicopters, and the continued inability of the industry and the government to improve it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Lessons-from-the-YSR-crash/article16839069.ece
23,1,2010,Tough choices,"In its forthcoming review of the annual monetary and credit policy, the Reserve Bank of India will once again try to balance the often conflicting objectives of accelerating growth and reining in inflation. That traditional policy dilemma has become particularly acute today. To a large extent, the RBI’s quandary mirrors the current public debate on exit packages. Both the government and the RBI have indicated their preference for exiting from the stimulus packages but they are yet to spell out the time, nature, and extent of withdrawal. An exit strategy for the RBI would involve a reversal of its “super accommodative” stance that was formulated at the height of the global financial crisis in September 2008. Besides other measures, it pumped in a record Rs.6,00,000 crore of liquidity in a short span of time through reductions in reserve requirements and refinance facilities. The benchmark short-term repo and reverse repo rates were lowered by as much as 4.5 per cent. Like the other central banks, the RBI too resorted to unconventional measures such as quantitative easing for shoring up liquidity to forestall what appeared to be a major global recession. That threat has since receded.
However, as in many other countries, inflation has resurfaced in India, partly due to the surfeit of liquidity in the system. The Wholesale Price Index for December at 7.31 per cent exceeded the RBI’s target for the whole year. More worrying is the stubbornly high food inflation. The RBI and the government seem to be of the view that monetary policy measures will have little effect in a situation where increased food prices are brought about predominantly by supply side factors. However, the high prices of food and other essential articles will reinforce inflationary expectations. Economic growth in the country has picked up momentum and there is a distinct probability of the growth rate climbing to 8 per cent next year. While growth at this level suggests an interest rate hike, a number of other factors point to the maintenance of the status quo. For instance, the credit off-take has been low despite the benign interest rate environment. It is quite likely that the RBI will mop up liquidity through a hike in reserve requirements, leaving the interest rates unchanged. The RBI has already signalled a retreat from its easy monetary policy. An immediate monetary tightening, though directed at inflation, will mark the beginning of the retreat.
A sentence in the first paragraph of “Tough choices” was “The benchmark short-term repo and reverse repo rates were lowered by as much as 4.5 per cent.” Current repo and reverse repo rates are 4.75 per cent and 3.25 per cent respectively.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Tough-choices/article16839966.ece
25,1,2010,The NSA needs his own office,"If the appointment of Shiv Shankar Menon as India’s new National Security Adviser is major news, this is as much because of the impressive qualities the new incumbent brings to the job as the manner in which the scope and ambit of the office expanded under M.K. Narayanan. Some of that expansion was not always useful or advisable and has since been reversed. This is particularly true of the handling of counter-terrorism and intelligence at the tactical level, which will now be handled by the Ministry of Home Affairs’ proposed National Centre for Counter Terrorism with a full-time director. But P. Chidamabaram’s reputation as an efficient Home Minister has prompted calls for a further paring down of the NSA’s mandate. The fact that the NSA has multiple functions — diplomatic adviser to the Prime Minister, de facto overseer of the country’s nuclear weapons programme, and catalyst for long-term threat assessment and national security planning — has led some to argue these roles need not be played by a single person. Some have even begun to question the constitutionality of an executive, ‘unaccountable’ NSA in a parliamentary system. The last objection is misplaced because the NSA derives his existence and authority directly from the Prime Minister, to whom he is accountable and who, in turn, is fully accountable to Parliament. But the calls for trifurcation of the NSA’s role also have no merit.
As India’s engagement with the outside world grows steadily more complex, the government’s ability to manage present and future security problems is contingent on an institutional structure that can pull things together in space and time. The NSA’s role is to facilitate spatial coordination between ministries and departments on national security matters and also get the system to anticipate and prepare for the next set of strategic challenges. With so much of modern diplomacy conducted at the summit level, the NSA, as the principal staff officer of the Prime Minister tasked with overseeing India’s national security, is indispensable as an empowered interlocutor with foreign powers. As for the NSA’s role in the Nuclear Command Authority, it is unreasonable and perhaps even dangerous to suggest, as some have done, that a military officer should chair the Executive Council because ‘only the Army’ understands nuclear matters. India’s strategic assets are under civilian control and the NSA helps the Prime Minister exercise that control. It is clear that the national security structure in India needs revamping. The biggest weakness is the lack of an organic link between the NSA and the National Security Council Secretariat. The absence of a well-staffed ‘back office’ has hampered the functioning of the NSA and undermined the prospects for the kind of long-term strategic planning India needs. The NSA urgently needs to be provided with instruments that allow him to exercise his true mandate.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-NSA-needs-his-own-office/article16839432.ece
25,1,2010,Pandemic lessons to be learnt,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) is planning to review its response to H1N1 once the pandemic is over. Several European countries have accused it of exaggeration. With the world nervously watching the spread of the deadly H5N1 bird flu, which only sporadically infects humans but kills over half of those unlucky enough to catch it, the WHO significantly revised its influenza pandemic plan in 2005. Under the revised criteria, once a flu virus crossed over from animals and showed itself capable of efficient human-to-human transmission, the extent of its spread would determine the declaration of a pandemic. Catching everyone by surprise, it was a H1N1 flu virus that originated in pigs and carried a novel combination of genes that set off the current pandemic. Even after the new swine-origin virus began causing widespread outbreaks, the WHO was averse to using severity as a factor in judging the pandemic. It argued that assessing severity was complex; besides, it could vary among countries (and even within countries) and might change over time. But with the pandemic turning to be less of a killer than some virulent seasonal flu strains, people and governments are asking what the fuss was all about. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has now called for an investigation into the role of pharmaceutical companies in overplaying the dangers of H1N1.
Developed countries have spent billions to fight the pandemic and the healthcare systems of many developing countries have been severely strained. From about 29,000 people from 74 countries infected by the virus leading to 144 deaths at the time the world health body declared it a pandemic in June last year, H1N1, as on December 30, had spread to more than 200 countries. But the number of laboratory-confirmed deaths has not gone beyond 12,000. Though the actual number of infected people and deaths may be higher as the virus is widespread in the community, the fatality rate is nowhere alarming. Some developed countries have already reduced the vaccine orders or have been trying to resell their stockpiles. The WHO recently stated that the influenza has passed its peak in many countries in the northern hemisphere, including the U.S. However, the infection continues to rise in some parts of Europe, and in Asia, where the infection started later. In short, there is no warrant for either alarm or complacency.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Pandemic-lessons-to-be-learnt/article16839433.ece
26,1,2010,Strengthening Kyoto,"The joint statement issued at the conclusion of the Second Meeting of Ministers of the BASIC group countries on climate change in New Delhi is notable for the sober message it sends to the developed world and the United Nations: that progress on climate talks will depend on a reassertion of the central principle of common but differentiated responsibilities outlined by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The cohesive response of China, Brazil, South Africa, and India underscores the view of the developing world that the Copenhagen Accord chose to give insufficient importance to this central tenet. Instead, it tried to get the developing countries to accept a regime of iniquitous emissions cuts. The UNFCCC process must now correct this fundamental distortion and set future negotiations firmly on an equitable path. That road map, drawn up earlier in Bali, emphasises the importance of long-term cooperative action while affirming that economic and social development and poverty eradication are global priorities. Clearly, the development imperative needs to be centre-staged again to give the climate conference to be held in Mexico later this year a fair chance to chart the future of the Kyoto Protocol.
The Annex I countries under the Kyoto Protocol, who make up the developed bloc, must now take the lead and announce quantified emissions reductions for themselves. In parallel, they must give form to promised funding mechanisms for mitigation and adaptation. Such leadership is vital to get other high-emission countries on board, and create the $100 billion annual fund that is envisaged by 2020 to help the least developed and most vulnerable countries. It is significant that as an expression of their sincerity, the BASIC Four have affirmed their intention to submit voluntary national mitigation actions to the UNFCCC by January 31. The onus now lies on the developed world to do its part. The demand that there should be several rounds of discussions leading to the Mexico conference is wholly justified. These should be inclusive and transparent. The absence of such transparency at Copenhagen resulted in a highly visible crisis of credibility for the entire process. Early action is also needed on another front. The funds from the $10 billion pledged under the Copenhagen Accord for countries most vulnerable to climate change impact must start flowing quickly. There is yet another important and positive outcome to the common strategy adopted by the BASIC countries. It has fostered active South-South cooperation among the developing nations to advance science. Given that intellectual property rights on technology remain a major barrier to achieving higher energy efficiencies, such joint efforts involving India and China hold great promise.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Strengthening-Kyoto/article16839594.ece
26,1,2010,Russia on road to reform,"The Russian Federation’s recent endorsement of reforms to the European Court of Human Rights — the judicial arm of the 47-member Council of Europe (CoE) — signals Moscow’s deepening engagement with a system of governance based on democratic values, the rule of law, and respect for human rights. The development comes close on the heels of the Russian Constitutional Court’s extension of the decade-old moratorium on executions, and the country’s continued exclusion from other global institutions two decades after the end of the Cold War does seem incongruous. Moscow’s ratification of Protocol 14 to the Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the foundational charter of the CoE, means that states can be brought before the Strasbourg Court for failure to implement its rulings. This is indeed a bold commitment to enhancing accountability and transparency for a country that has drawn flak for its handling of the situation in Chechnya and its military intervention in Georgia. Another significant reform in the new Protocol is the improvement in the court’s powers to filter the applications and weed out repetitive cases. The issue has acquired urgency as clearance of the huge backlog, a quarter of which relates to Russia, has emerged as a formidable challenge.
Since 1998, the court has functioned full time to keep pace with the growing demands. The expansion of membership of the CoE, which has more than doubled following developments after the break-up of the Soviet Union, and the provision for individual applications to the Court also contributed to the mounting volume of petitions. Insofar as political and democratic reforms are predicated upon the stage of economic development and vice versa, Russia’s long pending bid for accession to the World Trade Organisation could boost investment and ease barriers to its exports and sustain the momentum for all-round progress. Similarly, Moscow’s application for membership of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development would deepen its commitment to greater integration into the global economy. The work at the Council of Europe is of no mean significance for countries such as India where the human rights standards formulated by it inform the internal debate on the evolution of the legal framework. To that extent, recent concerns over the dilution of the authority of the Council could have implications far beyond European borders.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Russia-on-road-to-reform/article16839593.ece
27,1,2010,Obama’s game-changing plan,"In the developed world, banks have recovered faster than the other sectors of the economy, and now face concerted regulatory action in many countries. After they were bailed out with enormous amounts of public money, it was expected that they would be more circumspect and avoid the practices that landed them and the global economy in a grave crisis. Instead, their imprudent investment banking activities have continued unabated. High investment fees boosted their profitability and made some of them declare oversized bonuses, which in turn triggered public anger against the banks. Government intervention in the financial sector has not waned even after the gradual withdrawal of the massive support that ironically contributed to the soaring profits. In all the developed countries, there is a strong public opinion in favour of reining in the banks. The United States and the United Kingdom have imposed an additional tax on bankers’ bonuses. Sweden has instituted a “stability levy” to curb risk-taking. But the plan unveiled by President Obama last week goes farther than any proposal mooted so far by other countries or in the G20 summits.
One part of the plan seeks to restrict the scope of banks’ activities. Banks that have insured deposits, and thus access to emergency funds from the Federal Reserve, would not be allowed to own or invest in private equity or hedge funds. Nor would they be allowed to engage in proprietary trading, the practice of wagering their own money in the markets. The second part of the plan seeks to restrict the size of banks through a cap on their liabilities. The aim is to prevent concentration, which has actually increased during the crisis. In the future, American taxpayers would not be held hostage by a bank that is “too big to fail.” The new plan has many features in common with the Glass-Steagall Act enacted in the aftermath of the Great Depression, but it does not envisage segregating commercial and investment banking activities into water-tight compartments. However, many of the mighty banks that transformed themselves during the crisis have to readjust by shedding proprietary trading and abandoning hedge fund activities, for instance. The plan might be difficult to enforce but that cannot be an argument for shelving or even diluting what appears to be the boldest attempt till date to bring big finance in line with the public interest. In this, there are lessons also for India, which has fortunately kept commercial banking and investment banking activities separate. It is about time that the strictly non-bank activities, such as those relating to the capital market and credit cards, are evaluated in terms of risks and returns.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Obamarsquos-game-changing-plan/article16839769.ece
27,1,2010,Cutting noise,"Noise is the permanent background score to life in bustling cities and towns. But when it exceeds a threshold, it disrupts the thought process and causes great annoyance. The World Health Organisation says it also affects health. Prolonged exposure to noise at particular levels can lead to hypertension. Other problems arising from chronic exposure include sleep disturbance, poor communication in classrooms, and hearing impairment. A decade ago, the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules 2000 issued under India’s Environment (Protection) Act 1986 promised to bring about change. Although the law is clear about the exposure limits for noise, the penalties, and the authorities responsible for enforcement, it has been unable to control the rising din. Given this background, it is difficult to imagine that the recent amendments to the rules notified by the Ministry of Environment and Forests will by themselves substantially reduce ambient noise. The amendments seek to make the rules more enforceable by bringing specific high-noise sources under their ambit. Thus horns, sound-emitting firecrackers, and sound-producing instruments may not be used in silence zones; protection from noise at night is also strengthened. State governments must now announce, in advance, the number and particulars of days on which there will be a regulated relaxation of norms for cultural or religious festive occasions.
The Environment (Protection) Act empowers the central government to plan and execute a countrywide programme for the prevention, abatement, and control of environmental pollution. Noise pollution is a good place to start. The State governments, which have enforcement authority on the ground, must act here and now. There is no justification, for example, to allow transport vehicles such as autorickshaws to tamper with silencers to generate noise for ‘visibility’ on the road. The amended rules stipulate that the noise level at the boundary of a public place should not exceed the legal noise standard by 10 dB(A) — the decibel unit — or 75 dB(A), whichever is lower. After a long era of poor voluntary compliance and enforcement, the first order priority is obviously to create greater awareness in the community on the effects of noise; vigorous enforcement can follow. Improving the motoring culture to restrict the use of horns through campaigns and strong persuasion is vital. Governments can take the lead and contribute directly to lowering of noise levels by replacing the large number of rickety transport buses that they run — and by repairing roads.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Cutting-noise/article16839905.ece
28,1,2010,Sri Lankan denouement,"Mahinda Rajapaksa’s victory in Sri Lanka’s presidential election has exceeded all expectations, including the most optimistic projections made within the President’s camp on the basis of hard-nosed pre-election opinion polls. The 17.73 percentage point margin of win is a reaffirmation of the maturity and good sense of ordinary voters who, given a choice between an experienced political leader in the saddle and an unpredictable adventurer sponsored by an unnatural combination of political irreconcilables, made it a virtual no-contest at the national level. The divergence in the voting behaviour of the Tamil minority and the Sinhala majority was as striking as it was expected; in turnout as well as choice of candidate, they behaved as polar opposites. This gives us a measure of the trust gap in the polity that needs to be bridged if Sri Lanka is to do well in future. Unfortunately, the election was also unusually bitter, with unsubstantiated allegations, personal attacks, and conspiracy theories flying thick and fast and the challenger, retired General Sarath Fonseka, introducing a paranoid note into the campaigning.
Everybody knew in advance that it was the successful ending of the 26-year-old civil war and the elimination of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam as a politico-military formation that had pre-determined the character of a presidential election brought forward by two years. Everybody also knew that Army Commander Fonseka commanded the respect of his men and had a reputation for professionalism — as long as he stayed a soldier. The problem was that, from time to time, he crossed the lines and betrayed vaingloriousness, chauvinism, foot-in-the-mouth disease symptoms, and hints of political ambition. The last thing Sri Lanka needed at this juncture was yet another South Asian variant of Bonapartism, or any more politicisation of the military that we have witnessed in recent months. Instead of waging a good political and ideological fight, the combined forces of the Opposition – the centre-right United National Party, the ultra-left Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, the minor league Sri Lanka Freedom Party (Mahajana wing), and the pro-LTTE Tamil National Alliance — showed appalling political judgment in lining up behind a candidate whose agenda for change was so vague, so empty-headed, and so self-contradictory that it made no political sense and, in fact, damaged the credibility of his sponsors. It is by no means clear that a serious UNP candidate like Ranil Wickramasinghe would have fared worse than General Fonseka, who is not even a registered voter, in a presidential contest. After this drama, politics in the island can return to a more normal state ahead of parliamentary elections, which are due in April 2010. The hope is that the campaigning will be on real issues, most importantly, a just and sustainable political solution to the Tamil question based on genuine devolution of power within a united Sri Lanka, and revitalisation and development of the war-ravaged areas of the North.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Sri-Lankan-denouement/article16839940.ece
28,1,2010,Uneven recovery,"In the most recent update of its World Economic Outlook, the IMF is distinctly more upbeat on the prospects of the global economy than at any time during the past two crisis-ridden years. Economic recovery across the globe is faster than previously estimated. From a negative growth in 2009, the world economy is projected to grow by 3.9 per cent this year and by 4.3 per cent in 2011. The IMF has revised upwards almost all its forecasts made in October 2009, quite substantially in many cases. For instance, in October it had projected the world economy to grow by just 3.1 per cent. In keeping with the observation that has become fairly routine in reports of world bodies including the IMF and the World Bank, China and India are in the forefront of the recovery, with a projected growth rate of 10 per cent and 7.7 per cent respectively in 2010 and 9.7 per cent and 7.8 per cent in 2011.
In contrast, the advanced economies will grow by just 2.1 per cent this year. This certainly will be a vast improvement over 2009, which saw a contraction. But it is not good enough to warrant a roll-back of the strong policy-backed stimulus measures. On the positive side, consumption has been unexpectedly strong, especially in the United States. An appetite for risk is re-emerging and equity markets have rebounded in many countries. In the industrial countries, inflation is not an immediate threat and investor confidence is picking up. But high unemployment rates, rising public debt and, in some countries, weak household balance sheets pose major challenges to recovery. The recovery has been helped by the corrective steps the central banks and governments have taken. But, sooner than later, private demand will have to take over. A withdrawal of these measures in the immediate future carries the danger of pushing these countries back into a recession. Given the fragile nature of recovery, fiscal policies need to be supportive of economic activity in the near term and the fiscal stimulus planned for 2010 should be implemented. However, in the face of mounting fiscal deficits that may not be sustainable very much longer, many countries are already planning appropriate exit strategies. Given the varying pace of recovery, the retreat has to be timed and calibrated according to the situation obtaining in each country.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Uneven-recovery/article16839947.ece
30,1,2010,Moving away from easy money,"In its latest review of the monetary policy, the Reserve Bank of India has tried to balance the often conflicting objectives of supporting growth and simultaneously reining in inflation against the backdrop of a fast changing environment. While the economy is seen moving into a higher growth trajectory, inflation has become a major policy concern. Besides, in any case, it was expected that the RBI would announce the first decisive steps to reverse the easy money stance adopted since September 2008. At the global level, the outlook for most countries is improving. Compared to a year ago, a different set of policy challenges has emerged for both the advanced and the emerging economies. In 2009, India and other emerging economies were engaged in mitigating the impact of the global financial crisis on their real economies. In 2010, their endeavour would be to strengthen the recovery process without compromising on price stability and to contain asset price inflation caused by large capital inflows. Both domestic and global factors have influenced the RBI’s decision to announce a sharp hike in the CRR by 0.75 percentage point — to 5.75 per cent — to absorb approximately Rs.36,000 crore in two stages.
The higher-than-expected increase in the CRR need not lead to higher commercial interest rates immediately. The policy interest rates, namely the repo and the reverse repo rates, have been left unchanged. Moreover, there will be sufficient liquidity even after the CRR hike takes effect. Almost 98 per cent of the government borrowing programme has been completed. The anticipated increase in credit demand during the rest of the year can be easily taken care of with the available funds. The RBI has lowered its projection of credit growth to 16 per cent and that of deposit growth to 17 per cent. The economy that has rebounded strongly with a 7.9 per cent growth in the second quarter is expected to maintain its momentum during the rest of the year. The RBI’s revised forecast of 7.5 per cent is sharply higher than the six per cent it had projected earlier. Inflation, though still caused predominantly by supply side factors, is a major threat to growth. The RBI has raised its projection for WPI inflation for end-March to 8.5 per cent. There are factors that might lower growth and accentuate inflation. Uncertainty about the pace and shape of global recovery, surge in oil prices in the wake of a sharp recovery, increase in capital inflows beyond the absorptive capacity of the economy, and performance of the South-West monsoon in 2010 are some of the imponderables.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Moving-away-from-easy-money/article16840400.ece
30,1,2010,Earthquakes and science,"The 7-magnitude shallow-depth earthquake of January 12, which had its epicentre about 15 kilometres southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti’s capital, ruptured the long Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault for a length of about 75 km and width of 13 km to 15 km. The extent of rupture along the fault will become clearer after detailed studies are carried out. While the quake relieved a certain amount of accumulated stress, the Fault, according to the United States Geologic Survey (USGS), has not been ruptured “appreciably” and still stores accumulated stress. An earthquake results when the rocks fail and the accumulated stress is suddenly released. According to the USGS, aftershocks of magnitude 7 will continue for months; there is also a “small chance” of subsequent quakes being larger than the calamitous one of January 12. It is well known that a sudden release of strain at one point loads another area along the same fault or adjacent faults, and may hasten the occurrence of another quake. The loading-unloading of stress becomes all the more pronounced after a major earthquake. Haiti lies in a seismically active zone between the North American and Caribbean tectonic plates. Another major strike slip fault, the Septentrional Fault, runs across the country. The country is also sandwiched by two thrust faults, one in the north and the other in the south.
Yet Haiti and the rest of the Caribbean region, which resembles a small-scale ring of fire like the one encircling the Pacific Ocean, are largely ignored by the scientific community. Quakes produced by the strike slip faults, Enriquillo and Septentrional, occur at relatively shallow depths. Even smaller magnitude quakes can be felt on the ground, and poorly constructed buildings can get weakened or damaged. Unfortunately, smaller magnitude earthquakes are generally ignored by the global network of seismic stations, which report only quakes of magnitude 4.5 and above. This underlines the need for studying regional seismic activity. Indonesia, which was sparsely instrumented prior to the 2004 tsunami, is better studied today. It is important to study even the smaller magnitude earthquakes in seismically active zones because, over the long term, they may anticipate a remotely possible large earthquake. Establishing or improving building codes will become possible only when a thorough seismic hazard assessment is made. The good news is that it is possible to fast-track the assessment to get a better understanding of the likelihood and nature of quakes over different time frames.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Earthquakes-and-science/article16840399.ece
1,2,2010,Time of iPad,"Apple Computer’s iconic Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs has made another bid to create digital history. Following months of speculation, he unveiled the iPad, a 24.64 cm (9.7 inch) touch-screen tablet. This device, he proclaimed, lets people hold the internet in their hands. Mr. Jobs hopes to make the same game-changing impact on the digital world that he did with the iPod, which has sold 250 million units, and the iPhone. Apple’s nifty new creation is positioned as a “third category” mobile device — between the laptop and the smartphone. It is 1.27 cm (half an inch) thin and tips the scales at 0.68 kg. The iPad can browse the web, zoom into maps, do email, display and share photos, play video and music, and enthuse gamers with a raft of ready games. It can turn into a digital canvas with one application, complete with an easel and brushes to create art anywhere. It doubles up as an e-reader for books, with an attached online bookstore. The e-reader model for downloadable books was made popular by Amazon’s Kindle; the iPad hopes to expand that base with an augmented virtual reading experience that is comparable to print (although the backlighting can be a problem). The reader can pleasurably flip the pages back and forth. The publishers can even add colour pictures and video to the virtual pages.
The stock market did not react to the iPad with instant enthusiasm, but that hardly settles its future. Mr. Jobs may be resorting to hyperbole when he claims the iPad does many things better than a laptop or a smartphone. But what industry sceptics sometimes forget is that Apple’s runaway success is not just about functions — it is also about charisma, starting with design and feel. The iPod rewrote — and how — the rules of how people discover, purchase, and enjoy music. The iPhone (with its below-par battery storage) and iPod Touch unleashed the development of over 140,000 software applications, which have been downloaded three billion times in 18 months. That the iPad can run virtually all of them ‘from day one’ gives it a huge advantage in the consumer market. Apple now hopes to enter a whole new realm, where technology and the liberal arts converge and entire sectors such as newspapers, magazines, video producers, game developers, and book publishers come on board. For the media, the iPad opens up fresh possibilities on how content can be created and distributed and, crucially, monetised. The models with the 3G cellular option (built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are standard) will connect the user to news, video, books, and key sports channels on the go. But universal appeal may elude the web-focussed iPad if it does not offer compatibility with Flash and Java formats; nearly 70 per cent of games and 75 per cent of video on the Internet depend on Flash support. To become the convergence device of choice, Apple’s latest creation must aim to embrace all web-technologies and platforms and be global and open.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Time-of-iPad/article16840657.ece
1,2,2010,Unrepentant Blair,"On January 29, Tony Blair appeared before the Iraq Inquiry, the Chilcot inquiry, in London. It was unlikely that the self-righteous former British Prime Minister would reveal anything new. Most of the relevant facts are already public. Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction: none have been found since the invasion. President George W. Bush and Mr. Blair took the decision to invade Iraq in April 2002; there was no link whatever between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda. Iraq, having been disarmed under U.N. supervision after 1991, was seen as a threat not even by its own neighbours. The list is almost endless. The British Cabinet was not given all the documents on which the decision to invade was based; the dossier claiming that Iraqi missiles could reach the U.K. within 45 minutes was both plagiarised and mendacious; the invasion was under-funded because preparations would have excited public suspicion; there was no planning for the post-invasion period. Mr. Blair has himself said publicly that the purpose of the invasion was regime change. Finally, only one British legal opinion, by Attorney General Lord Goldsmith, held the invasion not to be a breach of international law.
Against that background, Mr. Blair has done no more than deny that the invasion was based on “a lie or a conspiracy or a deceit or a deception.” His basic defence is that he believed everything he claimed at the time. This may show Mr. Blair’s conviction that all his actions were right if he thought they were right, but such psychological factors cannot compensate for the enormous failures of the British political process that enabled the illegal invasion. Three high-level Cabinet resignations in March 2003, rather than the one by Robin Cook, may have been enough to deter Mr. Blair. Rejection of war by Parliament, despite not being binding under the then U.K. law, would have almost certainly been enough. Although unconfirmed reports said that 95 per cent of the 386 ruling Labour MPs were against the war, on the day only 139 voted against it. Nothing has been done to address these systemic failures. That is particularly worrying considering that Mr. Blair ended his deposition by claiming, with unbelievable arrogance, that Iran now poses the kind of threat he claimed Iraq did in 2003.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Unrepentant-Blair/article16840656.ece
2,2,2010,Money down the drain,"There is nothing surprising about the Anglo-American decision to spend their way out of a hopeless war in Afghanistan by creating a fund to compensate defectors from the Taliban. In counter-insurgency, context is everything. Had the Taliban been on the verge of defeat on the battlefield, a few million dollars could well hasten the disintegration of its fighting formations. But given the nature of the conflict, the historical background, and the appalling scale of civilian casualties inflicted by the occupation, it is the Taliban who have been growing in strength, capability, and initiative. It is the U.S.-led coalition that is looking for a quick way out of a calamitous misadventure. Today, the binding constraint in the war against the Taliban is not the number of American troops or the lethality of their firepower but the capacity of the Afghan National Army and the willingness of Pakistan to tamp down and eliminate its ties with the extremist militias. The cash solution pushed through at the recent London conference on Afghanistan addresses neither of these constraints. Islamabad is likely to see the plan as another sign of Anglo-American desperation and as vindication of its strategy of keeping alive ‘assets’ like the Quetta shura of the Talibani and the Haqqani network leadership.
As for the Afghan National Army, its ranks already suffer from problems of low pay and morale. If extremists are now to be bought over with cash, the message it will send to army soldiers is that they chose the wrong side. This is not to say creative solutions are not needed to bring an end to the war. Dialogue and reconciliation are needed, although it is clear the Taliban leadership (and the al-Qaida elements, to the extent they are active on the ground in Afghanistan) is not interested in either. Rank-and-file fighters and even commanders are another kettle of fish but the danger is that the cash being ponied up to engineer defections might end up in the hands of the Taliban themselves. The equation would have been different had the offer of rehabilitation been made from a position of strength. There should of course be no illusion about the character of the Taliban: they remain as fundamentalist, as reactionary, and as brutal as they ever were. But as long as the U.S. and its allies wage and lead the war in Afghanistan, civilians will continue to be killed in large numbers and the Taliban support base will not erode. The occupation must end and, when that happens, there will be major consequences for the government and people of Afghanistan. But that scenario is unavoidable and must be faced sooner than later.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Money-down-the-drain/article16811755.ece
2,2,2010,"Bowling, India’s weakness","Having deservedly become the top-ranked team in Test cricket, India must address its most obvious vulnerability if it is to prolong its reign. Ian Chappell, the former Australian captain and one of cricket’s best minds, spotlighted the weakness recently when he said sides that were successful over long periods were powered by at least two champion bowlers; from studying the averages and strike-rates of India’s bowlers over the last year, he couldn’t find even one champion bowler. The last instance of an Indian bowler finishing the year (minimum qualification: five Tests) with an average in the mid-20s and a strike rate below 50 occurred in 2007, Zaheer Khan’s 41 wickets coming at a rate of 25.73 runs and 48.6 balls per dismissal. Other statistics confirm this worrying trend: in seven of India’s last nine Test series, it has conceded over 500 in an innings at least once; in three of these series India’s bowlers have been taken for over 600 at least once. Against Bangladesh, barring Zaheer’s inspired burst in the second innings of the second Test, India’s bowling laboured to shift the opponent’s lower-order.
There may be no cause for panic ahead of the series against South Africa, the world’s second-best-performing Test team. The bowlers may have struggled but India has won five successive series: evidently the side knows how to adjust. The problem does, however, expose a system that has disenfranchised the bowlers. Until such time a pitch allowing a run glut receives the same condemnation as one unfairly privileging the bowler, the bowling community will remain marginalised. India’s administrators who reacted smartly to the criticism that the national side wasn’t playing enough Test cricket must now concentrate their efforts on improving wickets across the country. Spin, traditionally an Indian strength, demands attention. Harbhajan Singh’s performance as lead spinner after the great Anil Kumble’s retirement has been patchy: he has on occasion swung matches, but is yet to command the consistency and penetration his role demands. Neither Amit Mishra nor Pragyan Ojha has made a clinching case as second spinner, but they must be allowed both time and trust. Any bowler capable of defeating high-quality batsmen in defence — as good a guideline as any for determining a potential champion wicket-taker — must be kept from slipping through the cracks in the system. Bowlers are a susceptible lot: injury and minor kinks in action can undo the endeavour of decades. They require considerate, nuanced treatment. Ian Chappell’s truth telling must be appreciated and acted upon.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Bowling-Indiarsquos-weakness/article16811754.ece
3,2,2010,The Generals and their labyrinth,"The image of the Indian Army has been badly dented with a section of its top brass implicated in what has come to be known as the Sukhna land scam. The damage could have been mitigated had there been a clear signal from the Army that it was prepared to deal seriously with the alleged misconduct. Regrettably, the controversy was allowed to malinger and was exacerbated by perceptions that the Army Chief, General Deepak Kapoor, was reluctant to act firmly against his aide and Military Secretary, Lt. General Avadhesh Prakash. Despite an Army Court of Inquiry (CoI) reportedly citing prima facie evidence to the effect that Lt. General Prakash was the key figure in the Sukhna land case, General Kapoor was in favour of milder administrative action rather than a court martial. The change of heart, which came a couple of days before Lt-General Prakash’s retirement on January 31, owes wholly to the very proper intervention of Defence Minister A.K. Antony, a politician respected across the political spectrum for his probity in public life. It was Mr. Antony’s ‘advice’ that the case should be dealt with sternly that persuaded the Army Chief to court martial Lt. General Prakash. Earlier, as recommended by the CoI, General Kapoor approved a court martial for Lt. General P.K. Rath and administrative action against two others; the sticking point was over his aide and Military Secretary.
The four generals are entitled to a fair process, which only a military court can provide under the procedure established by law. But it is important to send a signal that any scent of corruption in the armed forces will be dealt with firmly and without prevarication, even when it involves the top brass. The case itself relates to the issue of a no-objection certificate (NOC) to a realtor, who falsely claimed to be an affiliate of Mayo College, for setting up a school on private land adjacent to the Sukhna military station in Darjeeling district. Among the issues that need to be determined are whether rules and procedures were bent in granting the NOC and if there were security implications in doing so, given the area’s proximity to the border. The Indian Army, which was regarded as an incorruptible institution in the first few decades following Independence, has been affected by a string of corruption scandals in recent times. The only way to check the downslide is to have a policy of zero tolerance of corruption, something that Mr. Antony has stressed more than once. Apart from the moral and economic implications, corruption in the armed forces has a quite obvious bearing on security. It is a risk India can ill afford to take.
Correction
A sentence in “The Generals and their labyrinth” (Editorial, February 3, 2010) was “Regrettably, the controversy was allowed to malinger and was exacerbated by perceptions that the Army Chief, General Deepak Kapoor, was reluctant to act firmly against his aide and Military Secretary, Lt. General Avadhesh Prakash.” It should have been “linger”. “Malinger” is “to pretend to be ill in order to escape duty or work” and is thought to have come from the French word “malingre” (“mal”– wrongly + “haingre” – weak).",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-Generals-and-their-labyrinth/article16812852.ece
3,2,2010,Doctors for the villages,"While a country like China devised practical ways to deliver healthcare to rural populations by deploying its band of ‘barefoot doctors’ from the 1960s in a transitional phase, and then went on to expand full-fledged medical education facilities that enabled national coverage to a great degree, chronic shortages of doctors in rural India six decades after Independence remain a worry. The allopathic doctor-patient ratio is a dismal 1:1,722. Nevertheless, the Medical Council of India’s proposal for a three-and-a-half-year course leading to a diploma in Bachelor of Rural Medicine and Surgery (BRMS) to produce a class of allopathic practitioners who hail from rural areas and will serve in notified rural areas may turn out to be a cure worse than the disease. Chhattisgarh’s experiment with a controversial three-year medical course (introduced in 2000 and scrapped in 2004) should provide a cautionary tale. The key question is: should rural folk be short-changed when it comes to the education, training, and calibre of medical practitioners?
The Bhore Committee Report of 1946 provided a highly commended blueprint for a modern public health delivery system and the training of personnel. It envisaged the concept of a ‘basic’ doctor who would be central to the delivery of primary healthcare; he or she would be put through five-and-a-half years of sound medical education. An alternative cadre of Licentiates (LMPs) who underwent a three-to-four-year course in medical schools was abolished after deliberation. But the Committee recommended the setting up of more medical colleges, with all available resources directed at the production of one type of doctor with the optimal level of training over five-and-a-half-years. The expectation was that medical education would match population growth and expanding healthcare needs. The number of MBBS seats in India is less than 31,000 today which is far from adequate. There were 17,654 medical degree-holders available at the time of the Bhore Committee survey to serve a population that was less than a third of what it is today and they were less spread out. The challenge before the government is straightforward: it is to increase the MBBS-level intake manifold, rationalising the process of setting up medical colleges — and cleansing the clearance system of multi-point transactional corruption. A package of well-considered and sustainable measures, including attractive incentives, to ensure that a significantly greater number of doctors work in the countryside, must be put in place. Narrow-minded resistance from within the medical fraternity should not be allowed to stand in the way.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Doctors-for-the-villages/article16812009.ece
4,2,2010,A new kind of discordance,"The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s running battle with the Shiv Sena on the ‘Marathi manoos’ issue underlines the predicament of an organisation that is wedded in equal measure to Hindi and Hindutva. The Sangh Parivar’s formative years resounded to the rousing cry of ‘Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan.’ The slogan pretty much defined the Jan Sangh. The Bharatiya Janata Party, despite outwardly embracing the South, remains fixated to this day on Hindi. It stands to reason then that the Parivar and its political ward cannot countenance the Shiv Sena’s brand of virulent Marathi chauvinism. In a way, the BJP is being paid back in its own coin. The Sena’s opposition to North Indians is rooted in the same exclusivist ideology that informs the Parivar’s overall vision. In and out of power, the BJP has unabashedly pursued a policy of “anti-minorityism.” The party posited this in terms of “justice for all and appeasement of none” but on the ground the anthem invariably translated into aggression against minorities. From Gujarat 2002 to Orissa 2008-2009, the country has been witness to a pattern of violence against minorities whose primary driver was the thought process that motivated the Parivar rank-and-file. Having promoted a “Hindi-Hindu” culture, the BJP today can hardly quarrel with the Sena for targeting one section of Indians. To be fair to the BJP, it never treated its own Hindi fetish as licence to attack non-Hindi speakers. But the party did not protest either when its oldest partner repeatedly set upon innocent migrants from other parts of India.
So why have the RSS and the BJP suddenly woken up to the dangers of Marathi chauvinism? In recent statements, both organisations have unequivocally denounced the divisive nature of the ‘Marathi manoos’ project. Clearly, the urgency derives from the BJP’s growing problems with the Bihar-based Janata Dal (United). The National Democratic Alliance is today a shadow of its former self. Ahead of the 2009 general election, the alliance between the BJP and its largest coalition partner, Nitish Kumar-led JD(U), came under severe strain. Over the past two years, the JD(U) has expressed unease over the BJP’s “communalism” but positively bristled at its quiescence when Bihari migrants were attacked in Maharashtra. The Hindutva party knows that Mr. Kumar has many options outside the BJP whereas the Sena, beleaguered by the emergence of the rival Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, has none. From the BJP perspective, it makes sense to placate the JD(U) and wait for tempers to cool in Maharashtra. As for the Congress, its evident glee at the state of affairs between the BJP and the Sena is premature given its own share of problems with the Nationalist Congress Party.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-new-kind-of-discordance/article16812293.ece
4,2,2010,Rebound continues,"The recently released trade data for December 2009 reveal two significant developments in India’s foreign trade. First, the turnaround in exports has sustained for the second month. Exports grew by 9.3 per cent, from $13.38 billion in December 2008 to $14.61 billion. The improvement is particularly encouraging as it has come on top of the 18 per cent-plus growth recorded in November reversing the downtrend witnessed over a period of 13 months. The second development is that the trend in imports too has turned positive. After an 11-month slump, imports grew by 27.2 per cent to $24.75 billion from $19.46 billion a year ago. It is perhaps no coincidence that the pick up in India’s foreign trade, both exports and imports, has come at a time when the global recession is abating. The principal markets for India’s exports are the United States, the European Union, and Japan. Although these markets are recovering from the recession, economic growth continues to be sluggish and fragile. The policy-makers have been repeatedly urging exporters to diversify their markets. Indeed, such market diversification is a major plank of the Foreign Trade Policy, the targets being the newer, unconventional markets in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Such advice is especially valid now in the continuing quest for greater stability in exports.
The growth in imports is a positive sign. Manufacturing has been growing in double digits. Lower non-oil imports in the past indicated lower investment demand in capital goods. The more robust trade figures of November and December correlate with the stronger macroeconomic performance. All major institutions have been marking up their forecasts of India’s GDP growth for 2009-10. However, it would be unwise to ignore the ramifications of the global recession on foreign trade. To a large extent, the recent trade figures look good because of the base effect: world trade contracted sharply from October 2008. Over a nine-month period, April-December 2009, both exports and imports have grown at a lower rate than during the corresponding period in 2008. Despite the recent bounce back, exports are likely to be well below last year’s levels. The overall trade deficit for the nine months has shrunk by more than 28 per cent and now stands at $76.24 billion. Oil prices were generally benign until December when they started firming up. A lower trade deficit is not necessarily a positive feature when it indicates lower economic activity. World crude prices represent another imponderable and could well upset the calculations on the foreign trade front.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Rebound-continues/article16812292.ece
5,2,2010,Three years and counting,"Three years have passed since the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT) gave its final award on inter-State sharing of the river waters. The Inter-State Waters Dispute Act, 1956 bars any court, including the Supreme Court, from having or exercising jurisdiction “in respect of any water dispute which may be referred to a Tribunal under this Act.” A 2002 amendment to the Act provides further that “the decision of the Tribunal, after its publication in the Official Gazette by the Central Government...shall have the same force as an order or decree of the Supreme Court.” But this is only on paper. The final award of the CWDT has not entered into force because it has not been gazetted — and it has not been gazetted because the matter has been taken to the Supreme Court over the head of the Tribunal and has become part of the law’s interminable delays. With Karnataka challenging the very foundation of the final order and seeking fresh adjudication, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, under political pressure, also pressed their demands in the highest court of the land. Not surprisingly, the Tribunal refused to hear applications relating to the final award on the grounds that the Supreme Court had admitted Special Leave Petitions against it.
Cauvery is a river whose waters have been more or less fully utilised. This means that working out a modus vivendi for fair and equitable sharing among the basin States has been a volatile issue and implementing it in deficit monsoon years will be a tough political challenge. The CWDT was set up in June 1990 at the direction of the Supreme Court after repeated rounds of negotiation among the basin States had failed and the V.P. Singh government informed the court that it did not want to undertake any further negotiation. The Tribunal’s Interim Award came on June 25, 1991 and the final award on February 5, 2007. By any estimation, these awards were just, equitable, and workable. Under the final award, Tamil Nadu’s share of the water to be released by Karnataka at the Biligundulu gauging station was determined as 182 thousand million cubic feet, in addition to the 10 tmcft for environmental purposes. Taking the dispute back to the Supreme Court has defeated the very purpose for which the Tribunal was constituted. It is the guaranteed way of consuming time in years to the detriment of the interests of the farmers and people of the historically celebrated Cauvery basin. Both Tamil Nadu and Karnataka are paying a heavy economic price: in the absence of a settlement, the former’s massive scheme for the modernisation of the Cauvery delta zone is on hold and the latter’s plans for new check dams along the river cannot go ahead. If the dispute is not to drag on for another decade, the Supreme Court must dispose of these petitions efficiently — and allow the Tribunal to be the final adjudicator, as envisaged in the Inter-State Water Disputes Act.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Three-years-and-counting/article16812527.ece
5,2,2010,No end to Iraq’s instability,"On February 1, repeating a pattern of attacks carried out a year previously, a woman suicide bomber wearing an abaya or burqa blew herself up among Shia pilgrims passing through Shaab on their way to the holy city of Kerbala in southern Iraq. According to official figures, 54 were killed, including women and children, and 117 wounded. Fears have been raised of more attacks as the Kerbala pilgrimage proceeds to its culmination on Arbaeen (on February 5). Some 14 million people made the pilgrimage in 2009, and even more are expected this time. The physical difficulties of protecting them are obvious; most make the pilgrimage on foot, and many come from the Iraqi province of Diyala, which is known to be a centre for the recruitment and training of female suicide bombers. Iraq apparently does not have enough policewomen to search women at checkpoints. One Iraqi official body has maintained that the explosion occurred near a point where women were undergoing searches, but according to a survivor there were no searches. The use of sniffer dogs is often restricted by local and regional cultural sensitivities. Foreign equipment sold to Iraq has often turned out to be defective, and a British manufacturer of a non-functioning detector of explosives is to face fraud charges in the United Kingdom.
The political significance of the bombing is considerable. No group has yet claimed responsibility for it, though the pattern is consistent with previous Sunni-extremist attacks (including the bombing of candidates’ cars) aimed at discrediting the largely Shia government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and destabilising the run-up to the parliamentary elections scheduled for March. The latest attack has further exposed the civic void caused by the destruction of Iraq’s political and administrative infrastructure after the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003. In addition, such attacks show that their planners can easily outmanoeuvre the Iraqi government and forces, despite the deployment of 50,000 security personnel in Kerbala and Najaf. That in turn reveals the political power vacuum in Iraq seven years after the invasion and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. It is common knowledge that the invasion leaders, the U.S. and the U.K., had no plans for the post-invasion period. Now there is no foreseeable prospect of an end to Iraq’s political instability.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/No-end-to-Iraqrsquos-instability/article16812526.ece
6,2,2010,End of a friendship,"The expulsion of Amar Singh and Jaya Prada from the Samajwadi Party was an inevitable sequel to the escalating war of words between the individuals loyal to Mulayam Singh’s former confidant and the party’s current dispensation. Each side has accused the other of bringing the SP to ruin. In the litany of charges against Mr. Amar Singh, two stand out. The first is that he introduced a culture of glamour and corporate deal-making that struck at the socialist-subaltern character of the party. The second allegation is that he brokered a pact with Kalyan Singh under whose malevolent watch the Babri Masjid met its brutal end. These are not unknown truths, which Mr. Amar Singh himself accepts with the caveat that whatever he did was in the party’s best interests. A valid question arises: why did it take his detractors 14 years to decide he was causing the party unspeakable harm? After all, Mr. Kalyan Singh had a previous association with the SP, which by all accounts was tolerated by the party; it ended in 2004 with his return to the Bharatiya Janata Party. Mr. Mulayam Singh’s achievements are considerable. A leader of the grassroots, like Charan Singh and Karpoori Thakur, he far surpassed them in popularity — achieving an iconic status with the Muslim community, which christened him ‘Maulana Mulayam’ for the stellar role he played in safeguarding the Babri Masjid.
Mr. Mulayam Singh is an astute politician whose understanding of rustic politics influenced a legion of successors, among them no less than Lalu Prasad. To portray him as a pristine innocent in opposition to the ‘wily and opportunistic’ Mr. Amar Singh is to undermine the SP chief and a relationship that was mutually beneficial. Where does the party go from here? In the imagination of the old guard, it will recapture its lost glory once it returns to its pre-Amar Singh past. But that was a past uncluttered by modernity and socio-political complications. In the last 14 years, the towns and villages of Uttar Pradesh have changed considerably, with the young, as everywhere else, eager to learn English and be computer savvy. They are unlikely to root for a party that refuses to keep pace with the times. The intensely competitive nature of U.P. politics also means that the SP will have to muster all its resources to garner the ‘plus’ votes, that is, votes outside of its core constituency. These votes are in every political party’s calculation today; they can make the difference between victory and defeat. Chief Minister Mayawati is a past master at building alliances to expand her party’s social base and the Rahul Gandhi-led Congress is emerging as a significant rival. Mr. Mulayam Singh certainly has his task cut out.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/End-of-a-friendship/article16812785.ece
6,2,2010,Bird puzzle solved,"Did birds evolve independently or from dinosaurs? The question has been settled by a recent discovery; the findings are published in the latest issue of Science. A ten-foot long, nearly complete fossil discovered in 160-million-year old mudstone beds in northwest China provides indisputable evidence that birds evolved from dinosaurs. The young adult fossil is clearly a transitional one between dinosaurs and birds. It belongs to a new genus of alvarezsauroid dinosaurs: Haplocheirus sollers (meaning “simple, skilful hand”). The discovery has pushed back the fossil record of alvarezsauroid by 63 million years. What is particularly significant is that the fossil unearthed is about 15 million years older than the earliest known bird — Archaeopteryx. To confirm that birds descended from dinosaurs, it was essential to have fossils of bird-like theropods in the early stages of the transition and predating the Archaeopteryx. The absence of such evidence led to a paradox in the time scale (temporal paradox) and made some scientists believe that birds developed independently. While some recent discoveries from the Jurassic Period have challenged the temporal paradox, they were not able to settle the question. They were not truly transitional fossils and shared many morphological characteristics with birds, and moreover the ages of these fossils are “poorly resolved,” as the paper notes. The discovery of Haplocheirus sollers has finally solved the temporal paradox.
Haplocheirus has all the morphological features to be called the transitional form and the earliest among the alvarezsauroid dinosaurs. The curved, serrated teeth and canine teeth indicate it was a carnivore. It is by far the largest alvarezsauroid ever found: big for a bird and small for a dinosaur. According to the authors of the Science paper, certain characteristics of its digits imply that the “hand was fully functional…and retained some grasping ability.” Compared with the Haplocheirus, the derived alvarezsauroid dinosaurs from the Jurassic Period have undergone several morphological modifications that place them later in the evolutionary lineage. There has been “extreme morphological convergence between birds and derived Alvarezsauroid,” the authors conclude. There has been a rich haul of dinosaur fossils from China and the latest discovery establishes that alvarezsauroidea originated in Asia rather than in South America as was originally thought. Looking for fossils in rocks belonging to the late Jurassic Period and the appropriate depositional environment will be the key to find other missing fossils between Haplocheirus and the derived alvarezsauroid.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Bird-puzzle-solved/article16812784.ece
7,2,2010,A difficult choice,"It is not surprising that the expert panel headed by Kirit Parikh on the pricing of petroleum products should recommend total decontrol of the retail prices of petrol and diesel while suggesting a more gradual approach in the case of kerosene and LPG. In July-August 2008, the B.K. Chaturvedi committee had recommended a similar deregulation, although in its case, the process of aligning domestic prices with global ones was to be spread over several months. If the Kirit Parikh panel has its way, petrol and diesel prices would go up by between Rs.3 and Rs.4 a litre immediately, wiping out “the under recoveries” of public sector oil companies and substantially reducing the level of government subsidies. For the cooking fuels — kerosene and LPG — it calls for a nuanced approach but even here an immediate price rice of about Rs.100 for an LPG cylinder and Rs.6 for a litre of kerosene sold through the public distribution system (PDS) is suggested. The expert group charged with the task of devising “a viable and sustainable system of pricing of petroleum products” has had to come up with a methodology of minimising, if not avoiding altogether, the burden of subsidies. The three major public sector companies are expected to end this year with a total of Rs.45,500 crore as “under recoveries,” with kerosene accounting for about Rs.17,420 crore and LPG Rs.14,152 crore.
Making out a case for the continuance of subsidy on kerosene in rural areas, the panel has recommended that the price should be revised every year in relation to the per capita agricultural GDP. Among its suggestions to narrow the gap due to “under recoveries” is the sharing of production revenue from nomination blocks of the upstream government-owned oil companies, the ONGC and Oil India. Cash subsidy in certain cases should be charged to the budget. Even with these and other measures, subsidies would still be required but they will remain stable at a manageable Rs.20,000 crore. In a sensitive area such as petroleum product pricing, the government will need to consider the political realities as much as hard-headed economics. It is indeed a difficult choice between coming up with a sudden, unpopular jump in petrol, diesel, kerosene and LPG prices on the one hand and, on the other, continuing to bear ever increasing subsidies that would stretch the fiscal balance to the breaking point. Also, at a time when the government is under criticism for letting food and essential prices rise, an increase in fuel prices could raise transportation costs and push up the prices of essentials further. It is, however, clear that the present system of pricing petroleum products is not sustainable and a change, even if gradual, is imperative.

7,2,2010,Facing up to Gaza truths,"On February 2, Ehud Barak, Israel’s Defence Minister and a former Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) chief of staff, stated that unless Israel made peace with the Palestinians, it would lose its Jewish majority or become an apartheid state. The context is the increasing domestic and international pressure on its government to hold a public inquiry into Operation Cast Lead. The three-week war, waged in 2008-2009 against Hamas forces in Gaza following a clear Israeli breach of a ceasefire, resulted in the death of 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis. To start with, Israeli soldiers have told the country’s biggest-selling newspaper, Yedioth Ahronot, that the IDF rewrote the rules of engagement in Cast Lead. This was to protect Israeli soldiers at the expense of Palestinian civilians; and the targeted killing of ‘identified terrorists’ was turned into a shoot-first, ask-later policy. Secondly, an international mines action team, followed by United Nations technical staff, has confirmed finding part of an air-dropped 113 kg Mk 82 bomb in the ruins of the sole functioning flour mill in Gaza. Judge Richard Goldstone’s report to the United Nation concludes that the mill attack was intended to deny sustenance to the civilian population; it was potentially a war crime, and negates Israeli claims to have observed international law during Cast Lead. Thirdly, Israel denies disciplining two senior officers for using white phosphorus munitions in Gaza, though it does not deny using the chemical. Finally, in an attack on a civilian-occupied U.N. compound on January 6, 2010, the IDF massacred 40 Palestinians despite knowing that its troops had not been fired on from within the compound.
Mr. Barak’s warning is, however, at best partial. Since winning the 1967 war with Egypt, Israel has had a population of over 1.5 million Palestinians, whom it intends neither to expel nor to absorb as citizens with full rights. A viable Palestinian state would presumably relieve Israel of the charge of apartheid. Secondly, Mr. Barak has mentioned neither the 500,000 illegal Israeli occupants of the West Bank nor a halt to further construction there. The historian, Avi Shlaim calls this a dispute over a pizza in which one person continues to ‘gobble up’ the pizza during the discussions. Furthermore, Mr. Barak’s own government has rejected all calls for a freeze on further West Bank settlement; this means that a major precondition for a peace agreement will not be met. Can there be the slightest doubt that Israel is simply not up to reaching a just and equitable agreement with the Palestinians?

8,2,2010,The future of the past,"The death of a language means the passing of many things — a way of life, a cultural identity, a repository of indigenous knowledge. Language is not merely a mechanical means of communication but a medium that shapes the very way we think; as the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein observed, the limits of one’s language are the limits of one’s world. The outpouring of nostalgic sorrow and ruminative melancholy over the death at 85 of Boa Sr — the last speaker of the Bo, one of the ten languages of the tribes that populated the Great Andaman archipelago — is recognition that the passing of this grand old lady represents the irreplaceable loss of a part of the world’s heritage, the passage of the remnants of a living culture into memory. It is a reminder of the fragility of the indigenous people of the Andaman islands and the importance of protecting their lives and their culture — which dates back an estimated 70,000 years — from further degradation in the name of ‘upliftment’ and ‘civilisation.’ The dwindling numbers of indigenous people, most of whom were either killed by British colonisers or died through diseases imported by settlers, is reflected starkly in the population of Great Andamenese, down to around 50 from an estimated 5,000 a century ago. Once in residence along the length of the Great Andaman region, they now live in tiny Strait Island, largely deprived of their cultural and linguistic identities.
Only three other tribes survive in the Andaman islands: the 250 or so Jarawas, who resisted contact with outsiders until two decades ago and whose way of life is threatened by the ‘friendly contact’ promoted by the Great Andaman Trunk Road that cuts through their forest homeland; the Onges (around 100), who live in a remote pocket in the Little Andaman; and the Sentinelese, who have fiercely resisted outside contact, and whose numbers and language remain unknown. The Andamans is celebrated for being a storehouse of faunal and floral diversity but its linguistic and cultural diversity has largely been neglected. The languages or dialects of the Great Andamanese are regarded as one of the five language families in India; if Onge-Jarawa is derived from a separate linguistic ancestor as some believe, then this remarkable region would have contributed to two of six language families. While the study of language and cultures is a matter for academics, the effort to preserve them is a political enterprise, a process that requires empowering indigenous communities to protect their ancient traditions and tap into local resources in an autonomous and sustainable way. In the Andamans, more than elsewhere, we need to protect the future of the past.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-future-of-the-past/article16813316.ece
8,2,2010,Bumpy road to recovery,"The sharp declines in the stock markets around the world last week are significant as much for investors as for the governments framing macroeconomic policies. The almost synchronised fall in equity prices is attributed to major concerns over a possible debt crisis in some European countries. A handful of countries in the Euro zone, notably Greece and Portugal, have come under intense pressure to repay mountains of debt they have run into during years of profligate spending. The fear that even some of the larger European economies such as Spain might be drawn into a financial crisis has affected investor sentiment considerably. The belief that Europe will be the next flashpoint, when most economies of the developed world seem to be stabilising after a prolonged recession, has transformed regional worries into truly global ones. Multilateral institutions including the IMF and the World Bank expect the global economy to grow faster this year than it did during the past two years. However, the recovery is expected to be uneven, with the developed economies witnessing only a muted recovery. The U.S. economy has grown strongly during the past quarter but continues to be beset with high unemployment rates. The news of a possible default by some European countries has drawn attention both to the fragility of global recovery and to the fickle nature of global capital flows.
On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell below 10,000 for the first time since November. Stock markets across Europe lost as much as 6 per cent of the value. By Friday, the contagion had spread to the Asian markets. The Nikkei in Japan shed 2.9 per cent. Along with the rest of Asia, the Indian stock indices dropped precipitously on Friday. The Sensex went down by 434 points and the Nifty by 126 points. While in India the stock prices recovered somewhat during the subsequent trading sessions, it seems unlikely that the markets will soon regain to touch the high levels they reached in recent times. Last week’s stock price movements around the world once again debunk the decoupling theory, which held that the Asian markets are relatively immune to developments in the U.S. and Europe. In India and other Asian countries, the developments in Europe might trigger a long overdue correction that will bring down the stock prices to realistic levels. For investors and governments a more ominous message is that the problems emanating from the financial markets would once again spill over into the real economies, prolonging the slump and making a full-fledged recovery even more difficult.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Bumpy-road-to-recovery/article16813315.ece
9,2,2010,Set General Fonseka free,"If the combined forces of the opposition in Sri Lanka showed appalling political judgment in fielding retired Army general Sarath Fonseka as their presidential candidate, the government has returned the favour through an act that is as miscalculated and reckless as it is authoritarian and ugly. The decision to arrest and court martial the former Army Chief, and the manner in which his arrest was carried out, has shocked everyone who values democracy. Even at face value, the allegations made against General Fonseka are dubious, with the government apparently confused about what exactly he was guilty of (other than vaingloriousness, political ambition, paranoia, and foot-in-the-mouth disease, which are not really prosecutable offences). In fact, the official versions have been such as to challenge credulity: while a press release posted at the Army’s website informs us that General Fonseka has been “taken into military custody on charges of alleged fraudulent acts and military offences,” a government Minister has accused him of “direct contact with opposition political parties” amounting to conspiracy (while he was Army Commander, Chief of Defence Staff, and member of the Security Council), and the director-general of the Media Centre for National Security has spoken darkly of charges of plotting a military coup and conspiring to assassinate President Mahinda Rajapaksa. To the public in Sri Lanka and abroad, what all this signals is a witch-hunt that makes no political sense.
True, the general has been provocative beyond normal limits. Instead of accepting the people’s decisive verdict, he has made false allegations that the presidential election was stolen from him. He has hurled accusations of war crimes against field commanders who served under him in the 34 month-long-war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. He has spoken of an official plot to assassinate him. He has even given hints of political blackmail by saying that upon his death an affidavit containing the government’s ‘secrets’ would be made public. Statesmanship demanded that these provocations be treated as acts of political folly born of failure and frustration. President Rajapaksa, after all, is in an extremely strong position. Following his 17+ percentage point triumph in the presidential contest, he expects his party and alliance to make substantial gains in the parliamentary election that will be held in the first half of April. Sri Lanka, in the post-LTTE era, needs normalcy, reconciliation, a just and sustainable political solution to the Tamil question, and development of all regions starting with the North — not the politics of vendetta, more divisiveness and strife, and further politicisation of the military. Assuming that President Rajapaksa was persuaded or pressured by the hawks around him to go against his better political judgment, he must act boldly to reverse course and set General Fonseka free.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Set-General-Fonseka-free/article16813523.ece
9,2,2010,BAE gets away lightly,"BAE Systems, the British weapons manufacturer, is to pay criminal fines totalling approximately £285 million. This deal closes a coordinated eight-year investigation by the British Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) into longstanding allegations of bribery, slush funds, and unrecorded payments to clients. The U.K. levy of £30 million is a national record for a corporate criminal fine. BAE has accepted only the U.K. charge of failing to keep accounting records and the U.S. charge of not instituting appropriate anti-bribery preventive measures. The issues date as far back as the firm’s 1985 al-Yamamah deal to supply military equipment to Saudi Arabia, and include more recent contracts with Tanzania, the Czech Republic, South Africa, and Hungary. BAE had apparently been bracing itself for fines of up to £1 billion and would have been under no illusions as to the damage its reputation, as well as that of the British government, faced in any criminal trial.
Most importantly, BAE has not admitted any corruption allegations. The plea-bargained settlement has been severely criticised by NGOs like the Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) and by British MPs. Public accusations have been made that Prime Minister Tony Blair caved in to Saudi pressure to halt the British criminal investigation into the £43-billion al-Yamamah affair. CAAT says the fine is a ‘tiny price’ in relation to the value of the contracts. Preliminary English criminal procedures against a key BAE agent, the Austrian Count Alfons Mensdorff-Pouilly, have also been abandoned. The collapse of those proceedings has, however, enabled The Observer to reveal that the SFO prepared detailed allegations of systematic procedures through which BAE paid bribes to foreign politicians and officials. The company may have escaped the blacklisting that would have followed a criminal conviction for bribery and its shareholders will no doubt be relieved that it can continue selling weaponry and related equipment around the world. But the clear implication is that none of the parties involved, namely BAE, the British government, and the U.S. government, wanted to see the evidence tested in the criminal courts. It seems that states are terrified of pursuing even serious accusations of corporate criminality.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/BAE-gets-away-lightly/article16813522.ece
11,2,2010,A sound decision,"In placing a moratorium on the release of Bt brinjal till independent scientific studies establish its safety, the Union Environment Ministry has quite rightly addressed both scientific concerns and public opinion. After the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee cleared Bt brinjal in October 2009, the country witnessed widespread protests, some of them by activists who were irrationally opposed to the very concept of Bt or genetic modification. The fears and apprehensions among certain sections, however, gathered greater force in the absence of clear consensus among the scientific community in favour of allowing the genetically modified vegetable to be introduced. In the end, the moratorium was the right way out of a situation that had as much to do with politics as with science. As Union Minister of State for Environment Jairam Ramesh put it, there was no overriding urgency or food security argument to warrant pushing through Bt brinjal in the face of public opposition. With questions raised about the testing procedures, and attention drawn to the lack of long-term toxicity tests and the absence of data from sources independent of the marketing company, there was much to lose and little to gain from forcing Bt brinjal on Indian consumers. Also, opposition from 10 State governments, including those of the major brinjal-producing States, curtailed the options before the Environment Ministry.
However, the moratorium should be used, not to slow down research on Bt products, which hold long-term cost and supply benefits, but to put in place a system of credible and transparent testing that will win public confidence. Setting up of an independent biotechnology regulatory authority could be one of the first steps. In the case of Bt cotton, the benefits to farmers are proven with reduced input costs and higher yields. True, when it comes to food, the concerns are of an altogether different magnitude. Brinjal is a widely used vegetable that is consumed directly and not in a processed form. The problem is rendered more acute because the practical and cost-related difficulties in labelling GM foods take choice out of the hands of the consumers. But while the government will have to reassure the people and address concerns over the long-term effects on health and the impact on environment of Bt brinjal, there is no place for an absolutist stand against GM foods. To advocate a blanket ban on genetic modification is anti-science and is fraught with grave dangers. More science and better science is the answer to the questions raised by genetic modification, and not unreasoning anti-change activism based on irrational fears.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-sound-decision/article16813997.ece
11,2,2010,Moving towards normal growth,"In its advance estimate of economic growth for the current year (2009-10), the Central Statistical Organisation has projected a rate of 7.2 per cent. Though lower than the 7.5 per cent forecast by the Reserve Bank of India recently and the 7.75 per cent by the mid-year economic survey, the CSO’s projection gives room for optimism. If it materialises, India might well be seen creeping back towards the high growth trajectory, from which it slipped in 2008-09. After recording an average growth of well above 9 per cent for three years between 2005 and 2008, the GDP rose by 6.7 per cent last year — a commendable performance, given the difficult situation caused by the global financial crisis and the ensuing recession. A rate of above 7 per cent will be further proof of the Indian economy’s resilience. Besides, the economy has, by and large, weathered the consequences of a poor south-west monsoon during 2009. The agricultural sector has been particularly hit by severe droughts and floods in several parts of the country. Under the circumstances, a projected growth rate of minus-0.2 per cent for agriculture, though below last year’s 1.6 per cent, is better than expected and is unlikely to drag down the overall growth substantially as feared earlier. The contraction is partly attributed to a sharp drop in the production of food grains and oil seeds. Inadequate supply of food articles is the principal factor behind the raging food inflation.
Economic growth during the first half of 2009-10 has averaged 7 per cent, thanks largely to an extraordinary 7.9 per cent growth in the second quarter. While the government expects agriculture to recover sharply during the fourth quarter on top of a bumper winter crop, it is clear that it is the stellar performance of industry that will lift the GDP growth rate above 7 per cent. Manufacturing is expected to grow at 8.9 per cent. The mining and quarrying sector and the electricity, gas and water supply segment are predicted to post a growth rate of well over 8 per cent. The growth momentum is broad-based, with most of the sub-segments in industry and services performing above their long-term trends. The services sector, which is the traditional growth driver, is forecast to grow at around 8.3 per cent, less than last year. Construction as well as the segment comprising trade, hotels, transport, and communications will grow faster than last year. However, community, social and personal services may not do so well. With the spectre of high inflation looming large, the relatively strong growth might well induce the authorities to opt for a calibrated withdrawal of the stimulus packages.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Moving-towards-normal-growth/article16813996.ece
11,2,2010,Moving forward cautiously,"What separates affirmative action from discrimination is, sometimes, no more than a thin line. While Clause (1) of Article 15 of the Constitution of India bars discrimination “against any citizen on grounds only of religion,” Clause (4) specifically allows the State to make “any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes.” Large sections of Muslims are no doubt socially and educationally backward, and need the constitutionally-enabled special provision for reservation in education and employment. However, the challenge is to identify these backward sections by adopting a system that does not amount to extending the reservation benefits solely on the ground of religion, which is barred under the Constitution. In the case of the majority Hindu community, socially and economically backward castes, subject to some regional variations, have been identified for reservation benefits as socially and economically backward classes. The absence of an easily identifiable and permanent label akin to caste complicates matters for religious minorities. But social classes and vocational groups among the minorities whose counterparts in the majority community are regarded as backward should have access to the same reservation benefits. However, without a proper assessment of the social and educational conditions of different sections of Muslims, any ad hoc provision made by the State governments will be open to legal challenges.
In Andhra Pradesh, a four per cent reservation for selected sections of Muslims was made through the Andhra Pradesh Reservation in Favour of Socially and Educationally Backward Classes of Muslims Act, 2007, on the basis of the report of the A.P. Commission for Backward Classes. However, the Andhra Pradesh High Court found the Act “religion-specific” and the report of the Commission procedurally flawed. However, just as reservation benefits cannot be granted on grounds only of religion, they cannot also be held back on grounds of religion. The Scheduled Castes, who have suffered oppression in Hindu society, and the Scheduled Tribes, who have remained outside the social mainstream, fall under a different category of reservations, and the issue of extending the SC status to converts to other religions remains unresolved. However, there is no reason why affirmative action and reservations granted to the backward classes among the Hindus should not be extended to similarly placed sections among Muslims and other religious minorities. Instead of resorting to hasty measures that may not stand judicial scrutiny, the Centre and the States must formulate a comprehensive reservation scheme for the socially and educationally backward classes belonging to all religions including Islam, taking into consideration the recommendations of the Ranganath Mishra Commission.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Moving-forward-cautiously/article16813806.ece
11,2,2010,Endangered beauty,"The inclusion of Puntius denisonii, a strikingly beautiful fish found in the Kerala segment of the Western Ghats, in the IUCN Red List is an important step in the struggle to conserve the biodiversity of the hotspot. The endemic 15-cm-long shoaling species, known locally as “Miss Kerala” and commonly as the Denison barb, is sought after by aquarium enthusiasts for its attractive colouration. It has a flaming red streak running from its snout across part of the body. Exceptional good looks seem to have imperilled this inhabitant of fast-flowing streams to the point that the IUCN says it is now vulnerable. The deterioration of its habitat, already fragmented and restricted to a few rivers — notably the Cheenkannipuzha (a tributary of the Valapattanam river), Achankovil, and Chaliyar — poses as serious a challenge as the growing demand from the globalised ornamental fish market. For want of a monitoring mechanism, the Denison barbs are being massively harvested even in reserve forest areas. Fortunately, recognising the vulnerability of this fish to extinction in the wild, the Kerala government has initiated some action to curb unrestricted capture and export.
The scientific estimate of freshwater fish diversity in the Kerala segment of the Western Ghats is of the order of 207 species, including food, ornamental, and sport fishes. Many of these are under threat. Unfortunately, harvesting and trade in fish is not monitored closely, as in the case of other wildlife. This lacuna is highlighted by the IUCN in its Red List literature. Simultaneously, the scope for ‘river ranching’ — the cultivation of the species in captivity and its release in the wild — needs to be explored seriously. Some dedicated scientists in Kerala are working to improve the weak captive-breeding record of the Denison barb, but a low female-to-male ratio complicates the situation. Any success in boosting captive stocks could theoretically relieve pressure on wild populations, although strong vigil would be necessary to prevent fraudulent certification. For now, there is a good case for prohibiting the export of specimens, dead or live. Meanwhile, the State government must take effective action to mitigate threats to the habitat posed by mining, hydroelectric projects, deforestation, and urban expansion. India has a rich trove of inland freshwater fish diversity. The vulnerability of this fish underscores the need to aggressively protect it under wildlife and biodiversity laws.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Endangered-beauty/article16813805.ece
12,2,2010,Marshalling the States,"Over the past few months, the message that Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram has been delivering to Chief Ministers of the States hard-hit by Maoist violence is to prepare for tough action. Despite substantial investments in police infrastructure, and a steady surge of central forces, the Maoists face no imminent threat; the party and its armed cadre confront forces that are neither superior nor powerful. On February 9, Mr. Chidambaram held the latest in a series of meetings with Chief Ministers intended to set things right. For a variety of reasons linked to local political configurations, many States have been reluctant to join in the large-scale counter-Maoist operations. Hours before the meeting, Maoists succeeded in blowing up railway tracks in Jharkhand and Bihar. Despite this, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his Jharkhand counterpart Shibu Soren failed to show up for the meeting. Earlier, Mr. Chidambaram had met with Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh, Orissa’s Naveen Patnaik, and Maharashtra Home Minister R.R. Patil. Although Mr. Chidambaram said that progress in these States was satisfactory, the truth is that there was little success to report.
Ever since he took office as Home Minister, Mr. Chidambaram has been working hard to build a new architecture for addressing the Maoist threat, built around inter-State cooperation and intelligence-sharing. The sad truth, though, is that the bricks to support his architecture are just not in place. Ever since 2001, fatalities in the Maoist war have escalated steadily — 998 in 2009, just below the threshold widely used by scholars to define a high-intensity conflict. The escalation of violence has come at a time when other conflicts across the country, from Jammu and Kashmir to the North-East, are declining in intensity. By Mr. Chidambaram’s account, 223 districts — almost a third of India’s total — now face Maoist violence. While it is not true that Maoists control these territories, sustained violence has been witnessed in the jurisdiction of about 400 police stations in 90 districts. Last year, civilians and security forces accounted for more than 70 per cent of fatalities, up from 66 per cent in 2008. Underlying the failure of the forces to defend themselves or the people are years of neglect of police infrastructure and manpower — neglect that is impossible to set right in months, perhaps even years. Defeating the Maoists, as Andhra Pradesh has demonstrated, is indeed possible. It will require bottom-up commitment and hard work, though — something few States seem willing to engage in, the Union Home Minister’s efforts notwithstanding.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Marshalling-the-States/article13656819.ece
12,2,2010,Return to bipartisanship,"Bipartisanship, abandoned in the United States Congress over the last one year, may soon re-emerge. There have been several signs of a new, less rancorous style of American politics making its appearance this year. Last month saw a president-endorsed proposal come up for a bipartisan Senate commission to tackle the worrisome question of how to reduce the spiralling federal deficit. Though many senior Republicans were on board, the proposal did not survive the Senate vote that could have given it life. However in a rare departure from their usual lockstep voting pattern against contentious Democratic bills, 16 Republicans voted in favour of establishing the commission. Further, President Obama’s recent announcement of a bipartisan caucus on healthcare reform may portend an era of more consensual politics. While the discussants are likely to remain polarised on key dimensions of the legislation, the very act of meeting gives the reform effort a fighting chance through what Mr. Obama plainly described as “give-and-take.”
There are two factors hastening the return of bipartisan discourse in Washington. First, the stunning loss of the Massachusetts seat and the prospect of further Congressional defeats in November this year have compelled Mr. Obama to make serious efforts to bring the Republicans on board. He has good reason to do so — the “blanket hold” that Republican Senator Richard Shelby placed on 70-odd executive appointments (until $40 billion federal earmarks favouring his state were agreed) was a flagrant display of opportunism that may well become more recurrent. The reality is that the Obama administration is negotiating a complex matrix of policy goals — including job creation and economic recovery, deficit management, healthcare reform and several difficult areas of U.S. foreign policy engagement — and he needs a measure of Republican support to achieve this. Secondly, it is hardly surprising that the Republicans, still lacking strong leadership and a workable alternative to the Democratic agenda, are fixating on sound-byte-rich subjects such as healthcare reform and the deficit. Given the frustrations of sitting in opposition during a year when far-reaching policies were enacted, they will have to choose between sharing some of the responsibility of governing through bipartisan engagement and risking the charge of obstructionism via unnecessary filibuster. Under these circumstances, the President would do well to nurture the still-nascent initiative of reaching out across party lines, thus preventing partisan bitterness from bringing the legislative and executive processes to their knees.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Return-to-bipartisanship/article16814223.ece
15,2,2010,The way forward on Telangana,"With the Union government announcing the terms of reference and the time frame for the Telangana Committee, the proper course for the Joint Action Committee of political parties that is spearheading the agitation for a separate state would have been to wait for its report, due by December 31, 2010. The five-member Telangana committee headed by the former Supreme Court judge B.N. Srikrishna needs the time and the space for examining this contentious issue in all its aspects. People and parties are divided on the statehood question, and the terms of reference necessarily had to be broad and wide-ranging, accommodating the demands for both a Telangana state and for a united Andhra Pradesh. In any case, including one demand in the terms of reference would have implied dealing with the other and neither could have been considered in isolation. The JAC’s stand against the committee examining the demand for keeping Andhra Pradesh united mirrored that of the Telangana Rashtra Samiti, whose raison d’etre is a separate Telangana. Quite understandably, other parties, including those with high stakes in Telangana, were not willing to unqualifiedly fall in line with the JAC ’s ultimatums. The end-result could well leave the TRS friendless and lonely. Telangana accounts for 119 of the 294 members in the State Assembly, but only 12 of them have quit so far. Of these, 10 are from the TRS. Only one of the 39 Telugu Desam Party MLAs from the region resigned, while others decided to wait for the decision of the Congress MLAs from the region. As for the BJP, for long an unequivocal supporter of a Telangana State, one of its two MLAs from the region quit. An ineffective JAC, far from being able to convince all the legislators, was reduced to setting a deadline for other MLAs to quit.
Carving out smaller States is too important and complex an issue to be taken in the heat of inflamed passions and under the pressure of political agitations. In the absence of a political consensus, and when concerns are raised about the wider implications for the other parts of the State, decisions will have to be made after wide-ranging consultations, and on the basis of a well laid out road map. Those clamouring for a separate Telangana will surely help their own cause by extending full cooperation to the Srikrishna panel, instead of vitiating the atmosphere again by instigating violence or asking elected political representatives to resign. All stakeholders must ensure that the panel succeeds in its rather difficult task of balancing the interests and concerns of different sections and recommending a plan of action towards a solution, as set out in the terms of reference.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-way-forward-on-Telangana/article16814786.ece
15,2,2010,Investing in archaeology,"Another important archaeological puzzle could be solved on February 17 when the results of the DNA tests conducted on the celebrated Tutankhamun mummy will be revealed by the Egyptian government. This should establish the lineage of the short-lived pharaoh and determine his relationship with other mummies, including that of King Amenhotep III. The significance of these tests goes beyond furthering historical knowledge about Egypt’s ancient history. They are yet another convincing demonstration of how science can advance the frontiers of archaeology. It is a timely reminder to the Indian archaeological establishment that it must act purposefully to close the gap with the rest of the world in the application of science to the field. Where archaeology has embraced cutting edge methods, more of the unseen have been sighted, historical records have been set straight, and new directions discovered. If things go as planned for Egypt, robots will soon walk the hidden passageways of the Great Pyramid of King Khufu to reveal their secrets.
But what about the state of archaeology in India? The science branch of the Archaeological Survey of India was established as early as 1917, but it is mostly limited to chemical analysis and conservation. Limited studies in archaeomaterials have been taken up, but important disciplines such as Archaeological Prospection have not gained the attention they warrant. Central as well as State archaeological establishments need to get multidisciplinary and invest substantially in emerging sciences. It was only in 2008, following a ‘first-of-its-kind’ initiative by IIT Kanpur and the University of Allahabad that the ASI signed a Memorandum of Understanding to set up a Centre for Archaeological Sciences and Technologies at IIT Kanpur. This is a good beginning. However, given the large number of unexplored sites, such efforts need to be significantly scaled up and also be available at the State level. Two decades ago, permission was denied to researchers for making test-pits to study the foundation of the 1000-year-old Brihadisvara temple at Thanjavur. It is understandable that such techniques were treated with caution in that age. Today, difficult investigations can be safely undertaken with the help of less invasive methods such as three-dimensional, multi-offset ground-penetrating radar imaging. A well-researched road map for applying advanced S&T to uncovering the past must be the first new step towards closing the gap. It must be taken without wasting any further time.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Investing-in-archaeology/article16814785.ece
15,2,2010,Crafting an agenda for talks,"When the Foreign Secretaries of India and Pakistan meet in New Delhi on February 25, the challenge before them is to craft an agenda and a schedule for continuous interaction despite each having a very different set of immediate priorities. For India, ensuring sustained and effective action against terrorist groups based in Pakistan is the one issue that tops all others. Pakistan, on the other hand, is most concerned about water-related disputes, a relatively new ‘core issue’ in the already fraught bilateral relationship. The fact that Islamabad wants to talk about water does not square with its demand for the immediate resumption of the composite dialogue, since the latter includes just one of many current and future disputes, the Wullar Barrage-Tulbul navigation project on the Jhelum river. To that extent, India’s proposal for an open-ended agenda for the Foreign Secretaries’ meeting actually provides the two countries a more flexible format for official interaction on the issues that really animate them than the formal dialogue process which still lies suspended.
Saturday’s terrorist attack in Pune may or may not be the handiwork of Pakistan-based groups but the target and timing of the bomb blast have clearly been designed to evoke a comparison with the strike that took place in Mumbai in November 2008. The fact that, at a rally in Islamabad on February 5, a Jamaat-ud-Dawa spokesman threatened to target the Maharashtra city is also a reminder of the unfinished business Pakistan has to attend to on the terrorism front if it wants to build confidence and trust with India. In the absence of such confidence, talks can and should continue but it is hard to see how meaningful progress can be made on the water issue. India is not violating the Indus Waters Treaty and if Pakistan thinks it is, going for international arbitration is always an option. But as the upper riparian, there is much that India could do on its territory to develop and recharge the Indus river basin, which straddles the two countries. As the lower riparian, it is in Pakistan’s interest to seek Indian cooperation in a joint venture of this kind. That would require winning India’s trust, which, in turn, would require ensuring that the tap of terror is not just turned off but dismantled. In her meeting with her Pakistani counterpart, the Indian Foreign Secretary can do no better than to repeat what Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in Parliament last year: that India is prepared to meet Pakistan’s concerns on water or any other issue more than half-way provided Islamabad implements its commitments and acts against terrorist groups.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Crafting-an-agenda-for-talks/article16814544.ece
15,2,2010,The show does go on,"Like the storyline in a regulation Bollywood movie, the good guys finally won. The Shiv Sena’s diktat that the Shahrukh Khan-starrer My Name Is Khan must not be screened in Maharashtra has been met with welcome defiance with a clutch of multiplexes and cinema halls premiering the film on Friday. Many more that were initially reluctant to screen the film due to fear of violence and arson by Sena hooligans have overcome their apprehensions, resulting in the blockbuster being released in many parts of the State. A good part of the credit for refusing to be terrorised by Bal Thackeray’s storm troopers must go to a spirited public, particularly in Mumbai, which flocked to the cinema halls not only to see the film but also to cock a snook at the Sena. The Maharashtra government must also be commended for providing the enough security to make the cinema hall owners feel it was safe to release the film. But it is Shahrukh Khan himself who deserves the most praise for standing up to the Sena and for refusing to take the easy way out. The actor and co-owner of the Kolkata Knight Riders flatly rejected the Sena’s absurd demand that he apologise for saying Pakistani cricketers should have been picked for the Indian Premier League, if they were to allow his films to be released in Maharashtra.
The Bollywood film industry, which is acutely aware that box office collections in Maharashtra are critical to a film’s success, has traditionally kowtowed to the Sena and like-minded organisations. A few months ago, My Name is Khan’s director, Karan Johar, was coerced into apologising to Mr. Bal Thackeray’s estranged nephew Raj Thackeray after his Maharashtra Navnirman Sena hooligans stopped the screening of another of his films because it used the word ‘Bombay’ instead of ‘Mumbai.’ A welcome consequence of Mr. Khan’s decision to stand firm is that it has emboldened a section of the film industry to come out in his defence. The strong backlash against the Shiv Sena for attacking Mr. Khan (Mr. Thackeray went as far as calling him a “traitor’) is similar to what the organisation faced after criticising another national icon, Sachin Tendulkar, for saying that Mumbai belongs to India. Politically weakened after Mr. Raj Thackeray left to form the MNS, Mr. Bal Thackeray seems to be locked in a contest of competitive chauvinism with his nephew, with each trying to outdo the other by aggressively searching for ways to be in the public eye. The widespread revulsion against this form of parochial politics should consolidate the efforts to isolate parties such as the Shiv Sena and the MNS and demonstrate that the rule of law will prevail over threats and orchestrated violence.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-show-does-go-on/article16814542.ece
17,2,2010,The challenge from Pune,"Towards the close of 2009 which ended without a major terror attack, Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram said in a speech to the intelligence community that “there is the danger of a terror-free year inducing complacency, signs of which can be seen everywhere.” Last weekend, when a terrorist bomb ripped through the popular Germany Bakery in Pune, Mr. Chidambaram’s warning was underlined in stark relief. Ever since last summer, India’s intelligence services had been warning of a renewed offensive by Pakistan-based jihadist groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba. Police in several States, as well as neighbouring Bangladesh, had foiled multiple jihadist attack plans. In August, Indian communication intelligence detected plans to stage a car-bomb attack in Pune, while the interrogation of Pakistani-American jihadist David Headley made clear that the Lashkar had ambitious plans to stage large-scale attacks across India. Earlier this month, top Lashkar ideologue Abdur Rehman Makki had even held out explicit threats to target New Delhi, Kanpur, and Pune. But even though India’s police and intelligence services knew that Pune, apart from other cities, was facing a threat, they were unable to learn just when terrorists might strike and where.
If Saturday’s bombing does turn out to be the handiwork of Pakistan-based jihadist groups, Indian policymakers could soon find themselves confronting a difficult dilemma. Many in New Delhi’s policy community believe renewed operations by jihadist groups are the outcome of the desire of powerful elements in Pakistan’s military-dominated elite to maintain an adversarial relationship with India. This, the argument goes, is because tensions with India give Pakistan’s military an excuse to go slow in its ongoing offensive against Islamist groups at home -- a war many in Pakistan believe has been foisted on the country by the United States. Encouraging jihadists to target India allows Pakistan’s army to rebuild its long-standing relationship with the religious right, and to maintain its political primacy at home. If this turns out to be the case, it will bring India’s renewed efforts at dialogue with Pakistan under enormous pressure. Neither calling off the dialogue nor engaging in it will protect India from attack -- dialogue, after all, is only a process, not an outcome in itself. Pakistan’s half-measures against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks, as well as its refusal to dismantle the military infrastructure of the groups, illustrate the need to acquire the means to deal with a Pakistani establishment that seems to think it has nothing to gain from acting against anti-India terrorists. It is a situation that calls for a mature response that is firm and result-oriented and not one stemming from passions of the moment.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-challenge-from-Pune/article16815205.ece
17,2,2010,Yanukovych is back,"Opposition leader Viktor Yanukovych has clearly won, by a 3.48 percentage margin, Ukraine’s presidential election held recently. In keeping with the growing fashion, his antagonist, Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, has indicated that she will mount a court challenge to the outcome. International observers have testified that the election was transparent and unbiased, and was an “impressive display” of democracy. The European Union and the United States have endorsed the outcome. This contest has been a far cry from 2004, when electoral fraud and the annulment of Mr. Yanukovych’s ‘victory’ ushered in what came to be known as the ‘Orange Revolution’. Mr. Yanukovych has called on Ms Tymoshenko to resign her job as Prime Minister but if she proves defiant, he will have to decide between going for fresh parliamentary elections and doing business with Ms Tymoshenko for a while.
But what explains this political reversal in this strategically located east European nation? Virtually everyone concedes that the architects of the ‘Orange Revolution’ cynically betrayed the grand promises they made during that heady process. Outgoing President Viktor Yushchenko and the Prime Minister have been feuding incessantly. The economy has been thoroughly mismanaged. The russophobic and pro-NATO policies and postures of Mr. Yushchenko have been ill received by the people, 33 per cent of whom have Russian as their mother tongue. A Pravda commentary captures the essence of what happened: “The Ukrainians did not want to join NATO, the Ukrainians did not want to be colonised by the European Union. They want jobs, they want schools, they want hospitals, they want to eat.” Domestically, the influence of oligarchs is a threat to democracy and Ms Tymoshenko herself is alleged to have amassed enormous wealth in the energy sector in the 1990s. Internationally, Kiev’s relations with Moscow have been recklessly mishandled. The President-elect, who has a strong support base in the largely ethnic-Russian East and South, says he will improve Ukrainian-Russian relations and lift restrictions on the use of Russian in schools and the media. Ukraine will not join NATO, and Russia’s Black Sea fleet will continue to be based at the Crimean port of Sevastopol. If Mr. Yanukovych pays attention to the basic problems of the people, works for clean governance, and establishes a new equilibrium in external relations, he can expect to lead his nation to a period of political stability and prosperity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Yanukovych-is-back/article16815206.ece
18,2,2010,The funding gap persists,"Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has flagged an area of serious concern while speaking about the development of infrastructure. With just two years left in the current Five-Year Plan, he says that at the present flow of investment it may not be possible to raise the $514 billion required during this period. The Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode has become the preferred option of both the Central and State governments. Though the inflow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has shown an upward trend, it does not really help since much of it goes into the capital market. The future of the Indian economy, which is expected to grow at about 7.2 per cent this year, seems tied to the growth of the infrastructure sector. Economists and investment analysts suggest that the tardy progress in infrastructure development could shave off up to two percentage points in the overall growth. To return to a nine per cent growth trajectory, removing infrastructure bottlenecks is critical. A PPP policy has been enunciated, rules have been framed for the collection of toll in the roads sector, and the State governments have also realised that the yawning gap in infrastructure could be bridged only through FDIs and adoption of the PPP. Despite all this, not much seems to be happening on this crucial front.
Of the key sectors coming under the infrastructure umbrella — roads, ports, airports, telecommunication, transport, and power — only the telecom sector has maintained its significant rate of growth, thanks to the sustained initiatives and open competition. After a heady start nearly a decade ago, the programme for the development and upgradation of the National Highways has lost momentum, with just 20 per cent of the target of 50,000 km achieved by mid-2009. A global recession hit the aviation sector hard, slowing down the progress in the development and expansion of airports. The sea ports remain the weakest link in the chain. There has been a renewed interest in the power sector, especially in the non-conventional areas. But even the ultra-mega power projects show very tardy progress. An acute shortage of gas, thanks to the low priority accorded to the energy sector, has further hit power generation, leading to continued power cuts. The governments at the Centre and in the States need to remove the policy constraints and institutional hurdles to investment, implement announced policies, put a credible regulatory mechanism in place for each sector, and come up with a transparent dispute-resolution process. A fair, open, and rational tariff structure needs to be built into all PPP ventures.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-funding-gap-persists/article16815275.ece
18,2,2010,Reaching out to small investors,"The government needs to draw the right lessons from the recently concluded public offer of the National Thermal Power Corporation, which is among the most valuable of government-owned companies. Its follow-on public offer of 412,273,220 equity shares was fully subscribed only because of the sizable support it received from the Life Insurance Corporation of India and the State Bank of India. But, the portion of the share offer reserved for retail investors was grossly undersubscribed. After the NTPC, several other top performing government-owned undertakings — for instance, the Rural Electrification Corporation and the National Mineral Development Corporation — are expected to come up with public offer of shares. By offering a small part of its huge holdings in these undertakings, the government wants to mop up funds by way of capital receipts, thanks to the urgent need for it to bridge the ballooning fiscal deficit. Public enterprises like the NTPC that are already listed have been asked to increase the size of their public float up to 10 per cent of the equity capital. Those that are profitable but have not been listed so far have been asked to do so.
In the NTPC issue, although the fiscal objective has been realised with the full subscription, the meagre retail response means that another important objective, namely wide participation, has not been achieved. Share offers by profitable public enterprises are expected to spread the equity culture, which is now at abysmal levels and skewed in favour of specific regions. Investors who are more safety conscious would provide the government company with a stable, diffused shareholding. The principal reason why a substantial section of retail investors has shunned the NTPC issue is the high floor price — of Rs.201 a share — in relation to the market price of around Rs.205. Investors have evidently preferred to wait and pick up the shares without having to go through the issue process. It is true that market conditions turned adverse on the day the issue opened but any deft management of public issue should take into account all the contingencies. A suggestion has been made that retail investors should be given incentives, preferably a relatively large discount in the floor price. A wide range of facilities to increase retail participation including wider access to bank finance and new investor friendly schemes such as Applications Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA) should be provided. The divestment programme has yielded rich returns to the NTPC and others embarking on a follow-on issue. Their valuation has more than trebled. There is no reason to deny the small shareholder the benefits.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Reaching-out-to-small-investors/article16815276.ece
19,2,2010,India's flawed fight against Maoists,"Mao Zedong's famous aphorism on guerrilla war is taught at counter-insurgency courses across the world: “the enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue.” It is unlikely the 24 police officers slaughtered by Maoist insurgents in West Bengal's Silda area earlier this week, or the forces who failed to respond to the massacre of villagers in the Bihar village of Kasari, had ever heard of the dictum – or had the opportunity to acquire the skills needed to fight the war they had been thrust into. Like police officers across the country, the forces who failed to defend innocent lives in Bihar, and to protect their own in West Bengal, had received only rudimentary training. Neither State has the facilities to impart anything other than routine parade-ground drills and outdated firing-range training to their armed forces. India's Maoist insurgents are not the fearsome adversaries the media sometimes make them out to be. Like the police, they are badly trained and equipped. However, the insurgents have the advantage of knowledge of the terrain and the ability to melt into the population. In Andhra Pradesh, the crack Greyhounds counter-insurgency force has demonstrated that Maoist units crumble when confronted by skilled adversaries. The tragedies at Silda and Kasari have made it clear that simply pumping ill-trained police into the countryside will do nothing to win the insurgency.
If the battle against the Maoists is to be won, States will have to show the vision and resolve to create infrastructure of the kind Andhra Pradesh has built. The task, sadly, will need years of work. As this newspaper has pointed out on several occasions, India just does not have the numbers of police personnel needed to ensure law and order in normal circumstances, let alone protracted insurgencies. The United Nations recommend that 222 police officers be available for every 100,000 population; India has an average of just 125. In Bihar, the ratio is as low as 60 for every 100,000. Some of the States worst affected by Maoist violence also have an extremely poor presence of police, given their geographical area. Where New Delhi has 3,953 police officers in every 100 square km of its territory, Chhattisgarh has 22, Jharkhand 50, and Bihar 59. Police stations — the basic unit on which any security response depends — are decrepit, and often lack modern communication systems. In addition, the forces available have almost no meaningful training in counter-insurgency tactics. The Union government has sought to fill the void by pumping in Central Reserve Police Force units. While central forces have succeeded in restoring a semblance of order in some areas, their record of successful counter-Maoist operations has been poor. The central and State governments need to work together to draw up a map for building modern police infrastructure — or India's citizens will continue to pay a horrible price.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Indias-flawed-fight-against-Maoists/article13656818.ece
19,2,2010,Politics under economics,"At first sight, the Greek financial crisis poses serious problems for Greece, for the euro, and possibly for the status and standing of the European Union. The data are bleak. The GDP fell by 0.8 per cent in the last quarter of 2009, following slides of one, 0.3, and 0.5 per cent respectively in the previous three quarters; the government's own prediction of a 2010 slide of 0.3 per cent is widely considered an underestimate. The crisis has already had an impact, with the euro falling to $1.35 at one point, and all 16 eurozone countries face further falls through sales of the euro. The ratings agency Standard and Poor has downgraded the Greek sovereign debt. That makes the country's recent €2.5 billion three-month debt sale risky, as it implies Athens's lack of confidence in its own longer-term economic future. As for the EU, its rules allow bailouts only over specific projects, and it wants IMF help to be the last resort. France and Germany have expressed support, but privately accept that the eurozone might need to do more.
Closer analysis, however, shows a much more politically loaded picture. Prime Minister George Papandreou has pointed out that the crisis is largely the making of the previous conservative government. Secondly, the Chief Economist of the European Central Bank, Jürgen Stark, has confirmed that Athens manipulated economic statistics for years, which the EU's own monitoring procedures missed. Chancellor Angela Merkel's initial rejection of support for Athens may well have been motivated by the need not to alienate her coalition partner, the neoliberal Guido Westerwelle. The ideological issues involved are highly significant. The ratings agencies themselves gave major commercial banks top ratings just before those bodies collapsed in 2007-8. Finally, it must be remembered that other eurozone states and the international financial institutions may be acting as much out of ideological antipathy towards Greece's centre-left government as anything else. The IMF is notorious for ordering states to slash health and education spending as a precondition for loans. That would hit ordinary Greeks, among the worst paid workforces in the EU, very hard. Mr. Papandreou needs urgently to devise a workable and sustainable strategy to cope with these forces and factors.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Politics-under-economics/article16815443.ece
20,2,2010,Important caveats,"The politicisation of policing is rampant across Indian States. When the police come under political pressure, they are known to serve as the handmaiden of the ruling party, whether in covering up failures and misdeeds of the administration or in targeting political opponents. In many such instances, courts have intervened in the interest of an impartial probe and ordered investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation. Therefore the ruling of a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court that the highest court in the land and the High Courts have the power to order, without the consent of the State government concerned, an investigation by the CBI into cognisable offences committed within its territory comes as no surprise. But importantly, while upholding the constitutional validity of an existing judicial practice, the court entered certain crucial caveats. Calling for great caution on this issue, the Bench asked the courts to “bear in mind certain self-imposed limitations on the exercise of these constitutional powers.” While disagreeing with the contention that the ordering of a CBI probe without the State government's consent would impinge on the federal structure of the Constitution and violate the doctrine of separation of powers, the Supreme Court ruled that such orders could not be passed as a matter of routine or on the basis of allegations against the local police by a party.
However, the judgment raises several other issues and concerns. For one thing, the CBI too is not insulated from political pressures. As was evident in the Bofors case, the CBI is susceptible to pressures from the central government just as the State police forces are to pressures from the party in power in the State. Preferring one agency at the expense of another is not the solution. Institutional mechanisms must be put in place to protect investigating agencies from the influence of their political masters. It is a sound principle of law that courts should not normally intervene at the stage of investigation; judicial intervention at this stage should come only in the face of overwhelming evidence of a possible miscarriage of justice. This is also because the primary responsibility for maintaining law and order rests with the State government, and ‘police' is in the State list. Courts have shown a tendency to overreach, to encroach on the powers of the executive. Each encroachment is made in the name of protecting civil liberties and fundamental rights of the citizens. But every time the courts do so without sufficient reason, the foundations of the Constitution are shaken. Wrong use of extraordinary provisions is the surest way of undermining them.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Important-caveats/article16815663.ece
20,2,2010,Test cricket is best,"In an era of rampant commercialism and the rumbustious rise of Twenty20 cricket, pessimism regarding the well-being and future of the grand old game of Test cricket is common. But any suggestion of its impending demise is way off the mark. That the structure of the five-day game has a built-in resilience that helps it triumph over existential challenges was once again demonstrated in the second Test between India and South Africa in Kolkata. If the home team deserved credit for turning things around brilliantly after a pasting in the first Test at Nagpur, the operatic irresistibility of the Eden Gardens climax proved that Test cricket is in robust good health. Seat-edge endings in the abbreviated forms of the game often appear contrived and formulaic. But a result such as the one that saw India level the series against the Proteas with nine balls left has an authenticity that Test cricket alone can aspire to. It is a pity that it was not a full series of three or five Test matches and was squeezed in only after the Board of Control for Cricket in India was criticised for favouring the ODI and T20 formats at the expense of Test cricket. While it would be naïve to suggest that limited overs cricket might be a passing fad, it is the duty of the game's administrators to ensure that the best in the business play one another more often in Tests.
Which other form of the game provides the space for the sort of heroism that Hashim Amla displayed over the last two days at Eden Gardens? The South African, who batted 1,033 deliveries for 490 runs in three innings, exemplified the virtues of the longest format all through the series. He began at Nagpur with an unbeaten double hundred, after which his illustrious colleague, Dale Steyn, ripped the heart out of India's batting with a classical demonstration of pace bowling. Amla's battle with Harbhajan Singh on the final day in Kolkata was intriguing, although the tenacious Indian off-spinner triumphed in the end. But it was also a series that will be remembered for the batting exploits of Sachin the Great, world cricket's most thrilling batsman Virender Sehwag, exquisite strokemaker V.V.S. Laxman as well as the prodigiously accomplished Jacques Kallis and the ever-dependable M. S. Dhoni. In the end, India deserved to hold on to its No.1 Test ranking because it showed strength of character. After losing the toss and letting South Africa rattle up over 200 runs for the loss of just one wicket on the opening day, Dhoni's men played with great belief, commitment, and offensive skills to rewrite the script on a sporting wicket that made five days of old-fashioned cricket such a pleasure to behold.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Test-cricket-is-best/article16815664.ece
21,2,2010,Need for caution on fertilizers,"Armed with Cabinet approval, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee seem all set to introduce the new nutrient-based subsidy (NBS) policy for fertilizer pricing in the Union Budget to be presented on February 26. The move has generated controversy with the Left parties attacking it as anti-farmer and even parties within the United Progressive Alliance government such as the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam expressing reservations about the impact of the new policy on the farm gate price for fertilizers. If the sole purpose behind the NBS policy was to promote the balanced use of different nutrients like nitrogen, potash, phosphorous, and sulphur, there would be no reason for anyone to object. The excessive use of urea, for example, has pushed nitrogen in the soil to a high level in many parts of India, affecting crop production. That certain nutrients are used indiscriminately because of price despite their inappropriateness for particular crops, soil and local ecologies is a problem that needs to be addressed, in part, by the revival of agricultural extension services that were one of the first casualties of the reforms process two decades ago. But the proposed fertilizer subsidy scheme stems from another impulse: the desire to decontrol prices.
While assurances have been sought, and reportedly received, from the fertilizer industry that the price line would be maintained around the current level during the 2010 kharif season, there are sound reasons to worry about what will happen to fertilizer prices thereafter. The squeeze on India's farmers began way back in 1991 when Finance Minister Manmohan Singh first began to reduce the fertilizer subsidy. As input prices increased, farmers, especially those with marginal, small, and medium holdings, reduced their fertilizer consumption with detrimental effects upon yields. The price mismatch across different nutrients further complicated the picture. The NBS policy might make all fertilizers available at uniform rates, thus allowing the farmer to choose what is best for his land without worrying about opportunity cost. But if overall prices start rising, farmers are likely to cut back. That this is more than likely to happen is clear from the reaction of the industry. From the retention price system of the 1970s to the price system prevailing now, fertilizer companies have been clear that the only way they can realise their “full potential” is by full decontrol. Short of that, the industry was lobbying for a nutrient-based fixed subsidy alongside the freedom to set the maximum retail prices (MRPs). The UPA's new policy is in line with this wish.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Need-for-caution-on-fertilizers/article16816061.ece
21,2,2010,Focussing on fiscal consolidation,"The Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council's Review of the Economy 2009-10, coming as it does just a few days before the Union Budget, is particularly significant this year. The EAC has brought up to date the major macroeconomic trends, a task that will be carried forward by the Economic Survey and the budget. While sharing its growing optimism with other official as well as non-official agencies , the EAC has entered certain caveats. Significantly, in projecting the economic growth, it has sharply revised upwards its October forecast of 6.5 per cent, pegging the rate at 7.2 per cent with an upward bias and thereby endorsing the CSO's advance estimates. The EAC is not alone in marking up the growth forecasts since the beginning of the year. The Reserve Bank of India, in its review of the third quarter, had estimated a growth rate of 7.5 per cent, sharply higher than its own earlier forecast of 6 per cent. The mid-year Economic Survey had said that the economy will grow by 7.75 per cent. Even if the optimism is justified and the economy actually grows at around 7.5 per cent, it would still be below the 9 per cent-plus growth recorded in the three years beginning 2005-06. It is, however, clear the economy is surely on its way back to a higher trajectory. The EAC expects the economic growth to touch 8.2 per cent in 2010-11 and 9 per cent the next year.
The two principal worries are inflation and the “unsustainable” fiscal situation. While concurring with the RBI's projection of 8.5 per cent WPI inflation, the EAC assesses that the high food inflation now hovering over 18 per cent could spill over to other sectors if corrective steps are not taken immediately. They include timely release of food grains for the public distribution system and import of essential commodities that are in short supply. Holding that the large revenue and fiscal deficits recorded over the last two years cannot be allowed to continue despite their proven counter-cyclical effects, the EAC wants the fiscal consolidation to be attempted without in any way affecting the stimulus aspect. With adequate fiscal adjustment, it would not be difficult to reduce the Centre's fiscal deficit by one to 1.5 per cent of the GDP in 2010-11. Disinvestment and spectrum auctions will boost revenues by 0.8 per cent. There is little scope for compressing capital expenditure while effecting fiscal correction. Infrastructure spending remains critical. Correctives must focus more on expenditure management since much of the fiscal expansion is attributable to increases in expenditure rather than tax cuts.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Focussing-on-fiscal-consolidation/article16816060.ece
23,2,2010,Fingerprinting history,"Even ancient history does not stand still. Many of history's secrets lie locked inside the human genome. DNA studies have revealed patterns of early human migration around the world. They have shown that all of us probably descended some 60,000 years ago from a group of ancestors in what is now Ethiopia. In 1998, genetic tests on the descendants of Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, and Sally Hemings, a slave in his household, showed (alongside other evidence) that he is likely to have fathered at least one of her children. Now, and rather more dramatically, a battery of tests on 11 Egyptian mummies, including analysis of DNA samples and CT scans, has thrown up a fascinating body of evidence about the life and paternity of Ancient Egypt's best-known king — Tutankhamen (1351-1334 BC). The findings may disappoint some mystery writers and others who speculated about the boy Pharaoh's medical condition and end. The groundbreaking study, led by Zahi Hawass of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, shows that King Tut's death at the age of 19 was probably a result of malaria (complicated by a degenerative bone condition) and not murder. His death has been a subject of feverish speculation after X-rays of his skull in the late 1960s revealed a fracture (now known to be caused by the process of mummification). Various scholars, going on the basis of artefacts portraying him in an androgynous manner, speculated he could have died from a slew of rare illnesses, including Marfan syndrome.
The main objective of the study by Hawass et al — the results of which are published in the February 17, 2010 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association — was to determine the “familial relationship of the 11 mummies,” including that of Tut, and to search for “pathological features attributable to possible murder, consanguinity, inherited disorders, and infectious diseases.” Genetic fingerprinting has established a plausible pedigree that spans five generations. The study suggests his parents were the ‘heretic' Pharaoh Akhenaten and one of his sisters, his great grandparents were Yuva and Thuya, and the two stillborn foetuses found in his tomb were likely to be his children. Tut was a relatively minor Pharaoh in ancient Egypt's history. His present fame is linked to the wonderful treasures retrieved from his tomb, which was discovered by archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922. Yet it was under the rule of Tut, aided by powerful advisers such as Ay, that the traditional priesthoods and gods, banished under the iconoclastic Akhenaten, were restored. What we have just learnt about King Tut and his kin is a demonstration of the awesome power of science to rediscover our past.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Fingerprinting-history/article16816270.ece
23,2,2010,Trying to change,"At the Bharatiya Janata Party's National Council meet at Indore, the new man in, Nitin Gadkari, scored high on style quotient. Summing up the mood were the lyrics from an old Bollywood song to which he swayed: life is a puzzle; it makes you cry and it makes you laugh. With two defeats in succession, the BJP has lately had more occasions to cry than laugh, and it was clear to those who watched the proceedings that Mr. Gadkari — his easy, genteel manner notwithstanding — was not about to let the drift continue. In his addresses, the BJP chief touched upon a multiplicity of issues: indiscipline in party ranks; the trend in the upper echelons towards ostentation and personal ambition; the need to widen the party's catchment area by roping in the poor, especially Dalits; and of course, the mandatory doffing of the hat to Ayodhya and the Ram Mandir. Mr. Gadkari set himself apart in other ways too, plainly telling partypersons not to touch his feet or flatter him in the hope of easy rewards.
For the BJP, Mr. Gadkari is its first bit of good news in a long time. Whatever the impact of his plain speaking on the party's squabbling second-rung leadership, it is a fair bet that the rank and file will welcome the shift towards commitment and hard work. Yet his objectives are easier outlined than achieved. Personal ambition and factionalism have taken deep root in a party once known for its difference but now self-avowedly revelling in “seven-star” culture. Nor can an innately exclusivist party suddenly train itself to embrace a broad-based, inclusive agenda. Mr. Gadkari's own words illustrate the inherent difficulty of achieving this transition. The BJP chief pleaded with the Muslim community to voluntarily hand over the Ram Mandir site to Hindus and, in the same breath, decried the “appeasement” of Muslims. A spokesperson's clarification that the reference was to the Congress general secretary, Digvijay Singh visiting alleged terrorists in Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh made the meaning worse. It implied that visiting alleged terrorists amounted to appeasing Muslims. In setting a broader agenda for the BJP, Mr. Gadkari is simply trying to make a virtue of necessity. In truth, the BJP is in dire straits. Its May 2009 general election performance was its worst in two decades. The party's allies have deserted it and its equations with those that remain, including the trusted Shiv Sena, are shaky. And while Mr. Gadkari may have taken potshots at the Gandhi dynasty, he ought to know that that function is fulfilled in the BJP by its mentor in Jhandewalan.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Trying-to-change/article16816262.ece
24,2,2010,Evasions on torture,"On the ABC News programme ‘This Week' on February 14, former United States Vice-President Dick Cheney openly advocated torture, and confirmed that while in office he authorised it in over 30 cases. In the United Kingdom, the Court of Appeal accepted a Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) request on February 8 that a passage be removed from a draft judgment confirming that the British security services had been complicit in torture. The deletion overrides a precedent set in 1637 that there must be no secret communication between lawyers and courts during proceedings. The senior appeal judge, Lord Neuberger, the head of the civil judiciary in England and Wales, seems to have assumed, incorrectly, that the FCO had followed the normal practice of copying its request to all the other parties, among whom are rights NGOs and certain British and American media organisations. The FCO claimed that publication would damage the U.S.-U.K. intelligence-sharing agreement under which British bodies had obtained the relevant information and would therefore jeopardise national security. The case related to Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian citizen and U.K. resident, who was arrested in Pakistan in 2002, sent to Morocco and Afghanistan where he was tortured, and held at Guantánamo Bay for five years without charge or trial.
The other parties in the case intervened with the appeal court, and on February 10 the court ordered the FCO to publish the material involved. The American and British reactions to both reveal calculated evasions. Mr. Cheney has effectively admitted to war crimes, and the U.S. has in the past prosecuted Japanese soldiers, as well as Texan police officers, for waterboarding. In the U.K., Alan Johnson, Home Minister, and Kim Howells, who chairs the House of Commons Intelligence and Security Committee, have respectively attacked the media and commentators for spreading “groundless accusations,” “ludicrous lies,” and a “calumny and a slur” by saying the security services had colluded in torture. Since the appeal ruling, Foreign Minister David Miliband has said the legal position has not changed, as the details had already emerged in a U.S. court. A White House official, on condition of anonymity, says the intelligence-sharing agreement stands. The British government is, however, only trying to explain away the fact that it has systematically concealed torture and political embarrassment under unjustified claims of threats to national security. With such a record, western criticism of other states' rights records rings quite hollow.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Evasions-on-torture/article16816723.ece
24,2,2010,A catalogue of good intentions,"As expected, Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee has presented her second budget without any increase in passenger fares or freight tariff. In fact, she announced a marginal reduction in service charges for sleeper and air-conditioned class tickets, as also a cut of Rs.100 per wagon in the freight of food grains and kerosene as a response to rising prices. Otherwise, the 2010-11 budget will be remembered for its intentions and policy pronouncements rather than for specific budgetary measures. For instance, she has promised to come up with a business model for the Railways, to set up a task force for clearing private investment in Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects within 100 days, and to find innovative funding methods to operationalise the ambitious ‘Vision 2020' plan tabled in Parliament. Despite the slowdown in the economy, the Railways hopes to exceed its announced freight loading target of 882 million tonnes this year and touch 890 million tonnes. The target for next year has been set at an ambitious 944 million tonnes. To ward off criticism that she was focussing inordinately on her home State, West Bengal, where elections are due next year, Ms Banerjee has tried to evenly spread the proposed new projects and trains among different regions. She has promised an India-Bangladesh rail link to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore.
Among the positive features is the Minister's promise to add 1000 route-kilometres of railway track this year, as against an annual average of just over 180 km over the past decade. The budget allocation for metro projects has been raised by 55 per cent over last year. A record Plan outlay of Rs.41,426 crore has been proposed for the coming year, but nearly a fourth of it is to come from market borrowings. Although Ms Banerjee repeatedly spoke of the PPP mode to speed up the implementation of the infrastructure projects, she did not indicate any specific framework, and the markets were not enthused. Following the signing of an MoU with the Health Ministry, the Railways announced plans to set up 381 medical diagnostic centres. Five sports academies and a National Authority to plan high speed corridors for passenger traffic, on the lines of the Dedicated Freight corridors, are among the other noteworthy announcements. Perhaps the most significant focus has been on the critical areas of safety and security. Apart from expanding the high-tech Train Protection Warning System, the Minister committed herself to strengthening the Railway Protection Force and raising 12 companies of women in this force. Industry hopes that Ms Banerjee will come up with a detailed framework for PPP before long to realise her vision.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-catalogue-of-good-intentions/article16816724.ece
24,2,2010,In deep crisis,"India's national carrier, Air India, severely hit by financial crisis, still remains in the intensive care unit. Though the government has decided to infuse equity to an extent of Rs.800 crore, nothing seems to be going right for the National Aviation Company of India Limited, the new corporate entity created by merging Air India and Indian Airlines in 2007. For one thing, the process of merger is yet to be completed. Secondly, the losses are mounting month after month — currently Rs.400 crore a month, on average. A year after the formal merger, the losses had doubled to Rs.5,548 crore (2008-09). The airline is so badly strapped for cash that it needs Rs.1,000 crore more as working capital for just staying afloat and maintaining its services at the present level. Already, its working capital borrowings have piled up to Rs.16,000 crore, with the accumulated losses adding up to about Rs.7,000 crore. It appears that Air India is caught in a vicious circle. Wherever it turns to for assistance, it is required to come up with a road map for turning the company around. Given the airline's predicament where it cannot even pay for the fuel or clear the wage arrears of the staff, scaling up its operations — necessary for earning more revenue — is unthinkable in the absence of a lifeline.
At the Board of Directors' meeting last week, the proposal to hive off its strategic business units and make them independent, commercial entities was dropped from the agenda. So far, the company's efforts at raising funds have not borne fruit. It has to work out an actionable turnaround plan before the government can firm up, on the advice of the Group of Ministers concerned, further steps to resuscitate the airline. This means there has to be wide consultation involving the management, administrative staff, and trade unions to hammer out such a plan, whose components will include: rationalisation of wages and work force, discharge of debts, fleet expansion through induction of the latest aircraft, and an end to the culture of political interference in management. Air India has been calling for a level playing field in operations vis-à-vis private carriers. All these issues have been discussed intensely and at different levels in the past. But there has been no consensus on any of the issues that are critical for the viability of the airline. The government cannot be expected to keep pumping huge sums of money unless it is convinced that the airline has a comprehensive and practical plan of action for its revival. The bottom line should, of course, be the financial viability and sustainability of Air India. Time is running out, and the management must get its act together before it is too late.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/In-deep-crisis/article16816577.ece
24,2,2010,Hair reveals our past,"In less than 10 years after the human genome from a living individual was first sequenced, scientists have successfully sequenced a complete ancient human genome (only partial ancient human genomes and mitochondrial DNA have been sequenced in the past). The study was published recently in Nature. The sample studied was one of the four excellently preserved human tufts from a male paleo-Eskimo obtained from about 4,000-year-old permafrost at Qeqertasussuk, Greenland. As against the gold standard of sequencing the genome 10 times, the ancient human genome was sequenced 20 times over nearly 80 per cent of its length. Repeated sequencing helps enhance the level of accuracy, ensuring that any differences seen between ancient and modern human genomes are true. There is great interest in studying ancient humans to understand the routes of human migration from Africa. The ancient human's mitochondrial DNA sequenced in 2008 helped in identifying him as belonging to Saqqaq culture of East Siberia. Tracing the route of migration from East Siberia to Greenland through Alaska and Canada also became possible by comparing the ancient human genome with modern genome data; Saqqaqs had split from Chukchis, their closest relatives, some 5,500 years ago.
Sequencing the nuclear DNA and comparing the functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with modern human genome data helped in identifying his appearance and roots. The study revealed that he had brown eyes, dark thick hair, and brown skin, which are typical Asian characteristics. His shovel-graded front teeth and earwax of the dry type are typical of Asians and native Americans. His metabolism and body mass index indicates that he was adapted to living in a cold climate. Sequencing the complete ancient genome became possible as hair tufts were excellently preserved in permafrost. However, the samples recovered in 1986 were stored at room temperature in the National History Museum of Denmark, Copenhagen, until they were studied recently. Past studies in humans and animals have shown that unlike bones and teeth, hair shafts are able to preserve mitochondrial DNA in larger quantities and for longer periods of time even at room temperature; the shaft's melanin material probably prevents DNA damage. But the latest study has shown that it is indeed possible to extract nuclear DNA from hair shafts, especially when hair is preserved in ice. The real challenge will be to extract nuclear DNA from samples recovered from temperate and tropical regions, where the majority of ancient human remains are found.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Hair-reveals-our-past/article16816500.ece
26,2,2010,A balanced review,"In line with the recent optimistic forecasts by both official and non-official agencies, the pre-Budget Economic Survey estimates that the economy could grow by as high as 8.75 per cent during 2010-11 and move to 9 per cent the next year. It is a tribute to India's economic management that the economy seems certain to grow, so soon after the global crisis, by a highly respectable 7 per cent-plus this year. A double-digit growth does not seem out of reach within the next four years. Economic growth is well supported by strong fundamentals. Gross domestic savings stood at 32.5 per cent of GDP in 2008-09, while the gross domestic capital formation was 34.9 per cent. This record places India on a par with the world's fastest growing economies. The outlook for foreign trade is improving with both world output and trade volumes picking up, though how fragile the recovery is remains unclear. The broad-based recovery creates room for a gradual roll-back of the stimulus offered over the last 18 months. Those measures are necessary to push the economy back into the higher growth trajectory.
Pegging the gross fiscal deficit at 6.5 per cent of the GDP for this year, the Survey has recommended replacing the current defective subsidy schemes that control the issue prices of food, fertilizer, diesel, and kerosene by a system that places money directly in the hands of the beneficiaries to be used for purchases in the open market. At present, while the high level of subsidies meant a major fiscal burden for the government and consequently curtailed the scope for public spending in critical areas such as poverty alleviation, the benefits do not get substantially passed on to the targeted sections of the population. According to the Survey, it is a mistake to assume that a subsidy scheme has to be coupled with price control. The best way to intervene is to help the poor directly instead of controlling the price. However, the government is unlikely to dismantle marketing subsidies soon, ignoring political opposition. The high consumer price inflation is a major worry and a political embarrassment as well. Ominously since December, the high food prices and the gradual hardening of non-administered fuel prices are getting transmitted to other non-food items, and they are very likely to push the inflation further over the next few months. Many of the Survey's policy prescriptions are not new but their emphasis at this point is certainly significant. It remains to be seen how exactly its hard-headed economic analysis is tempered by political realities in the Budget.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-balanced-review/article16816961.ece
26,2,2010,Sachin's summit,"At a time when immediacy masquerades as relevance in sport, a nuanced understanding of true greatness evades us. It takes something as monumental as what Sachin Tendulkar achieved in Gwalior against a South African side of no little quality to prompt us to filter out the shrill absurdities and begin to examine the contours of real greatness. Tendulkar turns 37 in April — he has long passed the age when every failure a batsman suffers is investigated for evidence of fading eyesight and slowing reflexes. Yet he continues to confound us, constantly forcing us to review and revise the limiting parameters against which great batsmen — and indeed great athletes — are measured. No other Indian sportsperson has been quite as adept at pressing our awe-buttons as Tendulkar. The maestro's double-century, the first such instance in the 2962 One Day Internationals held so far, is significant at many levels. Every time a barrier is breached, every time something seems possible only in theory is realised, some of the patterns of collective mental conditioning are broken. Tendulkar, in achieving this feat of will and endurance in his 21st year of international cricket, has not merely exploded the myths common to ageing sportspersons; he has also shown again that longevity is the most functional of metrics in assessing greatness.
“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then, is not an act, but a habit,” said Aristotle. It is a habit that few athletes have exemplified as well as Tendulkar for more than two decades. Sporting immortality is achieved by quickly erasing dark memories of the odd intimations of mortality. Even so great a batsman as Tendulkar has had his lows, and his lowest perhaps occurred when he was booed off his home ground, the Wankhede Stadium, in March 2006. But he has sparked a renaissance, batting on occasion without ego, playing a shrewder, safer game, but every so often reprising the rousing, intuitive style of his younger days. The last 12 months, in particular, have seen more of the latter: he has during this period made 10 international centuries, six in Tests and four in ODIs (including three scores of over 150); most of them have evoked a sense of glorious lightness. He has 93 international centuries, and if he progresses at the same rate, the staggering achievement of 100 centuries could be his by the end of the year. But numbers, however impressive, do not offer the measure of a man. These days Tendulkar is often asked what motivates him now that he has achieved nearly every batting record. His answer has always been the same: he loves the game. It is this simple, unaffected love that has allowed him to adorn cricket without appearing bigger than the game.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Sachins-summit/article16816960.ece
27,2,2010,A delicate balance,"Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee's strategy of a partial rollback of the fiscal stimulus package in his Budget is not without its risks, given particularly the uncertainty over the external environment. Yet it is a measure of the government's confidence that the move to a higher growth path of 7.2 per cent this year and to a projected 8.2 per cent next year is sustainable even in the absence of the stimulus that it has reversed course and sought to raise Rs.46,500 crore through indirect taxes. Though this is offset partially by the direct tax concessions totalling Rs.26,000 crore, the net revenue raised, together with the expected buoyancy in a year of robust growth, has enabled the Finance Minister to keep the fiscal deficit down to 5.5 per cent next year. The real story of this budget then is not of any big idea or innovative strategy, but one of fiscal consolidation. There is the recognition that a sound and prudent fiscal management — with the deficits under control, and subject to gradual and targeted reduction over the medium term — has provided an enabling environment for the move on to a high growth trajectory. In a milieu where fiscal consolidation would be impossible while simultaneously increasing social sector spending and holding taxes down, the tax area had inevitably to yield. Overall, while an additional tax burden of Rs.20,500 crore is not too much for the economy to absorb, the impact of specific increases as, for instance, on diesel and petrol — the main target of protest by the opposition — is bound to be reflected in the price level.
Structural reform of the income tax system has been delayed with the new income tax code still in its formative stage. Meanwhile, income tax payers have gained significant relief from the broadening of the income slabs and from tax deductions for investing in infrastructure bonds and contributing to the Central Government Health Scheme. The cut in the surcharge on corporate tax from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent is balanced with the raising of the minimum alternate tax to 18 per cent. Among the specific sectors, real estate that has been hit the most by the slowdown has been provided some concession. So have the medical equipment and mobile phone manufacturers, and the cinema industry. The restoration of the general excise duty to its original level of 10 per cent and of the duty on large cars and multi-utility vehicles from 20 per cent to 22 per cent would not be much of a burden. More significant from the point of view of impact are the revival of the customs duty of 5 per cent on crude and of 10 per cent on petroleum products and the hike in the excise duty on petrol and diesel by Re. one a litre. Even while it is reluctant to decide on raising the prices of petroleum products as recommended by the Kirit Parikh Committee, it has collected more in taxes and may well let the oil companies live with under-recoveries of the product prices.
As in the earlier budgets, much of the focus on the expenditure side is on social sector spending that now accounts for 37 per cent of the total plan outlay for 2010-11, while another 25 per cent is to be spent on rural infrastructure. The United Progressive Alliance's flagship Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme has been allotted Rs.40,100 crore and the Bharat Nirman programme of building rural infrastructure Rs. 48,000 crore. In addition, the allocations for health and housing — rural and urban — have been increased. Higher allocations are no doubt needed in all these sectors, but what is missing is the effort to strengthen the delivery mechanism at the ground level though the institutional weaknesses in the government structure have been identified over and over again. The suggestion made in the Economic Survey for moving away from subsidising the foodgrain prices in the public distribution system and instead providing coupons directly to the families below the poverty line so that they can buy food from the open market is no doubt too radical for the budget. Yet, in the case of fertilizers, the government has adopted the nutrient-based subsidy scheme and it even talks of moving towards a system of direct payment of subsidies to the farmers. This is an area in which it has to move with caution lest the inevitable increase in fertilizer prices should prompt the farmers to use less of the nutrients, thereby affecting farm production. The right to education bill passed last year is still to make its impact felt and the Finance Minister has increased the allocation for upgrading the quality of school education, to which every child in the 6-14 age group would be entitled. The right to food, the big idea that emerged from the last budget, is still in its formative stage, with the draft bill almost ready for circulation and debate. The government's dilemma on how inclusive that right should be — whether to adopt the conventional poverty line with its lower figure of poverty or the higher estimates that expert committees have come up with more recently — and the attendant cost seem to be holding back its roll out.
Notable in this budget are the moves on reforming the financial sector. New banking licences are to be issued by the Reserve Bank and eligible non-bank finance companies are to be allowed to convert themselves into banks. The global financial crisis has shown up the systemic weaknesses of financial regulatory institutions the world over. Drawing a lesson from this experience of the advanced financial markets, the Finance Minister has proposed a Financial Stability and Development Council to exercise macro prudential supervision over the economy including over large financial conglomerates, and to coordinate the functioning of multiple regulatory agencies. Overall, the budget has had a positive impact on business sentiment and the animal spirits of the market.
Correction
The second paragraph of “A delicate balance” (Editorial, February 27, 2010) was “… The restoration of the general excise duty to its original level of 10 per cent and of the duty on large cars and multi-utility vehicles from 20 per cent to 22 per cent would not be much of a burden.” The General excise duty increased by just two percentage points from eight to 10 per cent. The original level is 14 per cent. The Finance Minister announced only a “partial roll-back”.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-delicate-balance/article16462578.ece
29,2,2010,Right by birth: On daughters and Hindu succession act,"The latest decision of the Supreme Court on the right of Hindu daughters to ancestral property corrects an obvious anomaly in the interpretation of a crucial 2005 amendment to the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. The verdict settles the question whether the coparcenary right of daughters comes into effect only if the father through whom they claim that right was alive on the day the amendment came into force. The apex court has now categorically ruled that the daughters’ right flows from their birth and not by any other factor such as the existence of their fathers. In other words, it has rejected the common misinterpretation that only daughters of coparceners who were alive on that day could get an equal share in property. The court has rightly recognised that the amendment conferred equal status as a coparcener on daughters in Hindu families governed by Mitakshara law, and this right accrued by birth. The change came into effect from September 9, 2005, but with a provision that partitions or testamentary disposition that had taken place prior to December 20, 2004 — the date on which the amendment Bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha — will remain valid and unaffected by the change. This led to the interpretation that the daughters’ coparcenary rights, being prospective, would not come into effect unless both the coparcener father and his daughter were alive on September 9, 2005. This position was crystallised in a 2015 judgment of the Supreme Court in Prakash and Others vs. Phulavati. This judgment now stands overruled.
The court’s reasoning is unexceptionable. First, it locates the origin of the coparcenary right in one’s birth. Second, it finds that there is no necessity for a predecessor coparcener to be alive for one to acquire that status, as what is relevant is birth within the degrees of succession to which it extends. In that sense, the legislation, even though it comes into effect on a prescribed date, is retroactive in its application as it is linked to birth, an antecedent event. It also underscores that the legislation makes it clear that the daughter’s rights are the same “as that of a son,” and “as if she had been a son at the time of birth”. The coparcenary status given to daughters has been a subject of reform in many States, particularly in south India, long before the UPA regime brought in the amendment for the whole country. Kerala had introduced legislation in 1975, Andhra Pradesh in 1986, Tamil Nadu in 1989 and Maharashtra and Karnataka in 1994. The legislative aim was that a flagrant discrimination between sons and daughters in entitlement to an equal share in coparcenary property, that is property inherited from one’s father, grandfather or great-grandfather, should be done away with. It is indeed welcome that the apex court has sought to give full effect to this intent by setting at rest doubts arising from varying interpretations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/right-by-birth-the-hindu-editorial-on-daughters-and-hindu-succession-act/article32347299.ece
29,2,2010,Historic ratification: On universal ratification of a labour standard,"The welcome decision by the Kingdom of Tonga to outlaw the worst forms of child labour is the first time in the International Labour Organization (ILO)’s 101-year history that a labour standard has been universally ratified. Convention 182, which was adopted in the 1999 annual international labour conference, prohibits the sexual exploitation of children, trafficking, deployment in armed conflict and other conditions that compromise their overall well-being. The Convention complements the ILO’s efforts under the 1973 Minimum Age Convention to prevent the employment of children below a lower age threshold. Under the influence of both these ILO standards, millions of young boys and girls have been rescued from hazardous conditions of work. Concomitantly, these have resulted in significant increases in enrolments in primary education. The landmark ratification, however, does not detract from the enormity of the challenge that remains. An estimated 152 million are trapped in child labour and 72 million of them are engaged in hazardous work. If anything, current efforts would have to be stepped up significantly to achieve the ambitious goal of total abolition of the scourge of child labour by 2025. But the COVID-19 pandemic is threatening a reversal of recent gains, with widespread job losses, deterioration in conditions of work, decline in household incomes and temporary school closures.
The historic first universal ratification of a global labour standard may be an occasion for celebration; it is nonetheless a moment for sober reflection. The two instruments on child labour are among the eight core ILO Conventions regarded as embodying the spirit of the 1998 declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work. Instruments relating to the freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining and the elimination of discrimination in employment and occupation are among the others. These conventions provide the necessary framework to counteract the predominance of informality in the conditions of work and ought to be a priority for governments. Though belated, India has signalled its legal commitment to the elimination of child labour with its 2017 ratification of Convention 182 and the instrument prescribing the minimum age of work for children. As the world prepares to designate 2021 as the year to abolish child labour, governments must seize the moment to instil hope in the future generations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/historic-ratification-the-hindu-editorial-on-universal-ratification-of-a-labour-standard/article32347515.ece
1,3,2010,Talk about Afghanistan,"Yet again, Indians have been killed in Afghanistan in a brazen attack in the heart of Kabul. The victims also included civilians of other nationalities, besides Afghans. The attack has come at a time when the Taliban are thought to have suffered some military setbacks. Much has been made of the recent success of the United States and Afghan forces in clearing the militants from Marjah, a town in Helmand province. A local government of sorts has been installed in the town. The recent arrests of key Afghan Taliban leaders by Pakistan, including Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, have also been projected as a positive development even though doubts exist about Pakistani motives for the arrests. The Kabul bombing has shown that contrary to the projected impact of these developments, the Taliban retain the capacity to strike at will targets of their choosing. Although the Taliban spokesman told the New York Times that Europeans, and not Indians, were the main target of the February 26 double suicide bombing-cum-car bombing, the fact is that at least six of the 16 people killed and many of the injured were Indian nationals. One of the two guesthouses targeted by the attackers was used mainly by Indians. Indeed, New Delhi has already condemned it as an attack aimed at India and Indian interests in Afghanistan, and media reports have placed it in the same category as the deadly bombings targeting the Indian Embassy in Kabul in 2008 and 2009.
While the evidence from the ground is not conclusive about the target, the bombing more importantly underlines the vulnerability of Indians living and working in Afghanistan. Some elements in the region are dead set against any Indian involvement in that country. The statement by Minister of External Affairs S.M. Krishna that the attack was the “handiwork” of those who want to undermine the friendship between India and Afghanistan is bound to be interpreted as a veiled reference to Pakistan, which has made no secret of its opposition to a role for India in its western neighbour. If the bombing, which came a day after the Indian and Pakistan foreign secretaries held talks, was an attempt to scupper the tentative steps that the two countries are taking to revive a dialogue, it should not be allowed to succeed. Instead, engagement must be seen by both sides as an opportunity to talk frankly about Afghanistan. New Delhi must make the point that it has longstanding ties of trade and culture with Kabul and that these are not inimical to Pakistan. At the same time, Islamabad needs to stop viewing Afghanistan as a zero-sum game with India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Talk-about-Afghanistan/article16462311.ece
1,3,2010,Effective financial regulation,"A significant announcement in the budget pertaining to the financial sector is that about setting up a new apex body to strengthen and institutionalise the mechanism for maintaining financial stability. The Financial Stability and Development Council, as it will be called, will monitor macro prudential supervision of the economy, including the functioning of large conglomerates, and address inter-regulatory concerns. Earlier attempts to create such a body did not fructify for various reasons. It was felt that a “super regulator” would not preserve the autonomy of individual regulators, such as the RBI, SEBI and the IRDA. However, there has been considerable vagueness about the functions of financial regulators, as evidenced by certain recent, well publicised cases. For instance, it is not clear whether SEBI or the RBI will supervise the recently introduced interest rate futures. There is ambiguity over the popular unit-linked insurance schemes, with both SEBI and the IRDA claiming jurisdiction. Instances such as these will only increase, as financial innovation will bring in relatively complex products that combine the features of capital market instruments and banking and insurance products. As in other countries, disintermediation in the financial sector and the emergence of financial conglomerates will pose major regulatory challenges that would require a great degree of co-ordination among several regulators. The proposal to license new private banks raises many practical questions. On no account should the RBI dilute its licensing criteria. The private banks that came into being in the early 1990s have had a mixed track record and only a handful of them, promoted by the erstwhile development financial institutions, have flourished.
The decision to provide additional capital to four public sector banks and some regional rural banks is welcome. However, the government will have to think of new ways to maintain capital adequacy in some of the banks owned by it without divesting its majority equity stake. The role of the India Infrastructure Finance Company will come under scrutiny. It has not so far been the catalyst it was expected to be in stepping up the financial resources needed for infrastructure. With an additional investment in infrastructure bonds up to Rs.20,000 qualifying for tax relief, this grossly underfunded area should attract long term savings. The decision to provide banking facilities by 2012 to centres with a population above 2,000 will promote financial inclusion significantly. Around 60,000 habitations are to be covered in the process, which will involve harnessing technology as well as conceptualising and implementing new, cost-effective banking models.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Effective-financial-regulation/article16462312.ece
2,3,2010,The smallest of steps,"To the untrained eye, the meeting between the Foreign Secretaries of India and Pakistan last week produced no perceptible movement, with not even an announcement made of a second meeting between the two sides. Nor have the official and background statements made by Islamabad and New Delhi since then been particularly encouraging. But put the same Petri dish under a microscope and the evidence of a small step forward is apparent. Nirupama Rao is likely to travel to Pakistan in March for another meeting with her counterpart, Salman Bashir; on his part, Mr. Bashir, though lamenting the lack of “structure” in the engagement that has begun, is not averse to pushing the process along. But if it is certain that the next step will be taken, where it actually leads will depend on how the two countries play their cards. The time between the February 25 Delhi meeting and the next in Islamabad will allow Pakistan to move further ahead on the trial of the Mumbai terrorist attack conspirators. It will also give the Pakistani side the opportunity to find ways of clamping down on terrorist masterminds like Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Saeed, whose daily statements are aimed at provoking a rupture in the fragile dialogue process. The results of the Pakistani action, if any, can be shared with Home Minister P. Chidambaram when he visits Islamabad for the SAARC interior ministers meeting in the next few weeks.
The more substantial the effort Pakistan makes, the easier it will be for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to put up the scaffolding for a meaningful dialogue. But India, too, needs to understand that moving the goal posts is not a helpful strategy. Strictly speaking, the meeting which took place last week should have been held in October, when court proceedings against the LeT operatives in Pakistan got under way. Be that as it may, now that India has decided to press its case across the dialogue table for action on terrorism, it must not allow terrorists to derail this discussion. Not conceding ground on issues where Islamabad wants the dialogue to make a forward movement is a far better strategy than refusing to hold a dialogue or suspending talks in a fit of pique. At no stage should the military establishment in Pakistan be able to point to Indian reluctance to talk as an alibi for not fighting the Afghan Taliban. As the heinous killing of Indians in Kabul last week showed, the Taliban are as opposed to India as the LeT or other terrorist groups. Islamabad may not easily neutralise the likes of Hafiz Saeed; but by resuming talks, India might just have found a zero-cost strategy for calling Pakistan's bluff on the western front.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-smallest-of-steps/article16462502.ece
2,3,2010,A critical area,"By allocating 46 per cent of the total plan expenditure to infrastructure development, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has clearly shown how imperative this is to return to a higher growth trajectory. That highways, railways, and power got a lion's share of the allocations for 2010-11 signals a clear priority to connectivity and electricity. Rural roads too got a quantum jump in funding. No less significant is the government's commitment to involving the private sector all the more in infrastructure development. Witness Mr. Mukherjee's statement: “With development and economic reforms, the focus of economic activity has shifted towards the non-governmental actors, bringing into sharper focus, the role of government as an enabler.” So, the objective seems to be to create an “enabling ethos” for Public Private Partnership (PPP). Going by the Rs.1,73,552 crore allocation for upgrading both urban and rural infrastructure, it is evident that the government wants to accelerate development of high quality physical infrastructure such as roads, ports, airports, railways and power. In this mix, the road and energy sectors come in for special attention for two reasons — some of the ongoing programmes are critical and there has been a perpetual shortfall in the achievement of targets over successive Five-Year Plan periods. The last two years have seen a substantial increase in investment in infrastructure, but as a proportion of the GDP the figure is just around six per cent, three per cent short of the requirement.
The Finance Minister has raised the budget allocation for the road transport sector from Rs.17,520 crore to Rs. 19,894 crore — a 13 per cent increase. The government, notably the Highways, and the Planning Commission have targeted a construction pace of 20 kilometres-a-day of the National Highways. Though a massive highways upgradation and expansion programme was launched way back in 1999 and subsequently revamped in 2006, the progress has not been satisfying. Litigation and implementation delays continue to hamper the effort. Similarly, on the power front, there has been a major shortfall in reaching the targets for the 8th, 9th, and 10th Five-year Plans. Even the 11th Plan target is unlikely to be reached. The allocations for the power sector have been doubled for the coming year, and a major impetus given to new and renewable energy. It is not enough for governments to just allocate funds. Infrastructure projects must be made attractive for private and foreign investors, and the States need to be fully involved in implementing and monitoring them.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-critical-area/article16462503.ece
3,3,2010,Smarter phones,"Mobile phones revolutionised communications in the last decade, bringing basic voice and data access to countless people. The mobile industry body GSMA estimates that there are over 4.5 billion wireless connections worldwide today. As governments everywhere have been discovering, these devices have raised productivity and are driving economic growth. India should now be paying more attention to this sector as the phones become smarter and open up new possibilities. The experience in Haiti showed that these gadgets can save lives. In the wake of the January earthquake, an injured man used an iPhone application to diagnose his condition and apply first aid; a teenager updated her social networking site to tell the world that she was alive in the rubble. These are anecdotal instances, but they are part of a wider phenomenon of a fast-growing mobile web. The mobile internet is powered by high bandwidth networks and smartphones with better display screens and gigahertz processing power. It should surprise no one that the smartphone category is growing 30 per cent year-on-year, and half of all new Internet connections are made using a mobile device. At this year's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, developers and operators took a step toward consolidation and formed a common platform to write affordable application software for smartphones that can be used across operators and handset models.
The pace of change in mobile broadband should send out a clear message to the government in New Delhi and to the regulators: remove the policy bottlenecks that constrain domestic growth in this important sector. Indecisiveness on policy issues has inordinately delayed full migration from the second generation mobile networks to the higher bandwidth third generation, or 3G. Further delays in awarding licences for 3G networks can only act as a drag on economic and social progress. It is no doubt a positive sign that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has taken note of the apparent lag in decision-making, and circulated a pre-consultation paper on introduction of the next generation 4G network. This new technology is still being refined, but its recent commercial introduction in Stockholm and Oslo is clear proof that mobile services are headed in this direction. It is important to remember that affordable smartphones with the potential to give the end-user greater value and the economy a fillip will arrive soon. They represent the next wave of growth, and everything must be done to facilitate their use.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Smarter-phones/article16462764.ece
3,3,2010,Irrational protests,"Islamist fundamentalist organisations rooted in religious obscurantism have long been prone to sudden bursts of irrational violence at the slightest provocation. The stone-throwing and arson in Karnataka by fanatics against the publication in a Kannada daily of an article, purportedly by Taslima Nasreen, on wearing of the burka were a nasty challenge to the freedom of expression guaranteed in the Indian Constitution. Two people died, one of them in police firing, after thousands of protesters came out on the streets in Shimoga and Hassan districts and indulged in indiscriminate destruction of private and public property. Muslim organisations have on several previous occasions voiced their opposition to the well-known views of Ms Nasreen against oppression of women and patriarchal prejudices in Muslim society. By violently protesting every instance of publication of her articles, the religious fundamentalists obviously want to enforce a ban, otherwise legally unsustainable, on her critical and creative works. The larger purpose was to criminally intimidate free-thinking writers who dare to question the authority of religion and religious scriptures. Freedom of expression is an inviolable, fundamental right in India; it cannot be held to ransom by intolerant, communal, fringe elements who invoke religious sentiments to get away with blatantly unconstitutional acts. In secular India, the right to freedom of religion is on a par with other fundamental rights. One fundamental right cannot infringe on another fundamental right.
It is a great pity that after being hounded out of Bangladesh for her views on society and religion, Ms. Nasreen has had to face the wrath of religious extremists in secular India. She is now forced to live in hiding, avoiding all public appearances for fear of provoking radical Islamist outfits. In this particular case, Ms Nasreen sees a conspiracy to “misuse” her writings to create public disturbances and denies writing any article for the Kannada newspaper. The translation of the article too seems to be flawed. However, the issue is not the authenticity of the article or its authorship, but the right to freedom of expression it embodies. For Islamist fundamentalists, the target is much bigger than Ms Nasreen: it is the democratic Constitution of secular India. Fatwas and threats of violence in the name of religion are meant to coerce people, especially writers and artists and public figures, into an unquestioning submission to religious diktats. These undermine the secular structure of the Indian Constitution. Creativity and artistic expression, when stifled, will have the effect of killing off critical reasoning and undermining the very democratic fabric of the country.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Irrational-protests/article13290439.ece
4,3,2010,Caveat on a promising visit,"Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's three-day visit to Saudi Arabia, though long overdue, ended on a high note. Dr. Singh and King Abdullah bin Abdul-Aziz covered substantial ground and managed to pin down specific areas for further collaboration. Determined to go beyond their traditional buyer-seller energy relationship, the two leaders opened up a much wider common agenda, including such exciting areas as outer space, renewable energy, and advanced computing. Four years after King Abdullah made a pioneering visit to India, the vision of a comprehensive political, security, and economic relationship, anchored in the Riyadh Declaration signed during Dr. Singh's visit, now stands firmly established. The Prime Minister's visit to Saudi Arabia, which is not only the world's largest oil producer but also a regional heavyweight, is also likely to leave its stabilising imprint on other areas in West Asia. These include the neighbouring oil rich countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which are encountering serious security challenges.
Significantly, the visit has added a prominent security dimension to bilateral ties. Saudi Arabia and India fully appreciate that they are common victims of terrorism. They are both targeted by the forces of global jihad, entrenched in the rugged mountain ranges on either side of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. If Mumbai was India's terror nightmare, Riyadh too faced a string of devastating bombings in 2003, when al Qaeda operatives blew up prominent residential compounds. Saudi Arabia continues to remain in the cross-hairs of the al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which operates out of neighbouring Yemen. The signing of an extradition treaty during Dr. Singh's visit therefore needs to be welcomed as a major breakthrough. From an Indian perspective, there is now hope that outfits like the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), whose operatives reportedly visit Saudi Arabia for various purposes, will be captured by Saudi authorities and sent to face the law in India. Further, the shared focus on safeguarding the “sovereignty and independence” of Afghanistan must be welcomed. In a visit that otherwise went so well, New Delhi's hardly concealed interest in seeking Riyadh's “good offices” to moderate Pakistan's behaviour has struck a jarring note. The suggestion appeared quite unnecessary as serious discussions on the Pakistan situation are expected to be integral to the fast-developing India-Saudi security relationship. By overtly drawing Saudi Arabia into the India-Pakistan equation, the United Progressive Alliance government has needlessly opened itself to the charge of diluting the principle of bilateralism that has, by virtue of a national consensus, governed New Delhi's engagement with Islamabad.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Caveat-on-a-promising-visit/article16475114.ece
4,3,2010,Incentives and fiscal transfers,"The 13th Finance Commission (TFC), whose report was tabled in Parliament recently, has broken new ground by building incentives into the transfer mechanism. Most of its key recommendations have been accepted by the government. The States stand to get a larger share of central taxes than before. Apart from increasing their share of the divisible pool of tax revenues from 30.5 per cent to 32 per cent, the Commission has proposed an additional 2-2.5 per cent for local bodies. Grants-in-aid to States are projected at Rs.315,581 crore over the next five years. The shared taxes and central grants together will take the overall devolution to States from 37.6 per cent to 39 per cent of the central divisible tax revenues. The TFC does not want any inconsistency between the amounts released to the States and the percentage share in the net tax revenues recommended by it. The States have been impressed upon to comply with the norms set by the Commission if they are to avail themselves of the full benefit of certain transfers. It has called upon the Centre not to lean heavily on surcharges and cesses since collections under these heads are not shared with the States. The transfer formula, which emphasises fiscal discipline on the part of the States, has been so worked out that non-Plan revenue grants will be made available to fewer States.
The system of incentive-based transfer seeks to reward States that comply with the norms prescribed by the TFC. However, given the political sensitivity of some of these proposals, the accent is on achieving incremental gains for fiscal federalism. The Commission has earmarked Rs.50,000 crore of central grants to compensate States for any revenue shortfall on account of switching to the Goods and Services Tax. The compensation will be available even if there is no shortfall, provided the State concerned adopts the GST model the TFC has prepared. This however is going to prove contentious. The empowered committee of State Finance Ministers has worked out its own model wherein tax rates are higher than in the TFC's version. The States want a much higher share of the divisible tax receipts to be transferred to them.

5,3,2010,Regulate air shows,"The Indian Navy has already initiated a detailed probe into the crash of its fighter trainer Kiran Mk II aircraft in Hyderabad that took three lives, including those of the two pilots on that aerobatic show. A case under the Aircraft Act 1934 has been registered at the Bowenpally police and it should take a while for the naval officials to investigate this thoroughly. A day after the crash, which took place just before noon in a thickly populated residential area near the Begumpet airport in the heart of Hyderabad, at least three theories about the cause of the crash have been floated: 1) There was a sudden problem or failure in the aircraft; 2) the pilots lost control during the vertical dive and could not pull back; 3) the aircraft's engine could have been struck by a bird. It is up to the Navy probe team to get to the bottom of this tragic accident. The planes were performing a manoeuvre called ‘bomb burst' in which four planes do a loop in a formation, before they peel off and disperse in different directions. The Kiran Mk II aircraft and these two pilots belong to the Navy's elite Sagar Pawan team that has performed over 100 successful shows since it was formed in 2003. Both the pilots have experience of flying over 1,000 hours each and have performed extensively in such shows.
Yet considering the extraordinary stress that man and machine are put through in such aerobatic shows, the risk of accidents is naturally higher than in commercial aviation. The questions that arise are whether an aerobatic show was indeed required for an aviation summit, and more important, whether it was advisable to permit that at Hyderabad's Begumpet airport, which is set in what is now a densely populated area. The defence services use occasions such as Republic Day, Independence Day, and Air Force and Navy days to demonstrate their capabilities and enthuse young people to join the services. But it may be time to regulate more strictly aerobatic shows over the city skies. Conducting them in busy civilian airports is a problem because they are apt to disrupt regular air traffic, but that was not the issue at the Begumpet airport. After the shifting of the civilian airport to a fine new location at Shamsabad, the avian population in the area has increased and the old drill to keep them off does not continue. This seems to have enhanced the risk factor for aircraft. There is also the question of compensation to residents who have lost their property in the crash. This is not the first air show nor will it be the last. Keeping these in mind, the Defence Ministry and the Civil Aviation authorities must come up with detailed and transparent guidelines for the conduct of such air shows in future.

5,3,2010,Dispelling Greek myths,"The Greek economic crisis continues to test the political will of all involved. The country's budget deficit is €300 billion. It owes $75.5 billion, $64 billion, and $43.2 billion to French, Swiss, and German banks respectively. George Papandreou, the centre-left Prime Minister, has proposed public expenditure cuts and savings measures to reduce the budget deficit from 12.7 per cent of GDP — over four times the 3 per cent allowed by eurozone rules — to 8.7 per cent by 2011. Although the finance ministers of the European Union have approved the proposals, German financial institutions and public reactions are creating complications. Greece needs to refinance €20 billion of its debt by May 2010, but German banks refuse to buy any more Greek government bonds. Three German banks hold over €14 billion of Greek debt, and a fourth, although willing to assist over bonds, has ceased to invest in the country. Greece faces plummeting revenues as economic activity stalls, but may have to spend 15 per cent of revenues solely on debt-servicing in 2010. The German public, which has suffered austerity measures, is hostile to bailouts for a country that has exceeded its budget deficit limits greatly. Greece's reputation for corruption does not inspire confidence in other eurozone countries either.
While Mr. Papandreou's economic problems are very serious, the wider ramifications are equally important. On February 24, those hardest hit took to the streets in a 24-hour strike; there were some brief episodes of violence. A Member of Parliament also raised the temperature with reminders that Germany has not paid war reparations to Greece; other Greek politicians have been angered by lectures from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker to the effect that Greece must do its homework and that other Europeans must not pay for Athens' bad economic management. Most outsider perceptions, however, are mistaken in significant respects. First, EU rules do not allow simple bailouts of states. Secondly, corruption is not confined to Greece; France and Germany have both had their high-level corruption scandals. Thirdly, the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank is investigating the investment bank Goldman Sachs for colluding with the previous Greek government — a conservative one — to conceal the budget deficit from EU monitors. The most level-headed analyses call for guaranteed EU loans combined with expansionary Greek policies to encourage investment. Such moves would be well received in Greece, but they should also be welcomed for reasserting the primacy of the political over the narrowly economic.

6,3,2010,Banning pernicious weapons,"The global ban, from this August, on the pernicious cluster bombs that drop deadly explosives in their hundreds over vast areas inflicting indiscriminate death and devastation cannot conceal the utter contempt the big powers had for the post-World War II Geneva Conventions on humanitarian law (laws of war) that seek to protect civilian populations during combat operations. Worse, the obdurate refusal of the major arms manufacturing and procuring countries such as the United States, Russia, Israel, China, India, and Pakistan to accede to the pact underscores the fact that a minority of countries, some of them democracies to wit, stand isolated on a concrete step to promote international peace and multilateralism. Cluster bombs, an anti-vehicle weapons legacy from World War-II, outlawed under the new United Nations Convention, are also de facto anti-personnel landmines to the extent that where they fail to detonate on impact, they explode when unearthed years after the end of conflicts, maiming and killing unsuspecting civilians in their thousands. Indeed, the relative success recorded in the abolition of landmines, banned in 1997 with support from the U.S., is often attributed to this similarity with cluster bombs, used extensively by the allied forces in Afghanistan and Iraq; not to mention Israel which deployed them in 2006 against Lebanon. Small wonder then that flagrant violations of the terms of engagement of these powers in West Asia are routine, and the apologies proffered, often as an after-thought and only after much public indignation and outrage, have become equally routine.
The new Treaty outlaws the production, use, and transfer of cluster bombs and States Parties are obliged to destroy stockpiles within eight years and clear their territory of unexploded bomblets within two years thereafter. Therefore, the view that the law may permit a waiver of certain forms of assistance when States Parties undertake joint military operations with countries that are not likely to accede to the Treaty in the foreseeable future is a dangerous and disingenuous interpretation that militates against strict compliance. World powers are under increasing domestic pressure to bring home their demoralised troops from the savage battlefields. It is time they also saw the writing on the wall — the demand to demobilise the demonic weapons, on top of which must be the catastrophic nuclear weapons of mass destruction.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Banning-pernicious-weapons/article16514584.ece
6,3,2010,Don't fail the women of India,"The United Progressive Alliance government's announcement of its intention to push forward the Women's Reservation Bill without any dilution in the coming week is the best political news we have had for a long time. If all goes according to plan, the long-pending Bill will be adopted by both houses of Parliament on or around March 8, which marks the centenary of International Women's Day. The Constitution (108th Amendment) Bill seeks to allot one-third of the seats in the Lok Sabha and in State assemblies to women, with the reservation applying by rotation to the various constituencies. The Bill, which has been introduced in the Rajya Sabha, has the support of the Congress, the BJP, the Left parties, and some important regional parties. Notwithstanding the obstructionism of the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Samajwadi Party, there should now be no problem in putting together the two-thirds support needed for constitutional amendment. What is really significant in a political sense is that, led by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, the government was able to summon the political will to go for this breakthrough, which will surely have far-going and profound effects on the ground. On the other hand, India's dismal 10 per cent representation of women in Parliament indicates that without a constitutionally mandated change, it will continue to bring up the rear among the world's nations.
The experience of working a mandated system of 33 per cent (now raised to 50 per cent) reservation for women in panchayati raj institutions has amply demonstrated that enhanced political participation of women at the grassroots deepens democracy in many ways. It delivers more of the constitutional guarantees of rooting out discrimination on the basis of sex or caste, providing equality of opportunity for women, and redirecting resources in favour of the most disadvantaged in the population – who, even within the most deprived groups, are likely to be women. The World Economic Forum in its 2009 report on global gender disparities ranks India 114th in a list of 134 countries. Given the troubling statistics starting with the worsening sex ratio in the 0-6 age group in the population, eliminating the gender gap in its various dimensions should be a top political priority for rising India. Greater representation of women in legislatures and Parliament is likely to force a shift of focus towards this priority. The world over, women's empowerment and advancement through progressive struggles, and by right, have had a highly beneficial impact on politics, the economy, health, education, culture, and society. With the ruling party, the main opposition, and other significant political players deciding to join hands on a key issue, a rare and historic opportunity presents itself. The polity and Parliament must not fail the women of India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Dont-fail-the-women-of-India/article16548660.ece
8,3,2010,A reversal of stance,"In what is seen as a major reversal of its policy, the International Monetary Fund in a recent paper has said that capital controls are sometimes justified “as part of the policy toolkit” for an economy dealing with surging flows. Its recognition of the need for controls comes at a time when many emerging economies, including India, are having inflows at such a high level as to pose a challenge to their macroeconomic management. With the global economy recovering from the recession, capital from the developed world has been turning to the emerging markets for better returns. Historically low interest rates in the rich countries and a greater tolerance to risks have aided and abetted this trend. For the recipient countries, the consequences of such large flows have been mixed. In India, foreign institutional investors and portfolio managers have returned to the share markets in strength after a lull. The rupee has appreciated, hindering the nascent revival in exports. Flows far in excess of the economy's absorptive capacity have necessitated RBI intervention by way of buying the dollars and then sterilising the resultant excess rupee liquidity. While India has so far not opted to restrain flows into the equity markets, it has placed restrictions on their entry into the debt markets. Some other countries have gone further and levied a tax on foreign capital or imposed quantitative restrictions. The most recent example is Brazil. In October last year, faced with a flood of foreign exchange inflows that was driving up its currency, its government imposed a 2 per cent tax on all inward remittances. Earlier, another Latin American country, Chile, had required foreign investors to keep a portion of their remittances with its central bank for a specified period.
By imposing capital controls to support a fixed exchange rate, Malaysia came out of the Asian currency crisis of the late 1990s in a much better shape than some of its neighbours that had allowed a free movement of capital. The IMF's new stance is surprising because historically it has been a strong advocate of capital account liberalisation even for those member countries with a weak external economy. In its view, controls are expensive as they can distort resource allocations and can be evaded easily. In the past, the IMF has urged member countries facing a surge in capital inflows to allow the exchange rates to appreciate or to accumulate reserves. The two related policy options have not always been sufficient, as the experiences of India and Brazil, besides others, have shown. The IMF 's reconsideration of capital controls shows that it is trying to adjust to the ground realities.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-reversal-of-stance/article16548536.ece
8,3,2010,Operation Moshtarak,"Since February 13, when they launched Operation Moshtarak (“Operation Together”), NATO and Afghan National Army forces have encountered fierce Taliban resistance in Marjah, a town of 80,000 people in the southwestern province of Helmand. The province has the world's largest opium output and Marjah alone yields the Taliban an estimated $2 million a month. Militarily, the surrounding network of canals interspersed with residential compounds makes defence easier, not least with improvised explosive devices. NATO has now sent in more than 15,000 troops as well as helicopters and drones to attack Marjah and the Taliban have confounded their expectations by staying and fighting. Even President Hamid Karzai has demanded that NATO must protect civilians. The toll of ‘collateral deaths' has been mounting relentlessly, with the U.S.'s high-tech electronic war killing innocent children, women, and men in an unprecedented variety of ways. Marc W. Herold of the University of New Hampshire, a regular contributor to Frontline on the subject, has assiduously developed a database that seeks to account for every Afghan civilian killed by the U.S./NATO forces since the 2001 invasion. A master table he has made available to The Hindu indicates that there have been close to 10,000 civilian impact deaths resulting from U.S./NATO military actions in Afghanistan since October 7, 2001. Shockingly, the data reveal, in the words of Professor Herold, that “more Afghan civilians died under the Obama clock in 2009 than under his predecessor, George W. Bush during 2008.”
A senior British officer estimates that it will take 30 days to clear the Taliban from the targeted areas. The occupation force commanders know that stability cannot be restored without public trust. Scepticism and cynicism are justifiably widespread among the locals, who have no illusions about the corruption and the chaotic nature of the Afghan state that is supposed to replace the Taliban in Helmand. One strategic analysis notes that in many areas the Taliban are the only source of stable civil authority and everyday security. The U.S. has hinted at the possibility of talks with the Taliban, possibly in the hope of marginalising its more extreme elements. But even that is an uncertain strategy, as many of the younger Taliban leaders are known hardliners. Secondly, it is highly doubtful if a centralised state can be created in a culture where people have for centuries thought and acted locally and tribally. Thirdly, NATO may take Marjah but holding it will be another matter. It will make the putative capture of Kandahar province, a more important Taliban stronghold than Helmand, far more difficult. As the civilian toll mounts, as the dossier of war crimes grows fatter, the entire U.S. project of creating a reshaped Afghan body politic so that it can depart in 18 months is in deep trouble.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Operation-Moshtarak/article16531310.ece
8,3,2010,Google and our digital future,"Google's hopes of creating the world's largest digital library remain uncertain after a New York district court declared it needed more time to rule on this controversial project. Announced in 2004, the $200 million project began by scanning and digitising the entire libraries of four major universities, including Harvard and Oxford, and the New York Public Library. In return for permission to digitise these works and make excerpts available through its search engine, the libraries were promised a digital copy of the books and journals. The case, which has implications not only for authors and publishers but also for anti-trust practices and copyright law, has been snagged in a legal quagmire since 2005. The Author's Guild and the Association of American Publishers filed a class action suit against Google Inc. for resorting to what they regarded as a massive copyright infringement for commercial use. Google claimed that use of snippets” and “excerpts” of copyrighted works were exempted under the principle of “fair use.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Google-and-our-digital-future/article16531308.ece
9,3,2010,A historic vote,"India may have missed the symbolism of passing the Women's Reservation Bill on the hundredth anniversary of International Women's' Day but the delay does not rob the Rajya Sabha's decision of its historic and global significance. There is hardly any example of such a bold and progressive measure to improve the representation of women anywhere in the world, least of all in a society plagued by pervasive gender inequality, discrimination, and violence. After developing cold feet in the face of political threats by the Samajwadi Party and Rashtriya Janata Dal and the disruptive tactics used by their MPs, the Congress party decided to stiffen its spine and go for broke, despite the risks involved. Credit for this resolve must be given primarily to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, whose unequivocal advocacy of the bill helped quell the misgivings within a section of its male leadership, as well as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. But the applause must also go to the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Left, which put the politics of oppositionism aside to help the government pass the 108th constitutional amendment in the upper house on Tuesday. The Trinamool Congress's criticism of the suspension of seven SP and RJD MPs for their unruly behaviour on Monday demonstrates the party's duplicity and need not unduly detain the government's floor managers. Once the reality of women's reservation sinks in, few of those who have staked such strident positions against the bill can afford to remain in denial.
In all probability, equilibrium will quickly return to existing alliances and arrangements as parties turn their attention to managing the mechanics of seat allocation under the new dispensation. The United Progressive Alliance government should now move quickly to win the Lok Sabha's approval for the women's bill. Any delay will only play into the hands of the obstructionists, defeating the purpose behind moving ahead in the first place. As in the Rajya Sabha, there will be protests in the lower house, perhaps even more unruly and boisterous than before. Unlike their colleagues in the upper house, many male MPs in the Lok Sabha will stand to lose their seats to women and are likely to throw everything into what will, after all, be their last stand. Ensuring a proper floor strategy to deal with disruptions is vital so that there will be no repeat of Monday's disgraceful scenes. The members who attacked the dignity of the Rajya Sabha chairperson betrayed the trust reposed in them by the people. Suspending or expelling MPs for flagrant violation of parliamentary procedure and indulging in violence is a requirement of democracy and there is no reason for the government or Speaker to be squeamish about it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-historic-vote/article16560721.ece
9,3,2010,Substance over style,"It was evident from the start that this year's Oscar awards were going to be a two-horse race for best picture and best director. Gratifyingly, Hollywood's Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences opted for Katherine Bigelow's The Hurt Locker over James Cameron's Avatar in this contest of intriguing contrasts. Bigelow's intense Iraqi war drama about an elite bomb disposal squad in Baghdad was made on a modest $11 million budget and earned a paltry $14.7 million before the award was announced. By contrast, Cameron's visually breathtaking interstellar epic, which employed cutting edge digital technologies, consumed $237 million in the making and has grossed a record breaking $3 billion (and counting). In rewarding the nerve-wracking portrayal of war, steeped in realism, over a fantasy about a conflict between humans and blue-skinned humanoids, which is marred by a cliche-ridden and clumsily allegorical storyline, the Academy favoured substance over style. It has not always done so, opting often for commercially successful big-budget films over smaller and much better ones. This attitude has been changing in recent years. In terms of art, the only possible contender to The Hurt Locker this year was Quentin Tarantino's hip and stylishly compelling Inglorious Bestards. Fittingly, while the winner picked up six Oscars of the nine for which it was nominated, Avatar bagged three well-deserved statuettes in the technical category.
The uncertainty over the Bigelow-Cameron contest, which was lent an additional edge by the fact they were once husband and wife, is a departure from last year, when Slumdog Millionaire was the runaway favourite. But this year's Oscars are proof that a bigger nomination list for best picture (10 against the usual five), doesn't necessarily mean a better list. Apart from Slumdog Millionaire, last year's list included Milk, the crusading biopic of America's first openly gay public official , The Reader, a haunting and beautifully filmed love story in the time of Nazi Germany, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, an intriguing and meticulously crafted story of a man who ages backwards. The justification for returning to a 10-picture nomination list, a practice given up in 1943, is that it prevents some very good films from getting squeezed out of the race. But in the bid to provide greater exposure to films, something for which there exists strong commercial pressure, the Academy should not spread itself thin and devalue nomination to the world's best-known film awards.

9,3,2010,Dinosaur-eating snake,"If well-preserved snake fossils are rare, the recovery of the nearly complete remains of a 3.5-metre long snake offering insights into its feeding behaviour is exciting news. The 67-million-year-old snake, Sanajeh indicus, unearthed from Dholi Dungri village in Panchmahal district, Gujarat, is an extraordinary specimen. It was found in the nest of a sauropod dinosaur and lay coiled around broken pieces of a just-hatched egg adjacent to two unbroken eggs and a sauropod dinosaur hatchling fossil. S. indicus shares many features with today's derived macrostomatans, notably pythons. The coiled position and its association with the dinosaur hatchling indicate that the snake preyed on just-hatched dinosaurs by tightly coiling around them. The findings are reported in the latest issue of PLoS Biology. Unlike in basal snakes, the 12 cm-long jaw of S. indicus can move laterally as well. The jaw mobility from lateral movement along with the size of the jaw provided a gape of 16 cm; this enabled the snake to prey on bigger animals. The derived macrostomatans have a very wide gape, going up to 60 cm., for a fully grown python. S. indicus is a primitive snake with some advanced morphological features. It cannot be considered a transitional fossil between basal snake and today's derived macrostomatans. With its jaw adaptations relatively well developed, it will occupy an intermediate position in the snake phylogeny.
Interestingly, a scientist working with the Geological Survey of India discovered the specimen in 1984. But while the juvenile dinosaur and the eggs were identified and the finding reported, the fossil remains of the snake went largely unnoticed. The import of the excellent specimen came to light only in 2001 when Jeffrey A. Wilson from the University of Michigan examined it. Detailed investigation was delayed by more than a year as government policy insisted that a memorandum of understanding be signed with the University of Michigan. This is a classic case of bureaucracy going to extraordinary lengths to slow down, if not block, research enterprise by scientists working in government institutions. At a time when countries like China are pulling out all the stops to promote research and encourage their scientists to collaborate with their peers in scientifically advanced countries, unimaginative policies in India stifle research and leave talented scientists de-motivated and frustrated. When will Indian officialdom realise that facilitating, and not policing, is the way to encourage science and the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Dinosaur-eating-snake/article16548538.ece
10,3,2010,Say no to RTI amendments,"Central Information Commissioner Shailesh Gandhi recently took the extraordinary step of unilaterally releasing the minutes of the October 14, 2009 meeting between Union Minister Prithviraj Chavan and Central and State Information Commissioners on a proposal to significantly amend the Right to Information Act, 2005. The meeting's importance lay in the fact that it saw the hopeless isolation of the government side (Department of Personnel and Training, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances, and Training) on the proposed amendments. Of the 60 Information Commissioners who attended, all but two were opposed to the idea of tinkering with the historic legislation. What explains such unity of resolve? The DoPT's package contained two ‘killer' amendments. The first would include under Section 8 (which specifies exemptions to the Act) applications deemed to be “frivolous and vexatious.” The second would bar from the Act's purview any discussion leading up to an official decision. The best judge of whether or not an application is “frivolous and vexatious” is the Information Commissioner who is called upon to decide the issue. In the four-and-a-half years since the Act came into force, no information officer has complained of being overburdened by such applications. Nor is there anything to suggest that government functioning is hampered by the disclosure of official discussions (previously known as file notings) and records of process. The only reasonable conclusion is that both the bureaucracy and the political government fear transparency of process because it will expose wrongdoing.
In recent days, RTI queries relating to public spending, governance, distribution of largesse, and even the procedure adopted for deciding awards have proved to be deeply embarrassing for the government. The ghost of RTI amendments has returned – in the controversial form of exemption for the office of the Chief Justice of India. The irony is too glaring to miss. It was the Supreme Court that laid the ground for opening up acts of governance to public scrutiny. In the 1975 State of U.P. vs Raj Narain case, the court said: “In a government of responsibility like ours, where all the agents of the public must be responsible for their conduct, there can be but few secrets. The people of this country have a right to know every public act, everything that is done in a public way, by their functionaries…” The RTI Act has empowered the ordinary citizen in a way its architects did not anticipate. Studies have shown its growing appeal across all social strata, which is surely why the government is set on blunting this powerful tool in the hands of the people. Such obscurantism must be seen through and defeated.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Say-no-to-RTI-amendments/article16554631.ece
10,3,2010,India's hockey future,"In three decades, India has not seen any success at the highest level of its ‘national game.' The euphoria that followed a win over Pakistan in the ongoing World Cup tournament in Delhi was short-lived. The host crashed to three successive defeats, suggesting an eventual placing not much higher than what India has achieved in the competition since winning its solitary title at Kuala Lumpur in 1975. Ranked 12th before going into this World Cup, the team can be reasonably pleased with a place in the top eight. In the tough world of international hockey, fitness, speed, agility, and tactics, which were displayed so splendidly by the Australian side, count more than reputations. The tournament has exposed the chasm that exists between India and the top teams in these areas. Although chief coach Jose Brasa's assertion that a winning combination cannot be developed in eight months is reasonable, the Spaniard's tenure might come in for review at the end of the Asian Games in Guangzhou in November 2010.
There has been improvement in this Indian team but it is not the sort that can make an impact at the world level. Brasa was engaged only after India's failure to qualify for the Beijing Olympics. It was a humiliating ‘first' for a country that has gloried in its eight Olympic gold medals in the sport, though the last one came way back in 1980 in a devalued competition. A player revolt at the Pune camp demanding incentives and annual payments, manipulative establishment politics, and messy litigation marked the run-up to this World Cup. It is time to move on to settling a long-term development plan. Sadly, the authorities hounded Richard Charlesworth, one man who could have helped execute such a plan, out in 2008. The Australian team, under his guidance, has shown in this World Cup why it is rated so high. Any long-term plan should focus on reviving dwindling hockey interest in traditional pockets. The administration should be restructured to meet the demands of the game and to offer financial security to the players without compromising discipline. The national championship and the Premier Hockey League should be revived, along with junior competitions, to widen the base for a talent hunt. This World Cup has aroused pubic interest and passion in a sport that seemed to have been forgotten. Near-capacity crowds at the Dhyan Chand National Stadium and good television ratings augur well for Indian and world hockey.

11,3,2010,An urgent India-Pakistan issue,"The Supreme Court of India's decision asking the central government immediately to release and deport 16 Pakistani prisoners who have completed their sentence is a welcome step in civilising official conduct towards the hundreds of cross-border prisoners languishing in Indian jails. Hopefully, the Pakistani judiciary led by Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary will take a similar stand towards Indian prisoners in jails in that country. The bench rightly rejected the government's argument that these men could be set free only if Pakistan released an equal number of Indian prisoners. ‘Reciprocity' in this case is shameful: it means using people as pawns in diplomacy towards the other. It is no secret that Pakistan follows the same policy, with identical arguments heard in Pakistani courts. Both countries get away with it because the people who end up in jails on the other side tend to be poor and have little means to have their rights enforced. Many are subsistence fishermen struggling in the unmarked waters around Sir Creek. Others are jailed for alleged offences ranging from crossing the border to drug trafficking, from spying to visa infringement. Few among them pose any real danger to the country where they were arrested. Sometimes years can pass before the prisoner's government gets to know about his arrest by the other side. The two sides even wrangle over granting consular access, which means allowing a diplomatic representative to visit the prisoner to verify his nationality and well-being. Prisoners who have served out their sentence need to wait for months or even years to be released because New Delhi and Islamabad use them as bargaining chips, often waiting for symbolic occasions to free them. There are instances of prisoners losing their mental balance by the time of release. The swift release of a Pakistani child from an Indian prison last month was an exception and owes much to a campaign by the Indian media.
The shabby attitude towards prisoners is in contrast to the bonhomie that exists between the elites of the two countries. When diplomats from the two sides meet, they are admirably pleasant with each other even at tense moments. Retired military and intelligence officers meet and exchange niceties across Track 2 tables. But the two countries seem incapable of decent behaviour when it comes to dealing with prisoners. In 2008, a bilateral committee of retired judges, mandated by the governments, visited jails in India and Pakistan and made excellent recommendations for the early release of these prisoners. The Mumbai terror strikes put paid to all that. Holding the fate of hundreds of prisoners ransom to the complicated Indo-Pakistan relationship is morally abhorrent, inhumane, and politically unacceptable.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/An-urgent-India-Pakistan-issue/article16560629.ece
11,3,2010,De facto abolition,"The 2015 target to establish a universal moratorium on executions -- proposed by the Spanish Prime Minister at the Fourth World Congress against the Death Penalty held recently in Geneva -- is likely to revive momentum on the 2007 non-binding resolution adopted by the U.N. General Assembly to evolve a realistic strategy to discourage states from enforcing the ultimate sentence. Many promising developments in the principal retentionist countries, evidence of high cost of specialised expertise needed to handle death penalty cases, and the expensive business of maintaining the death row population as compared to imprisoning convicts for life -- not to mention the grave risk of miscarriage of justice — add moral weight and urgency to the case for halting executions forthwith. In 2008, New Jersey abolished the death penalty to become the 13{+t}{+h} State in the U.S. to do so. This and the decision elsewhere to defer carrying out the death sentences as well as the serious debate in the U.S. Supreme Court over lethal injection as a humane answer to the cruel nature of execution are some of the welcome developments. The triennial World Congress, which brings together civil society groups, human rights networks, and senior representatives from governments, has called upon states that already enforce a moratorium to delete this penalty from the statute and has urged countries where it is no longer legal to hand down death sentences to advocate complete abolition in their international relations. It is indeed significant that, while Russia and Ukraine have in place a moratorium on executions, the other 45 member states of the Council of Europe (the human rights body) encompassing the 27 states of the European Union, have legally abolished the death sentence.
In a striking departure from domestic policy, the Supreme People's Court in the People's Republic of China issued guidelines last week requiring judges to impose the harshest sentence only in extreme instances and to temper justice with mercy. It is also a response to the popular demand for a more fair and discriminating system. The recent measures are a sequel to the 2009 decision to phase out executions by firing squads and instead resort to lethal injections. It is apparent that the moral pressure brought to bear upon states through diplomatic means is far more effective than the hollow discourses on democracy. The road to the universal abolition of the death penalty may be long and uncertain, but the most recent trends towards either abolition or moratorium are certainly gratifying.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/De-facto-abolition/article16560628.ece
12,3,2010,The long road to justice,"The Special Investigation Team tasked by the Supreme Court of India to enquire into the communal violence that shook Gujarat eight years ago has summoned Chief Minister Narendra Modi to appear before it for questioning on March 21. The summons is pursuant to a petition filed in the court by Zakia Jaffrey, widow of the former Congress Member of Parliament, Ehsan Jaffrey, who was one of the 69 persons killed at the Gulberg housing society in Ahmedabad on February 28, 2002. Ms Jaffrey, and her co-petitioner, Citizens for Justice and Peace, have accused 62 senior Ministers, political leaders and activists, police officers and bureaucrats, including Mr. Modi, of conspiring to unleash large-scale violence against the Muslims of Gujarat. This followed the Godhra incident in which 59 passengers, all but one of them Hindu, perished following a mob attack on the Sabarmati Express. Ms Jaffrey first tried to file a complaint with the police in Ahmedabad, which refused to accept it. She then moved the Gujarat High Court without success. As a last resort, she appealed to the Supreme Court.
If the truth about Gujarat is ever to emerge, the SIT must be allowed to conduct its investigations without fear or favour. It must be free from the pressure of the establishment as well as activists, some of whom have levelled baseless and even over-the-top charges against it. Mr. Modi and the Gujarat government have always denied that there was any method in the madness that convulsed their State in 2002. But the failure to ensure proper investigation of the shocking crimes committed under their watch suggests a pattern of behaviour that needs thorough probing. A diligent investigation would look at the phone records of the Chief Minister and his closest associates to try and get a fix on the persons they remained in touch with during those days. Already, the SIT has established a prima facie case against one of his senior Ministers, Maya Kodnani, as well as various leaders of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. Since it is reasonable to assume that a man of Mr. Modi's intelligence and authority must have been aware of what his political associates were doing then, the SIT needs to establish why he never saw fit to get the police to act against them or the others against whom cases are now being filed. Was the de facto legal protection that was provided to rioters and their ringleaders the product of oversight, indifference, callousness, or complicity? This is a question the people of Gujarat, and the whole of India, want an answer for, however challenging the task and however long it takes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-long-road-to-justice/article16566741.ece
12,3,2010,Protectionism in check,"Although the global economic recovery after the recession has been fragile and uneven, trade among countries has bounced back after a sharp decline a year ago. Between October, 2008 and January, 2009, global goods trade dropped by nearly 20 per cent. Several factors that were behind last year's plunge assume significance in the context of the ongoing recovery. Initially, supply side factors, notably the complete drying up of trade finance and protectionism, were blamed. A more recent analysis has attributed the fall in merchandise trade to a decline in demand, amplified by the synchronised downturn in nearly all countries. The globalised supply chains transmitted the weak demand signals rapidly. The relatively quick recovery corroborates the view that a precipitous fall in demand in the wake of the financial crisis was the principal factor. Consumers across the globe, shocked by the intensity of the crisis, put off their purchases. With the global economic climate improving, they are returning in strength. The impressive turnaround in the export performance of many developing countries, notably China, is due to the revival in demand at the global level.
Protectionism was a major threat during the downturn. However, a new report, prepared jointly for the G20 countries by the WTO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, points out that the feared surge of protectionism did not materialise. Even more significantly, in the recovery phase, most countries have successfully managed the political process of keeping protectionism at bay, despite the high unemployment rates and the shrinkage of employment opportunities. Over the past six months, the number of restrictions on international trade has dropped sharply. A majority of the new curbs relate to industries such as minerals and base metals that have traditionally relied on such measures. There has been no spurt in the emergency measures to block imports such as anti-dumping laws and recourse to safeguards mechanisms for goods deemed unfairly priced or subsidised. There are many critics of the report who contend that protectionism exists but in less traditional forms, as for example the bailout of financial institutions and car companies and the ""Buy American"" home procurement rules in the United States. The inability to move ahead with the Doha round also shows a lack of commitment among industrialised countries to free trade. The consensus is that protectionism is nowhere near its peak levels of the 1930s but cannot be discounted totally in today's world.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Protectionism-in-check/article16566740.ece
15,3,2010,Rediscovering Russia,"India's relations with Russia over the two decades since the collapse of the Soviet Union have alternated between indifference and neglect, on the one hand, and active cooperation and intense friendship, on the other. Both states of the relationship have sprung from the kind of situation Indian and Russian policymakers have found themselves in at different times. Broadly speaking, New Delhi and Moscow have both tended to calibrate the bilateral thermostat with an eye on the temperature in Washington. When the U.S. tries to cosy up to either power, India and Russia are quite happy to take for granted, if not forget, each other. But when Washington's mien is frosty and unhelpful, comfort is sought in the warmth of druzhba. However, the U.S. attitude towards the two is not always symmetric. The George W. Bush years, for example, saw a deterioration in America's relations with Russia over issues like missile defence and the expansion of Nato, even as U.S. engagement with India scaled new strategic heights. Although India's relations with Russia remained on an even keel, the Manmohan Singh government did not accord Moscow the kind of priority it deserved. Indeed, with the Bush administration using the nuclear deal to push for gains across a broad spectrum of areas, especially military procurement, India's relations with Russia came under a bit of strain.
The coming to power of Barack Obama in the U.S. has restored some sense of balance to Indian foreign policy, with the government scrambling to revive old friendships in the face of Washington's changed policies towards the region, especially Pakistan and Afghanistan. This is the geopolitical context for India's rediscovery of Russia. Though the Russian side today lacks the same narrow motivation for embracing India more tightly — after all, Mr. Obama has tried to repair relations with Moscow — Vladimir Putin, a strong leader with a clear strategic vision, realises it is important for Russia to expand the ambit of its cooperation with India. On Afghanistan, both share the same anxieties about U.S. indulgence towards the Pakistani military and the proposal to integrate a ‘reformed' Taliban leadership in the power structures at Kabul. On the nuclear energy and defence fronts, Russia has stood the test of time as a valued friend and partner, supplying India with attractively priced advanced equipment without preconditions at a time when other countries have a long list of collateral demands. To be sure, a lot more needs to be done to add ballast to the relationship, especially on the trade and business-to-business fronts. But it is essential that the current period of intense engagement not be allowed to falter once the U.S. makes some fresh overture to India.

15,3,2010,A fraud of an election,"The Political Parties Registration Law, enacted by the military junta in Myanmar ahead of general elections to be held later this year, is aimed at keeping the popular leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi out of the electoral process. Only portions of the law have been released and they are outrageous. There cannot be a greater fraud on the electoral process, the sole aim of which is to keep the military junta in power. The international community, led by the United Nations, was hoping against hope that the military rulers would see some reason and make the forthcoming elections an inclusive process. In a slap in their face, the junta has barred anyone convicted of a crime from being a member of a political party. Further, parties that want to register under the new law must expel members who are “not in conformity with the qualification to be members of a party.” This means that Ms Suu Kyi cannot contest the elections, and her National League for Democracy (NLD) must expel her if it is to be eligible to participate in the process. The junta has also offered a carrot to the NLD by removing the seals on the regional offices of the party.
There are preliminary indications that the NLD may not be averse to jettisoning Ms Suu Kyi so that it can contest the election. Evidently, the thinking is that it can win the election and then try to undo the enormous damage the military rulers have done over the past two decades. But the NLD must remember that the junta annulled the 1990 elections after the party swept the polls. There is no indication that it is willing to loosen its iron grip on power. It has built into the new constitution reservation of 20 per cent of the seats in parliament not for women — but for the armed forces. It has adopted as a model the Indonesian constitution under the brutal and corrupt dictator Suharto. Painful experience has shown that the junta remains unmindful of world opinion. Neither the U.N. nor the regional cooperation forum, the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), has been able to make the military rulers see reason and bring the country back to the path of democracy. Assuming that people voting in this fraudulent election somehow manage to teach the ruling generals some kind of a lesson, they are unlikely to relinquish power. China remains Myanmar's only friend and there is no indication that even this rising global power, with all its resources, can make the junta abandon the path of tyrannical, boorish isolation from the world.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-fraud-of-an-election/article16567085.ece
16,3,2010,A deeply flawed bill,"The civil nuclear liability bill is a deeply flawed piece of legislation that the government has done well to develop cold feet about. Broadly speaking, the law proposes to channel all legal liability stemming from a nuclear accident in India on to the nuclear power plant operator concerned. In turn, the operator's own individual liability is limited to Rs.500 crore regardless of the scale of the accident or of his own negligence. For any damages in excess of that amount, the bill makes the government liable up to a further level of 300 million Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), approximately Rs.2100 crore-2300 crore. Once India accedes to the IAEA's Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC), Indian victims could draw upon an international fund to the maximum amount of another 300 million SDRs. The first problem with the bill is the unconscionably low level of compensation envisaged by this three-tier system of payments. Assuming that every promised cent comes in, the maximum amount victims of a catastrophic nuclear accident could hope to receive would only be just about twice the $470 million the Indian government settled on for the Bhopal gas disaster way back in 1989. Secondly, there is a serious problem with the very concept of channelling liability since this lets the designers and suppliers of crucial equipment off the hook. The Indian bill allows for a right of recourse against suppliers, but with operator liability capped so low this provides no comfort at all.
The fatal flaw is the bill's perspective. The aim of any reasonable nuclear liability law should be to provide adequate and speedy compensation to the victims of a nuclear accident. It must be to use the concept of tortuous liability to incentivise the adoption of best safety practices by all those involved in the nuclear supply chain, be they equipment or raw material suppliers, transporters, or power plant operators. The cap on liability is tantamount to an unwarranted and counter-productive subsidy for the nuclear power industry. Moreover, under the guise of providing quick compensation, the victims have been deprived of any agency in the process. Their ability to move even an Indian court of law in the event of inadequate compensation would be severely compromised, a fatal infirmity with the bill given that many of the damages a nuclear accident might cause may not manifest themselves within the 10-year period stipulated in the law for filing claims. The government says that in the absence of such a law, U.S. equipment suppliers will not be able to provide India components like reactors. But then Russia and France, as suppliers, do not face any such problem. The issue with U.S. suppliers cannot be resolved by selling out the interests of the people of India — and the government must stiffen its spine to make this absolutely clear.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-deeply-flawed-bill/article16567379.ece
16,3,2010,Iraqi nationalists must deliver,"Despite mortar attacks and bombings, mainly in Baghdad and mostly by Sunni Islamists, which killed 38 people and wounded 110 more, the Iraqi general election took place as planned on March 7. About a million security personnel were deployed. The turnout was about 62 per cent. The electorate of 19 million, including 1.4 million outside the country, had the opportunity to elect a 325-seat Council of Representatives from 18 provinces. Under the law, a quarter of Council seats must be held by women, and the Council serves a four-year term. The campaign front-runner was the State of Law coalition led by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's Dawa Party. The coalition faced strong competition from former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's secular-nationalist Iraqiya List, and from the Iraqi National Alliance, a Shia-majority grouping. For their part, the provinces that fall within, or partly within, the autonomous northern region of Kurdistan saw a challenge mounted by the Kurdish Gorran (Change) party against the Kurdistania Alliance, which comprises President Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and Massoud Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party.
Counting has been delayed by technical problems and by the complicated nature of the ballot. The shape of the government may not emerge for several weeks. But initial results reveal significant political issues. Mr. Maliki's group leads narrowly, with strong support in Baghdad and five other provinces, including Basra in the south-east. The Iraqiya List leads in another five, including Sunni-majority Anbar to the west and the part-Kurdish province of Kirkuk. Mr. Maliki has already commenced talks with the Kurdistania Alliance leaders, who have trounced their Gorran rivals and are potential kingmakers. Predictably, Iraq's neighbours are watching closely. Iran, which has an admirably pragmatic attitude to this, wants Iraq to be stable and free of ethnic conflict, but neither Iran nor Turkey, with their significant Kurdish minorities, will want the demand for a Kurdish state revived. Saudi Arabia, which is nervous of potential Shia strength in Iraq, and Syria, which has a substantial Shia minority, also have a stake in post-election developments. For the region, and above all for the 31 million Iraqis, everything will depend on Mr. Maliki's and Mr. Allawi's capacity to prove the claim that they are primarily Iraqi nationalists.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Iraqi-nationalists-must-deliver/article16567372.ece
17,3,2010,Ensuring a level playing field,"A recent decision by the equity markets regulator, SEBI, has wide ranging implications for the capital market and its investors. From May 1, all those who want to apply for shares in a public issue must produce 100 per cent of the money as margin. Hitherto, qualified institutional bidders (QIB) were required to bring in just a tenth of the bid amount, while retail investors, in contrast, were required to provide for the full extent of application money. This practice was justified on the basis of some tenuous logic: retail applicants can furnish the full amount because the average size of an application is not very large, and there are banks and other agencies to provide finance, if need be. On the other hand, institutional investors are reckoned to be better credit risk. They would not ordinarily have any difficulty in bringing in the allotment money to the full extent required. This practice of allowing large investors to make “leveraged” bids is in keeping with a policy stance that moved away from the fairly even-handed treatment of all investors in the primary market that characterised capital market regulation during the early years of SEBI. The justification in allowing the QIBs to bid for large chunks of shares, while putting up only a fraction of the required amounts, is that they can participate in multiple offerings as well as submit bids for several times their requirements with a limited outlay.
What has been left unsaid of course is that the large institutional bids create an artificial premium for the particular offering. That along with the deliberately well-publicised reports of a massive oversubscription on day one would induce small investors, including fence sitters, to apply. The only way to strike at this pernicious market practice is to place all investors on the same footing as far as initial applications to a share issue are concerned. The argument that large investors suffer an opportunity cost in terms of lost interest and should therefore be allowed to bid with a small margin does not wash. Retail investors too suffer a similar fate. Besides, SEBI has asked for faster allotment procedures to be in place soon. The regulator can consider extending the ASBA (application supported by blocked amount) procedure, now being popularised for retail investors, to the institutional segment as well. Under this, applicants to a share issue authorise their banks to block funds equivalent to the application money. Since it is only at allotment time the funds are released, there is no interest loss. Though belated, the latest regulatory action to check information asymmetry and the spread of misleading, potentially price-distorting information is welcome.

17,3,2010,Brown's defining failure,"Prime Minister Gordon Brown recently appeared before the Iraq Inquiry (the Chilcot inquiry) in London. Unlike Tony Blair, he did not enter by the back door to evade protesters; unlike his predecessor, he expressed regret for the deaths of Iraqi civilians. As The Observer's chief political correspondent, Andrew Rawnsley, notes, Mr. Brown had no objection in principle to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq. To Chilcot, he defended the action, saying it amounted to the right decision for the right reasons, which he contended were Iraq's “serial” violations of 14 U.N. resolutions. He added that he had gone by the intelligence given to him at the time. He theorised that democracy could not be created overnight “at the barrel of a gun,” thereby distancing himself from neoconservative ideologues who claimed they were bringing democracy to Iraq. New Labour's unpopular helmsman, who faces a general election within weeks, evidently wanted to limit the damage to his reputation. But his responses to Chilcot raise questions about the domestic element in the invasion decision. That included fears that the Tories could hurt the government by claiming it was soft on terrorism; these fears were baseless considering that British voters had given Labour a majority of 167 seats in the 2001 general election.
It is bad enough that party-political concerns were among the reasons for the invasion, and even worse that Mr. Brown evaded more important issues. First, none of the U.N. resolutions at the time legitimated the invasion. Secondly, Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11. Thirdly, it had no weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). Furthermore, the British security services had voiced reservations on the so-called intelligence on Iraq's alleged store of WMDs, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) had expressed doubts about the legality of an invasion. In addition, Mr. Brown confirmed that he was unaware of Mr. Blair's letters to George W. Bush explicitly committing the U.K. to war; that he had not seen relevant FCO papers prepared in 2002; and that he did not know of Attorney-General Lord Goldsmith's initial legal doubts about an invasion. This ignorance might help Mr. Brown to avoid taking responsibility for his part in the invasion, but that is not his greatest failure. The U.S. has confirmed that it could not have invaded Iraq without British support. The British government could certainly not have participated without the support of the powerful Chancellor of the Exchequer. Mr. Brown's opposition would have put an end to the proposed monstrous crime. His failure to oppose it will define his political career.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Browns-defining-failure/article16569367.ece
18,3,2010,New-look Team Gadkari,"Even as the Women's Reservation Bill struggles to stay the course, the Nitin Gadkari-led Bharatiya Janata Party has demonstrated exemplary support to the cause of female empowerment by allocating close to a third of its party posts to women. This is a message as much to the Bill's biggest and loudest champion — the Congress party — as to the obstructionist Yadav troika of Mulayam Singh, Lalu Prasad, and Sharad Yadav. Although the Congress was the first to decide in principle that women should get a critical share of party posts, Congresswomen continue to be a largely invisible lot. In allocating generous space to women at various levels in the party hierarchy, the BJP has shown that gender justice need not become hostage to legislative battles. Team Gadkari also scores in bringing a blend of experience and youth to the table. Old hands expectedly dominate the party's parliamentary board while a fair sprinkling of young people, drawn from diverse social backgrounds, have made it to the lower echelons of power.
When Mr. Gadkari beat competition from a range of heavyweight insiders to become the BJP chief, not many thought him capable of finding his way in the factional minefield that the BJP has become in recent years. The new incumbent was inexperienced in realpolitik, and moreover, the shadow of Jhandewalan loomed large over his appointment. In the event, Mr. Gadkari has proved that he has a better grip of politics and party affairs than most of the veterans. The confidence has begun to show — especially in Parliament where Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj have emerged as formidable team leaders. It was at Mr. Jaitley's instance that the Women's Reservation Bill came to be debated before being put to vote in the Rajya Sabha. His speech in support of the Bill reflected bipartisanship of a kind sorely lacking in Indian political discourse. More importantly — without prejudice to what this newspaper thinks about the BJP's disintegrative political programme and ideology — it came across recently as a sober party capable of making its point skilfully, without resorting to drama and bad behaviour. There is also a flip side to the new thrust. Team Gadkari includes the disagreeable and intemperate Varun Gandhi, who has been rewarded with the prize post of party secretary. The accommodation of the young man from a famous lineage, whose vitriol against Muslims fetched him a prison stay during the 2009 general election, is a concession to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. As long as the BJP remains a child of the shadowy RSS, it will not be able to resist the temptation to play communal politics — which has proved to be its undoing again and again.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/New-look-Team-Gadkari/article16573328.ece
18,3,2010,Left-green revival in France,"The first round of the elections for the 26 French regional assemblies, which took place on March 14, has resulted in a thumping win for the Socialist Party (PS), led by Martine Aubry, over the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), President Nicolas Sarkozy's conservative party. The UMP trails in almost all 22 regions of metropolitan France, namely the mainland plus Corsica. Interior Ministry figures show the PS as having gained 29.5 per cent of the vote, well ahead of the UMP's 26.2 per cent and the environmentalist Europe Ecologie's 12.5 per cent. The campaign was marred by acrimony and racist and sexist diatribes as Mr. Sarkozy's colleagues followed his lead (in previous elections) with tough positions on crime, immigration, and the national identity. Yet that strategy has been rejected by habitual conservative voters. It has even failed to attract support from Jean-Marie Le Pen's hard-right anti-immigrant National Front (FN), which tallied 11.55 per cent. The second round takes place on March 21; despite some confusion over the announcements, the PS and Europe Ecologie have announced that their party lists will be combined in all but three regions.
As the regional elections constitute the last major ballot before the next presidential election, due in 2012, they are being seen as a national referendum on Mr. Sarkozy. That the results show immense dissatisfaction and even dislike for him and the UMP is not in doubt. Unemployment, at 10 per cent, is France's highest for a decade; businesses are closing, and farm incomes are diminishing, which is very serious in a culture proud of its regional agriculture. About a million French citizens are expected to slide further into poverty as their unemployment benefit runs out and they are transferred to other categories of state benefits. As for the economy, the French central bank's growth prediction is 0.4 per cent for the first quarter of 2010. Dissatisfaction with the President's policies is, however, only part of the voters' message. Many analysts see the low turnout, 46.35 per cent, as a symptom of a deep discontent with the nature of contemporary politics. This may partly account for the strong National Front performance. But the PS and Europe Ecologie have realised that they are the parties that can do most with the first-round results; the former can win back large numbers of Left-inclined voters, and the latter can use their strong showing to initiate a new political agenda, this time as substantial members of a Left-green bloc. The stakes are high.

19,3,2010,In defence of PDS,"The central vigilance committee led by retired Justice D. P. Wadhwa, which was established by the Supreme Court of India to monitor its orders in the PIL on the right to food, has come out with a strong indictment of the public distribution system (PDS). Based on State-level reports for Delhi, Orissa, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Karnataka, the committee has identified widespread corruption at different levels of the system. To ensure the availability of basic items of food at affordable prices to the masses, containing and eradicating corruption in the PDS is an imperative. The committee has made several useful suggestions in this regard, including automation of the weighing system, doorstep delivery of food grain to fair-price shops, speeding up cases pending in courts under the Essential Commodities Act, and setting up inspection squads. It points to the lack of a system of accounting for grain allocated and a weak implementation of the monitoring and vigilance procedures. Rooting out corruption requires action by the executive and the judiciary, and also more directly through gram sabhas.
The recommendation of the committee for the “abolition of APL,” however, is unwarranted. Indeed, many of the ills of the PDS today can be traced to the introduction of narrow targeting in 1996, and the artificial and unfair separation of BPL (below-poverty-line) and APL (above-poverty-line) households. It is now widely recognised that the current definition of BPL is really a definition of destitution and has excluded large numbers of poor, malnourished, and food-insecure households from the ambit of the PDS. Incentives for diversion of grain, as the committee notes, stem from the high demand for BPL cards and the unmet needs of the so-called APL households. Targeting, it notes, has reduced the profits of traders running fair price shops. International experience shows that narrow targeting lowers the quality of welfare programmes. Lessons have also to be learnt from Tamil Nadu and Kerala. In Tamil Nadu, all households have access to grain of the same quantity, quality, and price, and there are recognisably fewer leakages in the PDS. Prior to targeting, Kerala, with near-universal programme coverage, was renowned for having the best-run PDS. It is well known in law that the misuse of a thing is no argument against its use. In the name of reducing corruption, the public distribution system itself must not be dismantled. On the contrary, during a period of high food inflation and in a country with the largest number of malnourished people in the world, the PDS needs to be strengthened and made universal.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/In-defence-of-PDS/article16576729.ece
19,3,2010,Agenda for road safety,"The resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly urging all nations to launch a decade of action on road safety from 2011 resonates with India's vulnerable road users. The Global Status Report on Road Safety, published by the World Health Organisation in 2009, reveals that the country leads a group of 10 countries with an appalling record. This small group records over 60 per cent of the 1.3 million road accident deaths reported worldwide. In India, death and disability from accidents have been rising steadily in tandem with motorisation; and the majority of victims are pedestrians, cyclists, and two-wheeler riders. The magnitude of the problem is clear from the report of the Sundar Committee of the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways released three years ago. The failure of governments to act in the face of its findings is responsible for the loss of about 100,000 lives each year. The burden of injuries is no less staggering. Even with under-reporting, the number of people injured is five times the number of deaths. Research studies indicate that the actual figure could be 15 times more. Yet very little has been done to implement the road map for safety drawn up by the Ministry's expert committee.
The U.N. resolution urging decade-long efforts should spur the Indian government to end the carnage on the roads. Action in key areas can achieve quick results. These include building better roads, curbing drunk driving, enforcing compulsory use of helmets and seat belts, and strict norms for use of cell phones while driving. Such interventions produce effective outcomes and the central and state governments must accord them high priority. A sizable part of the funds allocated for road safety during the 10th Plan period, and the first three years of the 11th Plan, remained unspent. This is partly because many States have not met mandatory norms for utilisation. The funds, running into several crores of rupees a year, could have financed safety infrastructure, driver training, and modernisation. The hope is that the Road Safety Bill, which is expected to be introduced in Parliament during the current session, will address several long-pending issues. This law must not stop with creating the anticipated National Road Safety and Traffic Management Board, but compel state agencies to become accountable in the areas of infrastructure and enforcement. Meanwhile, there are simple ways of protecting people on the roads. A good start can be made in metropolitan and urban India by investing in pedestrian infrastructure, traffic calming, and public transport. It has been established that such measures lower accident risk dramatically.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Agenda-for-road-safety/article16576730.ece
20,3,2010,Behind Headley's plea bargain,"Five years after he began the surveillance operation that finally guided a ten-man death squad through the streets of Mumbai in November, 2008, Pakistani-American jihadist David Headley has entered into a plea bargain with U.S. prosecutors. In India, the deal has provoked media outrage but careful study of the Plea Agreement (accessible under Resources at beta.thehindu.com) shows that claims that Headley has got off lightly are misplaced. Plea bargains in the United States work around a complex points system set up by the United States Sentencing Commission. In return for pleading guilty to all the 12 terrorism-related charges, and for meeting specified obligations for cooperation with investigators, prosecutors will recommend a reduction in sentence. In essence, Headley will avoid facing the death penalty and will not be extradited to India, Pakistan, or Denmark. However, the judge hearing the case is not bound by the sentencing recommendations — and if they are rejected, Headley will not be able to withdraw his guilty plea. Nor, unlike an approver in an Indian criminal trial, will he be granted a pardon in return for giving state's evidence. Some commentators have speculated that the Plea Agreement means Headley was a secret U.S. agent. The truth is that the U.S. repeatedly passed on substantial intelligence to India of the looming threat to Mumbai in the months before 26/11. Had Headley been the source of those warnings, he would be in the process of receiving a medal — not life in prison.
Just what has Headley — who made a similar plea bargain earlier in his troubled life, in connection with a narcotics-trafficking prosecution — promised in return for his life? Paragraph 12 of the Plea Agreement states that he will, when directed to do so by the U.S. Attorney's office, “fully and truthfully participate in any debriefings for the purpose of gathering intelligence or national security information.” In addition, he will “fully and truthfully testify in foreign judicial proceedings held in the United States, videoconferencing or letters rogatory.” This means he will have no choice but to testify in the ongoing trial of Mumbai attack suspects if called on to do so by Maharashtra prosecutors. He must also cooperate in any future criminal proceedings initiated by the National Investigations Agency on the Lashkar-e-Taiba's plot to attack the National Defence College in New Delhi. Further, Headley has agreed to “the postponement of his sentencing until after the conclusion of his cooperation.” Paragraph 8 of the Plea Agreement reveals that he has already “provided substantial assistance to the criminal investigation, and also has provided information of significant intelligence value.” This cooperation should strengthen the case against his co-accused, Tahawwur Rana, as well as key Lashkar operatives in Pakistan. Barring death-penalty enthusiasts, no one has any reason to bemoan the Plea Agreement. India's investigators and justice system must move quickly to capitalise on Headley's intelligence and testimony.

20,3,2010,A super regulator no one wants,"In his Budget speech, the Finance Minister proposed the setting up an apex regulator for the financial sector, which would enable the government “to strengthen and institutionalise the mechanism for maintaining financial stability.” The proposed Financial Stability and Development Council would monitor the macro-prudential regulation of the economy and address inter-regulatory coordination issues. The move to entrust it with the task of coordinating the activities of the existing regulators — the RBI, SEBI, the IRDA, and the PFRDA — has set off an intense debate. The existing oversight arrangement, of course, has not delivered. The High Level Coordination Committee (HLCC) on capital markets, supplemented by operational coordination among the regulators, has not been equal to the task. For instance, it has not been able to prevent turf wars between the IRDA and SEBI over the unit-linked insurance plans. The debt markets have stumbled between two regulatory jurisdictions, those of SEBI and the RBI.
For the new Council to accomplish what the HLCC has not been able to do, it might have to encroach on the autonomy of individual regulators. Such a prospect appeals to no one. Besides, there is every possibility that over the medium term the Council would become a unified regulatory authority for the financial sector. Bringing all regulatory functions under one roof has not worked well in countries where it was tried. The authorities need to clarify whether it is at all necessary to create a new body to monitor macro-prudential regulation and maintain financial stability when the RBI has been fulfilling nearly all those functions. Its role in insulating the domestic economy from the recent global crisis has been widely acclaimed. By setting up the new body, the government seeks to fix problems that do not exist in India. It must learn from the U.K., which tinkered with a long-established tradition and shifted the responsibility of prudential regulation from the Bank of England to a new authority, which proved grossly ineffective as the financial crisis unfolded. While attempts are already on to restore the status quo ante, it is clear that prudential regulation goes hand in hand with the central bank's role as a lender of last resort.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-super-regulator-no-one-wants/article16577026.ece
22,3,2010,Hollow offer,"Against the backdrop of Washington's efforts to tighten international sanctions on Iran, President Barack Obama's latest reiteration of his offer of comprehensive diplomatic contacts and dialogue with the Islamic Republic smacks of disingenuousness and insincerity. During the U.S. presidential campaign in 2009, candidate Obama won applause around the world for boldly declaring his readiness to meet with Iranian leaders and find a negotiated end to the nuclear question and other issues bedevilling bilateral relations. But ever since he got to the White House, the Democratic president has been unable to shake off the legacy of 30 years of American hostility towards Tehran. President Obama's first false step was to ignore President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and send a message directly to the Iranian Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei. Whatever his motivations, Mr. Obama's approach was seen by Iran as a crude attempt to play factions, a belief validated later when Washington openly took sides in the stand-off between Mr. Ahmadinejad and the supporters of Mir-Hossein Mousavi, who lost the presidential contest last year in an election widely believed to have been rigged. Encouraged by the apparent street power of the opposition Green Movement, the Obama administration committed a further blunder in believing that a regime change from within was imminent. Labouring under this illusion, it has allowed promising diplomatic proposals aimed at building confidence in the nuclear arena to wither on the vine.
Compounding Washington's gross misreading of the situation within Iran is the virtual veto on Iranian policy the Obama administration appears to have given to Israel. Tel Aviv's mindless rhetoric about the need for military strikes against nuclear sites in Iran has been used by American officials to steamroller the international community into supporting tougher sanctions against Tehran. There is, as yet, no formal proposal before the U.N. Security Council but the U.S., Britain, and France are keen to introduce a ban on gasoline sales to Iran, given that country's lack of refining capacity and its dependence on imported petrol. Among the key UNSC members, Brazil, Turkey, and China have come out against the plan. Beijing's opposition is notable because of its significant energy ties with Iran and the fact that it has a veto. India is not a member of the Security Council but needs nevertheless to join the international debate by joining issue with those who believe sanctions and coercion will help resolve the nuclear issue. Even if the American fears about Iran's intentions are true —and there is no evidence to suggest those are justified — there is ample room for diplomacy. Instead of offering peace while threatening sanctions, President Obama should learn to unclench his fist.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Hollow-offer/article16578569.ece
22,3,2010,Return of Tiger,"For Tiger Woods, the path to perdition was a short drive from the parking lot of his home in Florida to a fire hydrant on a neighbour's property. But the road to redemption, on which he has embarked bravely by announcing his return to competitive golf at the Augusta Masters, is likely to be long and bumpy. He will need all his legendary fighting skills to begin the arduous process of rebuilding his life and career. The sports media have always been kind to him, even in awe of him, until his serial philandering came to light a few months ago. But that phase of his career may well be over. At the Masters, however clever and imaginative his PR team (headed now by the former presidential press secretary Ari Fleischer), he is likely to be confronted for the first time by a largely adversarial media. His long silence and half-hearted apology, followed much later by a press conference at which he seemed to want to do all the right things but failed to do them, did not do much to restore his image among the media, corporate sponsors, or even his fans. In the event, reassembling brand Woods would appear less important than regaining public trust — something the champion lost with his akratic behaviour.
On the other hand, it would be churlish to begrudge Woods his return stage. The return of a great sportsman who has given so much joy to millions of people and whose best may still lie ahead is decidedly an event to celebrate. If there are those who believe that Woods has hijacked the year's first Major at the game's most hallowed venue for self-serving ends, they need to be reminded that everybody — not least a prodigiously gifted champion who has redefined the sport — deserves a second chance. This has nothing to do with television ratings, although it is true that Woods's return could lift the value of sponsors' TV spots by more than 40 per cent and viewership by more than 50 per cent. It is an elemental part of what sport is about — it's the capacity to offer the chance for transformation. If Diego Maradona, Shane Warne, and Kobe Bryant managed to vault over career-threatening humps, then there is no reason to believe that Woods cannot. “I fully expected Tiger to play the Masters and that will be good for Augusta,'' says Jack Nicklaus. Before Tiger was old enough to enrol in a school, his father Earl Woods told him that breaking Nicklaus's record of 18 major titles was going to be his life mission. Now he has a second chance to accomplish what has always seemed Mission Possible.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Return-of-Tiger/article16578568.ece
23,3,2010,Rape law and reform,"The laws relating to rape and sexual assault are set to undergo a radical overhaul with the Union Home Ministry readying a draft Bill on the subject. Home Minister P. Chidambaram's remarks suggest that the proposed legislation is likely to be based on the Law Commission of India's 172nd report, which called for a thoroughgoing review of our rape laws. The 2000 report was prepared following a direction from the Supreme Court that loopholes in the law relating to rape and sexual assault should be identified with a view to plugging them. At least two major changes seem to be on the anvil. First, the meaning of rape, which Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code construes as non-consensual sexual intercourse, will be broadened to cover other forms of penetrative acts that fall outside the purview of the existing definition. The Law Commission, the National Commission for Women, and various feminist organisations have supported such a widening of the definition of rape on the ground that the existing legal provisions neither reflect nor deal adequately with the various kinds of sexual assault women are subjected to in India. The restrictive interpretation of the term 'penetration' in the Explanation to Section 375 fails to address the myriad ways victims of sexual crime can be humiliated — physically, emotionally, and psychologically. Rape, as feminists have argued, must be understood as an experience of brutal violation and degradation and not just the act of penetration.
The proposed legislation will also broaden the definition of rape in another respect — by making it gender-neutral. This is principally to protect males, particularly young boys, who could be victims of homosexual crime. As the Law Commission observed in its report on rape laws: “Not only women but young boys are being increasingly subjected to forced sexual assaults...[which] causes no less trauma and psychological damage to a boy than to a girl subjected to such offence.” It is a mistake to regard gender-neutrality as a dilution of the rape law. While girls and women are victims of the vast majority of sexual crimes, boys and men suffer too. Statistics reveal that one out of 10 rape and sexual assault victims in the United States and England is male. Indian laws relating to rape have remained virtually unchanged since 1862, when the IPC came into force. (Some amendments made in 1983 have not made much of a difference.) It is necessary to review the law in a humane and progressive manner, factoring in what we know about the patterns of sexual assault and the severe trauma it inflicts on victims. The Home Ministry's draft Bill, which promises to do precisely this, will be closely watched.

A sentence in “Rape law and reform” (Editorial, March 24, 2010) was “At least two major changes seem to be on the anvil”, leading to a query on what the phrase “on the anvil meant” as it is not listed in major dictionaries. “On the anvil” is thought to be an Indian English expression, often used to mean something is about to appear or happen.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Rape-law-and-reform/article16614509.ece
23,3,2010,Mammals under threat,"A reliable measure of just how endangered the natural environment is in an era of fast-paced economic development is necessary to advance conservation goals. A recent research report on the likely local extinction threat to 25 mammal species in India over a 100-year time frame attempts to provide some answers. Scientists have looked at over 30,000 historical records about the presence of these animals and assessed them against their current status. What emerges from the work of Krithi K. Karanth and other researchers published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society should be of interest to all citizens who seek to preserve a part of the natural heritage of this hotspot-rich area of earth. One of the key conclusions is about the relatively high estimated probability of local extinction of all the animals surveyed, which range from prey species like spotted deer, sambar, muntjac, swamp deer, wild pig, and gaur to predators such as tiger, leopard, and lion. This is a timely alert. Fortunately, a lot can be done to improve the prospects of survival of these species in varied habitats, going by the fine-grained research data.
India has only about two per cent of its geography under the formal protected area system. The conclusion that these areas lower the probability of extinction in the case of 18 species should serve to tighten government policies that will make them inviolable and immune from even regulated extraction of resources. Further, several mammal species such as mouse deer, blackbuck, chinkara, sloth bear, jackal, and wolf have a range that extends beyond the small geographical area currently protected by law. This underscores the need to expand the protected area system. The vitality of the hills as reservoirs of biodiversity, highlighted by the research, also needs to be recognised — there is evidence that eight species had a lower likelihood of going locally extinct in elevated areas. Cultural factors also work in favour of seven species, although such tolerance has not come to the rescue of some rare endemic animals such as the Nilgiri tahr, swamp deer, and lion. The research data should be of real help to policymakers driving development. For example, they provide a ready map for infrastructure planners, identifying the areas to avoid while giving sanction to gas pipelines, mines, roads, and highways. With intelligent planning, it should be possible to avert protracted development conflicts over the environment. The challenge before India is to retain its natural heritage while working to improve the lives of its billion-plus population. It must act resolutely to stop the march of extinction with sensible land use policies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mammals-under-threat/article16598860.ece
23,3,2010,Obama's healthcare triumph,"On March 21, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 219 to 212 to concur with the Senate Amendments Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The Republicans, who voted unanimously against the motion, were joined by 34 Democrats but could not block a historic piece of legislation that will transform U.S. healthcare. Most of the bill takes effect in 2014; the 32 million Americans currently uninsured — in a total population of 308 million — will be covered. All businesses employing 50 people or more will have to pay a fee of $2000 per employee or offer insurance; part-time staff are included. State-level exchanges will be created where small businesses, the self-employed, and those uninsured will be able to choose from a range of insurance schemes. For households, there will be tax credits, and capped insurance premiums will be available to families on low incomes. It is highly significant that gender discrimination, age limits, and exclusion for pre-existing conditions will be banned, as will lifetime dollar limits on policies. The popular Medicaid programme, started in 1965, for people on low incomes will be expanded; there will be some expansion of the equally popular Medicare system, also dating from 1965, which is for many of those retired or over 65. Current estimates are that the implementation of the bill, which now goes to President Obama to be signed into law, will cost $940 billion over 10 years.
Healthcare reform in the U.S. has always been politically fraught, and the Obama administration has worked extremely hard to obtain Congressional approval for the bill. Many Democrats supported it only on condition that federal funds would not be available for abortion; that will have to be paid for separately by those who buy health insurance. Furthermore, individual States will be able to ban abortion on insurance offered through the proposed exchanges, though exceptions will hold for rape, incest, and danger to the mother's life. Secondly, the so-called public option, whereby a federal government scheme would offer insurance paid for solely from premiums, was a casualty of the earlier political battles. Mr. Obama has, nevertheless, taken almost the only opportunity available to persuade Congress to pass the bill while he is also dealing with the economic stimulus package, the bank bailouts, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Republicans will certainly mount all possible resistance at State level and will try to cause maximum damage to the Democrats in November's mid-term Congressional elections. That much of the $3.47 billion spent on lobbying Congress in 2009 was used for opposing health reform shows how bitter the opposition is to Mr. Obama's single biggest domestic policy commitment, as do the lies and smears levelled at supporters of reform. Mr. Obama's success with this bill amounts to a notable political triumph.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Obamas-healthcare-triumph/article16583686.ece
23,3,2010,What genome sequencing reveals,"How rich human genetic diversity is has been revealed by the fully sequenced genomes of an indigenous southern African hunter-gatherer belonging to the Khoisan or Bushmen community, and a Bantu individual. The Bantu individual is none other than liberation hero and Nobel Laureate Desmond Tutu. This is the first time that genomes of minority populations in Africa have been sequenced. The study, published recently in Nature, shows that southern Africans have about 1.3 million novel DNA differences compared with the genomes of West Africans, Asians, and Europeans. In addition to the genetic differences, partial genome sequencing of three more Bushmen revealed that they have 13,146 amino acid variants. Such is the genetic variation that two of the Bushmen studied, who may at times be within walking distance of each other, are more different than, for instance, a European and an Asian. Previous studies indicated an extraordinarily high level of genetic variation among indigenous populations in Africa. This was only to be expected as humans had lived in southern Africa much longer than in any other part of the world, and therefore had greater chances of accumulating genetic differences. A comparison of the Bushmen's single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with those of the chimpanzee's reveals that very few of the differences seen in their genome are ancestral.
The latest study has important implications for medical research. It will help in identifying diseases caused by genetic variations, and in understanding how genetic variations influence the effectiveness of drugs — a field of medical research called pharmogenomics. With no genomic data of southern Africans available, all pharmogenomic research and genetic disease susceptibility studies carried out so far have mostly used European genome sequences. As the sequenced data of all the five individuals are freely available, drug companies will be better equipped to produce drugs for these populations, and understand why Bushmen are particularly susceptible to TB. The results have inspired a more detailed investigation of the neglected people of Africa. The same team of researchers has begun to study different ethnic groups in Africa; the recruitment of volunteers has begun; and specific information from the present study has been incorporated for quicker and detailed investigation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/What-genome-sequencing-reveals/article16583668.ece
24,3,2010,Money gets tighter,"The Reserve Bank of India's traditional policy dilemma of reconciling economic growth with price stability has once again come into sharp focus. Last week the central bank hiked the short-term policy rates, the repo and the reverse repo rates, by 0.25 percentage point each. Taking into account the unexpectedly large 0.75 percentage point increase in the Cash Reserve Ratio announced in the January policy, the latest move confirms the shift to a tighter monetary stance. The CRR hike resulted in an impounding of nearly Rs.36,000 crore of bank deposits. Evidently, the developments since January, especially the unrelenting rise in the inflation rate, suggested stronger, more overt signals from the RBI in the form of a hike in the repo and the reverse repo rates. Many financial market participants, of course, were taken by surprise. Banks close their books for the financial year on March 31 and interest rate changes have enormous implications for their balance sheets. Besides, since the annual policy statement for 2010-11 is due on April 20, many assumed that the RBI would not act until then. However, there have been several occasions in the recent past when monetary measures were announced outside the policy dates. More specifically, the third quarter review in January left no one in doubt that the RBI would intervene proactively and strongly if and when necessary.
Economic growth has been underpinned by a strong performance of the manufacturing sector. The acceleration in the growth of the capital goods sector points to a revival of investment activity. After declining for 13 successive months, exports have been rising since November 2009, but more significantly it is domestic demand that has been driving the recent economic growth. With supply of goods struggling to catch up, inflation concerns are growing. Despite some slight moderation, food inflation remains at unacceptably high levels. The overall inflation in February based on the wholesale price was just short of double digits, while consumer price inflation, as measured by various indices, has accentuated further. The hike in the policy rates has to be seen as a continuation of the process of moving away from the cheap monetary policy that began in October 2009 and was carried forward in January. Given the still-abundant liquidity, several banks have said that they will not be marking up their lending rates immediately. It is however highly unlikely that they can put it off for long.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Money-gets-tighter/article16614457.ece
24,3,2010,Bravo BrahMos,"The successful flight of the BrahMos missile on March 21 spotlights India's status as a world leader in launching supersonic cruise missiles vertically from moving warships and manoeuvring the missiles at the supersonic speed of 2.8 Mach. Launching a missile in an inclined mode is relatively easy. But lifting off vertically from a rolling and pitching vessel, climbing, turning and cruising horizontally, performing manoeuvres, and precisely hitting the target is technologically a big task. Astonishingly, BrahMos performed its intricate manoeuvres at 2.8 Mach, with its propulsion fully switched on during the whole course of its flight. (Normally, when a missile performs manoeuvres, its engines will not operate.) Another highlight was the advanced indigenous software for way point manoeuvring that enables the low-flying missile to hit a target vessel taking shelter, for instance, behind a rocky island. This was the 22nd launch of BrahMos, a joint venture product of the Defence Research and Development Organisation of India and NPO Mashinostroyenia, a space-missile enterprise of the Russian Federation. BrahMos is a versatile, two-stage missile that is nine metres long and weighs 3.9 tonnes with the canister. It has a range of 290 km. It can carry only non-nuclear warheads. With a flight record demonstrating a high degree of reliability, it has already been inducted into the Navy and the Army. India has ship-to-ship, ship-to-land, land-to-land, and land-to-ship versions of BrahMos.
Nobody in their right mind wants lethal missiles fired to kill, destroy, and inflict damage on civilian targets. Since the BrahMos missile is all about enhancing defence capability, a vertical launch from a ship has several advantages. First, it ensures the vessel's safety because the missile is pushed out vertically and its booster engine is fired in the air, allowing the ship to move away. Secondly, the missile in vertical launch can take on a target lying anywhere in a 360-degree range. Whatever the ship's orientation, the missile can turn in any direction to pursue the target. Thirdly, the vertical placement enables accommodation of more missiles in less space in a warship's cramped environs. The missiles are concealed inside the ship, providing them with long and safe storage and protection against corrosion. With India declaring that it would not use nuclear weapons first against another country, BrahMos becomes a formidable and highly cost-effective defence because it can hit any attacker with speed, power, and precision. Given its fast reaction — it takes off in four minutes from the time the command is given from launch headquarters — the missile has virtually no equal in a hypothetical conventional battlefield. BrahMos is a state-of-the-art demonstration of the great advantages of Indo-Soviet, and now Indo-Russian, defence cooperation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Bravo-BrahMos/article16614469.ece
26,3,2010,America's Pakistan strategy,"There is no reason for India to be alarmed over the newly launched U.S.-Pakistan strategic dialogue. There is no need to worry, as some have begun to do, that this week's talks in Washington mark the beginning of a new phase in the re-hypenation of Delhi and Islamabad. In the run-up to the dialogue, Indian officials allowed themselves to be blindsided by the well-publicised wish list the Pakistanis said they were taking with them. The demands included American mediation over the Kashmir dispute with India as well as a civil nuclear energy agreement to allow the country to access global nuclear technology and fuel. In the context of the high decibel campaign (within Pakistan) of water theft by India, U.S. intervention was solicited to help effect a better water-sharing arrangement. On all of these counts, Pakistan's delegation will have to return empty handed. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who led the U.S. side in the strategic dialogue, promised help in increasing the efficiency of Pakistani energy and water utilisation; but she was clear and forthright in emphasising the importance of bilateral dialogue between India and Pakistan in the quest for solutions to outstanding issues. As for nuclear energy, Pakistan was told that a deal of the kind India got in 2005 is not on the table.
In courting Islamabad, President Barack Obama has been careful not to squander the gains Washington has made in building up a ‘strategic partnership' with India over the past decade. Mediation and other forms of interference are non-starters and the U.S. knows this. But in its search for an exit route from the quagmire of Afghanistan, the Obama administration is in danger of becoming over-dependent on Pakistan. This is where the danger for India, and, ultimately for the U.S. and the rest of the international community, lies. The presence of Pakistan's army and intelligence chiefs at the strategic dialogue underlined the abnormality of the situation. Terrorism and extremist politics in the AfPak region are mainly the product of the Pakistani military establishment, which nurtured and patronised jihadi groups as a force multiplier. Despite this, a solution is now being sought by valorising and even strengthening the role of this establishment at the expense of Pakistan's civilian structures of governance. If it was clear that the military had learnt its lessons and decided to change course irrevocably, the American approach might have some merit. But the continuing links between the army and the ISI, on the one hand, and terrorist groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba, on the other, are too well-known to ignore. The U.S. knows this and is using the strategic dialogue as a lever to influence Islamabad. The danger, of course, is that the lever may work the other way.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Americas-Pakistan-strategy/article16614755.ece
26,3,2010,China's rise in science,"President Barack Obama has earmarked $66 billion for non-defence research and development, which includes substantial funding for basic-science research, in his budget proposal for the fiscal year 2011. This six per cent increase over the 2010 budget allocation reflects the United States' anxiety to stay on top; China is fast catching up with it. The socialist country's efforts over three decades to improve its competitiveness in science and technology have started showing results. While Mr. Obama has given the thumbs down to NASA's plan of sending humans to moon, China's moon mission is very much on track. So is its mission to send unmanned probes to collect moon soil before 2020. Writing in the New Scientist, Jonathan Adam, author of the 2009 Thomson Reuter's Global Research Report on China, says: “If it continues in the current trajectory, China will overtake the U.S. before 2020.” The credit must go to China's two-pronged approach: capacity building and liberal funding. Since 2000, it has been the world's second largest producer of scientific knowledge. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report of 2007, China's gross spending on R&D grew at 18 per cent a year during 1995-2006. Its R&D budget for 2009 is $25.7 billion, a 26 per cent increase over 2008. This places it just behind the U.S. and Japan in terms of R&D spending.
A proxy way to assess a country's research strength is to look at the number of papers published by its nationals in international journals. For China, this number has risen from 20,000 in 1998 to 112,000 in 2008, according to the 2009 Thomson Reuter report. If joint authorship with researchers from scientifically developed countries is one way to assess quality of research, it was nine per cent with the U.S. collaborators alone. Another indicator of high-quality research done in China comes from the latest ranking by the Nature Group of Publications (NGP). The ranking of countries in the Asia-Pacific region based on the number of papers published in its journals during the past year (after correcting for the number of authors from each country) places China second, after Japan.While the biological sciences constitute a major thrust area, other areas such as material sciences, nanotechnology, space, atomic energy, computer science, and information technology are getting increasing attention. Nobody who follows non-defence R&D seriously is likely to disagree with New Scientist's assessment that “China's emergence as a scientific superpower can no longer be denied.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Chinas-rise-in-science/article16614754.ece
27,3,2010,Stopping ballistic missile,"The deployment of India's planned ballistic missile shield is to start in two years' time. The Defence Research and Development Organisation, which is developing and testing the complex system, intends to roll it out in two phases and have all of it up and running by 2016. The first phase will deal with missiles having a range of less than 2,000 km, and the second will tackle missiles with a longer range. The latter will be travelling much faster than the former and are therefore less easily targeted. There will be interceptors to destroy the incoming missiles at heights of over 50 km as well as much closer to the ground. Such a tiered defence is intended to boost the chances of knocking out an incoming missile before it hits the target. The problems encountered with a Prithvi missile simulating an enemy attack in a recent test is not likely to be a serious setback to these plans. India is not the only country that seeks to protect its citizens from enemy missiles carrying nuclear and other lethal warheads. The United States has been developing anti-ballistic missile systems for over 60 years. Its highly ambitious missile shield aims to destroy ballistic missiles during all stages of their flight. In February 2010, the U.S. successfully tested an airborne laser carried aloft on a modified Boeing 747, which was used to destroy a missile less than two minutes after it was fired. Israel, Japan, and the Taiwan regime too intend to establish missile defence capabilities. China, which demonstrated its anti-satellite capability in 2007, successfully conducted a mid-course missile interception test in January this year. Russia has a system of its own that was developed during the Cold War.
A big unanswered question is how effective any of these missile shields, including the Indian one, will be in an actual conflict situation, especially if it is between nuclear-armed nations. The technical evaluation of the U.S. system carried out by the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2000 is instructive. It found that there were a range of countermeasures an attacker could take to “confuse, overwhelm or otherwise defeat the defence.” Any country capable of deploying a long-range missile would be able to use them. Decoys could overload a defensive system and allow attacking missiles to slip past. Besides, even the U.S. system is intended to be effective against only a “limited ballistic missile attack.” The Indian defensive shield too will have similar limitations: if a single nuclear-tipped missile gets through, the consequences will be calamitous. This country would do better to rely on diplomacy, rather than a chancy missile shield, to increase its security.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Stopping-ballistic-missile/article16615661.ece
27,3,2010,Financial literacy and inclusion,"At a very basic level, financial education is about disseminating knowledge and information about the products and services offered by banks and other institutions. The objective is to make people aware of the risks and rewards so that they can make an informed choice. Financial literacy, in that sense, enables an individual to improve the management of one's finances and avoid distress. As the Reserve Bank of India Governor D. Subbarao said recently, financial education should begin at a very early age and be built into the curriculum of schools and colleges. Obviously, answers to questions such as when to save, what to save and how to save, will determine the level and quality of savings. The country naturally benefits through higher savings and investments. Realising the imperatives as well as the advantages, several countries have set up specialised bodies to spread financial literacy, supplementing the work done by regulators, financial institutions, non-governmental organisations and other less formal agencies. India has no nationwide structured financial education programme, but significant work is being done by the RBI, SEBI, Indian Banks' Association, various self-regulatory organisations and the Banking Code and Standards Board of India.
In India, financial literacy and awareness should go hand in hand, if the very important socio-economic objective of financial inclusion is to be achieved. The task is challenging because the majority of the population is still beyond the pale of the banking system. Alternative financial delivery channels involving the use of modern technology are being tried out but these will succeed only if financial literacy deepens. It is heartening that a few banks have set up dedicated centres to promote financial literacy and, eventually, inclusion. The other banks will do well to follow this lead, for they will all benefit from the feed back received. They can better understand their relatively new markets and offer region-specific products. Several related benefits also will flow from a concerted programme of spreading financial literacy. Consumers who are better-informed will demand accountability and seek redressal of grievances. That in turn would enhance the effectiveness and integrity of financial markets. As financial education empowers the common person, it reduces the government's burden in the matter of protecting him or her from the elements of market failure arising from information asymmetries. For these and other reasons, the RBI Governor has said financial literacy is not just a public good but a merit good too.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Financial-literacy-and-inclusion/article16615673.ece
28,3,2010,New START for nuclear-free world,"On April 8, the United States and Russia will sign a landmark arms agreement to slash their nuclear arsenals by no less than a third. The significance of the pact goes beyond the number of warheads and missiles the two sides have agreed to cut. It is the first legally binding and verifiable nuclear reduction pact the U.S. and Russia have negotiated in two decades after the end of the Cold War. It reinstates the U.S-Russian nuclear security regime that would have otherwise fallen apart after the 1991 Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty lapsed in December 2009. The follow-on agreement revives the arms reduction process and opens the way to further cuts by the two nuclear superpowers, which account for more than 90 per cent of the world's nuclear armaments. It creates momentum for the “reset” announced last year by Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev to build a new bilateral partnership. The new START was negotiated in a spirit of give-and-take. Mr. Obama had a real problem: he had to overcome strong opposition from his conservative critics at home who contended that Washington need not sign the treaty at all as Moscow was dismantling its ageing missiles anyway. In turn, Russia relaxed its insistence on imposing specific constraints on U.S. missile defence programmes — to facilitate treaty ratification in the Republican-dominated Senate.
The new treaty will breathe life into the vision of a nuclear-free world embraced by Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev. Everyone knows the road to this will be extremely long and tortuous. Already, the two sides have differed in their reading of the treaty's provisions. The Kremlin says it will establish a “legally binding linkage” between strategic offensive weapons and strategic missile defences. The U.S. State Department, however, asserts that it enforces “no constraints” on U.S. missile defence programmes. These clashing interpretations point to a fundamental chasm between Washington and Moscow. The U.S. broke a rigid link between offensive and defensive weapon systems when George W. Bush, of all Presidents, scrapped the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Russia says that unless the linkage is restored, no further nuclear cuts will be possible. Moreover, it warns that it will walk out of the START follow-on treaty if the U.S. proceeds to build a global missile shield, as this would upset the strategic nuclear balance between the two nuclear superpowers. Mr. Obama has put on hold any major ballistic missile development programme. He should follow up by accepting the Russian proposal to jointly build a missile defence against any future threats. This will create a strong foundation of trust the U.S. and Russia need to build on as they embark on the path of a nuclear-free world.

28,3,2010,Improve fire-safety compliance,"Fire accidents happen with dismaying regularity in buildings in Indian cities causing heavy casualties. Nine people were killed and 68 injured in Bangalore last month when a fire broke out in a commercial building. This week, in a worse accident at Kolkata's Stephen Court building, 34 lives were lost. Authorities are still looking for some more people who are missing. Some of the bodies were so charred that family members were unable to recognise them and sought the help of DNA examination to ascertain identity. As in most previous accidents, precious lives would have been saved had fire safety norms and building rules been followed. The fifth and sixth floors, which were gutted, have been found to be unauthorised constructions, with the fire safety rules flouted with impunity. Much of the Bangalore tragedy could have been averted had the corridors leading to staircases not been encroached upon, had fire exits been kept open, unsafe old electrical cables replaced, and the hoardings removed. What is clear is that lessons have not been learnt from the heart-breaking calamities of Kumbakonam (2004), where more than 90 children were burnt to death, and Uphaar Cinema, Delhi (1997), where 59 people lost their lives.
There is little point in the State government rushing to adopt a new set of fire safety regulations, of which there is no dearth. The National Building Code (NBC), published in 1970 and last updated in 2005, prescribes the minimum fire safety and rescue measures to be provided in buildings. In addition, cities have their own rules for multi-storey structures and procedures for periodical checking of fire safety systems. What is missing is a real and measurable improvement in the enforcement mechanisms. Simultaneously, transparency in giving building permissions must be enhanced and public access to building safety data, a practice common in other cities of the world, made easier. Governments must also desist from protecting unscrupulous owners and builders who violate norms. Ordinances such as the ones passed in Delhi and Chennai, which protect unauthorised constructions including those flouting fire safety norms, must be discouraged. The tragedy at Stephen Court, a 150-year-old heritage structure, reminds us that many such old buildings made of combustible materials and lacking fire exits need urgent retrofitting. Foreseeing this, the NBC has classified heritage buildings as a special category and stipulated separate norms. The old and the new structures must comply with the mandated rules. The duty of the state is to ensure enforcement and compliance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Improve-fire-safety-compliance/article16625605.ece
29,3,2010,What the Moscow blasts mean,"The twin bomb blasts in Moscow's crowded metro that killed 38 people and wounded 65 during the morning rush hours on Monday were a horrible reminder of continuing Islamist violence in Russia's troublesome North Caucasus. Female suicide bombers carried out the strikes — a trademark tactic of Chechen terrorists. One of the extremist websites claimed the attacks were staged by Chechen militants. Since 1999, when Vladimir Putin launched a second military campaign to crush separatism in the overwhelmingly Muslim-majority republic, suicide bombers have killed hundreds of people in attacks in Moscow and other Russian cities. In 2004, one such attack in the Moscow metro claimed 41 lives. After Chechnya was pacified in the mid-2000s, violence spread to the neighbouring North Caucasus regions, where massive poverty, unemployment, and rampant corruption provided fertile ground for extremism. While the Chechnya war was waged for independence from Russia, today's insurgency is a patently jihadist movement. In 2007, Chechnya's self-proclaimed ‘Emir of the Caucasus,' Doku Umarov, proclaimed the goal of liberating all of Russia's Muslim regions. Security experts do not rule out the latest deadly attacks being the terrorists' revenge for recent successful counter-insurgency operations in the North Caucasus, during which several terrorist leaders, including al Qaeda-linked Arab warlord Abu Haled, extremist ideologist Said Buryatsky, and head of the Caucasus Emirate's Sharia Court, Anzor Astemirov, were killed.
President Dmitry Medvedev has vowed to fight terrorism “without hesitation, to the end.” At the same time, the Kremlin has shifted the emphasis away from a security crackdown to promoting economic development, rooting out corruption, and clamping down on economic crime. In January, Mr. Medvedev merged seven Muslim regions in the North Caucasus into a new federal district and appointed one of Russia's most competent administrators, Alexander Khloponin, to be in charge, with the rank of Deputy Prime Minister. Explaining his move, Mr. Medvedev said that the region's problems “lie in economic weakness and the absence of prospects for the people living there” and that these problems should be in the focus of anti-terrorist efforts. India, a major victim of terrorism, condemned the attacks, with External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna expressing solidarity with Russia and underlining that New Delhi “condemned terrorism in all forms and countries.” Ripples from the Moscow metro blasts may extend beyond Russia and provide a moral boost to terrorists round the world. It is therefore imperative that the international community steps up cooperation in the war against terrorism on all fronts.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/What-the-Moscow-blasts-mean/article16627860.ece
29,3,2010,Clean chit for now,"The Financial Stability Report (FSR), released by the Reserve Bank of India last week, is altogether positive. Banks remain broadly healthy; they are well capitalised in line with existing regulatory capital ratios; and they have sustainable financial leverage. In short, the Indian financial system is stable. Maintenance of financial stability has been a key objective of monetary policy. Recent decisions of the government and the RBI have sought to institutionalise what has always been an implicit focus — making financial stability “an integral driver of the policy framework.” The RBI established a Financial Stability Unit in August 2009 and, two months later, revealed that it intended “to enhance transparency and augment confidence in the financial system,” by issuing financial stability reports. These reports would review the nature and magnitude of risks that affect the macroeconomic environment and the markets, and over time they would also aid policymakers proactively to deal with incipient risks in the system. Equally important was the announcement in the Union Budget about the setting up of a monitoring body, the Financial Stability and Development Council. Although its role and composition have yet to be clarified, it is clear that the new body will rely on the RBI and, more specifically, the financial stability reports.
Although the global markets have stabilised after the crisis, there are uncertainties about growth prospects and financial stability. India remains exposed to the impact of global economic shocks. Among the key factors that will affect financial stability are inflationary pressures, delays in fiscal consolidation, and the unsettlingly large capital inflows from abroad. None of these potential threats is likely to go out of control. In the FSR's assessment, banks will be able to withstand whatever stress that arises from credit and market risks. Banks are resilient and, even if one assumes that all restructured standard loans become non-performing assets, the stress would not be disruptive. Households and companies have not borrowed recklessly and, at this juncture, the levels of capital inflows are not such as to exceed the absorptive capacity of the economy. However, there are negative features that need to be watched carefully. The propensity of many corporates to take unhedged foreign exposures is a potential source of risk for the banking sector. Beginning April 1, banks will be paying interest on savings bank deposits on a daily basis, thereby incurring a substantially higher cost than now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Clean-chit-for-now/article16627861.ece
30,3,2010,Right decision,"The Tamil Nadu government did the legally correct and politically wise thing in accepting the recommendation of the Prison Advisory Board against releasing Nalini, a life convict in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case lodged in the Special Prison for Women in Vellore. Nalini played a key role in the monstrous crime that shook the nation on May 21, 1991: alongside the charge of conspiracy, she faced charges on 121 different counts and was physically present at the scene of crime. As Justice D.P. Wadhwa noted in the Supreme Court decision awarding the death penalty to Nalini and three others in the case: “It is not that Nalini did not understand the nature of the crime and her participation. She was a willing party to the crime.” Fortunately for her, the death penalty was commuted to life imprisonment in April 2000 following an open appeal by Congress president Sonia Gandhi. But if a life sentence for a heinous crime is to have any meaning at all, it should be just that: a lifetime in prison. Indeed, one of the arguments of those who want the death penalty to remain on the statute books in India is that the alternative, a life sentence, is decidedly not meant to be incarceration for the remainder of the convict's life. The life convict, in fact, can count on freedom after 14 years and usually earlier. Early release of Nalini would have bolstered the argument of the hanging party, advocates of an extreme, barbaric punishment that no longer exists in most countries.
While there is something commendable about the sense of forgiveness shared by Sonia Gandhi and her daughter Priyanka, who showed personal nobility in visiting Nalini in Vellore, this can have no bearing on the legal issue. Nor is the fact that Nalini is a mother or has acquired educational qualifications in prison relevant to the issue. A relevant question is: has she shown any remorse? “Even now,” the PAB records, “she does not admit her guilt.” Add to this the problem of taking care of the security of Nalini and others who might have to live in close proximity to her in the event of her release and the issue resolves itself from a practical standpoint as well. The principal perpetrators of the assassination are all dead now, but the ends of justice, including proportionality of the punishment, will not be served if Nalini is set free. After all, as Justice Wadhwa held, without her help, the assassination could not have been carried out. Instead of taking up the wrong cause, sympathisers of the no-longer-extant Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam would do well to support humanists in campaigning for the abolition of capital punishment in India — and for getting the three others sentenced to death in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case off death row.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Right-decision/article16634565.ece
30,3,2010,Lawless state,"On March 9, during a visit by U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden, the Israeli government announced approval for the building of 1,600 new settlement homes in occupied East Jerusalem. The timing was highly offensive, as Washington had only just brokered indirect talks between the Palestinians and Israel. The Palestinian leadership is justifiably furious: with its chief negotiator, Saeb Erekat, saying no trust can be built if Israel acts like this, it has pulled out of the planned talks. The Israeli announcement, made without Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's prior knowledge, came from the Interior Minister Eli Yishai, whose ultra-orthodox Shas party is a member of the ruling coalition. As if this were not enough, on March 24 the Jerusalem municipality announced a project under which 20 more apartments would be built in East Jerusalem. The number of Israeli settlers in East Jerusalem has doubled since the 1993 Oslo accords, as it has in the West Bank. No other state has recognised the occupation of either the West Bank or East Jerusalem. In another episode that damaged Israel's standing, the United Kingdom has expelled an Israeli diplomat and member of the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, over his country's use of forged British passports in the operation to murder Hamas official Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai on January 19.
For countries that invariably back Israel, the reactions of the U.S. and the U.K. have been very sharp. Mr. Biden, on President Obama's instructions, has “unequivocally” condemned the building plans while Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called the main plan's announcement an insult. Several British MPs have said Israel is becoming a rogue state. In response, Mr. Netanyahu has been typically truculent, calling Jerusalem his country's capital and telling the Palestinians that their demand for a freeze on all Israeli settlements in the occupied territories was “illogical and unreasonable.” He knows that none of the condemnations will be backed by serious action. Ms Clinton has told the American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) that U.S. support for Israel is “rock solid”; and the British security services will continue collaborating with Mossad. This means Mr. Netanyahu is unlikely to make any attempt to control his coalition partners, and can pander to the most extreme sections of Israeli society. He can also be confident of ensuring in advance the form of a final settlement with the Palestinians. Israel, it seems, can continue insulting its friends and destroying any possibility of a Palestinian state.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Lawless-state/article16634628.ece
31,3,2010,Eleven in a row,"Tamil Nadu saw an unusually high number of by-elections in the four years of the current Legislative Assembly: 11. Some were necessitated by the death of MLAs, some others by the resignation of members consequent on their defection to the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. But what was even more unusual was that all of them were won either by the DMK or by its ally, the Congress. With the latest win in Pennagaram, the DMK seems well on course to meet any challenge in the next Assembly election, which is due by May 2011. Although charges of electoral malpractices and use of money power were traded in all the by-elections, prompting the Election Commission of India to take up a hawkish monitoring of the poll process in some cases, the DMK-led alliance was a clear winner every time. No ‘election malpractice' can explain such a strong, consistent performance. Four years after returning to power in 2006, Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi is riding the crest of a wave of popularity. The victories have not come from any one region: the 11 constituencies are spread across the State, some of them in areas considered to be strongholds of the principal opposition party, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. In Pennagaram, the DMK had an extra reason to rejoice as the Pattali Makkal Katchi, a sub-regional casteist party, finished second, and the AIADMK candidate forfeited his deposit.
Far from being handicapped by any anti-incumbency factor, the DMK government is approaching each election with a list of its achievements. Going beyond distribution of free goods such as colour television sets and cooking gas connections as promised in the DMK election manifesto, the government introduced a health insurance scheme in partnership with a private insurance company, and announced a housing project to replace all huts. Through all this, the State witnessed no increase in power tariffs or bus fares. In a hugely popular move, the price of rice supplied through the Public Distribution System was cut down to just Re. one a kg. Although the State's revenues took a hit during the economic downturn, the welfare schemes and development projects continued in full steam. The shortcomings, if any, were in the delivery of services, not in their pricing. People were ready to forgive erratic power supply and diversion of PDS commodities so long as the prices and tariffs were in check. Whether sustainable or not in the long run, these welfare measures have given the DMK government a new sheen. To retain that over the next several months, with the patriarch at the helm and the succession clearly worked out, should not be too difficult a task.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Eleven-in-a-row/article16654694.ece
31,3,2010,Google in China,"Google's move to redirect visitors from its China website to a new service in Hong Kong, where they can access uncensored search results may be significant more for its long-term commercial impact than for its political overtones. A loss of revenue from China at current levels should not be a cause for worry, given that it is only a small percentage of the whole. Yet the comments made by Google co-founder Sergey Brin after his company decided to stop filtering search results on its China website are important. He described services and information as America's most successful exports, and sought the Obama administration's intervention to ensure that these are allowed to flow without any barriers. In any case, there has been no closure of operations by Google in China. It is also not a market that it is likely to ignore in the future. There is genuine worry, though, that Google's decision to stop filtering search results (required by Chinese law) and to relocate its service to Hong Kong may politicise commercial issues. Clearly, China's importance on the online landscape cannot be exaggerated. As a country with 385 million Internet users, most of them having access to broadband (minimally defined), and the world's biggest mobile phone market with nearly 750 million connections, it offers great value to business. Foreign companies offering online services acknowledge it and have refrained from disengaging from this fast-emerging economy over political issues. Moreover, it is relevant to point out that, although advocates of freedom justifiably demand unfettered access to everything on the Internet, oversight and some level of governmental control is maintained.
As the Internet evolves, governments are challenged to respond to the new information culture without curbing free speech. From a time when relatively few producers generated content for a large number of consumers, the world has come a long way and is now a networked web of people who themselves produce and share content. The explosive growth in the use of mobile devices to create and share text, pictures and videos via the Internet has added a potent dimension to this ongoing revolution. Yet nothing of what is produced is really shielded from scrutiny. It is well known that governments can and do access and monitor the enormous amounts of data that flow through digital pipes including e-mails. Google services are no exception. What governments need to acknowledge is that the mindset of traditional controls on the movement of goods and services across borders is outdated, because information moves across national borders instantaneously.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Google-in-China/article16654693.ece
1,4,2010,Great day for science,"After a few anxious hours of delay following some electrical glitches, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) got off to a glorious start on its research programme at an unprecedented realm of energy towards our understanding of the universe. Around 4.30 pm IST on March 30, the two counter-rotating beams of protons in the 27-km-long underground ringed particle accelerator at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva attained the intended peak energy of 3.5 trillion (tera) electron-Volt (TeV) each and were successfully brought to collide against each other. The LHC suffered a mishap soon after its commissioning in September 2008, so the success must taste the sweeter for the accelerator physicists and engineers who have toiled to get it up and running. It was a great day for particle physicists round the world. This breakthrough has set the stage for a potentially rich harvest of new physics during the LHC's scheduled continuous run for 18-24 months at a record-shattering total available collision energy of 7 TeV, which is 3.5 times the energy reached so far at the Tevatron accelerator at Fermilab, USA. This will do no less than recreate the conditions of the early universe. Although the intensity of the beams during the first collisions was kept at orders of magnitude below the designed value, at its peak value the collision rate will be hundreds of millions of events per second as against 50-100 per second seen in the first run that lasted about three-and-a-half hours. But these hundreds of thousands of collisions recorded on Day One by the six experiments located around the accelerator circumference will keep the scientists busy. They may already harbour new physics to answer some of the questions that physicists are asking.
Is the hypothetical Higgs Boson for real? The Standard Model, an otherwise highly successful theory of matter and forces at lower energies, requires this elusive particle to explain the origin of mass to all matter. Is physics at terascale energies governed by supersymmetry? Are quarks and leptons the fundamental constituents of matter, as it seems at lower energies? Does the universe have curled up higher dimensions beyond the four that we see? Visible matter — the stars and the galaxies — is believed to make up only five per cent of the universe. What constitutes dark matter and dark energy, which account for the rest? The LHC has thus embarked on a new journey of discovery. In realising this, the 50 Indian physicists participating in the experiments have played a significant role. In the months to come, thousands of scientists around the world will be poring over petabytes of data that could reveal completely unexpected physics — beyond the known and the expected.

1,4,2010,Iraq's post-election challenges,"The Iraqi general election has ended in a narrow ‘victory' for the former Prime Minister, Ayad Allawi. His secular-nationalist Iraqiya List alliance has won 91 seats in the 325-member Council of Representatives, two more than incumbent Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's State of Law coalition. The Independent High Electoral Commission has deemed the election to be free and fair and the head of the United Nations Assistance Mission to Iraq, Ed Melkart, has found both the process and the outcome to be “credible.” Overall, on a turnout of 60 per cent, numbering 12 million voters, two other formations have done well and they hold the key to the new government. These are the Kurdish Alliance, Kurdistania, which bagged 43 seats, and the Iraqi National Alliance, the resurgent Shia-majority bloc which took 70 seats, including 38 for the cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's Al-Ahrar Party. Whether Mr. Allawi succeeds in his efforts to put together the 163 seats needed for a majority will depend on how astutely he negotiates with the other leaders and, as importantly, on the fairness of the post-electoral rules.
The initial problems have to do with the conduct of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, whose first response to the result was to demand a recount. A day before the results were announced, he persuaded Iraq's Supreme Court to rule that the government would be formed by the leader of the bloc that has the largest number when parliament convenes, which will probably be in June. In a manoeuvre that smacked of electoral fraud, officials of the Accountability and Justice Commission, who are involved in removing former members of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party from public posts, banned six candidates, including three from Mr. Allawi's party, on the eve of the March 7 election. Iraqiya will appeal the bans in the courts. Mr. Allawi's track record of working for British intelligence and of being cultivated by the U.S. does pose a political problem. Including the Sadrist grouping in government would help reflect the spread of support in the election. The Sadrists campaigned for the early departure of U.S. forces, and have since strengthened their stand in keeping with the desire of the Iraqi people to free themselves from foreign occupation and interference. A national unity government led by the Shia parties, with Mr. Allawi's Iraqia acting as a counterweight to Shia extremism, would be a reasonable outcome. But achieving this will test Mr. Allawi's political skills severely.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Iraqs-post-election-challenges/article16343163.ece
2,4,2010,Making RTE work,"Free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of 14 years was one of the Directive Principles of State Policy intended to be implemented within 10 years of the commencement of the Indian Constitution. Not being justiciable, this directive failed to prod the Indian state into any kind of concrete action. Large sections of two generations grew up, in independent India, with little or no formal education. After 60 years, with the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, the entitlement to education has become enforceable. Although it took a long time coming, the Act is noteworthy on several counts. It offers a framework for ensuring quality education, for creating infrastructure, for making available a sufficient number of trained teachers, and for extending government funding to private schools. The central and State governments are to share the financial burden for implementing the Act in the ratio of 55:45, and the Finance Commission has given Rs.25,000 crore to the States. An outlay of Rs.15,000 crore was approved for 2010-11 by the central government, but if the Act is to achieve its stated objectives of ensuring a fixed student-teacher ratio, neighbourhood schools of specified quality for every child, and training for teachers to a national norm, the funding seems grossly inadequate. The National University for Educational Planning and Administration calculates that implementation of the Act will cost Rs. 171,000 crore for five years. It will be a great shame if the governments of rising India fail to come up with what it takes to educate all children decently at the foundational level.
But it won't be enough to approach free and compulsory education up to the age of 14 as an entitlement, especially for the millions of children who are left out in the cold. Accessing this right meaningfully and in full measure will require, aside from the investment of huge resources, financial and human, a lot of work to be done on the ground. Key to this is seeing free and compulsory education for children not just as a right — but as a duty. It is the duty of the state, parents and guardians, and the community to ensure that all children of school-going age are in school. A substantial proportion of India's poor children are engaged in agricultural labour or petty trades, housework, and sibling care. Ending the morally and socially abhorrent practice of child labour, not ‘regulating' it, must be taken up as a non-negotiable objective. But history teaches us that child labour will not go away, and free and compulsory education will remain a half-empty and formal right, if we do not hold governments to strict account for failing to perform their duty by the children of India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Making-RTE-work/article16357260.ece
2,4,2010,Trade rebounds,"The World Trade Organisation foresees a sharp recovery in global trade in 2010. The projected 9.5 per cent growth, apart from being impressive by itself, will also represent a sharp rebound from 2009, when world trade contracted as never before in seven decades. Exports from developed countries are forecast to rise by 7.5 per cent. Shipments from the rest of the world will grow by around 11 per cent. The pattern of recovery in international trade is in line with the growth prognosis for the global economy as seen by the International Monetary Fund and other major global institutions, which believe that developing countries led by China and India will post higher growth rates than the developed countries. The strong expansion in trade during the current year will help recover some, but by no means all, of the ground lost in 2009. It would take another year of similar expansion to surpass the peak trade volumes of 2008. Practically all forecasters had underestimated the extent of trade decline during the crisis period. The WTO's estimate of 10 per cent fell short of the actual figure by more than two percentage points.
The sharp decline in trade volumes is attributed to the abrupt fall in global demand. The financial crisis contributed to the lower demand in at least two ways. In the rich countries the home mortgage crisis weakened considerably the spending power of households, and in general, consumers tended to postpone their buying decisions. The complete drying up of trade finance was another factor. It is also true that trade statistics were exaggerated in the first place. The complex supply chains used by producers resulted in the movement of goods across several national boundaries before reaching their destination. This caused double counting. Also, some articles, notably consumer durables have a disproportionately large share in global trade compared to their share in global output. So as people stayed away from discretionary goods, the decline in trade was steeper than that of global output. The WTO says the multilateral system of trade has proved its value, assisting governments in keeping markets open during difficult times. According to an official study prepared for the WTO and two other organisations, the feared surge in protectionism has not occurred even in the recovery phase. Yet there are many critics who say that more subtle forms of protectionism are now practised. The inability to complete the Doha round shows the rich countries are not really committed to free trade.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Trade-rebounds/article16357259.ece
4,4,2010,Sound democratic reforms,"Pakistan's elected politicians have risen admirably above their zero-sum approach to forge a cross-party consensus on a set of constitutional reforms that hold the promise of strengthening democratic governance. The centrepiece of these reforms, known collectively as the 18th amendment, is the transfer of executive powers from the President to the Prime Minister. It will bring the system closer to the parliamentary democracy envisioned in the original 1973 Constitution before General Zia-ul-Haq and General Pervez Musharraf introduced distortions to reinforce their presidencies. In proposing the repeal of the Musharraf-era 17th Amendment, the reforms tabled in the National Assembly last week seek to strip the President of the powers to dissolve Parliament and appoint the three service chiefs and governors, thus rendering his role ceremonial. It was thought that President Asif Ali Zardari would never agree to the reforms. He can now justifiably take credit for keeping a longstanding PPP promise. For going through with a process that affects its leadership directly, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) is likely to regain some of its lost shine. The opposition Pakistan Muslim League(N) can take credit for keeping up political pressure on the PPP towards this end. Although the party's last-minute disagreements with some aspects of the package delayed the tabling by a week, the PML(N) leader, Nawaz Sharif, should be happy as it does away with a two-term bar on the prime ministership. The Pakistan Army, which has an uneasy relationship with Mr. Zardari, must be pleased too.
In the longer term, the proposed changes will make it difficult for an Army chief to manipulate the presidency and get an elected government dismissed. But it can also be argued that this leaves a politically ambitious general with no option other than the martial law, although under the proposed changes, “suspension” of the Constitution will count as high treason along with subversion. Anyhow, the Pakistan Army is not expected to become less powerful unless elected politicians can prise away from it the right to frame policy on crucial issues such as national security and foreign policy. The main question now is if President Zardari can capitalise on the political goodwill earned for giving up his powers and survive his ongoing battle with the judiciary. The Pakistan Supreme Court's insistence that the government ask Swiss authorities to reopen money laundering cases against Mr. Zardari (closed in 2007 under the now-annulled National Reconciliation Ordinance) is a move to force an interpretation on presidential immunity against prosecution. It is unfortunate that Pakistan's political instability never seems to abate.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Sound-democratic-reforms/article16363971.ece
4,4,2010,For love of water,"The United Nations reminded all countries on March 22, World Water Day, that humanity continues to impose a staggering burden on rivers, lakes, and deltas each year in the form of pollution. What the UN has highlighted in its report titled “Sick Water?” should stir the conscience of people everywhere. Pollutants dumped in key water sources annually are estimated to weigh as much as the global population — close to seven billion people. This disturbing truth should encourage everyone starting with national governments to do more to protect the broth of life. The first step is to plug the sources of the millions of tonnes of sewage and industrial and agricultural waste that are pumped perennially into waterways and other freshwater reserves. Action taken to improve water quality pays rich dividends — the UN Environment Programme and Habitat estimate the return to be anything between $3 and $34 for every dollar spent, depending upon the region and technology employed. Such investments are particularly important for India.
India's response to pollution has been atrociously slow. In 2008, the country had the capacity to treat only about 18 per cent of the sewage produced in cities and towns; and the increments since thenhave been insignificant. The rest of the sewage flows into waterways and lakes, contaminating groundwater and spreading disease. The Lok Sabha recently heard from Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh that in the nation's capital, a vast volume of untreated sewage was flowing into the Yamuna every day. This goes on merrily at a time some idle capacity is available in Delhi's treatment plants. The problem is linked to the national issue of insufficient housing, sanitation, and sewerage. The most infamous example of India's failed attempts at river cleansing is that of the Ganga, which has over the millennia been revered as a holy river. It is listed by the UN as severely polluted, with its basin receiving billions of litres of wastewater every year. Clearly, governments are abdicating their responsibility towards citizens by allowing the poisoning of meagre and dwindling freshwater. Some are keen to set up expensive desalination plants, without making a parallel effort to protect surface and groundwater, and recover wastewater. The way forward is to enforce the well-recognised ‘polluter pays' principle. Industry and municipal authorities should lead the clean up. When will rising India realise it must go all out to ensure clean water for its people?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/For-love-of-water/article16363970.ece
5,4,2010,Sexual abuse & Catholic Church,"That the Roman Catholic Church has been delinquent in handling widespread sexual abuse of members of its flock by some or several of its priests has become evident as it faces a new wave of paedophiliac scandals. An institution so deeply bound with the life of societies in many parts of the world suddenly faces the prospect of eroding credibility and moral authority, leaving many ordinary Catholics demoralised and confused. This has the makings of a crisis of historic proportions for the Church. No more can it afford to be in denial of what the Pope unhappily termed “the petty gossip of dominant opinion” — as the scandals overwhelm it in much of its heartland in Europe, besides the United States where 11,750 allegations of child abuse have so far featured in actions settled by individual archdioceses. Predominantly Catholic Ireland has been rocked by three judicial reports in the past five years detailing child sex abuse and cover-ups going as far back as the 1930s. The finding of Judge Murphy's Commission in Ireland was not merely that sexual abuse was “endemic” in boys' institutions but also that the Church hierarchy protected the perpetrators. Shockingly, despite knowledge of their propensity to reoffend, these paedophiles in priestly garb were allowed to take up new positions involving children after the victims were sworn to secrecy.
A key focus for those seeking Church reform is priestly celibacy, a tradition dating to Christianity's early days but made mandatory only in the 11th century. The debate over whether the rule should go has come into sharper relief than ever before. As Archbishop Robert Zollitsch, leader of Germany's Roman Catholic bishops, said in a message to mark Good Friday, the Church may be in dire need of “a new departure.” Transparency should be a guiding principle for that process. The Church must acknowledge and make amends for even decades-old cases. While Pope Benedict XVI has continually spoken out and apologised for the “heinous crimes” — he also met victims in the U.S. and in Australia — he himself has come under pressure. This followed allegations published in The New York Times that, as Archbishop of Munich and later as the chief enforcer for 24 years (until 2005) of Catholic doctrine and morals and head of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, Joseph Ratzinger might well have failed to act against offending priests. It seems unlikely that the Holy See will now be able to overlook international law, which counts egregious sexual abuse of children as a crime against humanity. To treat the assaults as “sins” subject only to action by religious bodies looks increasingly indefensible.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Sexual-abuse-amp-Catholic-Church/article16364199.ece
5,4,2010,Equitable urban future,"The news on the conditions of people in the world’s slums is mixed: there has been tangible improvement but it is not enough, and the mass of the slum population is growing. Since 2000, the lives of about 227 million living in slum conditions have improved and the Millennium Development target for shelter has been surpassed by 2.2 times. The State of World Cities 2010/2011 published by UN-HABITAT highlights this. The report also reminds us that the issue of adequate housing has not been solved. Rapid urbanisation has helped reduce urban poverty levels and improved access to services, but it has also made it difficult for the poor to find affordable housing. Every year, the global slum population swells by six million. The progress on slum improvement has been inadequate and the report exhorts governments to take urgent steps to ensure an equitable urban future. A `dignified and secure existence’, which is a part of the right to an adequate standard of living, is a core value enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). It will not be an exaggeration to say that, in the case of the poor in cities, this is inextricably linked with the peaceful future of city life.
What does this report hold for India? The country has been commended for the improvements made to the slums. Since 2000, about 59.7 million people have been lifted out of their slum conditions. However, the optimism generated by these figures fades before the worsening shortage in the supply of affordable housing. The 11th Five Year Plan estimates that the housing shortage for the poor, which was 24 million at the beginning of 2007, will increase to 26 million by 2012. Unless this huge gap is addressed, the report cautions, polarities within Indian cities will exacerbate. Investment and provision of land for affordable housing need to be scaled up. For example, if all the public money earmarked for this sector including the allocations made in the current budget is put together, the total amount would still fall short of the annual investment of about Rs.71,000 crore required for bridging the housing deficit. The state alone cannot be expected to bear the burden. Through a combination of regulations and incentives, the private sector must be persuaded to commit itself to social housing. Existing polices must be radically revised and imaginative financial incentives, such as the Low Income Housing Tax Credit successfully implemented in the United States, need to be put in place. A lot can be achieved if individual cities take the lead without waiting for central or State government directives and devise their own progressive housing plans.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Equitable-urban-future/article16364198.ece
6,4,2010,Severe setback,"The euphoria over the passage of the historic Women's Reservation Bill in the Rajya Sabha has rapidly dimmed, with the second hurdle proving too much for its champions. It is now highly unlikely that the Lok Sabha will adopt this progressive piece of legislation in the second half of the Budget session. Not unexpectedly, a bitterly divided all-party meeting saw traditional antagonists such as the Samajwadi Party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, and the Janata Dal (United) holding firm to their stand that a separate quota for backward class women must be worked into the Bill. And with the Trinamool Congress demanding subquotas for Muslim women and the Bahujan Samaj Party seeking the same for Dalits, the group ranged against the Bill in its present form has grown much larger. Added to this is the Bharatiya Janata Party's growing ambivalence on the measure, which many of its MPs are known to be against. While it is perfectly all right to ask for a full debate on a game-changing legislative measure, the party's opposition to the use of marshalls to evict obscurantist MPs would effectively make it impossible to get the Bill past the Lok Sabha. It must not be forgotten that the 14-year-old parliamentary journey of the Bill has been marked by scuffles, the snatching of papers, verbal abuse, and worse.
The fact is that intense passions have been generated over a reform that everyone supports ‘in principle,' where the devil is supposed to be in the detail. Large numbers of male MPs and MLAs cutting across parties are not reconciled to women winning 33 per cent of seats, by rotation, in the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies. While the United Progressive Alliance chairperson and Congress President Sonia Gandhi must be commended for her initiative, in the face of opposition within her own party and alliance, in getting the Bill past the Rajya Sabha, the party's course is shaped by the immediate imperatives of the UPA government — to get the Finance Bill approved and then try and negotiate the passage of the deeply flawed civil nuclear liability Bill. With the RJD and the SP withdrawing support over the Women's Reservation Bill, the Congress-led government would be averse to risk straining the relationship with its ally, the Trinamool Congress, or its supporter, the BSP, over this issue. The fate of the Bill now seems threatened by two powerful factors — the exigencies of government survival and entrenched opposition from male legislators who constitute over 90 per cent of the Lok Sabha. Whether the Congress leadership is prepared to risk early introduction of the Bill in the Lok Sabha under the present circumstances will be closely watched.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Severe-setback/article16364450.ece
6,4,2010,Exchange rates in a globalised world,"The global financial crisis might have abated but certain factors that were responsible for it remain just as potent and need to be tackled. In a recent policy brief, the UNCTAD has said that global imbalances — the phenomenon of current account surpluses from a few, mostly Asian countries, bridging the large deficits of the United States and other rich countries — continue to be a major cause for worry. One facet of the problem is reflected in the controversy surrounding the exchange rate policy of China, the country with the largest surplus. Its critics say that, by deliberately keeping the renminbi undervalued in relation to the dollar, China has boosted its exports, augmenting its reserves to record levels. According to this view, the Chinese currency must be allowed to float so that the play of market forces will cause its exports to shrink and stimulate domestic consumption, the two critical steps to restoring the balance with debtor countries. The UNCTAD finds both the diagnosis and the prescription too simplistic. It is unreasonable to put the onus of rebalancing the global economy on a single country and its currency. The real problem has to do with systemic failures, which require comprehensive and inclusive multilateral action.
Recent experiences suggest that neither a fully fixed exchange rate system nor a freely floating one can be the optimal solution to the volatility and uncertainty caused by the global imbalance. Multilateralism of the type seen during the height of the crisis in 2008 should guide a new, coherent approach to restoring the balance between trade and non-speculative financial flows. Like the World Trade Organisation that has contributed remarkably to an orderly trade, a new global regulatory body for the monetary system can help substantially in minimising exchange rate misalignments and preventing external shocks, the two major factors associated with global imbalance. Individual countries should have the policy space to deal with surging capital flows when the collateral damage becomes unbearable. The UNCTAD has proposed a “constant real exchange rate” rule that will guide exchange rate policies of countries. Basically, the objective is to ensure that the nominal exchange rates followed the interest rate differentials between two currencies. However, neither the monitoring of the constant exchange rate nor indeed the creation of a WTO-type body for the monetary system is going to be easy. However, the UNCTAD's suggestions are worth pursuing over the medium term.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Exchange-rates-in-a-globalised-world/article16364448.ece
7,4,2010,Behind the horrific massacre,"Fester Lente — “make haste, but slowly” — was the motto guiding the Roman Emperor Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus as his forces fought the wars that guaranteed the Mediterranean world two centuries of peace. Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram's advisors need to whisper those words in his ear. Tuesday's horrific annihilation of an entire company of the Central Reserve Police Force by insurgents in Chhattisgarh was wholly avoidable. It was not just one of those inevitable tragedies that scar the road to ultimate victory. It has demonstrated that the architecture of the government's counter-Maoist campaign is fundamentally flawed. Mr. Chidambaram's dramatic pursuit of success and his high-sounding polemical attacks on the Maoists have endeared him to Indians frustrated by years of inaction against terrorism. However, a poorly thought-through counter-insurgency campaign has ended up jeopardising the lives of men who are being pushed into a battle they are ill-trained and ill-equipped for. For the most part, the new forces arriving inside the forest heartlands of the Maoists have been doing little other than protecting their own logistical lines and camp perimeters. Tuesday's massacre, and the killings in West Bengal and Orissa that preceded it, have shown that the surge isn't displacing the insurgents: it's creating targets for them to attack.
Last year, counter-insurgency strategists in the Union Home Ministry began deploying central forces in a ‘clear, hold, and build' strategy. The theory was that the forces would displace the insurgents and thus pave the way for a civilian development programme. It hasn't worked. In successful counter-insurgency campaigns, the number of enemy combatants killed by state forces far exceeds their own losses. In Jammu and Kashmir, for example, Indian forces killed 3.1 jihadists for each fatality of their own last year. But in the counter-Maoist campaign, data published by the New Delhi-based Institute for Conflict Management's show, police forces have suffered far more fatalities this year than they have been able to inflict. Last year, too, 312 police officers were killed compared with 294 Maoists. It is clear that a thoroughgoing training programme is needed for both central and state forces. Police in J&K, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, and Tripura learned those skills in battle, sustaining horrific casualties in the process. The waste of human life can be avoided — but it will take time. Even as they build counter-insurgency capabilities, the central and State governments would do well to content themselves with a more modest, workable containment strategies. As the scholar Ivan Arreguín-Toft has shown in his thoughtful work on asymmetric wars, the strong do sometimes lose — in the main when their responses to their adversaries' strategies are flawed. India ought not to be losing the war against the Maoists. It will, inevitably, continue to do so as long as grandstanding substitutes for capacity-building and strategic thinking.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Behind-the-horrific-massacre/article15715681.ece
7,4,2010,What ICC move on Kenya means,"The International Criminal Court's move to go into the 2007-08 post-poll violence in the Republic of Kenya, after a pre-trial Chamber decided that the incidents are indeed crimes against humanity, is a unique attempt to try offenders who systematically undermine democratic institutions. There have been recurrent controversies about the quality of elections and the verdict, warranting the deployment of international monitors and observers to oversee the process. There have also been inordinate delays in determining the verdict and in forming new governments. Not surprisingly, this has led to a growing demand for international adjudication of such disputes, especially in countries where the writ of dictators, warlords or tribal chieftains runs. In Kenya, bloody ethnic clashes broke out in the wake of the 2007 elections, leaving more than 1,000 people dead. On the indefensible failure of the ruling coalition to set up a tribunal, the Chamber at The Hague Court concluded that the ICC must step in and investigate. The ICC's mandate is to bring to justice individuals rather than groups or governments for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Accordingly, its Prosecutor has identified 20 persons from among senior politicians and the police as being mainly responsible for rape, murder, and such other heinous crimes.
What applies to Kenya must apply to other countries as well. The refusal of the United States and India, in particular, to be bound by the jurisdiction of the ICC, which was established under the Rome Statute, takes away from its legitimacy and moral authority. A timely review of their negative stance could contribute to the evolution of a more effective multilateral order based on the rule of law. Political stability underpinned by respect for human rights and transparent governance is a vital prerequisite if countries such as Kenya are to capitalise on their rich natural resource base to lift millions of people out of chronic hunger, poverty, and disease. Else, the African continent's claim on the 21st century as its own will seem yet another cynical slogan mocking at the plight of ordinary citizens. Justice deserves a chance; but its prospects, particularly against the backdrop of the most appalling anti-people crimes, must not be left to chance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/What-ICC-move-on-Kenya-means/article16364737.ece
9,4,2010,A decisive mandate in Sri Lanka,"The results of post-conflict Sri Lanka's first parliamentary elections are on expected lines. President Mahinda Rajapaksa's ruling United Progressive Freedom Alliance, led by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, has scored a decisive victory on the strength of a vote share that may exceed 60 per cent. After President Rajapaksa's big victory in the January 26 presidential election, there was never really any doubt about the outcome of Thursday's general election. Perhaps this was one reason for the low turnout of voters. This is way and ahead the best performance by a political party or coalition in a general election since 1977. Indeed, a two-thirds majority in the 225-seat House, always a difficult target in a system of proportional representation, seems to be within the UPFA's grasp, assuming there will be a repeat of the defections that followed the 2004 elections. The United National Party, which has won only one parliamentary election in two decades, can take some comfort from the fact that its vote-base has not eroded significantly in this period. But the kingmaker of elections past, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, has suffered a rout, its opportunistic decision to back former Sri Lanka army commander, Sarath Fonseka, who is under detention and facing court martial proceedings, doing nothing to shore up its fortunes. The third force, the Democratic National Alliance, has failed to take off.
With his political stock enormously boosted, President Rajapaksa must turn his attention to the urgent task of reconciliation with Sri Lanka's Tamil minority and the development of the North and the East. The poor voter turnout in Jaffna was a reminder of Sri Lanka's persisting ethnic polarisation. In an interview to this newspaper after his re-election, President Rajapaksa agreed that the 13th Amendment was “implementable” in Northern Sri Lanka with some provisos. Under his leadership, the government must quickly articulate a set of comprehensive political reforms that will devolve power to the Tamils in a genuine and far-going way. It would be ideal if the UPFA, secure in its majority, could co-opt the UNP and especially its leader Ranil Wickremesinghe in this historic project. It is one of the tragedies of the Tamil community that its leadership, even in a post-LTTE world, remains confused between the politically achievable and the impossible. Unable to shake off the extremist politics and expectations of vocal sections of the Tamil diaspora, the Tamil National Alliance, which has fared well in the Northern Province, has not shown itself to be capable of rising to the challenge. What Sri Lanka's Tamils badly need is a responsible democratic leadership that can engage meaningfully with the Sinhala majority to resolve all aspects of the Tamil question on the basis of equality and devolution of power within a united Sri Lanka.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-decisive-mandate-in-Sri-Lanka/article16365236.ece
9,4,2010,A new human species,"Nearly 10 years after the genome of a living individual was first sequenced, and shortly after the sequencing of the genome of a 4,000-year-old male Eskimo, scientists have successfully sequenced the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome of a nearly 40,000-year-old hominin. The study, published recently in Nature, was based on mtDNA extracted from a small piece of bone of a little finger; the bone was found in the Denisova cave in the Altai Mountains in southern Siberia. Mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down the maternal line, is better conserved than nuclear DNA. The mtDNA data indicate that the hominin is probably a new human species that became extinct. The differences in nucleotide positions between the Denisova individual and the modern human are nearly double those between Neanderthals and modern humans. However, nuclear DNA genome data need to corroborate mtDNA findings for the hominin to be called a new human species, and to establish the relationship of the hominin with modern humans and Neanderthals. The same team is now working to sequence the nuclear DNA. The mtDNA data provide some fascinating information: the Denisova hominin, Neanderthals, and modern humans apparently shared a common ancestor about one million years ago; and the divergence of the Denisova hominin is about twice as old as the divergence between the Neanderthal and modern human.
The earlier notion that Neanderthals were our ancestors was overturned when it became clear they lived alongside us. The latest study shows that modern humans and Neanderthals probably lived alongside the Denisova individual, who lived about 30,000 to 50,000 years ago. A 2003 study revealed that we coexisted with another human species, Homo floresiensis, about 15,000 years ago; skeletal remains of H. floresiensis were found on an island in Flores, Indonesia. Independent of the species confirmation, the hominin discovery provides deeper insight into human evolution and suggests that the number of mass migrations of homo species out of Africa was not three, as previously thought, but more. In the case of H. floresiensis, excellent skeletal remains allowed morphological classification but comparable remains have not so far been found in the Altai. However, DNA can be teased out of the small pieces of bones found there as the cold climate favours long-term preservation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-new-human-species/article16365234.ece
12,4,2010,Empowering patients,"Reform of the healthcare system is a major priority for governments virtually everywhere. The approval given by the Union Cabinet for the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Bill, 2010, comes at the appropriate moment. Several expert committees have pointed out the parlous state of healthcare in India, which results in impoverishing expenditures for millions of households. Shockingly, only 10 per cent of Indians are estimated to have any form of financial cover for health. Moreover, about 70 per cent of health spending, as estimated by the 60th round of the National Sample Survey, is out-of-pocket. While the important questions of equity and access need to be addressed with higher spending, a key measure that can bring about change in the provision of care is the recognition of the patient's rights. The rights of patients are recognised by the World Health Organisation as a part of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the state and the physician are both obliged to respect them. What will make these rights actionable is a regulatory framework that is genuinely empowering. Any new law must contain unambiguous provisions for patients to be informed, in a standardised, written format. That would include the treatment choice for their condition, the risks and costs involved, as well as the alternatives. In the case of medical procedures, the experience of the doctor and the outcomes at the hospital should also be documented for the patient's benefit.
The informative model of patient rights, widely adopted in the developed world, can be readily applied in all settings where the care sought is elective. In emergencies, a system where the doctor unilaterally makes a choice in the best interests of the patient, who is unable to participate, would seem appropriate. The importance of a statute that empowers patients cannot be overemphasised, against the background of rising, out-of-pocket costs. The emphasis on costly health insurance plans operated by for-profit companies to cover catastrophic expenditure necessarily requires that patients are made part of the equation when costs are determined. They have no scope to participate now because hospitals and insurance administrators decide, through an opaque system, the treatment protocol and expenditure. Obviously, in such a system, informed consent by the patient is ruled out. Potentially, patients can benefit if the accreditation process launched by the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers goes about its task sincerely. The ability to assert the patient's rights will, however, depend on total transparency in public and private healthcare institutions, rigorous benchmarking of treatment, cost control, and good regulatory oversight.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Empowering-patients/article16365676.ece
12,4,2010,Better deal for bank depositors,"The Reserve Bank of India's directive to scheduled commercial banks to pay interest on the daily balances in savings bank accounts is significant for banks as well as their depositors. The new method, which came into effect on April 1, 2010, has replaced the age-old practice of banks computing interest on the minimum balance in individual savings bank accounts between the 10th and the last working day of a month. The savings bank deposit rate, which is set at 3.5 per cent, is one of the few administered interest rates remaining in the Indian financial sector. Unlike in the case of fixed deposits where banks have the freedom to vary the rates depending on the tenure or the deposit amount, the savings deposit rate specified by the RBI has to be applied uniformly. The obligation to compute interest on the daily balances means the banks will bear a higher burden. Its magnitude will depend on various factors such as the mix of savings bank accounts. For instance, the burden will normally be much more for banks that have a higher proportion of accounts of salary earners. In the past, the ‘peak' balances after salary credits during the beginning of the month did not count. Typically, a salary earner would have drawn down his account balance by the 10th of the month. On the other hand, banks may not have to pay more on accounts whose balances do not change frequently during the month.
The average level of demand deposits, comprising current and savings account balances, has remained around 33 per cent of all deposits, with savings deposits alone accounting for 22 per cent. With the promise of interest on daily balances, account-holders might be less tempted to invest in fixed deposits unless the interest differential is high.Without computerisation, banks would have found it very difficult to switch over to the new system of calculating interest on daily balances in the savings deposit accounts. Further technology application will blur the distinction between the demand and time deposits. Already, many banks are offering hybrid accounts combining the liquidity of a savings account with the higher yield of fixed deposits. That is made possible by automatically transferring balances above a certain minimum level to a term deposit account. It would have been unthinkable for a bank to take on such tasks in the pre-computerisation era. Even as savings bank depositors gain by earning an effective interest rate that matches the promised rate, banks will seek ways of reducing transaction costs by leveraging technology.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Better-deal-for-bank-depositors/article16365675.ece
14,4,2010,Protect archaeology,"The ongoing excavation of the 2300-year old Avenue of Sphinxes in Luxor, Egypt is an instructive example of what can go wrong when short-term tourism interests set the agenda for archaeology. Since the 5th century CE, the 2.7 km-long processional route connecting the two ancient temples in Luxor fell into disuse. It was later buried under the silt and today most parts of this route run beneath the thickly populated old city. Since the ‘Pharonic heritage' is a major attraction for the international tourist circuit and brings in a lot of revenue, Egyptian authorities have gone all out to exploit it, unmindful of the consequences. Sound archaeological principles have been sacrificed. Bulldozers tore down many later-period — but no less valuable — heritage structures and razed the old bazaar, displacing hundreds of people. As the larger plans reveal, the emphasis is on building more five-star hotels, IMAX-theatres, golf courses, and a monorail to take tourists to various historical sites. The vibrant old city of Luxor, one of the wonders of the ancient world, is at risk of being converted into a stage-managed theme park catering to a floating population of tourists.
India has its own share of misplaced projects such as the attempted eviction of vendors from the bazaar near the Virupaksha temple in Hampi. Equally worrisome are ill-conceived ventures such as the proposed theme parks in Hampi or the demolition of modern buildings in Jaipur city to put up structures that look like old ones. Archaeology is a serious scientific pursuit and cannot be treated as Lego blocks to build a make-believe Disney world. It may have social obligations to meet, but that is no excuse to compel it to serve casual visitors or compromise its research agenda. When historical sites are purged of the related associations, isolated from the immediate context, and alienated from the local communities, their archaeological future is likely to be jeopardised. It is a disservice to the serious tourist who travels in order to perceive the difference and looks forward to an enriching cultural experience. Policymakers must heed the call of the World Tourism Organisation, a specialised agency of the United Nations, to pay more attention to the social and cultural dimensions of tourism. There is no dearth of tools to evaluate the impact, measure the capacity of the local community to bear it, and find the ‘limits for acceptable change.' What is required is a commitment to an integrated approach that abides by the rules, disciplines, and norms of an exciting field of knowledge, accommodates the needs of the people around the heritage sites, and harvests the economic benefits of tourism responsibly.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Protect-archaeology/article16366164.ece
14,4,2010,Landmark judgment,"Who owns your genes? Among others, medical diagnostics companies, which — in certain cases, along with universities — exercise tight control over them. Nearly 20 per cent of the human genome is already patented. But in a recent landmark judgment, Robert Sweet, a senior U.S. federal judge who serves on the United States District for the Southern District of New York, invalidated seven of the 23 patents on two genes — BRCA1 and BRCA2. In 2008, the Myriad Genetics won a protracted battle to retain some European patents on BRCA1; the scope of the patents was reduced to cover only certain mutations. The two genes are commonly tested for mutations to determine the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. The Utah-based Myriad Genetics and the University of Utah Research Foundation hold the patents. Though patents cannot be granted to ‘products of nature,' thousands of genes have been patented on the ground that isolated and purified genes are distinctly different in character and composition from those present in our body. Significantly, the invalidation of Myriad's patents has come on the basis of the very arguments the company's counterparts had put forth earlier in defence of gene patents. What is laudable is Judge Sweet's brilliant assessment of scientific facts to invalidate every claim of the company. For instance, he refused to accept that isolated and purified genes are structurally and compositionally different from those occurring in the body. The verdict also summarily rejects as “erroneous” the premise that isolated DNA molecules are like any other chemical compound.
Judge Sweet's ruling will have great implications if it is upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The district court's decision will not be binding on other federal courts, and the decision will not automatically extend to all U.S. gene patents. Yet there is a real possibility of more pleas coming up before courts for invalidating many gene patents . Exclusive licences, with some exceptions, are a great barrier to fostering research. There is no incentive to make diagnostic tests cheaper either; Myriad charges about $3,000 to sequence the two genes to look for cancer-causing mutations. The fact that 10-15 per cent of all inheritable breast and ovarian cancers have a mutation in these two genes, and about 5,000 new cases of both cancers are detected every year in the European Union makes a strong case against exclusive licences.

15,4,2010,Continuing recalcitrance,"The painfully protracted saga of P.D. Dinakaran is becoming more embarrassing by the day with the Karnataka Chief Justice's brazen and continuing defiance of judicial propriety. His refusal to go on leave, as recently advised by the Supreme Court collegium, has exposed the powerlessness of this body, headed by the Chief Justice of India, and further dented the image of the higher judiciary. It was in the face of such recalcitrance that the ill-considered proposal to transfer him as Chief Justice of the Sikkim High Court was mooted. While the collegium evidently saw a transfer to what is the smallest High Court in the country as a form of punishment, it failed to ask the obvious question: if Justice Dinakaran, who faces charges of corruption and land-grab, is unfit for Karnataka, how can he be suitable for Sikkim or, for that matter, any other State? This is exactly what the Sikkim Bar Association was asking during its protests, which eventually torpedoed the transfer proposal. Rather than resign in the face of a total lack of public confidence in his reputation, Justice Dinakaran has decided to brazen it out. At one level, his refusal to go on leave exposes the limitations of the collegium. While this panel has the power to recommend the appointment, transfer, and elevation of judges, it does not have the authority to compel a judge to proceed on leave. This lacuna draws attention to the urgent need for a quick and effective statutory mechanism to remove errant judges, now governed by the cumbersome and time-consuming process of impeachment.
The impeachment process is so unwieldy that judges could be tempted to remain in office and ride it out. This is exactly what Justice Soumitra Sen of the Calcutta High Court is doing. It was two years ago that impeachment proceedings were kick-started against him on the recommendation of the Chief Justice of India following allegations of financial misappropriation, but the matter is still at the inquiry stage. Impeachment proceedings have also been initiated against Justice Dinakaran but it is far from certain when or whether the various steps required under the Judges Inquiry Act, 1968 will be taken before the matter comes up finally for vote in Parliament. In the only instance when an impeachment motion against a judge was voted upon by Parliament — in 1993, when Justice V. Ramaswami was in the dock — it was defeated. Justice Dinakaran's continuing defiance underlines the importance of seriously pursuing the proposed Judges Standards and Accountability Bill, which promises to strengthen judicial accountability by introducing a more efficient mechanism to govern the removal of errant judges.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Continuing-recalcitrance/article16366452.ece
15,4,2010,Turmoil in Thailand,"It is unlikely that the government of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva in Thailand will last much longer. Over the last few weeks, it has been the target of protesters who have poured into Bangkok from the rural hinterland. Grouped under the banner of United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship, the protesters owe allegiance to Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted from the premiership in a military coup in 2006. The demonstrations, which had been peaceful from the time they began in mid-March, turned violent last Saturday, resulting in the death of 21 people in clashes between the protesters and the security forces. The government's heavy-handed approach to dealing with the “red shirt” protesters has led to the deepening of the turmoil. Apprehensive of getting tainted by the crisis, the Thai Army, which manoeuvred Mr. Abhisit into office through deft backroom moves at the end of December 2008, has suggested dissolution of the government. This more or less seals the Prime Minister's fate. The sole option left to him is to call fresh elections. Should he try and dig his heels in, there is every possibility of a military coup to remove him. To add to his troubles, the country's election commission has ruled that his Democrat Party received illegal donations during the 2005 elections.
There is no guarantee, however, that elections will restore political stability in Thailand. The present struggle between the Red Shirts and the government is a battle for establishing the real centre of power in the Southeast Asian nation. So far, a combination of the military-backed urban and business elites has called the shots in politics and governance. Rural Thailand now wants a say in how the country is run. The reason it backs the fugitive Mr. Thaksin, an enormously wealthy businessman charged and convicted of corruption after his ouster, is that during his time in office, he assiduously built a base in this constituency with generous welfare schemes aimed at the rural poor. Should the pro-Thaksin forces seize power, the pro-establishment camp will go all out to wrest it back and the political situation will continue to be volatile. The Thai crisis is a copybook study of benighted civilian-military relations in a country where democracy is yet to take strong roots. Since 1932, when the last absolute monarch was overthrown, Thailand has experienced 18 military coups. Even after the 1992 transition to democracy from military rule, the Thai Army has remained a strong political force. Since the 2006 putsch, it has played a “guiding” role in politics. In Thailand, as in Pakistan, the failures of civilian politicians give the military all the advantage.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Turmoil-in-Thailand/article16366451.ece
16,4,2010,Murky IPL games,"The Indian Premier League is an ingeniously conceived and spectacularly executed show. It features genuine sporting skills along with elements of the burlesque. Now into its third edition, it has acquired not just a mass following but also new cohorts of fans among those who did not know they would love cricket lite. But success has brought a stiff price: serious questions about the league's integrity and internal governance. As controversies engulf the IPL's Kochi franchise, acts of impropriety and wrongdoing are becoming evident at more than one level by more than one party. Suave Minister of State for External Affairs Shashi Tharoor is Casualty No. 1 — for his so-called mentoring of the Kerala franchise. It is now established that with the stated aim of giving young people in Kerala, his home-State, a cricket team to cheer for, Mr. Tharoor sought to use the power and influence arising out of his public office improperly — in the interests of a business consortium that won the bid, Rendezvous Sports World. Although Mr. Tharoor is not a shareholder in Rendezvous, his close friend Sunanda Pushkar was given substantial 'sweat equity' in the consortium for no immediately apparent reason. Mr. Tharoor's undue interest in helping a commercial enterprise exploit the IPL boom, prior to the bidding and also subsequently, is a prima facie case of ministerial misconduct. The Prime Minister must ask him to step down from his ministerial post immediately, pending an investigation into his conduct.
According to IPL chairman Lalit Modi, the Minister called him with a request not to make public the list of shareholders of the consortium. Mr. Tharoor admits he contacted Mr. Modi on the matter, although his version of the nature of his interest is quite different. The Franchise Agreement does have a confidentiality clause, which prohibits disclosure of the agreement, other than as might be required under the law, without the prior written agreement of both parties (the consortium and the IPL arm of the Board of Control for Cricket in India). But there is no justification for the existence of such a clause in the first place. The IPL draws heavily on public resources, not only for security purposes, but also in terms of tax exemptions and tariff concessions. There is an undeniable public interest in requiring consortiums bidding huge amounts for cricket franchises to disclose to the public their funding sources and shareholding particulars. However, Mr. Tharoor is not the only one in the dock in this murky affair. A Kochi consortium co-owner has alleged that Mr. Modi offered the owners $50 million as a 'bribe' to withdraw from the bid after they had won it. The IPL Chairman has strenuously denied this. Actually, the original invitation to tender for ascertaining the two new franchises was cancelled after BCCI president Shashank Manohar found that stiff clauses involving binding financial obligations were included without the IPL governing council's approval. The subsequent tender invitation dropped the clause requiring the bidders to demonstrate a net worth of $ 1 billion and to pay an advance guarantee of $ 100 million. Evidently, within the IPL, there are serious conflicts of interest and vested interests lobbying for, and acting clandestinely on behalf of, big business and powerful politicians. The league owes its success to millions of cricket fans across the country and, to some extent, abroad. The time has certainly come for the BCCI as well as government authorities to look into the nature and size of the amounts flowing into the IPL, and ensure greater transparency and accountability on the part of both the organisers and the franchisees.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Murky-IPL-games/article16369125.ece
16,4,2010,Another policy dilemma,"The Reserve Bank of India is confronted with a new policy dilemma on the eve of its scheduled unveiling of the annual credit and monetary policy statement on April 20. Monetary policy has for long tried to balance the imperative of maintaining price stability with the objective of ensuring credit availability for the real sector. This time too, the RBI has to strike a middle course while pursuing the often conflicting goals. Inflation is well above the RBI's target range and, far from being a supply-side phenomenon , has become more generalised. Economic growth continues to be robust and, even as credit disbursements by banks seem to be gaining momentum, there is expectation all round that the RBI would hike its policy interest rates and, probably, the Cash Reserve Ratio as well. The RBI will also articulate its stance on the hardening Indian rupee. The rupee is currently trading at an 18-month high. Over a 13-month period till the second week of April, the rupee has appreciated by 13 per cent.
The rising rupee affects the competitiveness of India's exports, which are only now recovering after a long period of slump. Interestingly, the currency has strengthened although India is having fairly large trade and current account deficits. It is mainly the large-scale resumption of foreign institutional money flows into the stock markets that, in the absence of central bank intervention, has caused the rupee to appreciate. Between April and December 2009, the net portfolio inflow amounted to $23.6 billion, as against a net outflow of $11.3 billion a year earlier. These inflows have offset the current account deficits and propped up the balance of payments. Yet that alone cannot explain why the central bank has not intervened. The two-stage process involved in intervention — purchase of dollars in the first instance, followed by sterilisation of rupee liquidity — has quasi-fiscal costs. Besides, it will have to be dovetailed with the other policy objectives.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Another-policy-dilemma/article16366722.ece
17,4,2010,Learning from failure,"It is almost a rite of passage that an Indian launch vehicle runs into trouble in its first flight. The country's very first attempt to launch a satellite failed in August 1979 when the SLV-3 rocket went out of control and ended up in the Bay of Bengal. A year later, those problems were sorted out and the rocket put a 35-kg Rohini satellite into orbit. The Indian Space Research Organisation had to cope with two successive failures with the Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV) before its third flight in 1992 went smoothly. In 1993, a series of technical shortcomings coalesced and the first flight of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) ended in failure. Those issues were swiftly resolved and the PSLV has become known for its ability to carry out a wide range of missions with rugged reliability. The first launch of the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) nine years ago, using a Russian-made cryogenic upper stage, was, to some extent, the exception. Although the GSAT-1 satellite was put into orbit, a small under-performance of the cryogenic stage meant that it was not the planned orbit. Attempts to move the satellite using its own thrusters were not successful and the satellite was ultimately abandoned.
Despite such a history, the failure of Thursday's GSLV launch with the country's first indigenous cryogenic engine and stage came as a bolt from the blue. The engine and later the full stage have gone through extensive testing on the ground in the course of their development. Moreover, the actual engine that flew on the GSLV was test-fired on the ground for 200 seconds. Exhaustive reviews by experts of the cryogenic stage and the rocket were completed before the GSLV was cleared for launch. After the unsuccessful flight, the ISRO chairman, K. Radhakrishnan, initially suggested that two small cryogenic steering engines, which swivel to maintain the rocket's orientation, might have malfunctioned. Later, however, he indicated that the main cryogenic engine itself might not have ignited. In such a complex system as the cryogenic stage, even a small defect that escapes attention is sufficient to doom the flight. But the space agency would be unwise to confine its analysis to problems encountered with the indigenous cryogenic stage. This is an opportunity for a thorough examination of the entire GSLV rocket and its past five flights. There have, for instance, been problems with the Vikas liquid-propellant engine in previous flights. The procedures for the manufacture, assembly, and pre-flight testing of all liquid propellant engines and stages need particular attention. A comprehensive review would best ensure the future reliability of the GSLV.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Learning-from-failure/article16366992.ece
17,4,2010,Doing science in a new way,"The recent successful mapping of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) genome by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Team India Consortium with Global Partnership has shown a novel way to do science in the Internet era. The mammoth project of global significance tapped the latent talent and potential of nearly 400 students spread across India and made the result available in an internationally accepted format. Although the TB genome was sequenced in 1998, complete mapping was not possible as only about 60 per cent of the genome was annotated. A sequenced genome is like a book containing a string of million alphabets that makes no sense; mapping arranges these alphabets into words, sentences, and chapters. The CSIR's Connect 2 Decode (C2D) project was to map the complete TB genome by extracting information on individual genes contained in hundreds of published papers and using computational extrapolation for the missing ones. The C2D project, involving students — undergraduates to start with — enlisted on a voluntary basis, was completed in just four months. Doing it the traditional way would have taken years. The message is: there is abundant young talent in India and much of it goes waste for want of opportunities and due to systemic inadequacy.
Here India can learn from China. The BGI, which used to be known as the Beijing Genomics Institute before it moved its headquarters to Shenzhen in 2007, offers a possible answer to the question of harnessing the large talent pool that may otherwise go waste. A recent editorial and a news feature in Nature looked at the possibility of China becoming the world leader in genome sequencing, thanks to the BGI model. In fact, the BGI, which depends primarily on graduates, has contributed a lot to the sequencing of many genomes, the human genome included. Tuberculosis, which mainly afflicts the poor in developing countries, is a neglected disease. Drug companies have no incentive to invest in relevant research; Rifampicin, the latest TB medicine, was discovered in the 1960s. This neglect sits ill with the fact that 1.7 million people die from TB globally every year (there are two deaths every three minutes in India alone), and the number of people with multidrug-resistant TB is increasing. It is to provide a fillip to research and drug development that the TB gene map is made freely available online under the Open Source Drug Discovery initiative of the CSIR. Anyone, including drug companies, could use the data and add to or modify them; it works on the same principle as Wikipedia.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Doing-science-in-a-new-way/article16366991.ece
18,4,2010,Damning indictment,"The much-awaited United Nations report on Benazir Bhutto's assassination has no answer to the question that has bothered Pakistan and the world since that wretched December day in 2007: who killed her? This was expected. The terms of reference of the three-man commission, appointed by the U.N. at the request of the Pakistan government, were to establish the “fact and circumstances” of Benazir's assassination. It was understood that the commission, headed by Heraldo Munoz, the Permanent Representative of Chile to the U.N., would not carry out a criminal investigation to ascertain the mastermind behind the gun-and-suicide attack that killed Benazir as she left an election campaign rally at Rawalpindi's Liaquat Bagh. But within the limited scope of its mandate, the commission has produced a valuable document. Its report is the first comprehensive, independent reconstruction of events before the assassination and after. It contains several new facts and insights about the fatally inadequate security provided to a former Prime Minister by the Musharraf regime, and the criminally shoddy investigation into her killing. The commission's conclusion, that the Musharraf regime was deliberate and discriminatory in not responding to Benazir's security requirements, and that the investigation into her killing was blocked at every stage, is a damning indictment of the government of the day.
This is the first time an official, public international document has raised questions about the invasive role of Pakistan's military and intelligence agencies in running the country, its links with the Taliban and the jihadist groups fighting India, and the adverse consequences all this has had for Pakistan. Daringly, the report calls for an investigation into the role of the dreaded “establishment… the de facto power structure that has at its core the military and intelligence agencies” in the assassination. For the Pakistan Peoples Party, which has built itself as the main opponent of the establishment as well as its victim since the times of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, the report is a vindication. It is also a part explanation of why the PPP, despite taking office within four months of Benazir's killing, launched a proper investigation only in October 2009, after being goaded by the commission. It remains to be seen if this investigation can proceed along the lines urged by the commission in its report. But this seems doubtful, if the government's mysterious end-March request to the commission to delay the report by two weeks and, then, its attempts last week to withhold the document from public release are any indication. Given the nature of the Pakistani state, it is more likely that the truth behind Benazir's killing will never be known.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Damning-indictment/article16369232.ece
18,4,2010,Regulatory tussle,"Even after the government persuaded last week the Securities Exchange Board of India and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) to seek a legal mandate from a court on the issue of regulatory oversight of the unit-linked insurance plans (ULIPs), the tussle between the two regulators continues. So does the uncertainty over the ULIP schemes that are by far the most popular of the products offered by the life insurance companies. The capital market regulator, in a new circular, has asked all the new ULIP schemes to be registered with it, while allowing schemes in existence before April 9 to continue. It may be some time before the courts decide on issues such as this. Besides, legal rulings, dependent as they are on scarce precedents, are not the best way to demarcate regulatory authority in the financial sector. One reason for the confusion is the wide disparity in the age of different regulators. The RBI, now in its 75th year, has been the country's principal financial regulator taking on a wide range of functions including those which, in other countries, are in the domain of specialised agencies. Of course, the RBI too has been ceding territory, for instance, to NABARD, the apex development institution for agriculture set up in 1981.
The reason why the differences between SEBI and the IRDA have escalated may have to do with the fact that both are relatively new institutions carving out regulatory space in areas that were hitherto minimally regulated. The SEBI Act was passed in 1992 while the IRDA came into being in 1999. It will take a while for precedents to be set in the regulation of products and services that were previously offered by government-owned monopolies which, it was mistakenly believed, needed no independent regulation. Until competition came through economic liberalisation, the LIC had a monopoly over life insurance and the Unit Trust of India over mutual funds. The ongoing fracas shows how difficult it is to demarcate regulation in the case of hybrid products belonging to two or more financial domains, in this case insurance and capital markets. As financial disintermediation gathers pace, many more complex products, drawing on capital markets, insurance, and banking will be offered. The SEBI-IRDA tussle might be the most visible manifestation of inter-regulatory differences but there are others where coordinated regulation would have helped. A case in point is the debt market where both the RBI and SEBI claim jurisdiction.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Regulatory-tussle/article16369231.ece
19,4,2010,Behind and beyond Tharoor,"The resignation of Minister of State for External Affairs Shashi Tharoor ends an unsavoury chapter in the politico-cricket scandal set off by his lobbying for the Kochi franchise in the Indian Premier League. Although belated and coming after much false protestation, the resignation may help the Congress and the United Progressive Alliance government blunt some of the Opposition's attacks in Parliament. But it does little to address popular misgivings about misuse of public office by Ministers in search of private advantage. That Mr. Tharoor's “mentoring” of the bid for the franchise ended in a windfall for his partner, Sunanda Pushkar, is not in dispute. Mr. Tharoor allegedly went much further: he is even accused of negotiating the percentage of her 'sweat equity' in the consortium that successfully bid for the franchise, Rendezvous Sports World. Although Ms Pushkar has now offered to surrender her windfall, this does not undo what constitutes, prima facie, a corrupt practice by a public servant prosecutable under Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988. Actually, the assignment of free equity to Ms Pushkar suffers from more than one legal infirmity. Under the Companies Act, sweat equity shares are equity shares issued only to employees or directors of a company for consideration other than cash for providing know-how or making available rights in the nature of intellectual property rights or value additions. Further, at the date of the issue of sweat equity shares, not less than one year should have elapsed from the date on which the company was entitled to commence business.
But the rot clearly goes beyond Mr. Tharoor and Ms Pushkar to the very core of the IPL. Allegations have been made that the process of bidding for franchises suffered from something like insider trading. There are also conflicts of interest among those serving on the IPL's Governing Council. Chairman and commissioner Lalit Modi certainly did enough to provoke the Income Tax department to carry out a survey on the IPL's funding. The murky practices go hand in hand with a lack of transparency about franchise ownership and sources of funding. With franchise agreements incorporating confidentiality clauses, truth, as happened in the case of the Kochi franchise, is in the open only when a vested interest outs it. There is need for an immediate enquiry or investigation, if necessary by the Central Bureau of Investigation, into Mr. Tharoor's egregious acts of ministerial misconduct. But the interests of justice will be served only if this goes beyond the Kochi franchise into the layers of corrupt and questionable practices involving big business and powerful politicians in Indian cricket's money-spinning, iconic show.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Behind-and-beyond-Tharoor/article16371235.ece
19,4,2010,Going after Goldman Sachs,"On April 16, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a civil suit against the world-renowned investment bank Goldman Sachs, alleging fraud; if intentional fraud emerges, the case could be sent to criminal prosecutors. This is the first time the regulator has taken action against a Wall Street institution for capitalising on the collapse of the U.S. housing market, which triggered the global economic crisis in 2008. Specifically, the SEC accuses Goldman Sachs of failing to tell customers that investments offered by the bank were supported by very risky mortgages in an already overpriced U.S. housing market. Its officials also contend that the investor John Paulson had influenced the bank's selection of these investments because he knew they were bad risks, and that the bank had failed to tell customers of this. Mr. Paulson, who is not being sued, made billions of dollars himself by betting that the loans in question would fail. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs is alleged to have profited from bets on those loans and marketed the same packages aggressively. The entities that bought into the scheme, named Abacus 2007-AC1, were mainly foreign banks and pension funds; they lost about a billion dollars.
By current Wall Street standards, the sums involved are small. The SEC will also have to prove their case in the courts against what will surely be a fierce defence. The repercussions, however, are very extensive. The regulators may now investigate the packages other Wall Street institutions are offering. Public money is involved too. The American International Group, AIG, insured Goldman Sachs over some of the Abacus deals, and received a $180 billion taxpayer bailout when the investments crashed. Moral questions will arise over the fact that Mr. Paulson, and possibly the banks involved, saw nothing wrong in selling financial packages which they knew were unsafe and against which they and others could then bet. Furthermore, in 2000, the U.S. Congress eliminated, with the Commodities Futures Modernization Act, key protections against the kinds of things alleged in the Goldman case. Some liken this to allowing the unscrupulous to buy fire insurance on other people's houses. There is no doubting the rising public anger against Wall Street, but it is still not certain that Congress will pass stronger regulatory laws. As Nobel laureate Paul Krugman points out, many Republican members of Congress claim to be against taxpayer bailouts, but are actually colluding with Wall Street lobbyists to block regulation that would prevent future collapses.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Going-after-Goldman-Sachs/article16371137.ece
20,4,2010,Fine balance,"The Reserve Bank of India has surprised the financial markets with a rather muted increase in the policy interest rates — the repo and the reverse repo — and the Cash Reserve Ratio. Each of these is to go up by an identical 0.25 percentage point. On the eve of the policy statement, there were expectations that the hikes would be of a higher magnitude. Indeed, the RBI's recent reports on the economy including its policy-eve macroeconomic assessment clearly focussed on inflation and price stability suggesting a strong, concerted action against inflation. However, the policy statement strikes a fine balance between the needs of economic growth and price stability, even while taking into account certain special factors such as the huge government borrowing programme on the anvil. Economic recovery is becoming more broad-based, thanks to a strong showing by the industrial and service sectors. There has been a sustained increase in bank credit and in the financial resources raised by the commercial sector from non-bank sources. The economy has been resilient in the face of deficient monsoons during the second half of last year. In the circumstances, the RBI's projected GDP growth rate of 8 per cent, with an upward bias, for 2010-11 appears cautious but is consistent with the central bank's conservatism.
The baseline projection for WPI inflation for March 2011 is 5.5 per cent. That will pose significant challenges to monetary policy. Having breached the RBI's revised target of 8.5 per cent for March 2010, WPI inflation is currently poised to enter double digits. While the hope is that inflation will moderate over the medium-term, there are significant risk factors affecting both inflation and growth. Chiefly, the rising petroleum and commodity prices as well as the uncertainty about the pace and shape of global recovery and about the performance of 2010 south-west monsoon are expected to weigh down economic growth. The strong rupee appreciation is threatening the just-recovering exports as well as those who compete with imports in the domestic market. Among the non-monetary announcements, great significance is attached to the impetus given to infrastructure companies. Financial sector architecture will be improved through a new reporting platform for commercial paper and certificates of deposit. Foreign banks that are eager to expand in India will have to wait a little longer for some important clarifications. The RBI is to prepare a discussion paper on the mode of their presence by September 2010. New bank licences will be awarded only after due deliberations on another discussion paper to be got ready by July.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Fine-balance/article16371337.ece
20,4,2010,Redressal of injustice,"The curtains have finally come down in the Jessica Lal murder case, with the Supreme Court confirming the award of life imprisonment to Manu Sharma. It was 11 years ago that the son of a former Union Minister pulled the trigger on Lal in front of many eyewitnesses. This was after she refused to serve him a drink at a fashionable Delhi watering hole where she worked as a celebrity barmaid. Justice in what seemed like an open and shut case came close to being derailed when a sessions court acquitted all nine accused. This was because a string of witnesses turned hostile and the murderer was aided by a shoddy investigation (for instance, the shocking failure to recover the gun used to shoot Jessica) and a prosecution case riddled with holes. The news media and public-spirited citizens played a key role in protesting against this gross miscarriage of justice, exposing the nature of the investigation and revealing other embarrassing details related to the case. This sustained campaign eventually led the Delhi High Court to take suo motu cognisance of the acquittal and reopen the case after the police filed an appeal against the session court's judgment.
In pronouncing Manu Sharma guilty, the Delhi High Court placed considerable weight on the testimonies of the bar-cum-restaurant owner Bina Ramani and her family, as well as some of her patrons, all of whom were present when the shooting took place. The Supreme Court has done likewise, determining that the entire chain of circumstances, including Manu Sharma's behaviour following the incident, led to only one inference — the guilt of the accused. The two-member Bench had some strong words for what it saw as a ‘trial by media,' pointing out that unnecessary controversies were created by some reports that had “the effect of interfering with the administration of justice.” There is certainly a worrying tendency in the media to indulge in sensationalism and fanciful speculation in high-profile criminal cases. The disgraceful way in which the media reported the Aarushi murder case is fresh in memory; in the same way, there can be no defence for exaggerated or false reports on the shooting of Jessica Lal. But it is also important to acknowledge that justice was rendered thanks to the intense, even aggressive, media scrutiny over a brutal killing that shocked the conscience of the nation. While the judiciary deserves to be praised for its capacity for self-correction, a section of the broadcast and print media deserves a pat on the back for fighting for justice in the Jessica Lal case and for helping prevent it from being thwarted by those who wield power and influence.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Redressal-of-injustice/article16371336.ece
21,4,2010,Why we need an anti-torture law,"It is common knowledge that in India torture is professionally sanctioned and practised as a potent means of criminal investigation. There are honourable exceptions of course but in an alarming number of cases, the police and also paramilitary and military forces resort to this barbaric practice as a tool for extracting information from those in custody, circumventing the criminal justice system and undermining the rule of law. India signed the United Nations Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) in 1997 but is yet to ratify it. The specious rationalisation is that existing laws are sufficient to prevent this gross human rights violation. In a belated but welcome move, the Government of India has now given the nod for an anti-torture Bill that is aimed at harmonising our laws with CAT, a condition that is necessary for its ratification. Under the Prevention of Torture Bill, public servants who obtain a confession by causing grievous physical or mental hurt or danger to the life of any person are guilty of torture and liable for imprisonment up to 10 years.
Our existing laws deal with torture as if it were a regular offence. Provisions in the Indian Penal Code such as Section 330 (grievous hurt) may apply to torture cases but are limited in two ways. First, they apply only in situations where specific kinds of physical injuries are inflicted and fail to cover the gamut of ways in which torture is committed. Secondly, for the purposes of such sections, it is of no relevance whether the perpetrator of the offence is a public servant or not. A specific and separate law is necessary in the face of the widespread use of torture and the alarming number of custodial deaths caused by it. Describing torture and death in police custody as the “most heinous crimes,” the Supreme Court lamented some days ago that they were on the rise despite constitutional and statutory safeguards. According to the National Human Rights Commission, 2,318 cases of death in police custody and 716 fake encounters have been registered with it since 1993. Such numbers are merely indicative. It is an open secret that custodial deaths are routinely registered as suicides and encounters are frequently staged to murder those under detention. A built-in weakness in the proposed torture law is that the police will continue to have the responsibility of investigating such cases. This is one reason why complaints about torture rarely result in successful prosecution. Even so, the Prevention of Torture Bill can make a worthwhile difference to tackling one of the major issues of policing in India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Why-we-need-an-anti-torture-law/article16371587.ece
21,4,2010,Walk the talk,"United States Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood recently announced, to public acclaim in car-dependent America, that bicycle use and walking should be given the same importance as motorised transport in State and local projects. The Government of India took a similar view in its National Urban Transport Policy 2006 (NUTP). But it has been unable to persuade the States to implement the far-sighted reforms needed to make cities people-friendly. Providing a new deal for the cities now depends upon the commitment of the Ministry of Urban Development to pursue the reform agenda. A good place to start is to rate cities for their people-friendly quality. The Ministry has a good grading tool in the form of service-level benchmarks for pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transport users, among others. The NUTP unveiled a people-centric vision, yet the large sums of money that have been invested in urban infrastructure, such as flyovers and roads, centre-stage vehicles, not people. These structures are daunting to pedestrians, particularly children, the disabled, and the elderly. State governments have been dragging their feet on a vital aspect of the reform — the creation of a statutory Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) for the bigger cities. Had UMTA come into being, the massive funds granted under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission would have helped improve commuter services.
With the necessary legislative sanction to back it, the Authority can bring the major modes of public transport such as rail, bus, and feeder services under a single regulatory framework and make travel on a single ticket possible. This would end the administrative dichotomy of urban railways being run by the central government in some cities and the bus systems coming under State control. There is also a healthy living dimension to modernising public transport services and improving the ‘walkability' of cities. According to a well-cited study, “Walking to public transit: steps to help meet physical activity recommendations,” reported in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine in November 2005, nearly a third of American commuters who used public transport achieved, by walking to and from transit, the 30 minutes of physical activity a day recommended by the Surgeon-General. To fund urban infrastructure that hinders pedestrian movement is therefore to work against public health. Secretary LaHood summed it up nicely when he said Americans want to get out of their cars, get out of congestion, and have more opportunities for transport and exercise. Same here, Indians would say.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Walk-the-talk/article16371582.ece
22,4,2010,"Rectification, not revenge","Forced to jettison Shashi Tharoor as Minister of State for External Affairs, following damning revelations about his role in the Kochi franchise of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the central government seems to have launched a witch-hunt. The coordinated countrywide income tax surveys and searches of IPL franchisees and broadcasting firms, the behind-the-scenes political machinations, and the unwillingness to wait until the end of this week for the IPL final to be over look very much like a diversionary response — and a vendetta. There is much to be done to see that this hugely successful tournament, now in its third edition, is conducted with transparency and accountability. But what is needed is rectification, not revenge. The government cannot pretend that it knew nothing about the alleged irregularities before IPL Chairman Lalit Modi's tweets and l'affaire Tharoor made them public knowledge. The stink raised by the allegations over the IPL presents an opportunity to address the key issues — the inexplicable confidentiality clauses that draw a veil over ownership of some of the franchises, the nature of the funds that flow into them, and the conflicts of interest involved at several levels of the IPL.
In fact, the present crisis presents an opportunity for a deep rethink about the way Indian cricket is governed — at what cost, to whose benefit, for what social purpose? Mr. Modi might have done everything he could to create the impression that the league was his independent fiefdom. But the truth is that the IPL, inspired by the English Premier League, is a creation of the Board of Control for Cricket in India — with its governing council starting out in September 2007 as a sub-committee of the BCCI and graduating three months later to the status of a committee. The Board, which receives substantial tax concessions and other benefits from the state and fills its coffers by cashing in on the Indian public's phenomenal love for the game, cannot distance itself from the rot that has set in. It must take full responsibility for the integrity and transparent governance of its creation and eliminate the rogue elements without compromise. As important, it must reshape and reorient the IPL along the lines advocated in the thoughtful article, “The good, the bad, and the ugly of IPL,” published on this page. With proper social values and priorities and governance reform, India's most glamorous cricket show can indeed become “a giant platform to energise the [cricket-loving] masses for the greater good.” The future of the IPL is in the hands of India's powerful and already highly politicised cricket Board. It must set itself higher goals and standards than we have witnessed over the years.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Rectification-not-revenge/article16371837.ece
22,4,2010,Deadly waste,"The discovery of radioactive Cobalt 60 sources stored as scrap in New Delhi's Mayapuri locality by the Department of Atomic Energy and the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board is a clear pointer to the need for a stronger mechanism to monitor such dangerous waste. At least one person has received a very high dose of radiation in the incident, while six others have been treated for exposure-related symptoms. It is a matter of concern that an inspection conducted after the first reported injury found eight sources of radioactive waste in the scrap yard, necessitating a comprehensive clean-up of the entire area. Radioactive material is covered not by the Hazardous Waste (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008 but by the Atomic Energy Act, 1962. On paper, radioactive sources such as those used in radiotherapy machines in hospitals, industrial devices, and nucleonic gauges must be monitored from “cradle to grave,” and at the end of their useful life, be returned to the original supplier. Imports have to be shipped back to the source or handed over to the Waste Management Division of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre for disposal. The system of tracking and control of possession is obviously far from foolproof, although there is a lot of apprehension that these materials could be used by extremists to make “dirty bombs” (that can scatter radioactive materials). Many so-called sealed sources containing radioactive waste are going off the map and turning up in scrap yards, “orphaned.”
The Delhi incidents underscore the importance of conducting a coordinated search across the country to regain control of orphan radioactive sources. Besides reducing the danger of deadly radiation exposure to people, a clean-up can benefit industry. In 2007, the U.S. Customs regulators rejected several metal article shipments from India, as they were found to be contaminated with radioactive material. Germany, France, and Sweden have also detected Cobalt 60 in Indian steel. It is not surprising that the trail leads to metal scrap, including imported waste used in steel manufacture. The Government of India needs quickly to launch a clean-up act, with the participation of State governments. There is a strong case for designating areas in every city to handle recycling, and prohibit such activity in all other areas. A major effort is called for to train workers and raise capacity in the recycling industry. It is vital that all national ports are equipped to detect radiation in import and export. The safety protocol for waste-handlers, now being drafted by the National Disaster Response Force, needs to be implemented in right earnest to prevent accidents.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Deadly-waste/article16371836.ece
23,4,2010,Lessons from Bangalore,"The bombings at the M. Chinnaswamy stadium in Bangalore have underlined a stark fact: despite years of bitter experience, the loss of hundreds of lives, and the investment of crores of rupees in policing in recent years, urban administrators have not woken up to the terrorist threats that confront the cities. For reasons that are still unclear, the Chinnaswamy stadium was not evacuated when bombs went off outside its perimeter wall — despite the evident risk to spectators and players inside. Emergency services were not summoned to the site, exposing the city's lack of a well-rehearsed disaster management plan. Indeed, it is unclear if the stadium even had a full-scale evacuation plan; certainly, fans were not told what to do if something went wrong. Police even failed to detect some of the improvised explosives the terrorists had placed along the stadium's perimeter wall. There were no closed circuit television cameras outside the perimeter of the stadium, despite a plethora of intelligence warnings that high-profile sports venues and public places were likely to be targeted by terrorists. Protecting sports fans as well as other city residents who gather at crowded public facilities just does not seem to be among the priorities of governments or the private sector in India.
Fortunately, no lives were claimed by the Chinnaswamy stadium bombings. But the relatively low toll of 17 injured was the consequence of errors made by the still-unknown bomb-makers. For months now, the Union Home Ministry has been warning of a heightened threat from jihadist groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba. On Thursday, responding to this intelligence, the United States issued a warning advising its citizens to stay away from several crowded marketplaces in New Delhi. Little is being done, however, to make such venues safer for those who do not have the choice of avoiding them. No intelligence service in the world has the capacity to prevent all terrorist attacks. But effective closed-circuit camera surveillance, the deployment of necessary trained police officers, and emergency-response plans for rapidly moving the injured to hospital are vital measures that can help save lives. Police and emergency-services providers in cities from Singapore to New York have done ‘lessons-learned' exercises drawing on Mumbai's horrific experience of November 2008 — but not one major Indian city has done so. Later this year, New Delhi will host the Commonwealth Games. Experts have voiced concerns over security management at sites under construction. Even as India's police and intelligence services work to identify and apprehend the perpetrators of the bombings, urban administrators must take action to mitigate the consequences of the next attack.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Lessons-from-Bangalore/article16372090.ece
23,4,2010,Kandahar's grim prospects,"During the night of April 19, Azizullah Yarmal, deputy mayor of Kandahar, the second city of Afghanistan, was assassinated while praying in a mosque. The murder has caused widespread shock. Mr. Yarmal was known to be an honest and dedicated public official in an administration noted for corruption and incompetence. A few hours earlier, the Taliban had claimed responsibility for an attack in which a booby-trapped donkey cart was exploded by remote control in an attempt on the life of a former governor of Spin Boldak district. The bomb in fact killed three of his nephews and wounded four others. On March 13, suicide bombers killed 35 people. The repeated attacks form part of a Taliban campaign to spread fear among the half-million population of Kandahar and to show the occupying forces what their proposed attack on the city will involve. The U.S.-led offensive, planned for June, will be the biggest operation since the western invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and could involve 30,000 troops. Its stated aim is to drive the Taliban to the negotiating table.
The Taliban, for their part, have rejected talks while foreign troops are in Afghanistan, and say they will target all who work for the government. This strategy, bolstered by a reputation for ‘probity,' is clearly working among a population who, according to a U.S. military survey, bitterly resent U.S. support for the existing provincial council and consider, by 19 to 1, that the only way forward is to engage the Taliban immediately in talks, irrespective of the rigid and retrogressive society they would impose. That alone shows how destructive the U.S. presence in Afghanistan has been. The provincial council, headed by President Hamid Karzai's half-brother Ahmed Wali Karzai, is known to be extremely corrupt; Mr. Wali Karzai is also locked in fierce power struggles with a bloc led by former provincial governor Gul Agha Shirzai. Worse still, locals say the government is using its own mafias to kill business rivals or dissenters and rights campaigners. In addition, the U.S.-NATO commander in Afghanistan, General Stanley McChrystal, has overridden one of President Karzai's pledges, by saying that local councils or shuras will be allowed to ‘shape' the conditions for the offensive but will have no veto over it. The shuras are totally opposed to the attack and the residents of Kandahar are rightly fearful of what lies in store. The U.S. obsession with brute force rules key political issues out of the agenda. The only thing that is more or less guaranteed is more killing and destruction — of Afghans and their country.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Kandahars-grim-prospects/article16372412.ece
26,4,2010,Building blocks for new world order,"Lost in the din of the Indian Premier League controversy, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's participation in recent summits of the India-Brazil-South Africa (IBSA) and Brazil-Russia-India-China (BRIC) forums has gone largely unnoticed. Confounding the predictions of motivated sceptics in the West, BRIC has now met twice at the summit level and evolved a common approach to the global financial crisis that has made the quadrilateral a force to reckon with. At the political level, BRIC is hampered by two factors. Each member regards its ties with the United States as its single most important bilateral relationship and is excessively wary of displeasing Washington. Secondly, China and Russia, as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), prefer to exercise their power on security-related issues directly at that level rather than through committee. But on the economic front, BRIC solidarity is real. Within the G20, the four countries have jointly pushed for the reform of international financial institutions. In Brasilia on April 15, they called for changes in the governance structures of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to be implemented before the year is over. They also said they would explore the feasibility of using local currencies, rather than the dollar, for trading among themselves, thus signalling their rising stake in the evolution of the international monetary system.
Though similar to BRIC in some respects, IBSA has a geographical and strategic logic that is quite different. The trilateral brings together three important countries from Asia, Africa, and Latin America that are not just economically dynamic but politically vibrant and open as well. India, Brazil, and South Africa also share an unjust exclusion from existing structures of global governance such as the UNSC. The challenge before IBSA is to build on existing synergies and complementarities while carving out new areas for cooperation. It has tried to do this in three ways. First, enhancing the trade and investment, initially, within the trilateral and, then, between the three and their wider sub-regions. Secondly, business-to-business interaction and people-to-people contacts have been made a priority. The fruits of that effort are now becoming apparent. Thirdly, the three countries have identified specific thrust areas like agriculture and energy where work is proceeding. The Brasilia summit added a new and important dimension: a shared commitment to social inclusiveness in development. By broadening its agenda in this way, IBSA has demonstrated that multi-polarity is not just about power plays — it's about justice in the broadest possible sense.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Building-blocks-for-new-world-order/article16372499.ece
26,4,2010,Beyond monetary measures,"Other than for articulating the monetary policy stance and the broad macroeconomic trends, the Reserve Bank of India's annual policy statement is noteworthy for its comprehensive stock-taking of development and regulatory issues, financial markets, and several other related areas. In effect, it has become a one-point source of reference for all current financial sector matters, both regulatory and developmental. In respect of a few of the issues, such as the licensing norms for new commercial banks, the RBI statement provides an amplification of what the Finance Minister announced in his budget speech. Others, such as a road map for foreign banks, are in the domain of the central bank and needed to be updated. On the financial markets and financial sector reform, the RBI's well-known, measured approach is again in evidence. The financial system will stand to benefit only incrementally from the new products that have been announced. Obviously, the lessons from the financial crisis will guide the central bank in its approach to financial sector reform and intermediation. There are a few measures to strengthen financial sector regulation on an ongoing basis and improve the efficiency of the banking sector, while maintaining financial stability.
The RBI, which is expected to play a pivotal role in the new Financial Stability and Development Council, released its first financial stability report in March. In a significant initiative that will ensure transparency in the cost and delivery of credit, the RBI has issued guidelines for banks to switch over to a new system of base rate calculation from July 1. It will no longer be possible for banks to dispense credit at below the benchmark rates, which will be calculated in a transparent manner. Several new financial products are to be introduced but only after they have been deliberated upon. Regulation norms for non-convertible debentures and the final guidelines relating to over-the-counter foreign exchange derivatives are expected to be announced by June. The decision to boost infrastructure finance by relaxing the holding norms of eligible bonds by banks is a continuation of the policy thrust in this critical area. In two areas of great common interest — the operation of foreign banks and issuance of new bank licences — the RBI is likely to proceed cautiously. The consensus among regulators is to encourage foreign banks to incorporate subsidiaries in the country rather than operate through branches. Given its potential for controversy, the RBI has decided to delegate the task of vetting applications for new bank licences to an outside body.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Beyond-monetary-measures/article16372500.ece
27,4,2010,An unpleasant odour,"The central government's response to the controversy over the alleged phone taps of four political leaders is feeble and lacks credibility. A careful parsing of Home Minister P. Chidambaram's cautiously worded statement suggests it withholds more than it reveals. In declaring that the United Progressive Alliance government has not authorised any eavesdropping on the mobile phones of political leaders, Mr. Chidambaram has come up with a highly qualified denial. If the cell phones of political leaders such as Sharad Pawar and Prakash Karat were tapped, it is obvious that this would have been done surreptitiously rather than by following the due legal procedure; this would include a written authorisation from the Union Home Secretary, which must specify the reasons for intercepting the conversations and is subject to review. The Home Minister's statement that “nothing has been found…to substantiate the allegation” in the records of the National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO), which carried out the taps according to a recent expose in Outlook magazine, is also an assertion of the obvious. A highly secretive intelligence gathering agency such as the NTRO is not the kind of organisation that maintains truthful and detailed written records of every activity it undertakes. Moreover, the allegation is that the NTRO used a new generation device that can tap into phone conversations within a certain radius off-the-air, bypassing the process of obtaining authorisation and without enlisting the cooperation of the service provider.
The controversy raises serious issues relating to the misuse of official agencies in the narrow interest of the ruling party. It also raises the question of how the right to privacy can be protected in the face of changing technologies. Do we need new laws that govern the use of off-the-air surveillance devices? What if such devices get into private hands? Rather than address such serious questions, the government's overall reaction — which includes a flat rejection of the demand to set up a Joint Parliamentary Committee to probe the allegations — has been unconstructive. Intercepting private communication is inherently obnoxious and statutes such as the Indian Telegraph Act 1885 and the Information Technology (Amendment) Act 2008 allow this as an exception — for checking criminal and espionage activity, for instance. In 1996, the Supreme Court laid down a number of guidelines to check arbitrariness in intercepting phone calls. But despite its illegality and highly unpleasant odour, the practice goes on merrily. This time, the government must not be allowed to get away with a predictable refusal to go after, or reveal, the truth.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/An-unpleasant-odour/article16372971.ece
27,4,2010,SAARC at twenty-five,"As the 16th summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation gets under way in Thimpu, it would be easy to dismiss the event as yet another jamboree at which the leaders of the region will meet and talk a lot but achieve little of substance. A quarter-century after it came into existence, SAARC remains an under-performing regional association. The Thimpu summit is expected to yield an agreement on the region's strategy to deal with climate change, and another on trade in services. But many ambitious plans drawn up by SAARC for the betterment of an impoverished region, home to 1.6 billion people or more than one-sixth of humanity, have either remained on paper or moved towards implementation at glacial speeds. A fund for “least developed countries” within the region was once talked about and abandoned. The South Asia Development Fund for building infrastructure is expected to be operationalised at Thimpu a full 15 years after it was initiated. As an engine for the economic growth and development of the region, SAARC is yet to demonstrate any concrete achievements since 2006, when the much-delayed South Asia Free Trade Agreement became operational. It has pushed regional trade up to an estimated half a billion dollars but this is still way below potential. Subjects such as economic integration of the region and a common currency are no longer discussed with any earnestness.
Twenty-five seems a good age to fix the problem that ails the association. Its charter is clear that bilateral issues cannot be brought up in any forum of the association. Despite this, SAARC has permanently been overshadowed by the hostility between India and Pakistan. Both countries have used it as an alternative sparring ground, to the despair of the smaller member countries that see regional cooperation as an urgent necessity for their own progress. SAFTA is a victim, as is the SAARC convention on terrorism. The smaller nations must share some of the responsibility as some of them have used SAARC to tilt towards one or the other side of the India-Pakistan divide. Influential sections of the media in India and Pakistan tend to treat a SAARC event as a match between the two. This time is no different, going by the obsessive focus on a possible meeting between the Indian and Pakistani Prime Ministers on the sidelines of the summit. If these two countries, the biggest in the region, can commit themselves to keeping their rivalry out of SAARC, it would help the association focus on its agenda of regional cooperation. Eventually, this may even help India and Pakistan become good neighbours.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/SAARC-at-twenty-five/article16372970.ece
27,4,2010,Will this monsoon be normal?,"This year's south-west monsoon will be normal, says the India Meteorological Department in a forecast issued recently. But that is also what the IMD predicted last April for the 2009 monsoon, which then turned out to be a severe drought. This time the odds favour the IMD forecast being correct. Atmospheric scientists usually define a normal monsoon as one where the nationwide rainfall from June to September is within 10 per cent of the long period average for the season; a rainfall deficit of more than 10 per cent is taken as a drought. By that definition, the south-west monsoon has been normal 70 per cent of the time over the last 130-odd years. There has been a drought in only about 16 per cent of the years. There have been droughts in two successive years on just three occasions. Moreover, thus far whenever a drought involved a rainfall deficit of 20 per cent or more, as happened last year, the subsequent monsoon has invariably been normal.
India was the first country in the world to embark on operational seasonal forecasting. The first such forecast for the south-west monsoon was issued over a century ago, on June 4, 1886, drawing on the inverse relationship between Himalayan snow cover and monsoon rainfall. Since then, for its operational seasonal forecasts, the IMD has relied on various empirical models that took into account statistical relationships between various atmospheric and oceanic parameters and the monsoon. But published research that looked at the forecasts issued from 1932 to 2004 came to a dispiriting conclusion. There has not been, the scientists noted, “any improvement over the years, in spite of the continuing attempts to revise the operational models based on rigorous and objective statistical methods.” Besides, the IMD has not been able to predict a drought in its seasonal forecasts. Now, the Ministry of Earth Sciences has proposed launching a National Mission on Monsoon that will seek to develop reliable dynamical models for seasonal forecasting of the rainy season. Such models try to reproduce the complex interplay of processes that go on in the ocean and the atmosphere. The existing dynamical models, developed principally in the U.S, Europe, and Japan, have been good at forecasting the progress of the monsoon a few days in advance and shown considerable skill at predictions for up to 10 days. But they perform poorly in seasonal forecasts and fail to accurately reproduce the monsoon's year-to-year variability. Improving the models will require better understanding of the monsoon's links with processes that happen elsewhere. Then the models must be suitably modified to incorporate the new knowledge. All this is going to take both time and effort. But such an undertaking could offer the best hope for better seasonal forecasts.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Will-this-monsoon-be-normal/article16372749.ece
27,4,2010,No handing over of Kasab,"There is no question of India agreeing to Pakistan's demand for custody of Ajmal Amir Kasab for testifying against the seven Lashkar-e-Taiba men being tried in a Rawalpindi court for involvement in the November 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. Of the 10 men who carried out the three-day attack, Kasab was the only one captured alive. His “admission of guilt” statement to the Mumbai court that tried him has provided many details of the LeT involvement in the attack, even though he later denied all of it. The court will pronounce its verdict on May 3. Given the legal position and also the known links between the LeT and Pakistan intelligence agencies, there is no question of India acceding to Pakistan's demand. While Islamabad did take some unprecedented steps in the wake of the Mumbai attacks leading to the indictment and the ongoing trial, it has subsequently failed to show sincerity in dealing with the LeT and other anti-India militant groups. Instead, the government has given a long leash to the Jamat-ud-dawa, the charity front of LeT, and its leader Hafiz Saeed.
Even if we assume that the custody demand is not a ploy by Pakistan to shift the blame on New Delhi for its inaction against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack, and is born of a legal tight corner for the prosecution in the Rawalpindi court, there are ways of getting around it. The demand for Kasab can be traced back to a defence argument that his confessional statement was not admissible in a Pakistan court. In response, the prosecution sought to make him a party to the Pakistani trial — asking the court to declare him a fugitive and declaring its intention of seeking an Interpol “red corner” notice for him. In addition to Kasab's custody, Pakistan has asked for the magistrates and police officials who recorded Kasab's statements to testify before the Rawalpindi court. Since the Pakistani authorities have repeatedly said that their own investigation has yielded sufficient evidence to obtain convictions against the seven accused, this legal tangle over Kasab, if that is what it is, should not have arisen. But if the case needs strengthening, both sides should be able to agree that as provided by the law, the magistrates who took down Kasab's statements can provide the required testimony — in writing, as the law allows, rather than in person. The Law Ministries on both sides should be able to handle the required procedures. The demand for Kasab must not be allowed to become a new source of hostile rhetoric between the two countries.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/No-handing-over-of-Kasab/article16372751.ece
28,4,2010,Cleanup at IPL,"The leadership shake-up of the Indian Premier League might have been a necessary condition for the launch of a cleanup of Indian cricket's most spectacular and cash-rich show. But the suspension of IPL chairman and commissioner Lalit Modi by the Board of Control for Cricket in India invoking its special powers over its sub-committee can only be a first step in restoring the credibility of the IPL — by bringing honesty, accountability, and transparency to the conduct of an innovative tournament that can, aside from entertaining millions of fans, be a promoter of good social causes. In the context of the allegations and counter-allegations that have rocked the league, portraying one man as The Villain and the other members of the governing council as helpless bystanders or dupes does not seem very convincing. The real challenge before the BCCI is to cleanse the IPL of bid rigging, insider trading, dirty money, and conflicts of interest. To start with, the Board should resist the temptation of seeking the government's support in overcoming the crisis, essentially by crucifying Mr. Modi. Over the years, cricket administration in India has been politicised in a big way, with a wide spectrum of party leaders holding elected leadership positions in the BCCI or in State cricket associations. A Minister of the United Progressive Alliance government has been implicated in the scandal surrounding the Kochi franchise and there are allegations against some others that have been denied. Political considerations and vendettas must not be allowed to mar the investigations into the opaque activities of the IPL. With Mr. Modi out of the way, pending the conclusion of a probe into his role, the BCCI cannot pretend that all is basically well with the IPL.
The surprise is that in the midst of all this, the IPL tournament went on merrily — turning out to be a huge success organisationally, as an extravaganza, and in terms of the cricket on offer for millions of fans in India and abroad. At the end of six weeks of pulsating action, the tournament threw up a new champion in Chennai Super Kings. After starting slowly, and contributing greatly, through good performance and bad, to the excitement of the race for the semi-final berths, the Chennai team finished the tournament brilliantly, prevailing over the runaway pre-final favourite, Mumbai Indians. The losing finalist in the first edition and a semi-finalist in the second, CSK was ‘third time lucky' but deservingly so. Fittingly, the Chennai team, led by Indian captain M.S. Dhoni, walked away with the fair play award. The IPL can learn a lot from its champion team, especially the importance of being successful, and clean and fair at the same time. Cricket administrators must not fail the IPL, its upstanding cricketers, and its exploding number of fans.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Cleanup-at-IPL/article16373207.ece
28,4,2010,Uneven recovery,"The International Monetary Fund is generally credited with forecasting a global economic revival earlier than other major international institutions, including the World Bank. In the latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF finds further evidence of the world economy recovering from the global economic crisis. In nearly all countries the recovery is even better than expected. World output is forecast to grow by 4.2 per cent in 2010, up from the IMF's January 2010 projection of 3.9 per cent. Advanced economies, including the U.S. and the Euro Zone countries, are set to grow by 2.2 per cent this year. As was the case last year, the ongoing recovery continues to be uneven.The U.S. is off to a better start than Europe and Japan. Emerging Asia led by China and India are in the forefront of the recovery while many countries in Europe and in the Commonwealth of Independent States are lagging behind. China and India will grow by 10 per cent and 8.8 per cent respectively in 2010. While the forecast for China remains the same as it was in January, the one for India has been raised by a significant 1.l percentage points. Evidently, the IMF has taken into account the series of recent, upbeat economic news that show the Indian economy to be more resilient than thought. The IMF's projected growth rate for India for 2010 is indeed higher than the RBI's 8 per cent forecast for 2010-11.
While being generally upbeat, the IMF warns that the outlook remains unusually uncertain. The fiscal condition of many countries has deteriorated posing significant downside risks. For instance, the rapid increase in public debt in many advanced countries poses risks to their banking systems which, in turn, can be transmitted abroad. Since global recovery is still fragile, the fiscal stimulus planned for 2010 should be implemented. A policy agenda for achieving strong, sustained and balanced growth would require, among others, fiscal consolidation in advanced countries, exchange rate adjustments, and a rebalancing of demand across the world. Combating the high level of unemployment in advanced countries is a major worry as temporary joblessness can turn into long-term unemployment. That could spark off protectionism and derail once and for all multilateral trade initiatives such as those embodied by the Doha round. There is an urgent need to evolve a consensus over financial sector regulation in the developed countries. After all, it was the glaring shortcomings of the financial sector in the U.S. and other advanced countries that caused the worst global economic crisis in living memory.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Uneven-recovery/article16373206.ece
29,4,2010,Unlikely friends,"The euphoria in the United Progressive Alliance camp over the defeat of the Opposition-sponsored cut motions in the Lok Sabha is belied by the numbers: 289 for the government and 201 against. Exclude the Bahujan Samaj Party's 21 MPs — and it is immediately apparent that the Manmohan Singh government is a minority regime surviving on divisions within the Opposition, and leveraging its position to exploit the vulnerability of some of its rivals. That the dramatic rescue act by the BSP owes to some deft back-room understanding is plain enough. The larger question is the impact of this quid pro quo agreement on BSP-Congress relations in Uttar Pradesh. The BSP and the Congress have formally aligned just once, in 1996 when neither could have foreseen a situation where they would emerge as principal rivals in U.P. With 83 of 85 Lok Sabha seats from the State in 1984 and 269 of 425 Assembly seats in 1985, the Congress was master of all it surveyed in India's most populous State. Yet by 1991, the party was out of the reckoning in U.P. with only five seats in the Lok Sabha and 46 seats in the Assembly. While the Congress' marginalisation in U.P. was politically humiliating, it allowed the party the freedom to throw its weight behind whoever it perceived as a friend — the BSP in 1996 and the Samajwadi Party in later years, with a fair amount of cross-wooing thrown in.
Once Ms Mayawati wrested power from Mulayam Singh, the Congress's equation with the BSP changed — from on-again, off-again friendship to bitter rivalry accentuated by the deep personal animosity between the U.P. Chief Minister and Rahul Gandhi. The BSP chief and the Congress general secretary tend to bring out the worst in each other. The two fought bitter public battles much before the 2009 Lok Sabha election. The feud intensified after the Congress staged a surprise victory over the BSP. Not only has the Congress' rising star set himself the task of winning the 2012 U.P. Assembly election, he has left no one in doubt that he means to achieve this by weaning away Ms Mayawati's phenomenal Dalit following. But the BSP chief did not earn her formidable reputation for nothing. She has not deviated from the strategy of building an independent base and repeatedly testing its strength. Following her Lok Sabha setback, she has assiduously targeted her core constituency, placing Dalits in key positions of power and directing resources to Dalit-specific programmes. Against this background, it is difficult to see either party giving effect to the new ‘friendship' forged at the Centre. It is a cardinal principle in politics that principal rivals cannot be friends. And that is how it looks, at least in U.P.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Unlikely-friends/article16373487.ece
29,4,2010,Greece is not alone,"Greece has confirmed its expected request to the European Union and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout of €45 billion as initial assistance in its economic crisis. Athens will have to pay out on bonds worth about €8.5bn which mature in May and also has to pay €54bn this year as debt-servicing on €300bn. In addition, the country's budget deficit for 2009-10 was 13.6 per cent of GDP, or about €300 billion; the eurozone rules allow member states only three per cent. As for the bailout itself, the EU as a whole cannot provide such. Individual member states will contribute €30 billion for three years at five per cent, with Germany and France providing half that sum; the IMF is due to contribute €15 billion. Conditions will most probably focus on public-sector cuts and substantial changes to the state-pension system. Early public reactions in Greece have been hostile, with demonstrators particularly resentful of IMF involvement. Financial markets have responded selectively, despite Standard and Poor's downgrading of Greece's debt rating to junk.
Kenneth Rogoff, a former IMF chief economist, points out that national debt defaults and restructurings usually follow banking crises. He concludes that Greece must do all it can now to maintain international financial credibility so as to avoid IMF-imposed restructuring in future. But the matter is more complex than this assessment suggests. First, Greece is hardly alone; the U.S. budget deficit for 2008-9 was 9.9 per cent and the U.K.'s was 10.9 per cent for 2009-10. Sweden has also survived a comparable crisis. Secondly, Ms. Merkel's party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), faces a hard reelection battle in the province of North Rhine-Westphalia and needs to talk tough on Greece. Thirdly, the preceding Greek government, a conservative one, hugely expanded public spending and the budget deficit, by increasing public-service employment and failing to tackle widespread tax fraud. Meanwhile, the EU's regulatory bodies did nothing about the country's rising budget deficit, and Greece colluded with an investment bank to falsify the figures. Finally, Prime Minister George Papandreou has announced measures to crack down on tax evasion, to raise taxes, and to cut the budget deficit by four percentage points in the current financial year. The EU is also likely to adopt tougher regulations, which will reduce the capacity of private players to attack member states through financial markets. The Greek crisis, though serious, gives the EU an opportunity to help a member state, curb predatory financiers, and improve its own institutions and procedures.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Greece-is-not-alone/article16373488.ece
30,4,2010,People for climate,"Bolivia's attempt to win fresh support for the Kyoto Protocol is a step ahead in the efforts of the developing world to advance climate negotiations. Brazil, South Africa, India, and China have, as the BASIC countries, called for a legally binding, long-term cooperative agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. The failure at Copenhagen has underlined the importance of going all out for an agreement in the current year. To this end, the World People's Conference on Climate Change recently hosted by President Evo Morales in Cochabamba, Bolivia, deserves credit for drawing attention to the more contentious issues. The grassroots conference, which drew an estimated 30,000 people, has demanded that the affluent nations bear responsibility for the accumulation of greenhouse gases and prepare massively to compensate those who are most at risk from climate-linked environmental destruction. This has been the long-held position of the least developed and developing countries, but the Bolivia conference resolution goes much further. It asserts the deep sense of injustice nursed by the nations of the global South and wants a climate tribunal to be constituted on the lines of the International Court of Justice. This forum, it contends, should rule on the failure of developed countries to fully implement the Kyoto Protocol, and order reparations.
President Morales is unlikely to win many allies in today's world by calling for the end of capitalism, which he blames for the climate crisis. Bolivia is confronting its own economic dilemmas. It follows a policy of enabling the earth to regenerate its bio-capacity but finds it difficult to abandon the gains oil and gas bring. Another conundrum presents itself in the form of lithium, a ‘green energy' source of which Bolivia has the majority reserves. How can mining of the metal be reconciled with the national policy of not causing harm to ‘Mother Earth'? The Bolivian leader begs the question when he says it needs to be studied in depth. There are no dilemmas, however, when he speaks of the role of the biggest carbon polluters. The United States, he points out, is willing to spend staggering amounts of money on defence and the Iraq war, but not on paying compensation to poor nations. The Cochabamba conference also highlighted the conflict faced by indigenous people between their traditional rights and the U.N. scheme of carbon credits for forest preservation, called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD). Forests are a big part of the solution, but the UNFCCC must convince these communities that their interests will be protected.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/People-for-climate/article16297268.ece
1,5,2010,Ending the impasse,"In choosing to find a way to resume the dialogue process with Pakistan, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has been bold as well as pragmatic. Bold because it is the job of a leader who says he believes in engagement with a difficult neighbour to actually lead from the front and not be swayed by populist sentiment. And pragmatic because even if there is no guarantee that dialogue will open a way forward, the absence of dialogue is no option at all. Unfortunately, some political parties and analysts in India have tended to equate dialogue with surrender. For the past decade, the Indian strategic community has seen the suspension of dialogue with Pakistan as a lever to pressure it to address India's concerns about terrorism. For hardliners across the border the absence of dialogue is a godsend because it ensures that the two neighbours remain on the precipice, ready to fall over each time there is a terrorist provocation. Powerful elements within the Pakistani military establishment have a stake in the persistence of tension and are not enthusiastic about engagement with India. On the other hand, the peace constituency within Pakistan has been growing. Obviously, the best Indian strategy is one that seeks to enlarge that constituency. This seems to be the crux of what the Prime Minister is attempting to do.
Under the process agreed upon in Thimphu, the two Foreign Secretaries and Foreign Ministers will meet to take stock of the bilateral relations with a view to mutually comprehending the reasons for the current stalemate. Simply put, each side feels its core concerns are not being taken seriously by the other. If Pakistan can address Indian concerns about the activities of terrorist groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba and the rise in infiltration, it is likely to find New Delhi more than willing to discuss how disputes like Kashmir or Siachen can be resolved. If all goes well, the two countries can resume the kind of serious, result-oriented dialogue the subcontinent badly needs if it is to integrate and progress economically. But if Islamabad continues to take an opportunistic attitude towards the anti-India terrorist groups that operate on Pakistani soil, there is little chance that a dialogue will produce results. It is vital to concentrate on rebuilding trust, taking advantage of congenial political conditions in both countries. Punishment of the conspirators involved in the Mumbai 2008 terrorist attacks would be a major confidence-enhancing measure. But in the interim, long-pending humanitarian issues need to be addressed quickly, especially the repatriation of prisoners and those who inadvertently cross the land or sea borders.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Ending-the-impasse/article16297462.ece
2,5,2010,Vindicated at last,"While quashing criminal proceedings arising from 23 complaints against actor Kushboo, the Supreme Court has sent a strong signal that freedom of expression will not be allowed to be held hostage by those who indulge in smear campaigns or exploit the legal process to gain political or personal mileage. The slew of criminal complaints, filed mainly in Tamil Nadu in several places, relate to her comments published in a magazine in 2005. Noting the increasing incidence of pre-marital sex, Ms Kushboo sensibly cautioned girls to take adequate precautions to avoid unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. Her remarks were perversely interpreted by bigots as a licence for promiscuity and, believe it or not, as an affront to the dignity of Tamil women. The offences the actor was charged with included criminal defamation and indecent representation of women. The cases clearly had no legal merit, and the three-member Supreme Court bench did a real service to freedom of expression by addressing in some detail the issues raised by the petitioners before showing how hollow they were.
With respect to the charge of criminal defamation, the Court held that Ms Kushboo's remarks did not reflect any intent to harm and did not cause actual harm (neither mens rea nor actus reus). Further, the complainants were not ‘aggrieved persons' under Section 199 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As for the charges under the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act 1986, the Court concluded that it would “defy logic” to use against Ms Kushboo a statute “enacted to punish publishers and advertisers who knowingly disseminate materials that portray women in an indecent manner.” Notions of morality, it pointed out, are inherently subjective and the criminal law cannot be used to interfere with the domain of personal autonomy. The Court extensively cited its own landmark judgment in S. Rangarajan v. P. Jagjivan Ram & Ors — which underlined the importance of protecting freedom of expression in the face of intolerance. Coincidentally, in a double blow to the bigots, the Madras High Court threw out on the same day all criminal proceedings against actor and director Suhasini Manirathnam, who was targeted for apologising, on behalf of Tamils, to Ms Kushboo for the treatment meted out to her. While two upstanding actors have been vindicated, it is shocking that the cases against them have dragged on for half a decade — making the very process the punishment. Judges, particularly those in the lower courts, must apply their mind to the alleged offences rather than take summary cognisance of them. Vexatious litigation is an abuse of the judicial process and the higher judiciary needs to come down severely on it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Vindicated-at-last/article16297748.ece
2,5,2010,More than lip service,"The low level of participation in the capital market by small investors, despite the official espousal of their cause, has worried policy makers and regulators for long. While nearly half the population in developed countries has a direct or indirect interest in the capital market, hardly one per cent of the population in India invests in the equity markets, by far the biggest segment of the capital market. Even more striking is the fact that less than three per cent of household savings find their way to the capital market. One important reason is the apparent lack of faith in the integrity of the markets. This is unfortunate. The market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India — set up in 1992 in the wake of widespread stock markets shenanigans — has done a commendable job of building an impressive market edifice which is the envy of many others. All the market intermediaries — merchant banks, underwriters, brokers, and so on — were brought under regulation and the surveillance and monitoring of equity trading, which grew exponentially, were stepped up. The two other initiatives that have had a bearing on market integrity were the capitalisation of intermediaries and the induction of technology.
All these moves should have made Indian stock exchanges a safer and friendlier place to park individual savings. Yet in what should be seen as an unintended consequence, some of those very steps have made stock market investing more complicated for the retail investors. For instance, the technology-enabled compulsory dematerialisation of stocks is without doubt a major reform that greatly facilitated the buying and selling of shares at exceptionally low cost. However, for many retail investors the process of opening and operating a demat account is proving to be cumbersome. Again, the more recent requirement of complying with the KYC (Know Your Customer) norms has proved daunting to many small investors. Thus, in certain respects the use of high technology, the enhancement of capital requirements for brokers, and several other regulations have led to the alienation of the small investor and reinforced the inherent wholesale character of the stock exchanges. Official exhortation to retail investors to access the markets through mutual funds has merit. However, many mutual funds have fallen short of expectations. The intermediation charges are high and after-sales service is not up to the mark. Urgent steps are required to entice retail investors to debt instruments such as corporate bonds.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/More-than-lip-service/article16297746.ece
3,5,2010,Honourable verdict,"Seventeen months after Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab marched through Chattrapati Shivaji Terminus train station, delivering death to those unfortunate enough to be there on that night of unprecedented terror, justice has been delivered to his victims. Judge M.L. Tahilayani deserves credit for completing proceedings in a complex and high profile case in this short time-span — no small achievement in a system where procedural delays and obstructive legal tactics often derail criminal proceedings. Prosecutors had produced an enormous mass of evidence, ranging from intercepted communications to DNA samples and eyewitness accounts: no fewer than 1,015 objects and 1,691 documents are reported to have been filed in support of their case. For their part, lawyers for the accused had fiercely contested this body of evidence. Kasab, who will be sentenced for his crime in a separate hearing, had come up with three irreconcilable accounts in his defence. Monday's judgment will not, of course, grant closure to the surviving victims, nor to the families of those who lost their lives. This is because the key conspirators, helped by a half-hearted investigation in Pakistan, are yet to face a court of law. Investigators and diplomats must now work together to ensure that those who guided Kasab's gun are also brought to justice.
Judge Tahaliyani also deserves credit for the courage he has shown in acquitting two men who were charged with crimes they had not committed. Long before news of Pakistani-American jihadist David Headley's role in helping plan the outrage emerged, this newspaper had repeatedly pointed out that the evidence against Fahim Arshad Ansari and Sabahuddin Ahmad was, at best, thin. Held months before the Mumbai carnage on charges that included preparations for an attack on the Bombay Stock Exchange, Mr. Ansari was alleged to have produced maps and sketches of the city for the Lashkar-e-Taiba's assault team. However, no material evidence was produced to support this claim, except for a hand-drawn map. Nor was the case against Mr. Ahmad persuasive. Held in Uttar Pradesh two years ago for his alleged role in a murderous attack on a Central Reserve Police Force camp in Rampur as well as in the December 2005 attack on the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, Mr. Ahmad was alleged to have passed on Mr. Ansari's intelligence output to the Lashkar's leadership in Pakistan. No corroborative evidence was ever produced. Monday's verdict thus is a tribute to the independence of the Indian judicial system and its ability to deliver justice dispassionately. It also offers a lesson for India in these troubled times: even the most horrific of crimes can be addressed within the four walls of our criminal justice system, without recourse to special counter-terrorism laws or emergency measures.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Honourable-verdict/article13797882.ece
3,5,2010,Defeat of the lunatic fringe,"The Austrian President, Heinz Fischer, formerly of the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) and now an independent, has trounced two far-Right candidates to win a second six-year term. In the election on April 25, Mr. Fischer won 78.9 per cent of the vote, while Barbara Rosenkranz of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) took 15.6 per cent and Rudolf Gehring of the newly formed Christian Party got 5.4 per cent. The Green Party helped Mr. Fischer by withdrawing in his favour, after grilling him for his views on various issues. The 49.2 per cent turnout was far below the 70 per cent figure in the 2004 presidential election, and the proportion of spoilt papers was unusually high at 7.3 per cent. The low turnout may be partly explained by the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) candidate Erwin Pröll's decision not to contest, but to endorse the incumbent instead, which left many ÖVP supporters stranded. Secondly, the Austrian presidency is largely ceremonial. Thirdly, an election tends to be keenly fought when an incumbent has used the two terms allowed and new faces appear. During the run-up to this election, the Right was also damaged by chaos over nominations.
The campaign saw right-wing candidates vie with each other to stretch the boundaries of political extremism. Ms Rosenkranz, who has lobbied for changes to Austria's anti-Nazi legislation, went on record doubting the existence of gas chambers in Nazi concentration camps. Declaring that as President she would be “a horror show,” the editor of the influential daily, Österreich, withdrew the paper's support. The FPÖ campaign was hostile to Islam, to immigration, to women's rights, and to the European Union. As for Mr. Gehring, he opposes feminism and gay rights and favours salaries to make housewives stay at home and thereby prevent the “brain damage” he claims young children suffer in kindergartens. He is even accused of saying the government would soon implant chips into Austrians' brains. The Freedom Party's failure to win 25 per cent of the vote is a substantial blow to its prospects in regional elections scheduled for the autumn. That is significant in view of the Right's strong showing in the 2008 general elections, which may have prompted observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to monitor an Austrian election for the first time since World War II. The presidency may not command any real powers but the Austrian people have sent a clear and welcome message as to what they do not want.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Defeat-of-the-lunatic-fringe/article16298384.ece
4,5,2010,Wide-open race,"Britain goes to the polls on Thursday in arguably the most unpredictable and bitterly contested general election since 1992 when the Conservative Party returned to power in a nail-biting finish after it had been written off by virtually everyone. This time it is the Labour Party that is looking down the barrel and hoping for a miracle on polling day. Opinion polls predict a hung Parliament with the Tories slightly ahead of Labour and the Liberal Democrats but way short of getting a majority on their own. However, all three parties insist that the race is still “wide open.” Much will depend on the turnout and which way the record number of undecided voters finally go. The 1997 Labour landslide and its two subsequent victories in 2001 and 2005 were attributed to Tony Blair's success in winning over ‘swing' voters. Can any of the current leaders — Gordon Brown, David Cameron, and Nick Clegg – do a Blair? So far, they appear to be struggling. Let alone floating voters, even their committed supporters are playing hard to get. Since the last election, public distrust of politicians has deepened, especially after the MPs' expenses scandal, and most voters say they no longer trust any politician. Incidents such as the so-called bigotgate in which Mr. Brown was caught on a live microphone calling a woman voter a “bigot” have reinforced the perception that politicians hold voters in contempt.
Then there is anger over the impact of the recession. People blame Labour, accusing it of selling out to the bankers and not preparing for adversity when times were good. Tories and Lib Dems have desperately tried to tap into the widespread anti-incumbent mood by offering themselves as the ‘change' the country needs. People acknowledge the need for change after 13 years of Labour rule but not many are sure that the Tories or the Lib Dems are really the change they want. Indeed, the Tories' popularity has declined as the campaign progressed and their policies — especially on the economy and public services — have come under intense scrutiny. The Lib Dems too have failed to sustain the momentum they gained after Mr. Clegg's impressive performance in the leaders' televised debates, Britain's first brush with American-style electioneering. The debates have been praised for electrifying a dull campaign and transforming a predictable two-horse race into a volatile three-way contest. For progressive politics, there's a downside to the rise of the Lib Dems: it threatens to divide the Centre-Left vote to the benefit of the Right. Significantly, Mr. Clegg's party has rejected the idea of tactical voting to keep the Tories out. This will surely work to the disadvantage of Labour.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Wide-open-race/article16299126.ece
4,5,2010,Don't blame it on bad arithmetic,"The Mayapuri metal scrap market tragedy resulting from the callous disposal of equipment containing radioactive source cobalt-60 as scrap by the Chemistry Department of the University of Delhi has highlighted the urgent need to tighten the system of tracking and controlling the possession of such hazardous material. One can understand scrap dealers lacking awareness of what radioactive sources are and their hazards to health and environment. But it is hard to believe that members of a university science department could approve the auction of a radioactive device, flouting the guidelines of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) on safe disposal of such equipment after use. Admittedly, it was a 42-year-old apparatus that has been in disuse since 1985. What is shocking is that a ten-member ‘write-off committee,' comprising scientific members of the university and chaired by the head of the chemistry department, approved the disposal of the Co-60 source, along with other unused equipment of the department, in one lot; and the Vice-Chancellor gave his final approval swiftly.
To blame the deadly disposal on miscalculation, as the top university authorities have done, is to add insult to injury. Calculating the left-over activity in any radioactive source over time is a simple task. Co-60 has a half-life of 5.27 years, which means its activity goes down by half every 5.27 years. Forty-two years is eight half-life periods, which means the activity would have gone down only by 2 to the power of 8, which is 256. The source in question, a GammaCell 220 Irradiator supplied by the Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd, was a very strong source with 3300 Curies(Ci) of initial activity. Depletion by a factor of about 250 after 42 years would still leave a huge amount of residual activity of a few hundred billion decays/sec. On paper, the AERB guidelines take care of the problem of radioactive sources across the length and breadth of the country. But the DU-Mayapuri case has shown how lax observance and enforcement of the rules are on the ground. The temptation to view it as an isolated case must be resisted. As this newspaper pointed out in a recent editorial, a number of ‘sealed sources' containing radioactive waste are turning up in scrap yards; U.S. Customs regulators in 2007 rejected several metal article shipments from India because they were found to be contaminated with radioactive material; and Germany, France, and Sweden have detected cobalt-60 in Indian steel. While we wait for the findings of the inquiry committee, serious lessons must be learned from the Delhi tragedy. The time for the government to clean up is now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Dont-blame-it-on-bad-arithmetic/article16298226.ece
5,5,2010,Retrogressive intent,"Like Banquo's ghost, the scare of amendments to the Right to Information Act has made a habit of rearing its head every so often. In a recent letter to an RTI activist, the Department of Personnel and Training has confirmed the central government's intention to overhaul the 2005 Act — of course, with the now-familiar caveat that the process would include consultations with the stakeholders. No less than Sonia Gandhi argued against the amendments, to little avail, it seems. So what chance do the other stakeholders stand? In the time-tested manner of governments and bureaucracies, the department is upfront about some of the amendments while deliberately obfuscating the nature of some others. The door is to be shown to applications deemed to be “frivolous or vexatious.” Section 8 of the Act, which prescribes exemptions to the Act, could be amended to “take care of the sensitivity of the office of the Chief Justice of India” as well as to “slightly modify the provision about disclosure of cabinet papers.” What this means, shorn of officialese, is this: The office of the CJI will enjoy full immunity. Cabinet papers currently being processed are already exempted from scrutiny under Section 8. However, the bar abates once a Cabinet decision has been taken. Undoubtedly, therefore, the “slight” modification hinted at in the letter is aimed at making Cabinet decisions permanently inaccessible and opaque. Another amendment under consideration could disallow single-commissioner Information Commission benches. If that happens, the disposal of cases could slow down, rendering the Act ineffective.
Then there is the matter of “frivolous or vexatious” applications. Who is to decide what is vexatious and what is not? Any government department will naturally be vexed by an application that seeks to expose misconduct or corruption. A recent Union Home Ministry communication advised an RTI applicant not to disclose the names of men and women considered for the Padma awards. The anxiety clearly emanates from the arbitrary manner of deciding the awards. Under a future version of the Act, all queries relating to the awards could be deemed “vexatious.” It is true that the RTI is not always approached in the public interest; for example, there may be a disproportionate use of the Act by insiders, those within officialdom, to pursue their narrow career interests or even personal agendas. But this cannot be an excuse to dilute or degrade an Act that is recognised as being among the best in the world. At a workshop held recently to assess the RTI environment in South Asia, India was held up as model. It would be a great pity if the government was allowed to get away with the retrogressive amendments it has in mind.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Retrogressive-intent/article16298536.ece
5,5,2010,New guidelines for rating agencies,"Capital market regulator SEBI has issued new guidelines for credit rating agencies that seek to make the rating process more transparent. The guidelines flow from the report of a government-appointed high-level committee. As in the case of practically all aspects of the capital market impinging on investor protection, SEBI has relied heavily on the disclosure mechanism in formulating these guidelines. Henceforth, credit rating agencies have to make mandatory, comprehensive disclosures twice a year. They will have to place in public domain the factors behind their ratings and provide a synopsis of the discussions they had with the merchant bankers, bankers, and auditors concerned. They will have to disclose details of voting at the rating committee meetings and also of any dissent note. Credit rating agencies will have to look for and report defaults on the basis of certain well-established criteria, such as non-payment of interest on the due date, and also publish information about the historical default rates in various rating categories. It should not be difficult for the leading agencies to follow these guidelines. However, two questions are relevant here. One, will the additional information available really help the majority of investors? Second, will compliance with the guidelines help the agencies improve their image that has been tarnished recently?
Credit rating agencies provide valuable inputs to investors to make an informed decision when they want to place their money in debt instruments. More recently in India, new equity share offerings were also rated. In developed markets, they attracted a lot of negative publicity for their conduct during the recent financial crisis. Many complex financial instruments with high investment grade ratings fell by the wayside, dragging down the financial institutions and several other investors. The charge against them is that they misled investors by awarding satisfactory ratings to instruments whose risks they did not comprehend. In the late 1990s, during the Asian currency crisis too, they were seen in poor light. In India, the rating agencies are rapidly expanding their activities, even if the lack of depth in some segments of the debt markets might be restricting their scope. They will do well to adhere to these guidelines, if they are keen to improve their credibility in the eyes of investors. Notably, in every credit rating agency, there must be a Chinese wall between the analysts involved in the rating exercise and those responsible for the marketing and other business-related functions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/New-guidelines-for-rating-agencies/article16298535.ece
6,5,2010,Census and caste,"Should the Census of India 2011 be tasked with the collection of caste data, returning in a sense to the practice of the pre-Independence, colonial era? Let us start by recognising that the question is arguable. Opponents of caste enumeration tend to hark back to the ideals of the freedom struggle and the Constitution, which treat caste as illegitimate and see Census enumeration of caste as a tool of ‘divide and rule.' By not collecting caste data, the Census, a great national undertaking, strikes a blow for social equality. Supporters of caste enumeration tend to argue the opposite, namely that by collecting data on the caste-inequality link, the Census could become a promoter of progressive social change, chiefly by strengthening the case for compensatory discrimination policies across the land. As the sociologist Nandini Sundar points out, India in the past couple of decades has entered “a new era of caste relations” and while there has been heated debate on the political consequences of doing or not doing caste enumeration in the Census, little thought has been given to “how this is to be done, if at all; the nature of data generated; the level and form of tabulations in which data would be useful; who would gain from this knowledge at different levels; or the concrete ways in which caste data might or might not help to design government programmes to offset caste disabilities.”
Whether the collection of caste data, other than for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, will be socially divisive or will help in the quest for equality can be left aside for the purposes of settling the remit of the forthcoming decennial exercise. The short answer is that the Census is a great demographic endeavour that must not be confused with social science field work. As it is meant to collect observational data, and not information based on the perceptions of the respondents or self-categorisation, it cannot be the vehicle for capturing caste-wise population data. Besides, India is home to a humungous number of sub-castes with nomenclature variations across regions: aggregating them across villages will be too complex for the Census to handle. The enumerators, as Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram has pointed out, lack the sociological sensitivity to record and classify the population on the basis of castes and sub-castes. But this shortcoming applies also to the trainers and indeed to the whole Census system. If backward class commissions or socio-political movements need up-to-date measurement of caste and better data on the caste-inequality link, there are other ways of gaining this information. The government certainly did the right thing in resisting pressure from some political parties and regional groupings to task Census 2011 with doing something it just cannot handle.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Census-and-caste/article13666103.ece
6,5,2010,Sports Ministry on right track,"Union Sports Minister M.S. Gill has done a real service to Indian sport by restoring a 35-year-old clause in the government guidelines dealing with the tenure of office-bearers of the National Sports Federations (NSFs) and the Indian Olympic Association (IOA). The tenure clause in its amended form, which was notified last week, is actually a softening of the 1975 guidelines. It restricts the term of a president of a federation to a maximum of 12 years (up from eight previously) and that of the secretary and the treasurer to two terms of four years. It is another matter that over the years the guidelines have been honoured mainly in the breach. In August 2002, Sports Minister Uma Bharti formally decided to keep the tenure guideline in abeyance. Public opinion has weighed heavily against sports officials sticking to their posts for decades. Dr. Gill's laudable initiative was speeded up by observations made by the Delhi High Court in an ongoing public interest litigation and by the sentiments expressed by several MPs in the Rajya Sabha.
The IOA and NSF bosses have taken shelter behind the Olympic Charter, the document that governs world sport. They have also sought the Prime Minister's intervention. The Olympic Charter empowers the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to suspend a National Olympic Committee (NOC) if government regulations, laws or even the constitution of a country hamper the activity or erode the autonomy of an NOC. Nepal and Iraq in the past and Kuwait, more recently, suffered the consequences of IOC sanctions. Dr. Gill, who has tried to bring transparency and accountability into the functioning of the NSFs, has wisely decided to send a senior Ministry official to the IOC Headquarters in Lausanne to sort out the matter. Autonomy cannot mean unbridled liberty to run sports bodies at the cost of the public exchequer. In framing fresh regulations, the Sports Ministry has argued that it has merely followed international ‘best practices.' With politicians at the helm of most federations, reform and regulation of Indian sports bodies has become extremely difficult. The spirited attempts by Mani Shankar Aiyar, Dr. Gill's predecessor, to set up a regulatory authority met with stiff resistance. The former Chief Election Commissioner has a tightrope walk ahead as he sets out to discipline the IOA and the federations without breaching the Olympic Charter — even as he grapples with the enormous task of getting Delhi ready for hosting the Commonwealth Games less than five months from now.

The first paragraph of in the above Editorial says “In August 2002, Sports Minister Uma Bharti formally decided to keep the tenure guideline in abeyance.” A reader said that it was in 2001.
The writer clarifies: The reader is partially correct. There was an instruction, perhaps a noting, on October 11, 2001 to keep the guideline in abeyance. However, on May 2, 2010, when the latest order was released to the media, this is what Sports Minister M.S. Gill said: “I am satisfied that the cryptic order, passed on August 24, 2002, by the then minister, blocking the perfectly valid and well considered regulations of 1975, served no public interest. I have, therefore, set it aside .…” We have only stated the then Sports Minister formally decided to keep the guideline in abeyance in August 2002.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Sports-Ministry-on-right-track/article16300635.ece
7,5,2010,Intriguing verdict,"Britain's 2010 general election has given the country its first hung Parliament in more than three decades. An electorate distrustful of politicians, angry about the economic crash and the illegal invasion of Iraq, and anxious about the future, has voted, as Lord Mandelson, a senior member of the Labour government, put it, to “turn the page in the political book” without deciding “which chapter to open.” The last time there was an indecisive outcome was in 1974 when the Conservative government of Edward Heath was reduced to a minority, leading to political instability and fresh elections eight months later. Will history repeat itself? This is the question being asked as both the Conservative and Labour parties scramble to find allies to form a government. The former has emerged as the largest party by some distance. But it is unenviably short of a majority in the 650-member House of Commons; and together, Labour and the Liberal Democrats are closer to the halfway mark. Labour's hopes of leading a coalition government seemed to suffer a blow when Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, whose party fared worse than expected but has emerged as kingmaker, declared that it was the Conservative Party with “more votes and more seats” that “should seek to govern in the national interest.” But he stopped short of committing support to any party — leaving the door open for some tough negotiations, especially around his main demand for radical electoral reform. This could be a tactic to get a better deal from Labour, whose leader has skilfully played the ball back into Mr. Clegg's court. Regional players such as the Scottish National Party, the Unionist parties of Northern Ireland and the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru will have an unaccustomed role in determining the shape of the next government.
In a comparable situation in India, the single largest party would have been more or less assured of the first turn at government formation. Under the British constitutional arrangement, however, the incumbent Prime Minister has the right to remain in office until he or she chooses to resign or is defeated on the floor of the House. In 1974, Mr. Heath, who was in the same situation that Gordon Brown is today, hung on for several days before conceding defeat when an attempted deal with the Liberal Party failed. Labour leader Harold Wilson then formed a minority government, which lasted only a few months. Britain has had five hung parliaments since the beginning of the 20th century — 1974 was the last — and on each occasion, fresh elections followed within months. There are fears that whoever gets to form the new government, the United Kingdom is headed for a period of political and economic instability.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Intriguing-verdict/article16299113.ece
7,5,2010,An opportunity in Assam,"The recent handing over of Ranjan Daimary to India by the authorities in Bangladesh is one more signal to insurgents in the North-East that they can no longer look to that country to provide them sanctuary. The Bodo militant, who leads a faction of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland, is alleged to have masterminded the October 30, 2008 serial bomb attacks in Assam that killed more than 80 people. Just five months ago, in December 2009, Bangladesh similarly delivered the leader of the outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom, Arabinda Rajkhowa, along with one of his deputies, Raju Barua, to the Indian authorities, and a month earlier, two other top-rung leaders of ULFA were handed over. That leaves only ULFA's military chief Paresh Barua on the loose, while Anup Chetia, another top leader of the group, is in jail in Bangladesh. The issue of the North-East insurgent groups setting up cross-border bases was a major factor behind the difficult relationship India has had with its eastern neighbour through most of this decade. The turnaround can be credited directly to the willingness of the Sheikh Hasina government, elected in December 2008, to accommodate New Delhi's concerns on this matter and to formalise security cooperation. Prime Minister Hasina's visit to New Delhi earlier this year saw the two countries sign agreements on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, mutual transfer of convicted prisoners, and cooperation in the fight against international terrorism, organised crime, and illegal drug trafficking. New Delhi and Dhaka are now also discussing an extradition treaty.
The government should lose no time in putting to use the advantage it has secured with the arrests of these five high-profile North-East militants representing two of the most dogged and violent insurgencies in the region. It has provided an unprecedented opportunity to find lasting peace in Assam. With Mr. Daimary's arrest, the main obstacle to the dialogue that New Delhi has already initiated with a pro-talks faction of the NDFB is out of the way. The process should be able to go ahead without fear of disruption. With ULFA too, the government has a clear upper hand. That Mr. Paresh Baruah still remains outside presents a complication but the government can make him irrelevant by setting in motion a carefully thought out peace process with those of the group's leaders who genuinely want to talk and are clear that the issue of sovereignty is not up for negotiation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/An-opportunity-in-Assam/article16299112.ece
9,5,2010,No compromise on human rights,"The criminal justice system is founded on a slew of jurisprudential principles that protect the rights of suspects and accused. These include the right against self-incrimination, the right to remain silent, and the right against providing information under physical or mental pressure. Despite this, invasive procedures such as narcoanalysis, brain-mapping, and polygraph tests have been routinely used by the police — and, shockingly, with the approval of the courts. In holding that the forcible use of these tests is unconstitutional, the Supreme Court of India has drawn attention to the inherent violence in such investigative procedures, which constitute a gross abuse of human rights. The landmark 251-page judgment arrives at two broad legal conclusions. First, such coercive testing violates Article 20 (3) of the Constitution, which stipulates “no person accused of an offence shall stand witness against himself.” Secondly, it is an infringement of the right to personal liberty as understood in the context of Article 21, in particular the right to privacy, the right to a free trial, and the right against cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.
The court has made it clear that nobody can be compelled to undergo narcoanalysis, brain mapping, or lie detector tests and that any statements made during those procedures are not admissible as evidence. Such tests are permissible only when taken voluntarily. But even in such cases, they must be conducted in strict compliance with the National Human Rights Commission's Guidelines for the Administration of the Polygraph Test — which includes safeguards such as the mandatory recording of consent before a magistrate and the conduct of all tests by an independent agency. Proponents of the three tests, including those who concede that they sometimes produce false results, advance pragmatic arguments for their retention. They claim that the tests are a softer alternative to third degree methods of interrogation, which might become further entrenched in their absence. They also argue that these tests can serve the public interest in extraordinary situations: they can help uncover terror plots and prevent devastating attacks. Interestingly, the Supreme Court has not dismissed such arguments out of hand. Instead, it has taken the high ground to hold that as a court of law, it can only seek to preserve the balance between the competing interests of personal liberty and public safety, as they are reflected in the Constitution. The judgment must be acclaimed as a major blow for democratic and human rights in the face of invasive procedures that violate the mind.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/No-compromise-on-human-rights/article16299489.ece
9,5,2010,Far-going judgment,"There are many dimensions to the Supreme Court judgment in the case involving Anil Ambani's Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) and Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), besides the obvious. The crux of the case relates to the price and distribution of gas the latter company produces in the Krishna-Godavari basin. A 2005 memorandum of understanding between the two Ambani brothers bound RIL to supply gas to RNRL at $2.34 an mmbtu (million metric British thermal unit), the price at which RIL had agreed to supply NTPC in a 2004 international tender. Yet in 2006 the government rejected RIL's request to supply RNRL at that price, and instead determined in 2007 a formula that linked the gas price to that of crude oil. With crude oil prices well above $60 a barrel, the price of natural gas was set at $4.20. RNRL insisted on RIL fulfilling its obligation anyway. The majority judgment of the Supreme Court effectively overturns the Bombay High Court verdict of last June which substantially favoured RNRL. Holding that the private agreement between the two brothers is not legally binding on the two companies, the Supreme Court has asked the two parties to renegotiate the contract. The decision has wide-ranging ramifications for the investors of the two companies. On Friday, the stock markets reacted almost instantaneously marking up the price of RIL's shares while lowering that of RNRL. The judgment will set precedents in diverse areas including contracts and company law.
The most significant message from the judgment is the emphasis on the public ownership of all natural assets including hydrocarbon resources. Private parties, such as RIL in this case, are appointed to exploit the natural resources for the common good. From this assertion, it follows that the production-sharing contracts, entered into by the government with the contractor overrides everything else. Under the contract, the government alone can decide who the contractor should sell the gas to and at what price. In no other comparable sector has the government appropriated, let alone exercised, so much power. Thus far the public policy on pricing and utilisation of natural gas has been ad hoc, opaque, and at times whimsical. Uncertainty over the government policies has dampened investor interest in the last couple of bidding rounds under the New Exploration and Licensing Policy. The user-industries, such as power and fertilizer, have suffered because of the ad hocism in the gas policy. The last couple of rounds under NELP attracted very few big oil companies. It is hoped that, with this welcome nudge from the Supreme Court, the government will act quickly to remove the shortcomings in its policy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Far-going-judgment/article16299488.ece
11,5,2010,Figuring out Shahzad,"Precisely what led New York terror suspect Faisal Shahzad to try and set off a car-bomb in Times Square is not yet known. His journey from child of privilege to transnational jihadist was fuelled by the ideas of Yemen-based Islamist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, shaped by contacts with Jaish-e-Mohammad operatives in Karachi, and transformed into action by training and funds from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan. The stereotypical elements supposed to drive jihadists — poverty or indoctrination in madrasas — had no role in his life. The son of an affluent Pakistan Air Force officer, Shahzad studied in the United States before starting a reasonable career. Post-9/11, it has become clear that many young people from well-heeled backgrounds are being drawn to jihadist groups: Daniel Pearl's executioner Syed Omar Sheikh, British-born al-Qaeda operative Dhiren Barot, and Pakistani-American jihadist David Headley were all products of western affluence. Last year alone, the U.S. faced over a dozen jihadist attacks initiated by American nationals. Many citizens of European states are also known to be fighting alongside the Taliban and its Islamist allies.
Why is the diasporic jihadist threat growing? Pakistan's reluctance to dismantle the infrastructure of jihadist groups — set up, in the main, as instruments of the state against India — is one reason. Would-be jihadists in the West now have ready access to training and funds. There is also a second, deeper, problem. More than a decade ago, Hanif Kureishi explored the cultural tensions that underpin western Islamism in his novella, My Son, The Fanatic. Kureishi's story centres on the problematic relationship between Pakistan-born Briton Pervez, for whom Great Britain represents unlimited opportunity, and his son, Farid. The young man rebels against his father's search for upward mobility, arguing that the West is “a sink of hypocrites, adulterers, homosexuals, drug takers and prostitutes.” Many diasporic jihadists are driven less by theology than by rage against the societies around them. Researchers have found this rage to be made up of an inchoate mix of political discontent, cultural dislocation, and even sexual anxieties. Unfortunately, hundreds of young diaspora Indians, among them Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh, have been drawn to the diverse fundamentalisms of the homeland their parents left. The seduction of young people by extremists reflects the failure of immigrant communities and political institutions to tackle the problem at its roots. Politicians, community leaders, and intellectuals must work together to marginalise the extremists in their fold and intervene at various levels to counter the dangerous trend.

11,5,2010,Treating kidney disease,"ndia has a staggering burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Unfortunately for the vast majority of patients who progress to the end stage, the consequence is fatal renal failure. There is a strong case rapidly to scale up facilities for free or highly-subsidised dialysis because this therapy can cost a prohibitive Rs. 300,000 a year. Access to dialysis is crucial, since kidney transplants are available only to a small minority who can find a legal donor and afford the costs. But the major challenge lies at the public health policy level. Can governments prevent people with early CKD from developing renal failure? The good news is that they can — at relatively low cost. Fresh evidence indicates that a simple medical protocol can prevent most patients with compromised kidney function from developing end-stage disease early. Distinguished nephrologist M. Krishna Mani reports in his paper titled “Treating Renal Disease in India's Poor: The Art of the Possible” published by Seminars in Nephrology, January 2010, that a 15-year study of patients with chronic kidney disease from 1993 shows the potential for a remarkable extension of lifespan using the protocol. Compared with patients who were not part of the regimen, the treatment extended life by even 17 years. At the heart of the protocol is the reduction of the rate of decline in renal function using drugs classified as Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers.
The data from Dr. Mani's unit strengthen the trend of positive outcomes achieved in pilot programmes of the International Society of Nephrology Commission for the Global Advancement of Nephrology that followed the same strategy. These interventions provide key pointers for public health policy. The most important is obviously the need for a population-level programme of annual testing to detect diabetes and hypertension. Treating both conditions with lifestyle modification (such as dietary controls and exercise) and medication is essential to prevent kidney damage (and related cardiovascular disease). For those who have impaired renal function — measured by the presence of protein in urine and a threshold value for the kidney's filtration capacity — the treatment protocol must follow. Affordable generic drugs reduce further damage to kidney filters from elevated blood pressure and protein loss. The value of such prevention is inestimable, because only about one per cent of patients with end-stage renal disease in India can afford treatment. Moreover, there is just one nephrologist for every 1.6 million Indians. The kidney is a silent organ, but ignoring it can lead to disastrous consequences.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Treating-kidney-disease/article16299744.ece
12,5,2010,Check on arbitrariness,"The recent Supreme Court judgment falls short of guaranteeing Governors security of tenure but will have the salutary effect of discouraging their removal from office on political or subjective grounds. The five-member Constitution Bench, which heard a writ petition challenging the dismissal of four Governors after the United Progressive Alliance government assumed office in 2004, held that the removal of a Governor is open to judicial review “if the aggrieved person is able to demonstrate prima facie that his removal was either arbitrary, mala fide, capricious or whimsical.” In a way, the court has staked out a middle ground. While it has rejected the petitioner's contention that Governors may be removed only for compelling reasons such as physical or mental disability and acts of corruption, it has also refused to accept that the power of dismissal by the President under Article 156 (1) of the Constitution is absolute and unfettered. While the reasons for removal need not be spelt out, there must exist “valid reasons”; these would vary depending on the “facts and circumstances” of each case. While desisting from enumerating the valid reasons and grounds for dismissal, the court has clearly stated that being “out of sync with the policies and ideologies of the Union government or party in power at the Centre” is not one of them.
At a practical level, the issue of the dismissal of Governors is closely tied up with the nature of their appointment. Politicians and retired bureaucrats close to those in power are favoured choices for the post — a practice that tends to erode independence and impartiality. The Supreme Court may hold that Governors are neither employees nor agents of the central government but in practice many of them do behave like agents. The Sarkaria Commission recommended that apart from being eminent in some walk of life, a Governor should not have taken too great a part in politics, particularly in the recent past. The spirit of the latest judgment, which cites various recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission and the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution, is to press for a measure of security of tenure to gubernatorial office. But the Supreme Court rightly points out that it is for the legislature to consider such recommendations; as a court of law, its powers are limited, in this context, to examining the issue of removing Governors in the light of Article 156. It is doubtful that this judgment will put a stop to the arbitrary removal of Governor. But it will certainly make the central government think twice before exercising a power that has so often been misused.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Check-on-arbitrariness/article16258102.ece
12,5,2010,Environmental catastrophe,"The explosion that destroyed the offshore oilrig, Deepwater Horizon, at a well owned by British Petroleum in the Gulf of Mexico has been an environmental catastrophe. A surge of gas and oil burst through safety valves and exploded, killing 11 of the 126 crew on April 20. The rig, owned by the BP contractor, Transocean, and partly equipped by Halliburton, then sank on to the well-head itself and is at a depth of about 1,500 metres. Current estimates are that 210,000 gallons of oil are flowing into the ocean every day. All attempts to cap the well have so far failed. A relief well to intercept the damaged one would take about three months to drill. The technicalities are extremely challenging, as only robot submarines can do work at these depths. The oil spill will cause the extensive death of marine and related wildlife, and could seriously harm the entire coastal economy of Louisiana, Alabama, and Florida, as well as parts of Texas. Oil that strikes the coastline could enter the food chain through the vegetation. Recovery from this huge setback will take years.
The catastrophe is also changing the political climate. There is rising public anger against the oil industry and a widespread demand for federal government action. BP's initial evasiveness was a repetition of its conduct over the 1989 stranding of the oil tanker Exxon Valdez in Alaskan waters. Then, 10.8 million gallons of oil were spilt and investigators later found that BP had neither the rubber booms (as it had claimed) so that the oil could be contained, nor the teams to deploy the booms. This time, some nine million gallons have already been spilt, and many people involved are speaking out. Some of the rig survivors have said they felt coerced by company officials to sign statements that they had not seen what happened. When in office, U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney, a former Halliburton executive, exempted the oil industry from using expensive safety switches. The Obama administration, however, is moving with commendable speed to bring the industry in line. BP will have to pay all costs, including those for U.S. Navy and Coastguard help; President Obama has suspended permission for new offshore drilling; and federal regulators are to inspect all relevant installations. Congress has drafted legislation to raise oil company liability from $75 million to $10 billion. Significantly, the American States most affected by this calamity have been governed, in recent years, by Republican leaders who have been ideologically committed to doing away with governmental regulation. Now the people living in these States are paying the price.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Environmental-catastrophe/article16300015.ece
13,5,2010,Tories win all round,"The inconclusive general election of May 6, 2010 has resulted in the first elected British coalition government since 1931 (a National Government was convened for World War II). The Conservatives, led by David Cameron, have reached agreement with Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats, and their combined strength in the House of Commons will give them an overall majority of 77 seats. The negotiations, which lasted five days, involved the LibDems in talks with both the Tories and Gordon Brown's defeated Labour Party. Mr. Cameron, the new Prime Minister, will have Mr. Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister; the Liberal Democrats are to get four other Cabinet posts and, at least, one junior ministership in each of 20 ministries. The coalition has decided on a fixed five-year term, a LibDem wish. Both parties have made other concessions. Mr. Cameron has dropped plans to cut the inheritance tax, and will take steps to raise the income tax threshold to £10,000 a year. Mr. Clegg accepts that there will be £6 billion of public spending cuts this year, but has won a commitment to making the House of Lords a mainly elected chamber.
The new government will face tensions over several issues, and both party leaders encounter internal dissent. The economy will clearly be Problem Number One. With a 2009-10 budget deficit at 10.9 per cent of GDP, there are likely to be sharp disagreements over where the cuts will fall, despite the Prime Minister's promise to protect frontline public services. Secondly, the Eurosceptic faction in the generally hard-Right Tory party is very suspicious of Mr. Clegg's openly pro-EU party, even though the coalition has ruled out any further transfer of domestic powers to the EU. Thirdly, centre-left opinion on the LibDem side may resist Conservative welfare reform plans, and in the U.K. domestic elections the party will probably lose a big chunk of ex-Labour voters for sharing power with the Conservatives. The new government's biggest constitutional problem, however, will be over the electoral system for general elections. The Tories have always opposed reforming the current Simple Majority system, but Mr. Cameron has agreed to a referendum on the Alternative Vote (AV) system. The LibDems' acceptance of this amounts to the abandonment of one of their greatest strengths, the demand for a fully proportional system, and Mr. Cameron has gained far more than he has conceded. This goes far beyond questions of a fair share of seats for all parties. A parliament that represented British public opinion with reasonable accuracy would never have allowed the illegal invasion of Iraq.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Tories-win-all-round/article16300308.ece
13,5,2010,One of the greats,"Viswanathan Anand showed tremendous character in winning his fourth world chess crown in a decade. The 40-year-old Indian genius won the most intense battle of his career against Bulgarian challenger Veselin Topalov in Sofia, significantly scoring his edge-of-the-seat victory with black pieces in the 12th and final game of the championship match. This sealed Anand's place in chess history — as the greatest non-Russian champion, after the legendary Bobby Fischer, ever to play the game. For one whose three previous world titles came in different formats, Tuesday's triumph only reinforced the belief that his universal style of play remains the most effective against opponents of different temperament and approach. In a glittering international career spanning more than two decades, Anand has evolved from a bright, talented boy to a battle-scarred veteran who can quickly adapt himself to any challenge and challengers. If his maiden world title in 2000 took the monkey off his back after he destroyed Spain's Alexei Shirov in one of the shortest title-clashes, the triumph in a classy eight-man field in 2007 underlined his determination to end a seven-year wait and regain the title. The purists, mostly from the erstwhile Soviet Union, believed that the true sign of a world chess champion was his ability to win a title match, comprising a stipulated number of games. In 2008, Anand won their admiration by beating a previously unbeaten Russian, Vladimir Kramnik, with a game to spare.
Anand's latest triumph should rate a notch higher considering the challenges he had to overcome on and off the board before and during the match. Stranded at the Frankfurt airport following the cancellation of flights after volcanic ash descended over Europe, he travelled 40 hours by road to reach Sofia. After the schedule of games was pushed back merely by a day, he was off to the worst possible start, losing the opener rather listlessly. The setback steeled his resolve; he hit back in the second game and took the lead after a majestic victory in the fourth. Thereafter, both players had their chances in turn but it was Topalov who managed to capitalise on the champion's late error in the eighth game to draw level. Anand could have taken the lead again but missed a winning continuation in the drawn-out ninth game. After two more closely fought draws, the challenger pressed a little too hard with white pieces in the final game and the champion was quick to make him pay. As is his wont, Anand valued the “relief” of keeping the title more than the €1.2 million that came with it. A true world champion who has made it completely on his own, he is the pride of India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/One-of-the-greats/article16300309.ece
17,5,2010,Making it work this time,"A significant and welcome outcome of the talks between the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan in Thimphu was that the two Foreign Ministers would meet in Islamabad on July 15. The Ministers have been tasked with making efforts to bridge the “trust deficit” in order to pave the way for a full-scale dialogue on all issues. The two sides would do well to scale down public expectations of this meeting. For too long, India-Pakistan relations have been held hostage to media-hyped prospects of ‘breakthrough' and ‘setback.' In India, there is the expectation that every encounter with Pakistan at the table must yield the Jamat-ud-dawa chief Hafiz Saeed. In Pakistan, unless a meeting gets its teeth into the Kashmir dispute, or at least the river waters issue, it is deemed to have ended in failure. Given the background, the two sides have sensibly lowered the pressure of public expectations this time. Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has spoken of not expecting “miracles overnight” while External Affairs Minister S. M. Krishna has wisely refrained from listing out any demand. This does not imply that the factors that created the trust deficit have been brought under control. But it could mean the two sides have realised the value of restraint over rhetoric. Hopefully, this spirit will hold over the two-month-long wait for the ministerial talks.
But the timeline does give both countries an opportunity to do some constructive spadework ahead of the meeting. Two months seem time enough for Islamabad to figure out how to address sincerely Indian concerns on the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks. It is to be hoped that the arrest of Pakistan-born Faisal Shehzad for the attempted bombing of Times Square in New York and his links with militants in his home country, has given rise to some introspection among Rawalpindi's Who's Who. The reported remark by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that Pakistan would have faced “severe consequences” had the bomb gone off has since been clarified by her and others. No doubt, New Delhi feels vindicated by President Barack Obama's recent remark that the main threat to Pakistan was not India — but terrorism emanating from within. But the joy over this has to be accompanied by some serious thought on how the Pakistani perceptions and misperceptions about India can be reasonably addressed. Afghanistan is one sensitive issue on which the government needs to clear the air with Pakistan. This newspaper has consistently advocated Indian engagement and dialoguing with Pakistan without laying down preconditions. Agreeing to talk at a high political level represents real progress but it is the relatively easy part of the challenge that lies ahead.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Making-it-work-this-time/article16301288.ece
17,5,2010,Missing the big picture,"There is a sense of deja vu in the way the budget exercise ended recently with the adoption by Parliament of the Finance Bill. Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee announced concessions with a monetary value of nearly Rs.400 crore, while moving the official amendments to the budget. Over the years, the concessions announced have typically been very small in relation to the overall size of the budget. Mr. Mukherjee has not departed from the practice of tinkering at the margin without offering substantial reliefs. More significant, perhaps, is that the Bill was passed without much of a debate, as it has happened on many occasions earlier. The Budget is much more than a financial statement of government income and expenditure. In recent years, it has become the most significant economic policy statement and deserves more intense scrutiny by Parliament. Besides, parliamentary debates on the Finance Bill can serve the salutary purpose of educating the public at large. It goes without saying that increased public awareness will lead to a more informed criticism of official policies, thereby enhancing their value.
The recurrent feature of getting the Finance Bill passed without meaningful debates over its provisions has led to a situation where the big picture is often lost sight of. The tax concessions offered this time involve many small changes in the way some taxes are to be calculated and exemptions given. By adding to the clutter, they work against the cherished medium-term goal of simplifying the tax regime, whose two important characteristics are uniform tax rates and very few exemptions. Also, the Indian tax policy has become extremely complicated because it seeks to achieve multiple objectives, including some that are quite unique. While all countries use their tax systems to accelerate investments, encourage savings, and promote exports, India is probably among the few that rely on their tax policies to further objectives such as industrialisation of backward areas, promotion of small-scale industries, and development of infrastructure. All these are without doubt important policy objectives but seeking to achieve them through incentives such as lower taxes and larger exemptions goes against the grain of tax reform. With two major tax reform measures — the direct tax code and the goods and services tax — scheduled for implementation next year, the least the government could have done was to articulate the need to address some of the likely obstacles to their implementation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Missing-the-big-picture/article16301282.ece
18,5,2010,Hydrocarbon diplomacy,"While nuclear power and non-conventional energy from the sun, wind, and other as yet untested sources will be an essential part of India's energy security in the long run, there is no getting away from the fact that the short and medium term is going to be dominated by oil and gas. Despite some onshore oil finds and the promise of major flows of natural gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin, the country remains dependent on overseas producers for the bulk of its hydrocarbon needs. While the acquisition of oil and gas assets abroad has been an article of faith, India's efforts in this direction have been plagued by stiff competition from other global players, official indifference, and plain bad luck. Despite political goodwill, the country has not managed a major breakthrough in Russia. Energy relations with Iran remain fraught in the face of the threat of international sanctions. In Angola, Nigeria, and other oil-rich African nations, India seems unable to offer the sort of inducements Chinese companies manage with their larger foreign exchange reserves and flexible business practices. Likewise, big energy deals remain elusive in Central Asia. Even the initial efforts made to develop pan-Asian energy cooperation during 2004-05 have not been followed up. Despite heady talk of pipeline grids stretching from Turkmenistan and Iran to Myanmar and China, not one cubic foot of gas has crossed our land border so far.
Seen against this backdrop, the involvement of Indian companies in the Venezuela's Carabobo heavy oil project is good news indeed. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has long sought greater Indian involvement in his country's energy sector as a way of lessening its dependence on the United States and encouraging South-South cooperation. Last week, ONGC Videsh Ltd, IOC, and Oil India Limited committed themselves to investing more than $2 billion for their 18 per cent stake in the project that is expected to give India 3.6 million tonnes of crude a year. Venezuela's state oil company will own 60 per cent of the stakes, with the balance held by the Malaysian and Spanish national oil companies. Closer home, Indian companies are keen to make a big play in Iran, where the field is wide open, provided New Delhi is prepared to support them. Given the capital outlay required and the uncertainty over prices and politics, energy investments involving overseas partners will not be free from risk. The Manmohan Singh government is willing to gamble on nuclear cooperation with the U.S. despite glaring differences with Washington over how the bilateral agreement is to be interpreted. Surely, it can afford to be bolder in its hydrocarbon diplomacy, given the country's immediate energy requirements.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Hydrocarbon-diplomacy/article16301537.ece
18,5,2010,"Another Aquino, another chance","Senator Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino of the Liberal Party is heading for a resounding victory in the Philippine presidential election. On a turnout estimated at 75 per cent of the 50-million strong electorate, Mr. Aquino has a 15 percentage point lead over his nearest rival, former president Joseph Estrada of the Force of the Filipino Masses party (PMP), with about five million votes yet to be counted. The national Congress will announce the final results when it convenes at the end of May. The election itself was notable for two main reasons. First, severe pre-election political violence, the worst of which saw 57 people murdered in a single attack, did not escalate during the poll. On the day, incidents were only sporadic, though up to 14 lives were lost. Secondly, while there was some vote-buying, the electoral process was made more secure by electronic voting for all the 17,000 posts contested at a wide range of levels; with very few technical hitches, voters themselves fed their completed ballot papers into a scanner for direct transmission to a central server in Manila. Overall, public confidence in the system is higher.
The President-elect faces formidable challenges. The first is a culture of rampant corruption. This has been greatly exacerbated during the nine-year term of outgoing President Macapagal-Arroyo, who has appointed an ally as Chief Justice, presumably to obstruct future investigation into her conduct. Secondly, the budget deficit has ballooned as the economy slid and the worldwide depression hit remittances from Filipinos working abroad. Thirdly, the U.S. will almost certainly resist a reassessment of the Visiting Forces Agreement, whereby Philippines-based U.S. service personnel on criminal charges are held in American custody. The Obama administration will also be hostile to changes in the semi-permanent status of the U.S. forces, which are helping to counter radical Islamist insurgents on Mindanao. Furthermore, political inexperience itself may be a drawback for Mr. Aquino, as it was for his mother, Corazon Aquino, during her presidency in the 1980s. The new leader, however, has been given a mandate to crack down on corruption and tax fraud, and thereby help the public finances. He can be expected to put relations between Manila and Washington on a more equal footing. The hope is that he can achieve those aims, which are badly needed by a country once seen as a potential economic rival even to Japan.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Another-Aquino-another-chance/article16301536.ece
19,5,2010,Lessons from Dantewada-2,"“I have consistently held,” Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in September 2009, “that in many ways, left-wing extremism poses perhaps the gravest internal security threat our country faces.” Monday's massacre of more than 30 people in Dantewada in Chhattisgarh was a horrific case in point. It has also demonstrated that India's response to the challenge is deeply flawed. For at least the last two years, Maoist insurgents have been preparing for what they knew to be an inevitable assault on their heartlands by government forces. Key roads were heavily mined; ambushes planned; traps prepared. The 58 battalions of central forces hastily deployed to strengthen under-manned, poorly trained, and outgunned police found themselves reduced to protecting their lines of communications and logistical infrastructure against a well-entrenched adversary. The New Delhi-based Institute for Conflict Management estimates that, despite the surge of forces, just 294 insurgents were killed in 2009, against 214 in 2008, and that for the loss of 312 security force personnel, up by 50 per cent from the previous year. It is clear that simply pumping in more forces will achieve little. Knee-jerk use of military resources will create more problems than they will solve.
In his September 2009 speech, Dr. Singh opined that the Maoist threat could not be “treated simply as a law and order problem.” In a recent study, the Planning Commission found that just 7.5 per cent of residents of 33 districts hit by Maoist violence had access to safe drinking water; and less than 15 per cent had electricity. Decades of injustice and exploitation created the socio-political conditions in which the insurgents have thrived — and Maoists have ensured that efforts to drain this swamp have been stillborn. In 2008, 25 school buildings were destroyed by insurgents; that number went up to 71 in 2009. More than a hundred rural infrastructure assets like roads and culverts were destroyed last year, three times as many as in 2008. In Chhattisgarh alone, at least 71 State highways have been rendered unusable. Large-scale extortion and violence has scared away the teachers, doctors, and administrators who must spearhead change. Political opponents of the Maoists have been slaughtered, LTTE-style. But the situation is not hopeless. Governments must demonstrate their credibility by getting serious about development in relatively safe areas around those controlled by Maoists. They must work with democratic political groups to ensure that communities get a just share of the revenues from the mining and industrial projects being executed on their lands. They must scrupulously abide by the rule of law. And the Union Home Ministry must seek honest counsel from the many Indian counter-insurgency experts who have been warning of the flaws in its counter-Maoist campaign. Democratic India's long-term success against the armed extremists lies in abandoning unsuccessful strategies — and learning the right lessons from failure.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Lessons-from-Dantewada-2/article14785517.ece
19,5,2010,Better protection for monuments,"Will the recent amendments to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act lead to better protection of notified monuments? While the 1958 law had measures to prevent vandalism of the monuments, it hardly anticipated the imminent danger posed by unregulated development around. It was only in 1992 that this issue was addressed through additional notification. Areas around the monument were delineated as prohibited zones within 100 metres and regulated zones within a further 200 metres. These measures did not deliver the desired results. Monuments went missing, encroachment continued, and unbridled developments severely affected many important sites. The amended law has enhanced the penal provisions — the maximum jail term has been raised from three months to two years and fine from Rs.5,000 to Rs.100,000. Further, a new monuments authority is to be established to oversee the implementation of the Act. These measures might make a difference for the better but they do not address the real challenge adequately.
The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which takes care of the centrally protected monuments, has commendable technical expertise. But it is poorly equipped to address the complexities of conservation. Its poor track record in implementing the rules testifies to this. Conservation policy in the United Kingdom demonstrates that protection of historical environments is best approached simultaneously at three levels — the region, the local area, and the site. This creative approach places conservation “at the heart of an effective planning system” (to quote from a White Paper on the subject), dovetails it with development plans, involves local communities in the endeavour, and ensures that all the relevant authorities share responsibility for implementation. As of now, the amended Indian Act would apply only to the 3,675 monuments that are protected by the ASI, leaving 700,000 unprotected heritage structures out in the cold. This major deficiency needs to be urgently addressed so that non-designated archaeological sites and other heritage structures are offered protection. The State governments, which administer about 3,500 additional monuments, must also put in place supportive systems to ensure better protection of monuments.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Better-protection-for-monuments/article16301796.ece
20,5,2010,"Diplomacy, not sanctions","The agreement brokered on Monday by Brazil and Turkey was a slap in the face of the United States and its allies who have been arguing for some time now that diplomacy has no role to play in resolving the Iranian nuclear issue. Under the terms of the deal, Iran would send 1,200 kg of low enriched uranium to Turkey within one month of the ‘Vienna Group' — the U.S., Russia, France, and the International Atomic Energy Agency — signalling its acceptance of the plan. The Iranian low-enriched uranium (LEU) would be held in Turkish escrow for a year, at the end of which Russia and France would hand over 120 kg of uranium enriched to 19.75 per cent in the form of fuel rods suitable for use in the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR). By itself, the agreement and its successful implementation would not bring an end to the nuclear dispute between Iran and the West. But it is an important confidence-building measure that demonstrates the importance of dialogue. Had the Obama administration chosen to engage with Iran over the TRR proposal, the current formula could have been finalised in 2009. Instead, Washington wasted precious months insisting that the Vienna Group's initial offer, under which Iran would send its LEU directly to Russia and France for enrichment, could not be modified in any way.
For the U.S., the attractiveness of the original TRR fuel swap idea lay in the fact that the LEU, which Tehran could theoretically enrich to bomb grade should it decide to ‘break out' of the NPT, would no longer be available. This would still be the case under the Brazil-Turkey proposal. Because of the West's foot-dragging and the global shortage of medical isotopes, Iran declared earlier this year that it would go ahead and enrich its LEU to the level needed for the TRR. Acceptance of the latest proposal should lead to Iran suspending that initiative, pending completion of the swap. Instead of pursuing this constructive route, the U.S. has virtually repudiated the deal by pushing for tighter sanctions at the U.N. Security Council. Russia and China may feel the new proposal doesn't go far enough. But the sanctions route makes no sense in this case; it only complicates efforts for a more comprehensive, dialogue-based approach to the problem. It is a pity that India, which has a big stake in the maintenance of peace and security in the region, has been reduced to watching the action from the sidelines. It knows sanctions are counterproductive and has spoken out against them. It must now add teeth to its opposition by supporting Brazil and Turkey and offering to join them in their quest for a negotiated end to the nuclear standoff.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Diplomacy-not-sanctions/article16301984.ece
20,5,2010,Fulfilment at last,"After spending 35 years in pursuit of a world title, England found fulfilment in Barbados. And Paul Collingwood's men did it with a vitality of style not always associated with English sides of the past, dominating Australia in the final of the World Twenty20 and winning their maiden global limited-overs tournament. England's triumph was a testament to the benefits of brave, forceful cricket. Consider that seven members of England's victorious team appeared in last year's World Twenty20 in which the side played with the safety-first attitude so characteristic of it in major tournaments, and you get a sense of the remarkable transformation coach Andy Flower has wrought. The result of hundreds of hours of smart, directed training behind the scenes was a cohesive squad that had balance and variety in batting and bowling and a previously unattained level of athleticism in fielding. As Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara said during the Super Eights, England was not only a deeper and more powerful batting unit but also a well-rounded bowling attack with no obvious weakness. Collingwood led with uncommon assurance and the team responded to its captain's attacking instincts by playing without the fear of failure — such an important part of courting success on the big stage.
What will the triumph mean for English cricket? Former England captain Michael Vaughan's suggestion that this was better than the Ashes victory of 2009 drew ridicule from other experts. Michael Atherton, another former England captain, responded with the observation that the victory, while significant, wouldn't go down in English folklore: widespread recognition that Twenty20 is not the pinnacle of the game and awareness that Collingwood's team is not representative of the health of the English game in general — Michael Lumb, Craig Kieswetter, Eoin Morgan, and Kevin Pietersen learnt their cricket elsewhere — would ensure as much. Yet there is a lot about England's campaign that offers hope. The Australians, as they showed again in the semifinal against Pakistan, are fearsome in big games; the resistance has to be beaten out of them. England found the resolve required for this endeavour. Off-spinner Graeme Swann confirmed his command of his craft in all forms of the game, Kevin Pietersen rediscovered the touch that saw him heralded as the Next Big Thing, and Eoin Morgan proved he had the intelligence and innovation to orchestrate the middle order. But most of all, England looked like it belonged at the top table where, often in the past, in major tournaments it appeared content to slink away after putting in a token appearance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Fulfilment-at-last/article16301985.ece
21,5,2010,The spectrum bonanza,"The auction of spectrum for the third generation (3G) mobile telephone services has been remarkable in many ways. The most obvious is the sum of money the government will get from the seven successful bidders and the two public sector entities, which will pay the auction-set price for spectrum preferentially assigned to them many months ago. The figure of Rs. 67,718 crore is well above the most optimistic of estimates either the government or industry had made — and it just goes to show why the auction is the best method of determining who should be granted a licence to use a public good such as the airwaves and at what price. This is virtually ten times the amount for which the government granted two years ago the licences for the second generation (2G) services on a ‘first-come-first-served' basis. Opponents of that exercise will now feel strongly vindicated. The second interesting aspect of the exercise is the wide regional disparity in the winning bids: New Delhi and Mumbai circles are worth a hundred times as much as Jammu and Kashmir or the North East circles. The assessment of the bidders may have been coloured by the unstable political conditions in those two regions, but the wide skew in economic potential across various other parts of the country, as reflected in the bid amounts, is a matter of concern.
While no single company has won in all circles, it has come as no surprise that the well-entrenched among the current service providers weighed in with the biggest bids and won in a majority of the circles. What that means is that most mobile users, once they upgrade their instruments, can expect their own service provider to give them the data-rich 3G service too in their home town. But can they expect the companies to keep the 3G service affordable after having offered these unexpectedly large sums for spectrum? The companies simply have no choice. The price benchmarks have already been set by the public sector BSNL and MTNL, which have deployed their 3G services for some months now, and by Reliance Communications and Tata Indicom that have repurposed their existing CDMA spectrum to provide a high-speed data service. If at all, the tariff will move down, and that would be a necessary condition for this premium market, which is currently not even 10 per cent of the total, to expand. And if it does move down, the mobile service could do for Internet penetration in this country, now at no more than 60 million users, what the cellular device did to phone communication, expanding in just 15 years from zero to over 500 million users. That would be an immensely larger bonanza for the country than what the government won at the auction.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-spectrum-bonanza/article16302261.ece
21,5,2010,Turtles in trouble,"Just seven species make up the known diversity of the world's sea turtles today, but these evolutionary marvels are encountering a growing number of threats. The marine reptiles, all of them endangered, have persisted for millions of years, moving from the sea to land for nesting, and traversing the great tropical and sub-tropical ocean basins as part of their life cycles. Yet, as the 30th Annual Symposium on Sea Turtle Biology and Conservation held recently in Goa has highlighted, the modern human-dominated era poses grave challenges for their survival. With each passing year, nesting habitat is degraded or lost, feeding grounds are polluted, more turtles die in mechanised fisheries, and the threat of mindless port development looms large. Two environmental crises in the past few weeks highlight the dangers. The large oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has turned the major feeding grounds of the rare Kemp's Ridley turtle into a veritable death zone. In South Asia, which hosts five species, thousands of Olive Ridleys making their annual journey to Orissa's Rushikulya rookery for nesting had to suffer the effects of a massive oil leak from a ship in the Ganjam port. If a healthy population of turtles must survive into the future, there is a need for a new conservation paradigm.
The first-order priority is to identify and protect the nesting habitat of sea turtles on the Indian coastline. This can be achieved through a full environmental audit of all port projects. If the proposals discussed at the Goa symposium are accurate, no fewer than 331 ports are planned, and notifications have been issued for over 200. The scale of coastal development warrants an aggressive conservationist stance on the part of the Ministry of Environment and Forests. To its credit, the MoEF has supported the International Sea Turtle Society in organising the global symposium, for the first time in the country. It must now strike a blow for protection by enforcing environmental norms. For a start, it can declare the ‘no development zone' of 10 kilometres around turtle nesting beaches, and the 25-km buffer zone that conservation biologists suggest. This needs to cover all new port projects and the expansion of existing ones. A second priority relates to fisheries. While artisanal low-intensity fishing in sensitive zones does not appear to be unsustainable, the catchall ferocity of mechanised boats is killing vast numbers of turtles. A regime of restrictions is, therefore, justified. This should set seasonal curbs for intensive commercial fishing, enforce regulations on turtle excluder devices, and control trawler density. Only determined measures can save these wonderful creatures.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Turtles-in-trouble/article16302258.ece
22,5,2010,How not to end a stand-off,"A deadly crackdown by the Army on the anti-government Red Shirts may have cleared Bangkok of protesters but a long season of political discontent, unrest, and conflict is in store for Thailand. Some of that was foreshadowed in violence that gripped the capital and swiftly spread to parts of the hinterland following the Army action. The brutal end to the 45-day-long stand-off, in which protesters were demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and the holding of fresh elections, will fuel anger and bitterness among those who think the present government took office by illegitimate means. It will increase the political polarisation between the anti-Abhisit and pro-government forces. The Red Shirts will not give up efforts to dislodge the government; and the government will forcefully resist such attempts. The forecast need not have been so gloomy because there were at least two opportunities for ending the impasse. Unfortunately, both sides failed to seize them. More than 60 people died in clashes between the Red Shirts and security forces during the two major bouts of violence in recent weeks. Many of them would have been alive today had it not been for the bull-headed rejection by the Red Shirts of Prime Minister Abhisit's offer to hold an election in November, a year ahead of schedule. The protesters first wanted the government to hold a senior member of the cabinet accountable for the first round of violence in April. A second round erupted in mid-May. But an end to the crisis seemed possible even three days earlier when the Red Shirt leadership offered talks. Clearly, the hardliners in both camps worked against a compromise.
The Thai government blames Thaksin Shinawatra, the Prime Minister who was deposed in a 2006 coup and now lives abroad in self-exile, for bankrolling the protests. It holds him responsible for the crisis and the violence. Sections of the Red Shirts are allied to the fugitive leader who they feel was wrongfully ousted, but there is also no escaping the fact that the protests have symbolised a deeper discontent. Most of the people at the protest campsite in Bangkok came from the economically backward and neglected rural areas that want a say in how the country should be governed. No road map for national reconciliation can succeed unless its takes into account their demand for a democracy that empowers the entire nation, and not just a ruling elite backed by the military and the royalists. The still unfolding crisis offers crucial lessons in politics and governance for the region and beyond, and warns of the consequences of state failure to address inequity and deprivation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/How-not-to-end-a-stand-off/article16302522.ece
22,5,2010,Path-breaking issue,"Standard Chartered Bank's forthcoming issue of Indian Depository Receipts (IDRs) will be widely watched not just because it is the first of its kind. Its success — defined in terms of a range of parameters, of which the extent of subscription is just one — will prompt other well-established global companies to tap the Indian market and mobilise rupee resources. The IDRs are very much like American Depository Receipts (ADRs) or Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) in the way they are structured and regulated. Like them, the IDRs are created by a domestic depository against the underlying equity shares of a foreign company. The major difference of course is that they are denominated in rupees and issued by a foreign company, whose shares are listed in the country where it is incorporated. Also, it should have a track record of profitability and net worth of at least $50 million. Issued through public offerings, the IDRs are bound by the core rules and regulations prescribed by the market regulator, SEBI. The benefit to domestic investors is that they can trade in shares of well-known companies that are listed abroad.
In India, it has taken nearly six years — since the notification of the regulatory rules — for the first IDR issue to materialise. Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) has a long and well established presence in India and its familiarity and assessment of the domestic financial markets would have been the principal factors behind its pioneering role. There are other banks and companies with similar exposures to India and, for now, they prefer to wait and watch. It may seem fanciful now, but the expectation is that over the medium-term at least India will emerge as a major reservoir of capital that will attract resource-hungry corporates from around the world. For that to happen, Indian financial markets will have to integrate more with their global counterparts, through, for instance, a fuller convertibility of the rupee. However welcome that might be from the point of view of global markets, recent experiences have vindicated the Reserve Bank of India's measured approach to capital account convertibility. The SCB has said that the resources from the IDR issue will be used to beef up its capital adequacy. Such considerations are sure to weigh with prospective issuers, who might also seek to enhance their brand image through a listing in an important market. It is possible to reserve a portion of the IDR issue for employees, thereby boosting their morale. Finally, the resources garnered through an IDR can be utilised for acquiring companies in India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Path-breaking-issue/article16302525.ece
23,5,2010,Lessons from the tragedy,"There are few tragedies more heart-rending than a major plane crash. The Hindu expresses its deep solidarity with the families of the 158 men, women, and children who died in India's worst aviation disaster in a decade. Preliminary reports indicate that Air India Express's Boeing Flight IX-812 from Dubai could have landed safely at Mangalore's admittedly tricky ‘tabletop' runway had the experienced expatriate pilot not landed too far down the 2,450 metre runway, with the result that the Boeing 737-800 crashed through the perimeter wall at high speed and plunged into the woods below, breaking in two and bursting into flames. Under the circumstances, the survival of eight passengers was nothing short of a miracle. Preliminary reports also indicate that the weather was fine for the approach; it was not a wet runway; there was no problem with the aircraft; and visibility was good. But in all fairness, there should be no rush to judgment, especially by laypersons on technical matters on which experts are still unclear. The Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and the Flight Data Recorder (FDR), which have been recovered, should help the inquiry figure out what went calamitously wrong on Saturday morning.
India has a relatively good civil aviation safety record but experts have been expressing the view that safety standards have been slipping in recent years, and that corners are being cut. As an expert has pointed out in this newspaper, there have been a number of “close shaves” in the last few years, highlighting the fact “there is something seriously wrong with the system.” The very nature of the Mangalore crash raises serious questions that need to be addressed by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, the Airports Authority of India that manages the airports, and commercial airlines. Are the highest safety standards being complied with when it comes to location of airport, landing facilities, air traffic control, maintenance of aircraft and, above all, the quality and working conditions of pilots? Is commercially driven pilot fatigue on the rise, as the Indian Commercial Pilots Association alleges? It is understandable that under conditions of unfettered growth of the airline industry, airlines have been hiring foreign pilots. It is not that they cannot perform to Indian standards. But experts have been making the point that the DGCA needs to do a much better job of scrutinising the safety and training standards of commercial airlines (and enforcing, for example, directives on approach and landing) than it appears to be doing. The time has come to consider seriously the constitution of an independent air safety board and an independent regulator.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Lessons-from-the-tragedy/article16302920.ece
23,5,2010,Heading for synthetic life?,"A team of U.S. scientists has synthesised an entire bacterial genome and then produced living cells that relied on this genetic information. This was the first time a synthetic cell was made by starting with genetic data stored in a computer, declared Craig Venter who led the effort. His team has made major strides in recent years working on synthetic genomes. The Indian-born Nobel laureate, Har Gobind Khorana, carried out the first gene synthesis in the late 1970s. It involved stringing together some 200 bases, the chemical units that produce the four ‘letters' of the genetic code. By 2002, scientists in New York were able to produce infectious polioviruses from synthetic DNA about 7,500 bases long. The Venter team has now demonstrated the feasibility of assembling a genome that is over one million bases in length. It was then able to get the synthetic genome to work in another bacterium. However, as the team discovered, a change in just one base in a crucial gene was sufficient to stop the synthetic genome from functioning in a living cell.
But it is quite a stretch to speak at this stage of the production of synthetic life. The synthetic genome was based on the naturally occurring genome of the bacterium Mycoplasma mycoides (with certain modifications). Moreover, the genome, in order to function, had to be put into a living cell, not one that was artificially created. Dr. Venter “has not created life, only mimicked it,” commented Nobel laureate David Baltimore. It is much more likely that synthetic genomes will be used in the coming years to generate novel gene combinations. Scientists have long been able to modify genomes by inserting and deleting genes. Genetically engineered Bt-cotton plants, for instance, carry genes taken from soil bacteria. Several genes have been introduced into a bacterium so that it can produce the precursor of the anti-malarial drug artemisinin. Dr. Venter and his colleagues say that in the long run it would be better to design the entire chromosome from scratch than to make changes one by one in the genome. His group is planning to build an entire algal genome in order to make super-productive organisms that could take in carbon dioxide and spew out hydrocarbons. Inevitably, a technological advance that appears to tamper with the foundations of life arouses disquiet. Concerns have been expressed over the possibility of the technique being misused to produce dangerous pathogens and the artificially engineered organisms escaping into the wild and contaminating the natural gene pool. Governments and society need to find ways of maintaining oversight so that benefits of the technology are harnessed and its abuse prevented.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Heading-for-synthetic-life/article16302921.ece
24,5,2010,"Drift, dissonance, disappointment","The first year of the second term of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government was undistinguished in approach as well as achievement. After being voted back in 2009 following a surprisingly robust first term, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his team seem to have spent the next 12 months in a do-little state bred by political complacency and neo-liberal conservatism. The very strengths of the government have turned out to be major weaknesses. Freed from dependence on external Left support, UPA-II showed a distinct lack of interest in pursuing the social democratic initiatives, including a few pro-poor programmes, that stood out during 2004-2009. With a full term seemingly guaranteed, the UPA behaved as if that was an end in itself and it was henceforth under no obligation to extend itself in fulfilment of its promises. After being pushed and pulled by allies and supporting parties during the previous five years, the Congress and its partners in government appeared happy to stand still or move about directionless in this new-found free space. With opposition from the Right spearheaded by the Bharatiya Janata Party and from the Left led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) weakened considerably, UPA-II thought it faced no threat within or outside Parliament — and was occasionally surprised by the vehemence of the protests on issues that matter.
The first avatar of the UPA had the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, the Forest Rights Act, the farm-loan waiver, and the Right to Information Act to count as social-democratic achievements. But under UPA-II, the employment guarantee programme, now known as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme, despite some strengthening and expansion, is caught in corruption and deficiencies in implementation. Forest dwellers and tribal people continue to wage a struggle to retain their land and livelihood sources in the face of government-backed demands from mining and industrial lobbies. Farmers and peasants are no closer to any long-term solution to their distress situation and debt-trap. The Right to Information Act is sought to be diluted to favour judges and bureaucrats and those in power. But the defining failure of UPA-II has been its utter inability to control the spiralling prices of essential commodities, above all food items. Recovery from the global economic slowdown has seen inflation climb steadily, but the government's response has been unbelievably inept. Futures and forward trading of agricultural commodities and the cut in fertilizer subsidies have worsened the situation. With the Public Distribution System in a shambles in many States, the poor have no insulation against inflation. Everything points to mass poverty and deprivations widening and deepening.
Another defining failure of UPA-II has been on the law and order front. Its anti-Maoist strategy has met with spectacular reverses — with the extremists scaling up their violence from hit-and-run attacks to carefully planned ambushes and landmine blasts. No coherent policy is in place to deal with what Dr. Singh has characterised as “perhaps the gravest internal security threat our country faces.” It is an open secret that the Cabinet is divided between pursuing a militaristic approach and paying lip service to the imperative need to address the socio-economic roots of the problem. While seeking to crush the armed insurgency through ill-conceived paramilitary offensives, the government has conspicuously failed to ensure that development in the affected regions is not a disguise for mining and industrial projects that alienate people from their lands. In this respect, UPA-II seems to be replicating the failings of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance governments between 1998 and 2004. The growth of the economy and enrichment of the well-off, and not reduction in economic disparities, seems to be the main concern of UPA-II.
Some of the lethargy and indecisiveness can be traced to the divisions within the UPA and within the Congress itself on major policy issues. On anti-Maoist strategy, Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram revealed the divisions within the Cabinet when he spoke of his “limited mandate” in dealing with the issue. On the RTI, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Singh are known to hold opposite views. Again, on the issue of caste enumeration in the Census, the Cabinet is divided and unable to proceed in a clear-headed manner. On relations with China, Union Minister of State for Environment Jairam Ramesh spoke out truthfully, if a little too candidly, against the Home Ministry being “overly defensive” in dealing with Chinese companies that wished to do business in India. While a public airing of differences within a government, especially a coalition regime, is not by itself problematic, failure to resolve these differences could have serious consequences in day-to-day decision-making on key issues.
Among the few positives for UPA-II is the clarity and purpose shown in certain areas of foreign policy. Ignoring hawks within his own government, Prime Minister Singh, ably supported by External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna, pushed for talks with Pakistan. In the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, India showed leadership and a willingness to work with countries such as China, Brazil, and South Africa. Although New Delhi often tailed Washington in foreign policy, as was seen in the case of Iran, it also showed a readiness to work in forums such as BRIC (Brazil-Russia-India-China) and IBSA (India-Brazil-South Africa). In domestic policy, the Right to Education Act, which seeks to provide free and compulsory education for children between six and 14 years, should count as a significant positive, even if the hard work needed for implementation, especially in the Hindi-speaking region, waits to be done. The passage of the Women's Reservation Bill in the Rajya Sabha could have been counted as a breakthrough were it not for the fact that there seems to be little prospect of the Bill making headway in the Lok Sabha.

25,5,2010,A new beginning?,"When the most high-profile corporate war in recent Indian business history shows signs of ending there ought to be a sense of relief all round. The five-year-old dispute between the Ambani brothers with its origins in “ownership issues” has hardly been like other disputes that have engulfed many traditional Indian business families. Part of the reason of course is that the two brothers, Mukesh and Anil, were in effect seeking to assume the mantle of their father, who had in a generation built from scratch India's most valuable business in terms of stock market valuation. The very size of the Reliance group and its diverse interests had made it difficult to split the group's business equitably, when a division became necessary. The agreement of 2006 was perhaps the most practical way to divide the Reliance empire but, by its very nature, it could not have been enduring. The elder brother took control of the flagship Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) with interests in petroleum, oil and gas exploration, and refining, while Anil's share included telecom, power, entertainment, and financial services. It was evident the division left Mukesh with the aces, even though it was argued that companies in the high-growth areas of telecom and financial services were under the fold of Anil. Four years on, Mukesh's RIL has a market cap of Rs.3,25,630 crore, several times higher than the combined valuation of the Anil Ambani group of companies.
A “non-compete” clause had been inserted into the 2006 agreement to ensure that one did not venture into the other's territory, but that only left both chafing at the bit. The agreement, always tenuous, received a body blow with the Supreme Court decisively overturning the gas-sharing clause and upholding the primacy of the state in the ownership and distribution of natural resources. It could well mean that RIL does not have the flexibility to allocate the gas it promised to Anil Ambani's Reliance Natural Resources Limited (RNRL). With legal options running out, the two parties have been forced to negotiate. Significantly, the non-compete clause has been discarded and the two groups say they will strive to work together in a spirit of collaboration. On the other hand, they have agreed that each can enter businesses previously reserved for the other, which to the cynics implies new arenas of potential conflict. The prospect of cooperation and collaboration between the two brothers has been welcomed by shareholders, who immediately expressed themselves by pushing up the share prices of Reliance group companies on a bleak day for the larger market. Yet given the past history, it is unwise to assume that the perceived benefits will automatically accrue.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-new-beginning/article16303408.ece
25,5,2010,"State elections, wider effects","The state assembly elections held recently in Germany's most populous province, North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), have been unusually important. The ruling coalition, led by Jürgen Rüttgers and comprising the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Free Democratic Party (FDP), was decisively voted out. With the voter turnout down from 63 to 59 per cent, CDU support fell from 44.8 per cent in 2005 to 34.6 per cent, though its partner's share improved from 6.2 to 6.7 per cent. The main opposition party, the impressive Hannelore Kraft's Social Democratic Party (SPD), won 34.5 per cent, which contrasts with its national slide in the 2009 general election. The SPD has not, however, won enough to form a government with its closest ideological neighbours, the Greens, who raised their share of the vote from 6.2 to 12.1 per cent. Talks between the Greens and the Left Party, the former communists, have failed, and the SPD has turned its back on both, by trying to form a grand coalition with the CDU. Each major party has 67 seats in the 181-seat assembly. The horse-trading continues.
The consequences seem to be far-reaching. First, the CDU-FDP federal coalition is sharply divided over the failure of Chancellor Angela Merkel's attempt to delay the bailout package for Greece until after the NRW election; the bailout, very unpopular with German voters, is being cited as one reason for the NRW defeat. Again with the election in mind, Ms Merkel delayed two schemes dear to the FDP — tax cuts and the replacement of the 7.9 per cent health insurance levy with a flat annual fee of 150 euros per person. Those plans are now stalled; the central coalition has lost its majority in the 69-seat Bundesrat, the membership of which is proportionally drawn from the provincial cabinets, and which must approve all legislation before it goes to the Bundestag, the federal parliament. Another major policy on indefinite hold following the provincial result is the renewal of Germany's ageing nuclear power stations. The Chancellor's political allies may criticise her for excessive pre-election caution, but the blockages their main policies now face are only part of the issue. The rest has to do with a new tone the NRW election may have introduced into Germany's overall political life. The CDU, well aware that the bulk of its support is in the centre, does not share the right-wing FDP's keenness for tax cuts; nor is it likely to regret the demise of the regressive flat-fee health impost. It is now steadily edging away from its partner, which could end up beached as the neoliberal tide ebbs in the global economic climate.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/State-elections-wider-effects/article16303406.ece
26,5,2010,Teenagers on Everest,"“I do not for a moment say”, wrote the British alpinist Clinton Dent in 1885, “that it would be wise to climb Mt. Everest, but I most firmly believe it is humanly possible to do so; and, further, I feel sure that even in our own time, perhaps, these views will receive material corroboration.” Not even in his wildest fantasies could Dent have imagined just how much corroboration his assertion would receive. Last week, 13-year-old Jordan Romero became the youngest ever to reach Everest's 8,848-metre summit. In fact, the boy has summited the highest mountains in six of the world's seven continents; he scaled Mt. Kilimanjaro when he was just nine. There is little doubt that teenagers like Romero, or India's own Arjun Vajpayee who reached the summit this summer a month shy of his 17th birthday, have pushed the frontiers of what has been considered humanly possible. Even as their triumphs are applauded, they have sparked off a debate on just what risks ought be permitted for boys and girls so young that most governments do not see them as fit to vote, marry, or even drive motor vehicles.
Since Edmund Hilary and Tenzing Norgay made history in 1953, many have given their lives in their attempts to reach the highest place on our planet. Data released in 2009 showed there were 216 deaths on the mountain; some 2,700 individuals have made successful ascents once or more. Better equipment has made mountain-climbing safer but even the best does not guarantee safety in the face of bad weather and lack of oxygen. Fifteen-year-old Temba Tseri, who held the record for the youngest Everest summiteer before Romero, lost five fingers during his climb. Adults have the right to take what risks they choose but can this apply to children? Last year, a court in the Netherlands barred Laura Dekker, born on September 20, 1995, from pursuing her dream of becoming the youngest to sail around the world solo (16-year-old Australian Jessica Watson now holds that record). After winning an appeal, Dekker plans to set sail in September — though, ironically, she won't be able to leave or return to a home port since Holland's laws do not allow individuals under 16 to captain boats longer than seven metres. Key to the debate is the question of how much risk is acceptable — and whether the decision to allow minors to take them should be governed by law or be left to parents. So while we marvel at the high-grade skills, the physical and mental courage, and the self-confidence of Romero and Vajpayee, we need to recognise that the ethical, social, and legal issues cannot be dodged: the lives of children, after all, ought not to be risked just for sport.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Teenagers-on-Everest/article16303685.ece
26,5,2010,Costa Rica at a crossroads,"Laura Chinchilla, the former Costa Rican vice-president and a political protégée of the legendary outgoing president Óscar Arias, took office recently to become the country's first ever woman president and Latin America's fifth in the last two decades. In February, she won a landslide victory for her centre-right National Liberation Party (PLN). Her closest rival, Ottón Solís of the centre-left Citizens Action Party (PAC), in fact conceded defeat with only quarter of the votes counted, as he trailed by 23 percentage points to 47 at the time. Costa Rica is one of the continent's most stable democracies. Since 1899, it has had only two very short periods of dictatorship; it even has no army, and in 1987 President Arias won the Nobel Peace Prize for a plan that ended a long period of brutal civil war in five other Central American states. Costa Rica also has regular rainfall, a strong ecotourism sector, and popular exports in the form of coffee, pineapples, and bananas, with newer industries such as microchip production also emerging. As a result, the population of 4.5 million enjoys the region's highest living standards, with a per capita income approaching $7,000.
President Chinchilla faces systemic and policy challenges. The existing social-democratic welfare system and public infrastructure are under pressure after long periods of allegedly cronyistic politics and physical neglect. Public perceptions of cronyism throughout the system may well have contributed to the severe fall in the Left vote, which took Mr. Solís to within two percentage points of the presidency in the 2006 elections. Other pressures have arisen from Costa Rica's accession to the US-dominated Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), under which several public sector activities have been opened to the private sector. The new President has said she would continue the privatisation process. CAFTA, however, faces strong opposition within the country, and Mr. Solís almost succeeded in getting it scrapped in 2007. Furthermore, Costa Rica has a low crime rate but unfortunately it is a transit country for an increasing volume of drug trafficking. Other sources of potential tension lie in Ms Chinchilla's own attitudes. A social conservative, she is opposed to abortion, to same-sex marriages, and to the separation of church and state. Costa Rican feminist groups doubt that she will make much difference to the overall position of women, despite the fact that women now hold 23 of the 57 parliamentary seats. Much will depend on President Chinchilla's capacity to negotiate and compromise. In a significant sense, Costa Rica stands at a crossroads.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Costa-Rica-at-a-crossroads/article16303684.ece
27,5,2010,End this blockade now,"The blockade of Manipur by Naga political forces making the demand for “Nagalim” is threatening to take the two sides towards a showdown the region can well do without. The demand for Greater Nagaland has been the cause of much tension, involving as it does Naga claims on territory in Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, and Assam. But the case of Manipur is unique. Nagaland controls access to the national highway that is Manipur's main link with the rest of India. Led by the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah), the Nagas have long exploited this geographical advantage to press the claim over four districts in Metei-majority Manipur through the politics of blockade. The present siege began on April 11 with the Manipur government's decision to hold Autonomous District Council elections, including in districts claimed by the Nagas. Given the confrontationist mood, it was strange that the central government gave permission to NSCN (I-M) leader Thuingaleng Muivah to visit his ancestral village in Manipur's Ukhrul district, without consulting the Ibobi government. Criminal cases are pending against Mr. Muivah in Manipur and New Delhi's instruction to the State government to provide security for the visit showed it had not thought this through. A similar unilateral decision declaring an extension of the ceasefire with the NSCN (I-M) to the four contentious districts in Manipur led to the 'Great Uprising' of June 18, 2001. Predictably, Manipur thwarted Mr. Muivah's journey with the use of force, leading to the death of two Naga students and the heightening of tensions.
The lack of urgency shown by New Delhi in the matter is beyond comprehension. The blockade has crippled life in the State, creating shortages of essentials, from fuel to medicines and food items. But efforts to end it are not apparent. The people of Manipur would be justified in asking if their State's location — at the farthest end of India — has played any role in shaping New Delhi's apathy. A blockade there does not affect the rest of the country. The central government cannot afford to let the present situation drift any longer without a resolution. Manipur is already one of the most troubled parts of the North-East on account of several insurgencies. New Delhi must act to dispel the impression that it is appeasing Mr. Muivah and Naga sentiments at the cost of other ethnic groups in the region. Just as there can be no question of conceding the NSCN (I-M)'s claim of “full sovereignty,” the demand for Nagalim, which carries destabilising implications for the region, must be ruled out of court.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/End-this-blockade-now/article16303973.ece
27,5,2010,More teeth to financial regulation,"In the aftermath of the economic crisis, there has been a virtual consensus that the financial sector regulatory regimes in the developed countries need a thorough overhaul. However, despite ample evidence to show that it was regulatory inadequacy more than anything else that caused the sub-prime crisis to morph into an unprecedented global economic crisis, attempts to revamp the regulatory regimes have taken time, especially in the United States. The financial sector in the U.S., never comfortable with the prospect of a greater regulatory oversight, has been lobbying hard to dilute any new legislative initiatives. Even its ardent supporters will concede that but for the huge bailouts by government — which temporarily brought some leading names under public ownership — and the record easing of interest rates, the mainline banking system would have not survived the crisis. The recent approval by the Senate of a far-reaching financial regulatory bill on top of the passage of a similar measure by the House of Representatives in December is therefore a landmark event that brings the Obama administration closer to approving a broad expansion of government oversight of the increasingly complex banking system and financial markets. The regulatory overhaul the new legislation will bring about is expected to be the most sweeping one in the post-Great Depression era. The role of the Federal Reserve will be considerably enhanced. Other regulators will get greater role clarity.
The new legislation seeks to check abuses in lending especially in the mortgage sector, and ensure that troubled companies, no matter how big or complex, can be liquidated at no cost to the taxpayers. Each and every financial product/service will be covered by it. Derivatives, so much at the centre of the last crisis, will henceforth be traded through recognised exchanges. A new consumer protection agency to oversee all financial products is to be created. Hedge funds and most other private equity players will be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Of direct interest to India is the proposal to create “a financial stability oversight council” to coordinate regulatory efforts to identify risks. The developments in the U.S. will be keenly watched throughout the world. To reduce regulatory shortcomings, it has been agreed by the G20 countries, among others, that there will be global coordination but national actions. The U.S. president hopes that the new legislation will ensure greater accountability and responsibility on the part of the regulators and the government. That is an outcome every government will wish for.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/More-teeth-to-financial-regulation/article16303971.ece
2,6,2010,The enemy within,"The massacre by terrorists in Lahore last week followed by a raid on a hospital in the same city has reiterated what is obvious to many but still denied by powerful decision-makers in Pakistan — that the ‘good' and ‘bad' distinction between militant groups is not tenable. The Pakistan Interior Minister named the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and the Jaish-e-Mohammed as the organisations suspected to have carried out the attacks during Friday prayers on two mosques of the Ahmadiyya community, killing more than 80 worshippers. Extremists see the Ahmadis as non-believers and therefore fair game. Both groups are linked to the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, which claimed responsibility for the attacks. They are also believed to be behind the hospital attack. It is no secret that jihadist groups have flourished in the Punjab heartland undeterred by a 2002 ban, all the while building links with the Taliban. Pakistan's softly-softly approach towards groups with so-called strategic value against India gave the JeM, much like the Lashkar-e-Taiba, special privileges. Islamabad has always said it does not know the whereabouts of JeM chief Maulana Masood Azhar. It has maintained that since the ban, the group itself has ceased to exist. Yet a Faisal Shehazad, arriving all the way from the United States, had no problem getting in touch with it. Pakistan Army operations against the Taliban in the north-western regions may have helped reduce the number of incidents in that area, and a new operation is on the anvil in North Waziristan, under pressure from the United States. But given the Taliban's links with the Punjab-based jihadist groups, it is no surprise that the monster rears its head elsewhere.
A military strike by the U.S. on Pakistan, reported to be under contemplation should a terrorist attack on American soil succeed, is no solution. Any such action would be extremely foolhardy, and New Delhi should oppose it. But clearly, Pakistan itself must take urgent steps. This means nothing less than what India has been demanding for years: uprooting the infrastructure of terrorism built with state patronage for the jihad in Afghanistan and Kashmir. Some arrests were made after the mosque attacks. This is hardly enough. As the track record shows, many arrested terror suspects in Pakistan are let off by the courts because of the prosecution's failure to come up with evidence. It is unfortunate that at a time like this, instead of facing up to the reality, influential sections in Pakistan's political parties, the Army, and media remain in expedient denial. If Pakistan means to win this battle, it must clear its vision and recognise the enemy within.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-enemy-within/article16240486.ece
2,6,2010,A ray of hope,"The results of a vaccine trial for preventing breast cancer in mice have raised hopes of finding an effective vaccine for use in humans. Breast cancer is one of the biggest killers in several countries. With nearly 100,000 new cases reported every year in India, it has overtaken cervical cancer as the number one cancer afflicting women. The results published online in the journal Nature Medicine (“An autoimmune-mediated strategy for prophylactic breast cancer vaccination,” by Ritika Jaini et al, of Cleveland Clinic, Ohio) show that none of the genetically breast cancer-prone mice vaccinated with a single dose of alpha-lactalbumin protein developed the cancer while those that received a placebo did. Except for a couple of studies, research has shown the significance of using this protein as a potential antigen for breast cancer. Alpha-lactalbumin is normally not present in non-breast human tissues. Hence to be chosen as a preventive vaccine candidate antigen to prime the immune system, the protein should satisfy certain conditions. It should be expressed by a majority of breast tumours at significant levels that allow its detection. Secondly, its production by normal breast cells should be restricted to certain easily traceable situations. In this case, alpha-lactalbumin, a lactation-dependent milk protein, is expressed only by lactating mothers. Also, there appears to be less likelihood of the prophylactic vaccine causing any harm to vaccinated women because, the authors note, the availability of the protein is “insufficient in normal non-lactating tissue.”
Preventive vaccines against cervical cancer and liver cancers have been approved for use in the United States and in several European countries. But unlike in the case of breast cancer, the approved vaccines are directed against a virus that causes the cancer and not cancer formation itself. Another challenge is that while viruses are easily detected by the immune system, breast cancer cells are normal cells that have turned into rogue cells and hence escape detection and destruction by the immune system. Despite the study showing that the targeted protein lies dormant in the breast tissue in non-lactating mothers and therefore poses less risk of destroying normal cells through vaccination, the need to collect more supporting evidence before undertaking human clinical trials cannot be over-emphasised. However, if proven safe, a preventive breast cancer vaccine can be administrated to those past child-bearing age. This study is significant for another reason: it has successfully demonstrated in animal trials the criteria to be used for choosing the ideal antigen for cancer prevention vaccines.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-ray-of-hope/article16240483.ece
4,6,2010,Mamata's moment,"A year after its comprehensive defeat in the Lok Sabha election in West Bengal, the Left Front led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has clearly failed to recover lost ground in the polls to 81 urban local bodies in the State. Although the Left parties managed to arrest the slide in certain parts of the State, and made small gains in relation to the Lok Sabha election, this is of little consolation with the Assembly election only a year away. The principal opposition, the Trinamool Congress, which went for an alliance with the Congress in the 2009 general election to prevail over the Left Front, beat back the ruling front on its own this time. It notched up impressive wins in the key Kolkata Municipal Corporation and neighbouring Bidhannagar (Salt Lake) Municipality and emerged the most successful party in the districts. It hopes to set up the board in at least 50 civic bodies across the State largely on its own and with the Congress as partner in a few. The Left parties won 18 bodies and the Congress seven. Only about 17 per cent of the total electorate of West Bengal was covered in these municipal elections, but the outcome, coming after the losses in the panchayat elections in 2008 and the Lok Sabha election in 2009, raises the question whether the end of the Left Front's long tenure in government is near. After a record seven successive wins in the Assembly election, beginning 1977, the CPI (M) and the other Left parties might have to settle for a spell in the opposition. Even if corrective action is taken by the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government, it is difficult to envisage a change in the popular mood in West Bengal.
For the Trinamool, the municipal polls also served as an opportunity to set the alliance terms with the Congress for the Assembly election. The party's chief Mamata Banerjee might be calculating that her prospective ally has been sufficiently softened up by the results to be a pushover during the seat-sharing negotiations. However, despite the latest confirmation of the erosion of popular support for the Left Front, going it alone is not a viable option for the Trinamool. So, after accusing the Congress of being in league with the CPI (M) in the run-up to the municipal elections, Ms Banerjee has opened a line to the Congress, expressing faith in its top leadership and hoping to maintain relations with the United Progressive Alliance government. However, the volatile Ms Banerjee can always make things difficult for herself, just as she does for her allies. Political opportunism of the kind that saw her propose a Mahajot or grand alliance with both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party has been her strongest card and her greatest weakness. Now that she is within sniffing distance of the Writers' Building, Ms Banerjee seems to be in the process of realising that, in the immediate context, she needs the Congress as much as the Congress needs her.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mamatas-moment/article16240761.ece
4,6,2010,Jharkhand's predicament,"A five-month wonder has unravelled in Jharkhand. The abrupt end to the Bharatiya Janata Party's alliance of convenience with the Shibu Soren-led Jharkhand Mukti Morcha was not entirely unexpected: uncertainty was inherent in the arrangement. The BJP withdrew support to the coalition government a day after Mr. Soren, a Member of Parliament, went with the ruling United Progressive Alliance in the Lok Sabha by voting against Opposition-sponsored cut motions. For the BJP, the opportunistic experiment had soured; it promptly accused him of betrayal. The country then witnessed the unedifying spectacle of Mr. Soren desperately seeking to cling to his post, first, by extending new promises to the BJP, only to retract, and then by making overtures to the Congress. At one point, the Congress signalled that it was not averse to helping the JMM form a new government. Thankfully, nothing came of this. When an isolated Mr. Soren finally resigned ahead of a trust vote in the Assembly that he was guaranteed to lose, the wheel has come full circle. President's Rule has been imposed but while the Assembly remains in suspended animation, intense horse-trading seems to be in prospect.
The December 2009 Assembly elections produced a fragmented verdict, but in its anxiety to keep the Congress out of power the BJP rushed into the alliance with the JMM. Sheer greed for power marked the manoeuvring and the manipulation that led to that deal. The politics of opportunism is turning out to be the bane of Jharkhand, a State that is only a decade old. There are many tasks ahead for the mineral-rich, tribal-majority State that is facing the challenges of underdevelopment even as the Maoist insurgency is raging. Panchayat elections in the region were last held in 1977. The official machinery needs to show commitment and vigour in the implementation of livelihood support programmes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. A huge amount of basic work needs to be done in the social and infrastructure sectors. It would be politically and morally indefensible to treat Jharkhand as a basket case. Creative ways must be found to end the political instability that has paralysed governance. The State Assembly is but five months old. It is up to the major political parties to show sagacity and work out a bipartisan consensus to put a viable democratic government in place. A prolonged spell of President's Rule is clearly not the way forward.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Jharkhands-predicament/article16240760.ece
5,6,2010,Justice for Kargil heroes,"Next month India will commemorate its victory in the Kargil war and the extraordinary sacrifices of the soldiers. They fought in some of the most brutal terrain in the world to achieve the objective of throwing the Pakistani intruders out. In his speech of July 26, Union Defence Minister A.K. Antony, a politician known for his commitment to probity, must set to rest the ghosts that haunt the battlefield. It has long been known that many who played a key role in ensuring victory were disgraced so that superiors who ought to have been penalised for their wartime failures could receive medals and honours. Last week, the Armed Force Tribunal held that the officer with direct supervisory responsibility for the conduct of the war, former XV Corps commander Lieutenant-General Kishan Pal, falsified battle records to deny a key subordinate credit for his stellar conduct of operations. This action, which seems to have been driven by a desire to cover up command failures, cost 70 Brigade commander Devinder Singh a medal and a promotion. That it took 11 years to deliver justice to Brigadier Singh is shocking: the Tribunal's judgment has only affirmed what the Army has known all along. Several accounts of the war, including Lieutenant-General Y.M. Bammi's magisterial, Kargil: The Impregnable Conquered, former army chief General V.P. Malik's memoirs, and Brigadier Gurmeet Kanwal's official history of the war, made it clear that Brigadier Singh had been instrumental in India's victory in the Batalik sector. The Tribunal received testimony from Brigadier Singh's subordinates and superiors lauding his bravery and acumen — testimony that was available to Army headquarters years ago. Yet successive Chiefs of Army Staff and Defence Ministers did nothing to undo the mischief.
In the build-up to Kargil Day, Mr. Antony will do the Army, his Ministry, and the country proud if he summons the courage to offer Brigadier Singh an apology and restore to him the honours to which he is entitled. But he needs to do more. There are other cases pending before the Tribunal seeking redress; they revolve around decisions made by XV Corps — notably those of 121 Brigade commander Surinder Singh and Major Manish Bhatnagar. Some officers with reason to consider themselves aggrieved, like Colonel Pushpinder Oberoi, chose not to move the court for justice. The Defence Ministry must set up a body to conduct a transparent audit of these cases and set wrongs right. It must also conduct a thoroughgoing examination of the official Kargil Review Committee, which relied heavily on a tainted account of events. Armies in which promotions depend on personal prejudices, rather than dispassionate assessments of professional capability, will see poor quality leadership rise to the top. In the end, their war-fighting capacities will be eroded. Telling the truth will, doubtless, be a painful process — but the Army as well as India will emerge the stronger for it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Justice-for-Kargil-heroes/article16241028.ece
5,6,2010,Democracy diminished,"The failure of the United Kingdom, despite warnings from the Council of Europe, to comply with the 2004 ruling of the European Court of Human Rights that all prisoners must be allowed to vote illustrates the extent to which medieval notions of punishment colour the understanding of the canons of modern rule of law even in advanced democracies. The Court is the judicial arm of the Council of Europe, which comprises 47 states. Under any system of liberal constitutional government that enshrines universal adult suffrage, the deprivation of the basic democratic right of the vote to anybody undermines his or her fundamental identity as a citizen of a nation-state. As such, a denial of the right to felons is tantamount to a double penalty, considering that incarceration fulfils the punitive objective of curtailing their liberty. Disenfranchisement runs counter to the spirit of proportionality, deterrence, and reformation — values that are increasingly seen as underpinning the purpose of punitive measures and intended to undercut the harshness and cruelty historically associated with the administration of criminal justice. The Council's warnings to the British government to let prisoners vote in the 2010 general election or be in breach of their human rights came on the back of a campaign by liberal democrats and activist groups to enfranchise the country's 70,300 convicted prisoners. The court had held that a prisoner's right to vote — in addition to his or her rights to marriage, practise religion, freedom of expression and correspondence, access to legal remedy, and protection against torture — fell outside the purview of the deprivation of liberty sanctioned under a conviction.
The United States presents a unique case of barring an estimated five million convicted felons from voting. American states have different laws relating to prisoner voting rights. While several of them permanently disenfranchise felony convicts, a couple of states allow prisoners serving a sentence to vote. Equally bizarre is the Indian case where contesting and often winning elections from within prison walls is not uncommon, although exercising the franchise is another matter. India needs to follow the European, not the U.S., example in this respect. To prevent prisoners serving a sentence from fulfilling a basic democratic duty is indeed to deny them their human rights.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Democracy-diminished/article16241009.ece
6,6,2010,No end to financial volatility,"While volatility has become integral to stock markets, and indeed every other financial market, the extent of sharp fluctuations recently seen across the major bourses worldwide is unprecedented. The VIX or volatility index traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange reached its highest level in May after remaining steady for most of 2009. The index, which reflects the price investors are willing to pay to insure themselves against substantial market moves, is considered a reliable measure of recent investor uncertainty. Leading Indian stock indices, the Sensex and the Nifty, have also fluctuated. The Sensex has recently been moving in a wide band between 16,000 and 18,000 and is currently above 17,000. Indian stock prices have no doubt taken their cues from the Asian and other global stock exchanges, but the degree of correlation is less significant than it used to be. On the whole, Indian stocks have responded relatively well to the violently fluctuating stock prices abroad. This pattern of market behaviour is in contrast to the sharp erosion in market capitalisation during the height of the 2008 financial crisis.
However, it is premature to suggest that Indian markets have ‘decoupled' themselves from the volatile trends of the developed markets. Global nervousness arising out of the still unfathomable nature of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe has been magnified by concerns over fiscal policy in developed countries. There are fears that a simultaneous withdrawal of the stimulus packages by several countries will harm global recovery. In the United States, there are indications that the stimulus-fuelled recovery might peter out. All this has a bearing on investment in India, although the country's strong macroeconomic performance and other positive factors have helped bring some stability to its financial markets. The economy has grown by 7.4 per cent and the proceeds from the telecom spectrum auctions will help in fiscal consolidation. Fortunately, India's key vulnerability — the way its current account is funded through foreign institutional flows — is not exposed to the extent it was in 2008. Foreign investors have been net sellers on a few days but the movement has not been wholly one way. And if that set off a slight depreciation of the rupee, it has only helped exporters. Extreme volatility will harm markets and can choke nascent global recovery. India, like the rest of the world, will be hoping for the global uncertainties to end.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/No-end-to-financial-volatility/article16241447.ece
7,6,2010,Only way out is exit,"A three-day “peace jirga” in Afghanistan has given rise to more questions than answers. President Hamid Karzai called the jirga to win an endorsement for a peace deal with the Taliban so that it could be held out as a nationally mandated plan. The Taliban, the real and deadly opposition, was not invited; and the non-attendance of some heavyweight opposition politicians took away from the moment. Still, this traditional assembly, seen as a very Afghan way of taking crucial decisions, has helped the embattled Mr. Karzai put behind him some of the controversy surrounding his re-election last year. But the workability of the proposed peace deal is another matter. Foremost among the difficulties relates to the issue of what can be gained by negotiating with a reactionary and brutal group that rejects every way of ordering the world except its own, and Al-Qaeda's. Secondly, the Taliban has a strong card to play: it will not negotiate unless its condition that all foreign troops in Afghanistan must leave is met. Mr. Karzai, however, wants to implement his plan under the protective umbrella of the U.S./ NATO security forces. His game plan is to wean away ‘non-ideological' Taliban fighters with an amnesty, cash, and jobs. There is talk of offering asylum to hardline Taliban leaders in another country, possibly Saudi Arabia, and of working on the international community to have some other Taliban leaders taken off a US/UN blacklist. This would have made sense were the Taliban on the verge of military defeat. It is inconceivable that at this point, when the Taliban senses victory, the core leadership will opt for voluntary exile. Then there is the matter of how compatible Mr. Karzai's plan is with the interests of Pakistan and the United States.
Now in its ninth year, the U.S.-led invasion and occupation of Afghanistan has sent the country down a spiral of unending calamity. According to Professor Marc W. Herold, who runs the Afghan Victim Memorial Database, the occupying forces have killed more than 8,500 Afghan civilians from 2001 to the end of February 2010; and the toll has risen steadily since then. With a senseless troop surge under way, close to 80,000 American soldiers are now in Afghanistan. The number is set to nearly double by August 2010, before a planned withdrawal beginning July 2011. Despite the failures in Helmand earlier this year, another operation is imminent in Kandahar. It is certain to add to the appalling number of civilian casualties, which can only aid the Taliban by increasing its support base. The only way to resolve the Afghan conflict is for the occupation to end, and for Afghanistan's neighbours and the U.S. to stop meddling in its affairs. The people of Afghanistan have suffered too long — and the country must be allowed to find the most viable way out of the mess, whatever it takes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Only-way-out-is-exit/article16241522.ece
8,6,2010,The curse of Okinawa,"Japan's new Prime Minister, Naoto Kan, faces unenviable challenges. He was elected to the office by the Democratic Party of Japan following last week's sudden resignation by Yukio Hatoyama. Credited with fashioning the election victory of the centre-left DPJ only eight months ago, Mr. Hatoyama managed to become dramatically unpopular in record time. A controversy over financial irregularities during the election campaign destroyed the impression that the new government represented change from the sleazy money politics of the Liberal Democratic Party. But the trigger for Mr. Hatoyama's resignation was the U.S. military presence on the island of Okinawa. Of nearly 40,000 American troops in Japan under a bilateral security treaty, over two-thirds are in bases in Okinawa. The local population resents them. The DPJ made an election promise to reduce the number of U.S. troops in Okinawa, and specifically to move the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma off the island. The plan was fiercely opposed by the U.S., which sees its presence in Okinawa as vital; the island is located strategically close to North Korea and China. Public anger mounted when it became apparent that the U.S. carried more weight on this issue than voters, and that all Mr. Hatoyama could do was relocate the base to a less-populous area on the island. Across the rest of Japan, he was blamed for mishandling relations with an important international ally. With elections to the Diet's upper house due in less than a month, he opted to fall on his sword, leaving the mess to his successor.
Mr. Kan's credentials as a grass-roots politician, unafraid of entrenched interests, may help the DPJ regain some of its lost shine in time for the July elections. The party needs a majority in the upper house to reduce its dependence on allies for important policy decisions, especially on the ailing economy. With the Okinawa issue now an emotional lightning rod, Japanese voters are also likely to judge Mr. Kan on how he walks the tightrope of U.S.-Japan ties. The recent tensions between North and South Korea have shown how Japan is torn between its perceived need for the U.S. as the guarantor of its security and the growing feeling that it must cut its dependence on the superpower by improving ties with China and other neighbours. As well as heavy-duty domestic issues, Mr. Kan — Japan's fifth premier in four years — will need to deliver fast on this major foreign policy issue to prove that he can lead the country better than his predecessors.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-curse-of-Okinawa/article16242266.ece
8,6,2010,A colossal disaster,"The unfolding environmental catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico must convince governments everywhere that the economic costs of poor regulation of the oil industry can be staggering. Tens of thousands of barrels of reddish oil from the stricken Deepwater Horizon offshore well have turned much of the Gulf into a life-sapping zone. The oil has paralysed the economy of coastal communities, mainly in Louisiana. If computer-modelling studies published by the National Center for Atmospheric Research in the United States turn out to be reasonably accurate, the vast swathe of oil could harm more areas of the Atlantic coast over the next four months — the first signs are already visible in Florida. Such gloomy scenarios and the distressing images of dying oil-soaked birds, sullied beaches, and worried citizens pose a serious challenge to President Barack Obama. His immediate task is to exert sufficient pressure on oil giant BP to ensure that the gusher on the ocean floor is capped. After four major failed manoeuvres, there appears to be some progress in the latest effort to cap the well and pump the oil out by ship. Yet permanent relief wells may have to wait for quite a while. The disaster raises serious questions about safety in the global offshore oil industry. In the U.S., the evidence indicates that rules and regulations governing deepwater drilling were weak and often not enforced.
The hope is that the criminal and civil enquiry will throw light on the reports that BP was granted a series of exemptions by the regulator, the Minerals Management Service, on safety testing and contingency plans for accidents. Public statements by BP indicate that it scrambled for solutions after the event, and had to employ untested methods to stop the flow of oil. Containment equipment, meant for use in the event of a blowout in the mile-deep well, was not readily available when disaster struck. It was fabricated later, resulting in a fortnight's delay. The U.S. regulator suffers from a serious conflict of interest, as it has to both encourage oil production and police the process. This has apparently led to a standard regime of exemptions in safety enforcement. All this clearly indicates that the oil industry, which has been paying out billions of dollars to investors, must be made fully accountable. What emerges from the BP incident is the absence of a response plan to manage deepwater disasters. That is scary, considering there are as many as 50 such operations in the Gulf of Mexico alone. There are many global conventions against pollution of the seas. It is imperative, therefore, that countries permitting oil exploration publish their regulatory requirements on the Internet along with records of compliance by an industry that never sacrifices big profits.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-colossal-disaster/article16242263.ece
8,6,2010,Promoters & public,"The central government has done well to increase the levels of public participation in the share capital of companies listed on stock exchanges. The threshold level of public holding has been raised to 25 per cent from 10 per cent. Companies that fall short of this minimum have been asked to comply within a time frame by adding to the public holding at least 5 per cent every year. As for the new issuers of capital, some leeway in the time frame has been given to those who will have very large share valuations after the issue. The idea clearly is to help a company sell its shares in a gradual manner without fear of depressing the share prices during the initial offer. In fact, the main objective of the new guidelines is to strike a fresh balance between the relative shares of the promoters and the public.
Until the early 1990s, capital market rules were tilted in favour of the public. Promoters were not permitted to earmark for themselves more than 40 per cent of a new share issue. A few exemptions were allowed, as for example when there was a financial collaboration with a State government development institution. However, early in the era of liberalisation, pressure came from several directions to alter the listing rules to give promoters a larger share. Technology companies that had a limited presence in the stock markets and were, unlike today, hardly favoured by investors lobbied for a smaller public share. The idea was to ensure attractive valuation for their shares, which were later used as 'currency' for acquisitions and expansion. It was also argued that a lower public share would reduce the issue expenses, a line of thinking that found wider support when even the relatively small public shares were split among retail investors, high net worth individuals, and so on. However, the lower reservation for the public, which was brought down in stages to 10 per cent, encouraged collusive practices in several cases, leading to artificially high share prices. Liquidity has suffered and, as the government has now realised, a high percentage of floating stock is necessary for discovering a fair price. As a result of the revised guideline, very large share offerings estimated between Rs.160,000 crore and Rs.210,000 crore — a sizable portion by public sector enterprises — are expected soon. All these, however, do not guarantee a better deal for the small investor. Stock market reform may have brought substantial benefits to the capital market. But, as this year's round of public sector disinvestment shows, retail investors remain disgruntled and alienated.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Promoters-amp-public/article16241710.ece
9,6,2010,Pitiful justice,"When eight out of 12 original accused in the world's worst industrial disaster, the Bhopal gas leak of December 3-4, 1984, are brought to justice nearly 26 years later, it is difficult to respond to the verdict with anything other than dismay. Key protagonists Warren Anderson and Union Carbide Corporation (UCC, USA) have literally got away with mass murder. The eight Indians held guilty, among them Keshub Mahindra, chairman of UCC's Indian subsidiary, have been sentenced to two years' imprisonment by the trial court. Mr. Anderson was Accused No. 1 in the 1987 charge sheet filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation; as Chief Executive Officer of the parent UCC, he was directly responsible for the deaths and devastation that came in the wake of the leak of toxic methyl isocyanate gas from Carbide's Bhopal plant. Mr. Anderson, who had approved and ratified the standards in design, safety, and operations of the plant, was placed under house arrest immediately after the calamity but he won his release on a promise to return to India and stand trial. Of course, he never intended to return, and successive Indian governments merely went through the motions of trying to secure his extradition. In 1992, the district court in Bhopal declared Mr. Anderson a fugitive from the law. In 1993, the case was bifurcated and the eight Indian accused were tried separately.
The families of the gas victims are bound to see the Bhopal verdict as a cruel joke on their patience and suffering. The minimal punishment handed down to the eight Indians is less a reflection on the Bhopal judge than a consequence of a 1996 Supreme Court order diluting the charges — from culpable homicide to causing death by negligence, which carries a maximum imprisonment of two years. The unconscionably delayed verdict also raises larger liability questions for industrial disasters, especially in the context of the Civil Liability Nuclear Damages Bill. The Bhopal toll and consequences, short- and long-term, were horrific beyond precedent. The 4,000 immediate deaths and the tens of thousands disabled were the First Act of a heart-rending saga that continues to take its toll to this day. Thousands more have died from long-term exposure, not to mention children born with congenital defects and those falling sick from drinking water contaminated by the uncleared waste lying around the Carbide factory grounds. What the government has done for the generations of poor victims will go down in the annals of infamy. It sued Carbide for $3 billion but settled for 15 per cent of the amount, as a consequence of which survivors received an average compensation of less than Rs.15,000. Those born with disabilities and others suffering the long-term consequences have been left to fend for themselves. It is truly a case of too little, too late.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Pitiful-justice/article16241997.ece
10,6,2010,Football's African odyssey,"There is no such thing as a level playing field but the first World Cup to be held in Africa promises to be one of the most open in the 80-year history of the tournament. Only the second event to be held outside Europe and the Americas, the 2010 edition in South Africa grants no home-continent advantage to the world's premier footballing nations from South America and Europe. All but one of the 17 tournaments held in Europe and the Americas have been won by a country of the host continent. The exception is the 1958 World Cup in Sweden won by Brazil. Thus, like Asia's World Cup in 2002, jointly hosted by Japan and South Korea, this World Cup could see the Europeans and the South Americans start off on an equal footing. Will any of the six African teams be able to convert the home-continent advantage into title-winning success? While they might have a good run, as South Korea and Japan did eight years ago, at this point the odds are against any of them making it to the last 4, for all their individual brilliance. That the continent's best team, Egypt, is absent after being knocked out in a play-off by Algeria hasn't helped. Nevertheless, the choice of South Africa to host the World Cup is a tribute to the rising stature of African nations in football.
Five-time winner Brazil, the only team to be part of every World Cup since its inception, is deservedly at the top of the rankings of the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). With Maicon at the back, Kaka in midfield, and Robinho to press ahead, the team has both pedigree and form to propel it to glory. Compared with some of the previous Brazilian teams, this one seems short on star value, but no one ever counts Brazil out in this game. The other South American football giant, Argentina, is powered by Lionel Messi, widely tipped to be the star of the tournament. With the legendary Diego Maradona as coach, Argentina, seventh in the FIFA rankings, might be inspired to take off to great heights. Among the Europeans, the Euro 2008 winner Spain, ranked number two by FIFA, is the most fancied, even if it has never won the World Cup before. Portugal (ranked third), the Netherlands (fourth), Italy (fifth), Germany (sixth), and England (eighth) make up the rest of the list of strong title contenders. Bookies favour Spain, in the belief they will carry forward their form in the European Football Championship, and Brazil, the automatic favourite in World Cups outside Europe, as also England, which is seen as having a favourable draw. But what makes football the greatest game on the planet is that the only thing that counts ultimately is the performance over 90 minutes, and not the form and reputation built over years.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Footballs-African-odyssey/article16242262.ece
10,6,2010,Drowning in oil,"The unusually high mortality reported among endangered sea turtles in the wake of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico raises legitimate fears for the future of these ocean-dependent creatures. An initial survey carried out 10 days after the Deepwater Horizon well blowout found 156 dead turtles, most of them Kemp's Ridleys. The case of this species, now in its nesting season, is particularly poignant. It has been saved from critical decline after an oil spill in the Gulf in 1979 from the Ixtoc 1 rig caused severe degradation of its nesting area. Miraculously, its numbers bounced back, from a few hundreds to several thousands, thanks to good conservation. The plumes of oil in the ocean now threaten that outcome. Decades of painstaking work by scientists, wildlife officials, and lay turtle lovers could now be undone. In a morbid twist, one website started accepting serious bets on the possible extinction of the Kemp's Ridley due to oil pollution. Such an end for these long-surviving creatures would be a shocking price to pay for the failure of the oil industry and governments to adhere to environmental safety norms. Surely, the time has come to end laissez faire regulatory policies that have allowed the oil industry to throw environmental safety to the winds.
The danger to the Kemp's Ridley from BP's Deepwater Horizon has turned the attention of conservation groups to the need for massive community mobilisation for rescue and rehabilitation in the near future. Here, the initiative of the Caribbean Conservation Corporation, a science-based non-profit organisation, to get rescuers trained in handling oil-affected turtles is laudable. The CCC initiative to celebrate Sea Turtle Day on June 16, and encourage citizens to have high-profile sea turtle ‘parties' in their neighbourhoods, is promising. Such events provide much-needed information on the long evolutionary heritage of these animals and fast-emerging threats. Such awareness is vital to impress upon legislators that permission for offshore drilling activity, which often translates into near-shore well sites, could prove devastating to the nesting beaches of turtles. There is also a strong case to inspect anew the drilling rigs in operation, to ascertain the safety mechanisms available to prevent environmental damage in an accident. Marine conservation groups have been particularly worried about the ability of a bigger BP-owned oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantis, to handle a similar accident. It should be evident from the harm done recently that a green future for turtles and all other life lies in an energy paradigm that diverges from oil.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Drowning-in-oil/article16242265.ece
11,6,2010,A needless provocation,"Driven by myopia and sheer bloody-mindedness, the United States and 11 other members of the United Nations Security Council have voted to tighten sanctions on Iran. Brazil and Turkey, which recently brokered an important fuel swap agreement with Tehran, voted against the sanctions resolution while Lebanon abstained. What matters is not the specific provisions contained in the latest round of sanctions but the fact that Washington insisted on pushing them through just when a small window for confidence-building and trust between Iran and the international community had been opened by the Turkish-Brazilian initiative. Under their proposal, which the International Atomic Energy Agency is now considering, Iran will promptly transfer 1,200 kg of low enriched uranium — roughly half the amount the IAEA estimates it has produced to date — to Turkey, where it would be held in escrow. Russia and France would then fabricate an equivalent amount of enriched uranium fuel rods suitable for use in the Tehran Research Reactor. Once these rods are ready, they will be exchanged for the Iranian LEU.
Although the swap addresses an issue distinct from the one Iran is currently being sanctioned for, the successful implementation of the agreement would have been a major confidence-building measure. The U.S. and its allies would have succeeded in removing from the territory of Iran half its LEU stockpile — an amount that could theoretically be used to fabricate one nuclear device should Iran leave the Non-Proliferation Treaty and start weapons-grade enrichment. From the Iranian point of view, it would have demonstrated that the international community was capable of reasonableness and flexibility. From there, the Turks and Brazilians, perhaps supplemented by other powers, might have been able to move their engagement with Iran to a higher level, securing answers to the few remaining questions the IAEA has about the Iranian nuclear programme. But Wednesday's sanctions resolution changes everything. They send a signal to the diverse stakeholders in Tehran that reasonableness doesn't pay. Iran is likely to harden its attitude, thereby allowing the U.S. and its allies to take one more step down the path of confrontation. India, which has a major economic and strategic stake in the preservation of peace in the Persian Gulf and West Asia, should stop being a passive bystander to the crisis that is now looming large. By insisting on sanctions at this stage, the P-5 have only succeeded in scoring own goals. India may not be a member of the U.N. Security Council but that should not preclude it from actively pursuing a diplomatic end to the standoff.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-needless-provocation/article16242537.ece
11,6,2010,A new normalcy,"In the aftermath of the global economic crisis, the yearning for returning to normalcy has been strong. Yet that normalcy, which in the broadest sense means reverting to the legal, institutional, and policy framework that existed prior to the crisis, may never be realised. The crisis may have ended, but there has been an irreversible transformation that has changed the nature of what is normal. The new normal state has very little resemblance to the past. While prior to the crisis the global economy had robust growth and employment benefiting from an interconnected world with flourishing trade, investment, and consumption, the new equilibrium after the meltdown features more regulation, higher taxes, less leverage, lower growth, and higher unemployment in the developed countries. The emerging policy framework is broadly uniform, though it may be fine-tuned in specific countries and regions to address some special concerns. The crisis, though global in sweep, had its origins in the financial sector of the developed world. Economic recovery in the developed world remains fragile. Asian countries with China and India in the forefront are leading the recovery. For policy makers in the developed countries, adjusting to the new normal state has proved daunting. For instance, attempts to fix their financial sectors, so obviously broken, have met with resistance, especially in the U.S. The role of the state, which expanded dramatically during the crisis, will remain significant in the new financial architecture.
For developing countries, especially those in Asia, a deep study of the crisis has been immensely beneficial because it has provided a vindication of their policies. For instance, India's measured approach to capital account convertibility and its system of 'managed float' for the rupee helped check the contagion during the crisis. In fact, India's external sector policies have been commended by, among others, the G20 countries. Even the IMF, for long a votary of unfettered capital flows, has conceded that it might be appropriate in certain cases to restrain cross-border flows! For India and a few other countries, coming to terms with the new normalcy ought not to be as traumatic as it has been in the West. However, as the ongoing Euro debt crisis shows, the threat to the global economy can come from unexpected quarters. Asian economies, though with limited financial linkages to the euro, might still face major funding problems besides diminished trade prospects. New normalcy has therefore to be understood in a dynamic sense; it will endure only if it is the outcome of a collaborative effort at both the regional and global levels.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-new-normalcy/article16242515.ece
12,6,2010,Productive visit,"The visit by Sri Lanka's President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, has reaffirmed the country's close ties with India and provided both sides the opportunity to signal a readiness to take the bilateral relationship to a new level. This was reflected in the joint statement by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Rajapaksa, and the host of agreements to strengthen and expand bilateral cooperation. It was the first time in a quarter century that New Delhi played host to a Sri Lankan head of state who arrived without the burden of a raging ethnic conflict back home. Mr. Rajapaksa, whose political stock following his presidential and parliamentary election triumphs is unmatched among leaders in the region, did not have to seek support for his government nor assistance in a devastating civil war. For three decades, the Tamil question, and unease with the way successive Sri Lankan governments handled it, dominated ties between the two neighbours. With the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam eliminated as a military entity, the Sri Lankan leader clearly wants to reformulate the bilateral relationship. That he is prepared to go the extra mile for this is evident from his agreement to an Indian consulate in the southern city of Hambantota where China is assisting in building a modern port, in addition to the already agreed diplomatic outpost in Jaffna.
India too is eager to look at its relations with Sri Lanka through a post-LTTE lens. In this, the immediate issue has been the resettlement of all the Tamils displaced during the final stage of the military operations against the Tigers. In addition to the grant of Rs. 500 crore for the humanitarian relief, rehabilitation, and resettlement of internally displaced persons, the infrastructure development, and other assistance being provided by India for projects in Northern Sri Lanka, New Delhi's decision to assist in the building of 50,000 houses is a timely initiative. But as a good neighbour, India must make a much bigger, and qualitatively more significant contribution, to the development of the war-ravaged North, and the rehabilitation and rebuilding efforts for the Tamils.
While the assurances given by President Rajapaksa give rise to the hope that the longstanding political grievances of the Tamil people will be addressed in a just manner, it is no surprise that the joint statement reveals differences over how to go about resolving this question. New Delhi expects “a meaningful devolution, building upon the 13th Amendment…[to] create the necessary conditions for a lasting political settlement,” in other words implementation of the 13th Amendment with significant enhancements. Mr. Rajapaksa, on the other hand, has recorded “his determination to evolve a political settlement acceptable to all communities that would act as a catalyst to create the necessary conditions in which all the people of Sri Lanka could lead their lives in an atmosphere of peace, justice and dignity, consistent with democracy, pluralism, equal opportunity and respect for human rights.” Expressing his resolve “to continue to implement in particular the relevant provisions of the Constitution designed to strengthen national amity and reconciliation through empowerment,” he shared with Dr. Singh his ideas on “conducting a broad dialogue with all parties involved.”
This requires, first, political will on the Sinhala side to find a just and enduring solution. It also implies responsibility on the part of Tamil parties to make up their minds quickly on what kind of devolution, development, and future they want for their people within a united Sri Lanka. They must overcome their differences and liberate themselves from the separatist mindset of the Prabakaran era, which prevented even so-called moderates from making any workable proposals in talks with successive Sri Lankan governments. They must move forward in the confidence that Sri Lankan Tamils are a hard-working, educated, brave, and resilient people with many talents. Given a congenial socio-political environment, generous development assistance, peace and stability, and a decent measure of self-administering opportunities, they can shape a bright future for themselves as part of a united nation.
The setting up of a ‘Commission on Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation” is a positive step President Rajapaksa has taken towards bridging the deep ethnic divide. Under its terms of reference, the Commission, which has eight reputed representatives from the Sinhala and Tamil communities, is to go into the events of the period, February 2002 to May 2009, “their attendant concerns and to recommend measures to ensure that there will be no recurrence” of such a situation. Some objections have been raised to the limited period covered by the terms of reference as well as to the absence of a mandate for the Commission to inquire into the alleged excesses committed by the Sri Lankan military in the final days of the war. But in balance, the Commission is a good opportunity for both the majority and minority communities to put the past behind and move forward to live harmoniously in a united Sri Lanka. South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Committee, from which the Sri Lankan experiment takes its inspiration, was also not a perfect model but it helped the country close the chapter on apartheid and progress. In Sri Lanka, years of war and attrition have damaged both communities. The Commission can surely help begin the process of healing.
From 1991, successive governments in New Delhi have conducted Sri Lanka policy on sound and constructive lines. The time has come to take the bilateral relationship to a new level by exploring its full potential. As part of this, rising India must – without imposing itself – continue to encourage the Sri Lankan leadership to find a satisfactory resolution to Tamil grievances within an improved devolution framework.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Productive-visit/article16242833.ece
13,6,2010,Murderers in olive green,"Early last month, three north Kashmir villagers were lured from their homes with promises of work and murdered by officers of an Indian Army unit who passed them off as jihadists trying to cross the Line of Control. Northern Army commander Lieutenant-General B.S. Jaswal has promised that the murderers would be prosecuted and punished. That isn't enough: the case has demonstrated, not for the first time, that there is a serious malaise both in the Indian Army's counter-insurgency formations and in the internal oversight mechanisms. Evidence gathered by the police leaves little doubt the Srinagar-based XV Corps ought to have known something had gone horribly wrong long before complaints were filed by the murdered villagers' relatives. Instead, top commanders proved clueless about what rogue units under their command were doing. Back in 2006, a police investigation found evidence that Rashtriya Rifles formations had been involved in the murders of several south Kashmir residents who were passed off as jihadists killed in combat. In 2004, an anonymous whistleblower in the Army revealed that four porters hired from Jammu and Punjab had been killed in a similiar fashion by the 18 Rashtriya Rifles. Not in one single case did the Army initiate action against the perpetrators. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has promised “zero tolerance” of human rights violations — but these words will remain a meaningless piety unless the Army evolves credible criminal justice systems.
Militaries around the world have to grapple with criminal acts by their troops, often of magnitudes worse than anything soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir are accused of. Earlier this month, troops from the United States army's 5 Stryker Brigade murdered several Afghan civilians in cold blood; the institutionalised torture of alleged terrorists in Iraq is too familiar to need recounting. However, in many of these cases, internal military investigators worked to build credible prosecutions conducted in the full light of day. Indian military commanders have, for the most part, reflexively glossed over wrongdoing. Between 1993 and 2007, the Army's Human Rights Cell investigated 1,321 allegations of human rights violations in J&K and the North-East. Just 54 cases, it claimed, were supported by fact; in consequence, 115 personnel were punished. But no data on either the investigations or the proceedings that followed has ever been made public. The argument that making such details public will erode military morale makes no sense whatsoever. After all, the actions of rogue military personnel demean the sacrifices of those who put their lives at risk in genuine counter-insurgency operations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Murderers-in-olive-green/article16243218.ece
13,6,2010,WHO and conflicts of interest,"Ayear after the World Health Organisation declared an Influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, a joint investigation by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism has raised “troubling questions about how WHO managed conflicts of interest among the scientists who advised its pandemic planning, and about the transparency of the science underlying its advice to governments.” The open access findings are published in the journal (“Conflicts of interest: WHO and the pandemic flu ‘conspiracies,'” by Deborah Cohen and Philip Carter). While three scientists had financial ties with drug companies producing influenza drugs and vaccine, and had declared their conflicts of interest in other instances, WHO failed to disclose this. In a defensive letter sent to the journal, Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO, admits that the “WHO needs to establish, and enforce, stricter rules of engagement with industry, and we are doing so.” However, at a January 2010 hearing of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, the organisation denied any industry influence on the scientific advice it received. A report by the Council of Europe has already come down heavily on WHO for its mishandling of the H1N1 influenza pandemic, which led to “distortion of priorities of public health services across Europe, and waste of large sums of public money.”
It is mandatory for authors submitting papers to leading medical journals to declare any conflict of interest, and such information becomes part of the published paper. This is a vital safeguard meant to protect the integrity of academic work. By contrast, the BMJ article points out, the investigation reveals “a system struggling to manage the inherent conflict between the pharmaceutical industry, WHO, and the global public health system, which all draw on the same pool of scientific experts.” Conflicts of interest by experts advising WHO can have serious financial and healthcare implications, especially when the world body declares a pandemic. Many developed countries spent a fortune stockpiling drugs and vaccines when they were not needed; and the healthcare systems of many developing countries were severely overstrained. One doesn't have to buy into conspiracy theories to be able to recognise that when a pandemic is mis-diagnosed and mis-declared, only the drug companies gain. Dr. Chan has vehemently denied that commercial interests influenced the world body's decision-making. If the idea is to regain trust, mere assurances will not do.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/WHO-and-conflicts-of-interest/article16243217.ece
15,6,2010,Of wedlock and deadlock,"A rational and progressive divorce law must strike a balance between two seemingly incongruous objectives. It should support and sustain the stability of the institution of marriage. But it should also enable couples to end their contract with the minimum fuss and acrimony once it is established that the marriage is beyond repair and no constructive purpose would be served in keeping it alive. The irretrievable breakdown of a marriage, a concept first recognised in New Zealand's matrimonial laws in 1920, is now widely accepted around the world as a condition for the grant of divorce. In clearing amendments that make irretrievable breakdown a ground for divorce in the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 and the Special Marriage Act 1954, the Union Cabinet has accepted longstanding recommendations made repeatedly by the Law Commission of India and the higher judiciary. The Delhi High Court struck an extremely sensible and pragmatic note as early as 1967 when referring to married couples in Ram Kali v. Gopal Das: “It would not be practical and realistic…indeed it would be unreasonable and inhumane, to keep up the façade of marriage even though the rift between them is complete and there are no prospects of their ever living together as husband and wife.”
As things stand, the provisions relating to divorce in the Hindu Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act (which provides for a civil marriage by registration, under which a couple may marry whatever be their religion) mainly relate to ‘matrimonial fault' — or such things as adultery, cruelty, and desertion. The provision for divorce by mutual consent, introduced in the Hindu Marriage Act in 1976, also exists. While this requires both parties to cooperate on the terms of their divorce, irretrievable breakdown is a conclusion the court may reach if the facts before it establish that the marriage cannot be saved. It is important to stress that irretrievable breakdown was never envisaged as a painless, hassle-free way of arbitrarily dumping a spouse. As the Law Commission has recommended, aside from ascertaining that the marriage is wrecked beyond hope of salvage, any grant of divorce under this provision must ensure that adequate financial arrangements are made for spouses, whenever required, and children. The process of reforming Hindu matrimonial law has resulted in a situation where it is not substantially different today from that which governs civil marriage. The challenge in this connection is to persuade other communities — Muslims and Christians, in particular — to accept reforms in their marriage and divorce laws that are progressive, gender-equal, and in keeping with contemporary thought and practice.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Of-wedlock-and-deadlock/article16244239.ece
15,6,2010,Asia's global responsibility,"According to a recent assessment by the International Monetary Fund, Asia will grow by 7 per cent this year, with its bigger economies, China and India, posting higher rates. But leadership in the global economic recovery casts special responsibilities on these countries. Their current strengths, and the policy choices they will be making from now on, will have a significant bearing on the fortunes of the global economy. The debt crisis in Europe has added to the problems created by financial market volatility. Economic recovery has been uneven across regions; and in many countries, it is still fragile. The outlook is much better for the world's most populous continent. Output in most of Asia is well above pre-crisis levels and, for the first time, its contribution to a global recovery is outstripping that of other regions. In a development that portends well for the sustainability of growth, domestic consumption rather than an overwhelming dependence on exports has become the growth driver in most Asian economies.
There are two sets of risks the global economy faces. First, many advanced countries have practically exhausted the fiscal space available for continuing policy support. Secondly, the financial sector continues to be vulnerable to external shocks. A key concern is that political leaders in the developed countries have so far not been able to deliver on the promised bank reform packages. Adverse developments in Europe could disrupt trade in Asian economies. But fortunately the financial linkages to euro area economies are limited. The biggest challenge India and a few other emerging economies face relates to capital inflows. Asia's bright prospects have attracted large inflows of capital from developed countries, which have very low interest rates. This could lead to overheating in some cases. On the other hand, portfolio capital is known to be fickle and can quickly reverse course. Policymakers need to strike a balance in the crucial area of unwinding macroeconomic stimulus and financial sector support packages. The correct time frame will depend on the specific circumstances of each country. A key lesson from the crisis is that financial sector reforms are indispensable for lasting financial stability. While the Asian financial system has been resilient, it is important for banks in individual countries to stay ahead of the curve. Asia is not immune from developments elsewhere but the continent is in a very strong position to tackle the risks. At a policy level, it makes eminent sense for Asian countries to cooperate and coordinate their approach to global economic issues.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Asias-global-responsibility/article16244238.ece
16,6,2010,Double-digit inflation,"Inflation is spoiling the government's celebration of India's quick recovery from the effects of the global crisis. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) figures for May point to three worrying trends. First, for the fifth month now, the aggregate annual rate of inflation as reflected in the month-on-month increase in the WPI has been near or well above double-digit levels. The figures for May put inflation at 10.2 per cent over the year. Secondly, the current inflation is particularly sharp in the case of some essential commodities, as a result of which the prices of food articles as a group have risen by 16.5 per cent and of foodgrain by close to 10 per cent. Finally, there are clear signs that what was largely an inflation in food prices is now more generalised, with fuel prices rising by 13 per cent and manufactured goods prices by 6-7 per cent.
The government's response is that while this is a matter for concern, the trend is likely to reverse itself with the onset of the monsoon. To the extent that any policy response is being spoken of, the reference is mainly to a tightening of credit and an increase in interest rates by the Reserve Bank of India. This ignores important structural influences on the pace of price increase in the current conjuncture. One is the long-term neglect of agriculture, which has affected the level and pattern of agricultural production to an extent where supply-side constraints are leading to inflation every time growth picks up. The sudden and sharp hike in the support prices for pulses announced recently is an acknowledgement of this problem by the government. However, given the likely lag in output responses, the immediate fallout of that price increase could be an aggravation of inflationary trends. A second structural influence is the effect the policy of reducing subsidies, raising administered prices, and dismantling price controls has on the costs of production. Even when inflation is ruling high, the government is contemplating deregulation of the pricing of universal intermediates such as petroleum products. Finally, inflation is high and persistent, despite expectations of a normal or good monsoon, because the decision to give private trade a greater role in the markets for essentials has provided the basis for a new bout of speculation, which the government seems unable or unwilling to control. It is to corrections in these areas that it must turn when looking for a solution to the inflation problem — rather than merely look for relief from monetary policy adjustments.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Double-digit-inflation/article16245433.ece
16,6,2010,Schengen at 25,"The Schengen area, associated in this part of the world with a single travel visa — valid across several countries in the European Union (EU) and beyond — is now 25 years. It symbolises an arena of relative success in the grand project of regional integration. It is hard to make a similar claim with equal confidence, many would argue, with respect to the other visible sign of transnational integration — the decade-old single currency — in the wake of the handling of the impact of the financial crisis in the 16 countries that constitute the eurozone. The Schengen area, now comprising 22 of the 27 EU states besides Switzerland, Iceland, and Norway, entails the absence of internal barriers in a territory along a 42,673 km external sea and 7,721 km land borders. The freedom of movement thus guaranteed to more than 400 million people constitutes one of the EU's founding goals, complementary to the other objectives related to the movement of goods and services. During the early days of the elimination of national boundaries, the Benelux three decided to dispense with border checks in the 1960s. Their attempt blossomed into something more substantial when the big two EU founder members, France and Germany, joined forces in the historic agreement at the Belgian town of Schengen in 1985. When the Schengen Convention entered into force a decade later, Spain and Portugal had already been roped in.
A distinguishing feature of the Schengen zone is that its evolution has defied the general logic of EU expansion wherein each new impetus to closer integration comes from Brussels rather than from below. Accordingly, the easing of controls was an inter-governmental initiative among individual member states until it was adopted into the EU's legal and institutional framework under the 1999 Treaty of Amsterdam. However, the steady expansion of the internal borderless domain has necessitated deeper cooperation among states to combat organised crime, trafficking in drugs, and illegal migration and to enforce the counter-terror strategy effectively. Paradoxically, to the extent the member states are anxious to retain national jurisdiction over such highly sensitive areas, the scope for cross-border cooperation is varied and generally limited. The decision of Ireland and the United Kingdom to keep out of the most prominent feature of Schengen policy, the provision for a common visa, exemplifies the degree to which national reservations influence particular policies. A revision of this stance may not be a major priority for either country any time soon. But continued insularity from the general direction of progress in the EU is hard to imagine.

17,6,2010,Coalitions and contradictions,"Last June, the Bharatiya Janata Party's national executive meeting at Delhi was held under the shadow of defeat in the 2009 Lok Sabha election. The mood, reflected in the speeches as well as the resolutions, was introspective, with references to the party's “shortcomings” that needed to be “rectified.” This year, the BJP — which has since acquired a new President with Nitin Gadkari replacing a somewhat ineffectual Rajnath Singh — would have liked to project a more united and assertive face. Indeed, the three resolutions — on the growing Maoist threat, the United Progressive Alliance government's performance, and the Centre's “assault” on federalism — bear a combative stamp. But this year's party jamboree, held in Patna with an eye on the Bihar Assembly election due later this year, was overshadowed by unanticipated developments which deflected attention from the BJP's fierce criticism of the UPA and ended up creating a strain between the BJP and its senior partner in the State government — the Janata Dal (United).
Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's outburst about newspaper advertisements sponsored by Narendra Modi's admirers (one of which showed the Gujarat Chief Minister and Mr. Kumar hand in hand in an expression of solidarity) and his abrupt cancellation of a dinner he was to host for BJP leaders seem to have been calculated moves. With elections round the corner in a State with a 16 per cent Muslim population, the JD(U) needs to retain the traditional support it has enjoyed among the backward or pasmanda Muslims. By vociferously distancing itself from a hardliner in the BJP such as Mr. Modi, the JD (U) is at once stressing its secular credentials and underlining the fact that its relationship with the BJP is forged by expediency rather than ideology. While Mr. Kumar's flare-up has led to speculation that he could be doing a Naveen Patnaik – the Orissa Chief Minister dumped the BJP just before the 2009 election – the political arithmetic in Bihar is stacked differently. It is unlikely the JD(U) will risk challenging its principal enemy, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, on its own; also, the RJD would be even harder to beat in the event there is a revival of its alliance with the Congress. The ‘Nitish-Modi controversy' exposes more than just the gulf between the BJP and the JD(U). At a different level, it draws attention to a deep-seated internal contradiction within the National Democratic Alliance, which is made up largely of regional partners who are with the BJP only because they are principally opposed to some other party (usually, the Congress). The instability of the NDA, which has witnessed at least 10 parties leaving it since it was founded in 1998, is a reflection of this very contradiction.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Coalitions-and-contradictions/article16248730.ece
17,6,2010,A new challenge in Central Asia,"The ethnic violence in the Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan is a worrying development in a world already struggling to cope with numerous other flashpoints of conflict. It has claimed more than 180 lives so far and caused a massive humanitarian crisis spilling over into neighbouring Uzbekistan. The roots of Kyrgyz-Uzbek hostility reach far back in history, but the current outbreak of violence along this old fault line appears linked with the sudden ouster in April of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev. The new regime, an interim government of 14 opposition political parties headed by former diplomat Roza Otunbayeva, holds him responsible for orchestrating the riots. The anti-Uzbek riots are taking place in the southern region, where the deposed leader retains a strong following among the Kyrgyz population. The region is home to large numbers of ethnic Uzbeks, whose loyalties lie with the political set-up that replaced the corrupt and nepotistic Mr. Bakiyev. In mid-May, barely a month after the upheaval that saw the exit of the old order, more than 80 people were killed when Bakiyev supporters clashed violently with groups allied to the new dispensation. That was in the same southern cities consumed by this new round of violence. That the country is led by an unelected and fractious coalition has only complicated matters. With the violence said to be abating, President Otunbayeva's plan for a June 27 referendum on a new Constitution and democratic elections later in the year will hopefully remain unaffected. But her urgent appeal to Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev for military help as the crisis threatened to overtake the country of 5.5 millon people highlighted Moscow's crucial role in a region of strategic importance where several regional and international players, including the United States and China, wield considerable influence.
Despite its support to the new Kyrgyz government, Russia's cautious decision to put the matter before the Collective Security Treaty Organisation of seven Central Asian republics underlined the complexities of intervention in a high-stakes region. The CSTO decided to send logistical help such as helicopters and fuel, but no troops. Such caution, possibly born out of the international experience in Afghanistan, is heartening. But the instability in Kyrgyzstan is unlikely to disappear soon, and poses a new challenge for the region, especially to Russia. It is to be hoped that international powers will resist the temptation to exploit the situation for individual strategic advantage, and instead think of pitching in with responsible and constructive help.

18,6,2010,Hope in Manipur,"It is good that the United Progressive Alliance government has finally woken up to the suffering of the people of Manipur brought on by the 65-day economic blockade of the State by Naga political groups. The decision to send a convoy under armed escort to Manipur came after Naga student groups in Manipur refused to withdraw the blockade of National Highway 39 even after Nagaland-based groups lifted their siege on the State's crucial road link to the rest of the country. The latter were protesting Imphal's refusal to allow Thuingaleng Muivah, the leader of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (I-M), to travel to his ancestral village in Manipur. The Manipur-based Naga groups, on the other hand, are protesting the Ibobi government's decision to hold elections to the Autonomous District Councils, which they fear will erode autonomy for Naga tribes living in the hill districts of the State. The two sets of protests were provoked by different events but both are linked to the demand for Nagalim, a “greater Naga land” that will include territory from adjoining States, including Manipur. With each passing day, it became clearer that the central government's failure to end the blockade, and the attendant shortages and rise in the prices of essential commodities, including medicines, was a dereliction of constitutional and humanitarian duty. The first hopeful sign came when Nagaland student leaders met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in New Delhi. The government is still trying to persuade the Manipur-based Naga groups to withdraw their siege, failing which trucks escorted by paramilitary personnel will take supplies to Manipur. That the Centre had to cite in support of its decision a recent Guwahati High Court order asking it and the Manipur and Nagaland governments to clear the highway speaks volumes about the complexity of the situation.
The Meities of Manipur and the Nagas have adopted inflexible positions that make compromise seem difficult. While the Nagalim demand is totally unacceptable, Manipur's decision to hold the ADC elections, after a controversial amendment to the relevant law affecting the authority of the elected councils, exposed an exclusivist ethnic approach to politics and governance. Deplorable as the Naga blockade is, the Manipur government's decision to bar Mr. Muivah from visiting his village in the State has caused problems for the central government, which has been in peace talks with the separatist leader for more than a decade. While there are no easy answers, what the situation cries out for is a responsible and coherent policy approach that places the interests of ordinary people at the centre of decision-making.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Hope-in-Manipur/article16256222.ece
18,6,2010,The power of cash incentives,"The Janani Suraksha Yojana, a path-breaking conditional cash transfer initiative launched in 2005 to encourage deliveries at government health care facilities, has achieved some of its goals. It was launched at a time when India accounted for 20 per cent of maternal and 31 per cent of neonatal deaths in the world. Benefits started accruing a year after the scheme came into operation — the number of deliveries in government health facilities shot up by 36 per cent in Rajasthan and 53 per cent in Madhya Pradesh. A study based on survey data put out by the government for the period between late 2007 and early 2009 has been published recently in The Lancet (“India's Janani Suraksha Yojana, a conditional cash transfer programme to increase births in health facilities: an impact evaluation,” by Stephen S. Lim et al.). The study revealed that cash payment led to a reduction of about four perinatal deaths per 1,000 pregnancies, and two neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births. The analysis found no reduction in maternal mortality based on the district level data. The uptake of JSY did not vary much between rural and urban areas, despite rates being higher in rural areas. But other parameters, including wealth, age, and education of women, had a bearing across both high-focus and non-high-focus States. For instance, at the national level, the uptake was highest among those who had 1-5 and 6-11 years of education. Women availing of the cash incentive showed a typical pyramid profile, with those who were neither poor nor rich accessing it the most.
With a budget of Rs.1,540 crore and 9.5 million beneficiaries, JSY is the world's largest conditional cash transfer scheme. It has demonstrated that providing an incentive of Rs.600 and Rs.700 to women in urban and rural areas in non-high-focus States, and Rs.1,000 and Rs.1,400 in the case of high-focus States can bring about an overall reduction in the perinatal and neonatal deaths. However, effective measures are required to ensure that the benefits reach the poorest and the least educated women, who are in most need of skilled birth attendance. Although women availing of the cash incentive are required to attend three antenatal care visits, adherence was not good. Earlier studies have shown that quality of care is compromised for various reasons. For instance, early discharge after delivery, as soon as the women availed of the incentives, was reported. A modified system of staggered payments may be one way of ensuring better care. Though it may strain the system further, it can help reduce the number of maternal and neonatal deaths.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-power-of-cash-incentives/article16256291.ece
19,6,2010,The evolving tax code,"The government is to be commended for not only proactively seeking feedback on the draft Direct Tax Code (DTC) but also for responding positively to that. The first version of the code, released in August 2009, attracted plenty of interest from both professionals and lay people. The revised code, once again thrown open for a public discussion, is less rigorous than the earlier one in the crucial realm of personal and corporate taxation. However, in the process of allaying tax payers' genuine apprehensions, it might have departed from the original objective of ushering in a simplified tax system, with low rates and minimal exemptions. Nowhere is this more evident than in the case of the tax treatment of retirement benefits. The EET method (Exempt savings, Exempt interest on savings, but Tax withdrawals) proposed in the earlier version was meant to remove certain anomalies. Withdrawals from the retirement benefit schemes such as the provident fund and insurance schemes would have been taxed. The revised draft restores the tax exemption on the more important savings schemes, which is a welcome development in a country where high quality social security schemes are few. Promoting long-term contractual savings has been a national priority and taxing withdrawals of retirement benefits would have been a major disincentive to savers, insurance companies and others. In another departure from the earlier draft, the tax deduction for interest paid on housing loans will remain. It will protect to some extent home-owners from the vagaries of interest rate movements.
Companies will appreciate the decision to continue with the minimum alternate tax (MAT) on book profits rather than on gross assets as was proposed in the earlier version. The code was meant to curb some sharp practices such as padding up the value of assets, but industry associations and tax professionals argued convincingly against using gross assets as the basis since that would have been unfairly burdensome on capital-intensive and long-gestation projects besides loss-making companies. On many other debatable points, such as the powers to override tax treaties and the special concessions to the SEZs, the revised code has provided clarifications. There could conceivably be further revisions of the code before it is notified next year. In the meantime the government will do well to manage expectations. For instance, it is unlikely that individuals and corporations, having won back their concessions, will also get the benefit of considerably lower tax rates. And despite the best intentions to keep the code simple, there will still be a plethora of rules and exemptions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-evolving-tax-code/article16258236.ece
19,6,2010,Let the ban stay,"As the International Whaling Commission prepares to hold its 62 nd annual meeting from June 21 in Agadir, Morocco, there are strenuous attempts by a few nations to get the moratorium on the slaughter of whales lifted. The 24-year-old ban on commercial whaling has become an emotive issue for Japan, which cites historic and cultural reasons to justify its abhorrent hunts. There are some disturbing indications that behind the scenes, the cosmetics and food supplement industries may also be driving the agenda. The ban has not deterred Japan from sending factory ships each year into faraway Antarctic waters to hunt minke whales, and process their meat for sale. It has done so by invoking the IWC provision that allows the unilateral issue of permits to kill whales for scientific experiments. Iceland also used this loophole to launch a similar programme four years ago, while Norway has resorted to an objection clause to claim exemption from the moratorium. Such reasoning has become wearisome to the global conservation community, which finds little science emerging from the harpoons. The systematic violation of the ban has, on the other hand, seriously eroded the credibility of the IWC.
It would be monumental folly to accept the ‘compromise' proposal circulated in April by two senior IWC executives, including the chairman, to partially lift the ban on whaling commerce. Under that proposal, there will be small kill quotas for the existing whaling nations — Iceland, Norway, and Japan — and closer monitoring. The apprehension is that this measure could open the door to an enlarged whaling programme, attracting new entrants and marking a return to the 20 th century horrors of large-scale massacres. What the IWC should really sponsor is more science for conservation. The argument for true research is forcefully made by Australia, which has petitioned the International Court of Justice on Japan's violations. A government-funded 2009 study titled “Conservation and Values: Global Cetaceans Summary Report” points out that only a few of the 86 species recognised by the scientific committee of the IWC have been closely studied. There is a major void in knowledge about the biology, ecology, and status of the others. For instance, although the pro-whaling group says there are enough minkes to allow hunting, the Red List of the conservation body IUCN says data on the species are “deficient.” Meanwhile, threats to whales from other human-made causes, such as fisheries conflicts, noise disturbance, ship strikes, and pollution are growing. The Agadir meeting will serve a useful purpose if it can strengthen science and consider ways to enforce the ban.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Let-the-ban-stay/article16258237.ece
27,6,2010,Mistimed and insensitive,"In a move that some describe as bold and others as callous, the central government has substantially raised the prices of petrol, diesel, kerosene, and LPG. It has also moved to a decontrolled price regime in the case of petrol and promised to implement the same for diesel in the near future. The immediate and near-term impact of these decisions would be an aggravation of the inflation focussed on essential commodities that currently burden the common person. Petroleum products are consumed in some measure by all. Being universal intermediates, increases in their prices have a cascading effect on the costs and prices of all commodities, including essentials. Given the current inflationary surge, therefore, this is the worst time for hikes in, and the decontrol of, the prices of petroleum products.
The government's claim that this was unavoidable because of the “losses” being suffered by the oil marketing companies (OMCs) is difficult to swallow. When the domestic prices of oil products are controlled but the price of imported oil is rising, oil marketing companies receive from the consumer less than what it costs them to acquire the products they distribute. This leads to what are termed “under-recoveries.” However, in most years these under-recoveries do not turn oil refining and marketing firms into loss-making enterprises. This is because they deliver a range of products and services, the prices of all of which are not controlled. Under-recoveries are notional losses that only lower book profits relative to some benchmark. Thus, there is little danger that the industry would be bankrupted even if prices were kept at their earlier levels. Moreover, because until recently the industry was wholly in the public sector, the prices of oil products were treated as one set of instruments in the tax-cum-subsidy regime of the government. Any losses suffered by the industry or additional funds it required for investment could be met from resources mobilised through taxes that fall on the rich. There is, of course, the question of fairness. Since there are many players involved in the industry, there is no reason why under-recoveries should affect only the books of the oil marketing companies. This requires the oil refineries to offer discounts when selling products to the OMCs and for the government to reduce the taxes it levies on oil products in order to absorb part of the under-recovery. The government should have focussed on these matters for which rules can and have been devised. Opting instead for a steep hike in petroleum product prices in the midst of an inflationary episode is clearly mistimed, insensitive, and politically self-damaging. It also seems intended to favour the private companies that have been allowed to enter and expand in this sector. Private companies will treat any shortfall in profits as a “loss” and demand price adjustments. But they cannot be placated by unduly burdening the rest of society, especially the hundreds of millions of poor people.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mistimed-and-insensitive/article16272111.ece
27,6,2010,Timeless tennis,"The rationale for introducing sudden death in sporting encounters is founded on the premise that viewers, particularly in this age of shrinking attention spans, tire of long-drawn-out encounters. In tennis, the tiebreaker — the equivalent of the penalty shootout in football or a play-off in golf — is the peremptory method for arriving at a solution. The tiebreaker was introduced in Wimbledon as early as 1971. This was a decision justified by recalling an enervating contest between 41-year old Pancho Gonsalez and Charlie Pasarell in 1969, which seemed like it lasted forever. Although there would be no tiebreakers in the final set, their introduction in Wimbledon and other tournaments had an immediate impact on match length. Well, at least until last week. Stretching over three days and consuming 11 hours and five minutes, the epic first-round Wimbledon clash between John Isner and Nicolas Mahut was a marathon that made the Gonsalez-Pasarell contest seem like a 100-metre dash. By the time Isner won the fifth set 70-68, the world's longest tennis match had caught the attention of the world, hitting the band of most popular topics on Twitter, making it to the front pages of newspapers round the world, and even daring to steal a bit of attention from football at a time when the entire planet is waka waka over it.
That a seemingly interminable first-round encounter between two modestly talented players could have captured the world's imagination is a reflection of the truth that our love for sport is not driven by flair and genius alone. But time does usually matter today. The longest cricket Test match, between England and South Africa in 1939, consumed nine playing days — the outcome of a brief and aborted innovation to stage ‘Timeless Tests,' an idea spurred by the desire to force a result and, believe it or not, increase gate collections. Ironically, the farce ended in a draw — else the English would have missed their boat home. As for football, the world's longest match took place last month between two minor football clubs in England to raise money for an Indian charity. It lasted 35 hours, short of the 40 planned, thanks to England's default weather condition: rain. The lesson here: even in this age of short attention spans and multi-tasking, there is nothing like an unplanned battle of mammoth proportions to delight the eye and engage the mind.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Timeless-tennis/article15913454.ece
29,6,2010,Brinkmanship politics,"Over the past fortnight, the Janata Dal(United) and the Bharatiya Janata Party have practised a form of brinkmanship politics that is not unusual when partners have to go to elections with separate agendas. The latest in the long-winding saga is a possible rapprochement between the sniping allies. Though ideologically incompatible, the JD(U) and the BJP have proved to be a great political fit, with the JD(U)'s OBC base perfectly complementing the BJP's forward caste core vote. Yet politics is not business where tremendous care is taken to preserve a successful model. Like so many of the BJP's other past and present partners, the JD(U) has the self-image of a secular-liberal party practising an inclusive agenda. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is ambitious, image-conscious, and would like nothing more than to be able to win the upcoming Assembly election on his own terms. Naveen Patnaik in Orissa went through the same tensions with the BJP until, on the eve of the 2009 general election, he boldly threw off the Hindutva albatross, striking pay dirt with the gamble. Mr. Patnaik's was a swift, surgical operation that carried conviction with the voters. Unfortunately, Mr. Kumar has played the on-again, off-again game far too long for the electorate not to spot the opportunism in it. There was much talk of a JD(U)-BJP split around the time of the Biju Janata Dal-BJP break-up. Mr. Kumar volleyed and thundered but, as always, withdrew from the brink, going on to pose with none other than Narendra Modi at an election rally in Ludhiana.
It is no small irony that today the same photograph — used as advertisement by the BJP — has caused a fresh rift between the partners. Mr. Kumar is justified in taking the BJP to task for the advertisement, which the party appears to have released without the Chief Minister's express consent. Yet even he cannot deny that in 2009 he shared a political platform with Mr. Modi, and seemed none too concerned when the photograph in question appeared in print. Further, Mr. Kumar was a Cabinet Minister at the Centre at the time of the 2002 anti-Muslim pogrom in Gujarat. If the Bihar Chief Minister is serious about his secular credentials, he ought to go beyond grandstanding. Gestures such as returning the Gujarat government's Rs.5 crore flood relief assistance can backfire, more so should the JD(U) and the BJP jointly fight the election. For its part, the BJP ought to reflect seriously on its inability to retain allies, the latest instance of this being the unedifying drama played out in Jharkhand. Insider Jawant Singh might have beenfloored by Nitin Gadkari's charm offensive, but external allies willwant verifiable proof that the party has disinvested from its divisive agenda.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Brinkmanship-politics/article16272222.ece
29,6,2010,Australia's change of guard,"Politics has seen some fast moves but the one that unfolded in Australia last week had to be among the fastest. In less than 24 hours, Kevin Rudd, the hero of Labour party's comeback in the 2007 election and once the most popular Australian Prime Minister, saw the premiership slip from his hands into that of his deputy, Julia Gillard. The revolt within Labour was triggered by the rapidly falling popularity of Mr. Rudd and his government in opinion polls conducted in May. This happened after he deferred a vote on an important scheme to tackle climate change that was promised by Labour during the election campaign. The Emissions Trading Scheme was an initiative to reduce Australia's carbon emissions. But without adequate support for it in the powerful Senate, where Labour does not enjoy a majority, Mr. Rudd had to announce that the government would take a decision on how to proceed on it after a couple of years. It was amid the discontent over this issue that the government slapped a new tax on mining profits. In the face of a high-voltage campaign against the tax by the big mining companies and their shareholders, a beleaguered Mr. Rudd could not convincingly defend the idea that profits from a national resource must be shared nationally. With the government's ratings crashing in every opinion poll, and national elections due next year, a nervous Labour decided swiftly to jettison its leader in favour of Ms Gillard. In the end, Mr. Rudd's two big achievements — ratifying the Kyoto protocol, and a formal apology to the aboriginal people of Australia — were of little help in a high-stakes political battle.
The new Prime Minister, the first woman to make it to that office in Australia, faces the task of correcting the course of “a good government [that] was losing its way” and recouping lost ground for Labour. Ms Gillard, who entered parliament first in 1998, is known to be a pragmatic politician. One of her first actions in office was to reach out to the mining companies for negotiations to arrive at a compromise on the tax. She has also promised a review of the government's stand on carbon-trading. With immigration a major issue of concern to Australian voters, Ms Gillard has signalled a break from the Rudd vision of a “big Australia” and her preference instead for a “sustainable Australia.” It could end up giving Labour a Right-ish look but her party is unlikely to complain if it can win them the next election.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Australias-change-of-guard/article16272220.ece
29,6,2010,Long road ahead,"The main takeaway from the talks between India and Pakistan in Islamabad was that a dialogue between two sides burdened with a complex and difficult relationship has to be a constant, continuous process. It may not yield instant or even quick results. What it needs is political will to stay the course. Even by this scale of modest expectations, the two sets of talks last week managed to post some positive outcomes. Pointing to a new determination on both sides to make the dialogue process work, the discussions between the two Foreign Secretaries ended with the broad agreement to focus on the “doables,” a major change from previous such encounters at which all the emphasis was on the bilateral differences. The officials have thus managed to prepare a sound foundation for the scheduled July 15 meeting between the two Foreign Ministers, S. M. Krishna and Shah Mahmood Qureshi, who have been asked by their Prime Ministers to find ways to bridge the trust gap. Exactly what “doables” are being contemplated towards this end should become clear after this ministerial meeting. Although the two rounds of meetings between Home Minister P. Chidambaram and the Pakistan Interior Minister, Rehman Malik — on the sidelines of the SAARC conference of Home Ministers — have focussed mainly on the issue of the Mumbai attacks, there seems to be a new realisation on the Pakistan side that it needs to address Indian concerns on this more seriously. The announcement by Mr. Malik that his government was willing to share with Indian investigators the voice samples of some of the key accused in the Mumbai case who are under trial in Pakistan, so that these can be matched with the voices of the handlers who were directing the attacks, is a crucial step in trust-building. Mr. Chidambaram rightly pointed out that it was over the Mumbai attacks that relations between the two countries unravelled; in order to repair the ties, issues arising from these attacks need to be squarely dealt with.
Also immensely useful in taking the dialogue process forward after the Foreign Ministers' talks would be, as officials in New Delhi have noted, a clear acknowledgment from Pakistan of the progress made during the pre-2008 peace process. This has so far not been forthcoming, possibly because of the unease of owning a Musharraf legacy, even though it should flow naturally from the Pakistan government's insistence on the resumption of the composite dialogue process. Both sides will soon have to devote considerable diplomatic energy to arrive at a mutually acceptable framework for a full-scale dialogue, and it would be sensible to build on the achievements of the four rounds of talks that were held between 2004 and 2007.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Long-road-ahead/article16271187.ece
29,6,2010,Improve the archives,"The recent celebration of International Archives Day has turned the spotlight on the poor state of government archives in India. It serves as an urgent reminder of the imperative need to improve them. Despite a good early beginning — 1805 in the case of the Tamil Nadu Archives and 1891 in the case of National Archives of India — most government institutions have failed to keep pace with the developments in archival practices. The user experience and the public services they offer are far from satisfying. Unfortunately, historical records, though no less important than other forms of heritage, are low on government priority and can be said to be the most endangered. For instance, the National Archives, the premier institution that holds a 40 km. shelf-length of historical records, has a financial outlay of a paltry Rs.20 crore (2010-11). With this, it has to upkeep records, improve infrastructure, acquire new documents, provide grants to State-level organisations, and run the School of Archival Studies to train archivists. What is of equal concern is the poor utilisation of allotted funds. Poor planning and inefficient administration have added to the parlous state of archives.
Digitising records and providing information online is critical to the future of archives. It helps preservation by limiting the use of original records, improving public services, and facilitating better networking of archival repositories. Although the Working Group on Art and Culture for the Eleventh Five-Year Plan identified this as a priority, the target of digitising five million pages a year compares poorly with, say, the 33 million pages targeted annually by the United Kingdom. Archiving has to scale up quickly to cope with the large number of records and make up for lost time. To complicate matters, slow de-classification of records by government departments hampers this effort and affects the efficiency of archives. In the case of the National Archives, this factor alone accounts for holding up the acquisition of an estimated half a million records. With several institutions shifting to the digital mode of working, the major challenge facing India's archives is the preservation of digital information. An early decision on new collecting strategies is imperative if the loss of invaluable contemporary information is to be prevented. Innovative funding plans, capacity building, and a sincere commitment to protecting the historical record are vital to ensure the future of the past.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Improve-the-archives/article16271185.ece
30,6,2010,Last eight standing,"Not just flair and flamboyance but also power and precision contribute to success in football. Over the last three weeks, the FIFA World Cup in South Africa saw the top teams find winning ways through a combination of possession football and counter-attack. As the tournament enters the quarter-final stage, last World Cup's finalists, Italy and France, are back home but the pre-tournament favourites, Brazil and Spain, are still in line for a summit clash. Uruguay, Paraguay, and Ghana, the only African team in the last eight, have outperformed themselves. But other than Italy's exit in the first round, this World Cup has served up no shockers thus far. A group stage draw with Portugal aside, Brazil won all its games comfortably. With an unusually solid defence led by fullback Maicon, and a variety of attacking options with Robinho as the spearhead, the five-time champion revealed no flaws in its four matches. But while two unfancied teams, Uruguay and Ghana, will fight it out for the other semi-final slot from the same half of the draw, Brazil finds the Netherlands standing in its path. Argentina and the Netherlands are the only two teams with an all-win record thus far. Argentina, with 10 goals in four matches, tops in both goals per game (2.5) and shots on goal per game (9). Lionel Messi may be scoreless but he holds the record for the highest number of shots on target (13) among all players. Spain, which is taking possession football to new heights, tops in total passes completed (2,265) and pass completion rate (81 per cent). Youthful Germany is a strong contender for the crown: it has shown impressive speed and precision in counter-attacks that have demolished the opposition.
This World Cup could turn out to be the tournament that set football officialdom thinking seriously about the use of technology in refereeing. Several teams have suffered from faulty application of the offside rule but what will rankle fans and administrators the longest is the refereeing blunder in the Germany-England match, when Frank Lampard's shot landed in and bounced back and was not ruled a goal. While apologising to the English and Mexican federations for the refereeing errors, FIFA president Sepp Blatter has put the topic in sound context. Only goal-line technology, which can help determine whether the ball crossed the goal-line or not, will be on the discussion board. The irrefutable argument against bringing in video replays to settle questionable refereeing decisions is that they will ruin the free flow of the game. Fortunately, the two most talked about refereeing errors turned out to be of little consequence: Germany thrashed England 4-1, and in the match where Carlos Tevez scored from an off-side position, Argentina blocked out Mexico 3-1. By refusing to follow the cricket example of flirting with technology-supervised umpiring, football can remain a game of glorious uncertainties.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Last-eight-standing/article16273188.ece
30,6,2010,Ineffective consensus,"On the face of it, the G20 meeting at Toronto managed to reach a consensus on the two key issues of coordinating fiscal policies and framing global regulatory rules for the financial sector. The summit declaration was so worded that all sides could claim victory. On reining in fiscal deficits and reducing government indebtedness, it merely committed all countries to follow “growth-friendly fiscal consolidation plans,” halving their deficits by 2013 and stabilising the ratio of debt to gross domestic product by 2016. However, there would be no sanctions on countries not adhering to this guideline. No major policy changes are likely to follow either: almost all G20 countries are on course to hit the target by the stipulated time. The public message was that all countries, while shoring up domestic demand in the short run, would move towards fiscal consolidation, but at a pace to be decided by the country itself. The declaration reflected the dilemma faced by policy makers: synchronised fiscal adjustment across major economies would adversely impact the recovery but failure to consolidate where necessary would undermine confidence and growth. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's point that global recovery was still fragile and hence needed to be nurtured through continued public spending in the advanced countries was endorsed by other big emerging economies and the United States.
Some strange economic logic was apparently behind the papering over of differences related to fiscal policies. Countries with the lowest growth rates are the strongest advocates of fiscal cutbacks, while those with robust growth rates, such as India, are more relaxed about public spending. Dr. Singh's point that deflation was a greater risk than inflation is particularly valid for a country like Japan, while for India inflation has become a serious threat to growth. As for the United Kingdom, its new government has unveiled one of the toughest budgets in decades aimed specifically at correcting the structure of public finance. With so much of divergence over the issue, the G20 was hardly in a position to agree on anything tangible to guide the global economy. On the financial sector reform front also, it is unlikely that the world's biggest banks will come under new regulations anytime soon. The onus is on the Seoul summit scheduled for November to carry forward some of these key items on the agenda.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Ineffective-consensus/article16273187.ece
1,7,2010,Kashmir's street war,"Eleven people have been killed so far this summer — one, a nine-year old child — in murderous clashes between police and protesters. Polemicists have cast the violence as a new intifada against Indian rule. It isn't, and that makes the killings all the more tragic and deplorable. Kashmir's street war has been overwhelmingly concentrated in the old-town areas of Sopore, Baramulla, and Srinagar. Few of the clashes have involved more than a few hundred people. Home to artisans and traders, the old-towns have been in economic decline for decades, their historic dominance of the region's political life undermined by the emergence of new élites linked to public works contracts, the bureaucracy, and modern entrepreneurship. In recent years, they have become home to large numbers of prospect-less young people. Islamist polemic, the slogans of Kashmiri independence, and the hurled stone are the vocabulary of their inchoate rage.
The riots in Kashmir's old-town areas hold out two distinct challenges: one policing-linked, the other political. First, the death toll has exposed J&K's incapacity to contain the street violence, except through brutal suppression. In some cases, as video footage makes clear, the lives of police personnel were under imminent threat. In others, lethal force appears to have been used because of panic, lapses in planning, and poor training. Instead of working to develop effective, non-lethal crowd control forces of its own, J&K has relied heavily on the Central Reserve Police Force — an overworked organisation called upon to discharge a bewildering array of counter-terrorism, protection, and riot-control duties. The State government has 32,000 armed police personnel to deal with such crises. But to avoid public opprobrium, it has chosen not to take the lead role. As for the political challenge, Kashmir's old-town neighbourhoods have, for historical reasons, resisted the re-institutionalisation of organised politics that has taken place elsewhere in the State. National Conference leaders elected from these areas have ridden to power on low voter turnouts, not popular legitimacy. The power of local leaders of the religious Right, like Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, has been in decline; the opposition People's Democratic Party is focussed on its south Kashmir heartlands. It is no surprise that the protesters have proved immune to calls for restraint from a wide spectrum of leaders, ranging from secessionists, clerics, and political establishmentarians: none of them speaks for them. Kashmir's Islamist patriarch, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, has been the principal beneficiary of this void. Politicians cutting across party lines must address the rage that is driving the violence — or they will collectively pay the price.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Kashmirs-street-war/article16182276.ece
1,7,2010,Water on Mars,"After several attempts, researchers have successfully studied the composition of Mars' northern ancient crust. Much like the southern crust, the various hydrated clay minerals, mostly Fe/Mg phyllosilicates, indicate a high likelihood of an ancient environment that sustained surface and subsurface liquid water on the red planet. The paper, published online in Science (“Detection of hydrated silicates in crustal outcrops in the northern plains of Mars,” by J. Carter et al.), indicates that the hydrated minerals of ancient crustal rock in the northern hemisphere were formed by aqueous alteration at a high temperature and in a subsurface environment. The ancient crustal rock in the northern plain, unlike the one in the southern hemisphere, has remained unexplored so far because it is covered by a blanket of lava and sediments that is hundreds of metres thick. This blanket has been punctured at several points by huge craters created by asteroid impacts exposing the ancient crust. Using the images taken by sensors on board the European Space Agency's Mars Express and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the authors found hydrated minerals in nine of the 91 craters studied. The composition of the hydrated minerals strongly suggests that they were formed prior to asteroid impact and crater formation. In fact, being identical in composition with the phyllosilicates found in the southern hemisphere, the impacting asteroids could not have played a role in their formation.
In our solar system, after Earth, Mars may have a hospitable climate favourable to life, the basic requirement being the presence of water. The presence of water-ice clouds, similar to the cirrus clouds on Earth, in the atmosphere of the red planet, and their precipitation toward the ground were reported last year. The latest discovery indicates that Mars was once altered on a global scale by liquid water more than four billion years ago. But the close proximity of the hydrated silicates to unaltered olivine mineral, which is easily modified by water, suggests that the minerals were exposed to water only for a geologically short period of tens of million to hundreds of million years. It could also mean that they were not exposed to large bodies of water. Primary mineral hydration would have occurred within the crust partly in the subsurface. This is contrary to the views of a number of scientists that a shallow ocean covered the northern hemisphere after the craters were filled by lava and sediments.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Water-on-Mars/article16181214.ece
2,7,2010,Not out of the woods yet,"Madhav Kumar Nepal may finally have resigned as Prime Minister of Nepal but there will be no end to the political crisis in South Asia's youngest republic unless all its major political parties resolve to form a national government and do so quickly. There will be plenty of time in the future for adversarial politics but the moment now is for consensus so that the country's Constitution is finalised and fresh elections can be held. As the single largest party, the Maoists have the right to expect that the prime ministership of any national government should be held by them. This was the arrangement after the 2008 Constituent Assembly elections. Unfortunately, the government headed by the Maoist leader, Prachanda, was undercut by the Nepali Congress's refusal to join it and by the insubordination of the Nepal Army brass. Prachanda's resignation, which followed the misuse of presidential prerogatives to reinstate the dismissed army chief, allowed Mr. Nepal to form the government. But history will consider the administration he headed as a wasted year. India's role in needlessly prolonging this political stagnation is also unlikely to be judged very kindly.
Thanks to the stalemate, the original deadline for writing the new Constitution was missed. But unless serious steps are taken by the political parties, there is no reason to assume the new target date will be met. At the heart of this damaging crisis is the failure of the NC and UML to address the organisational and political shortcomings that led to their electoral defeat in 2008. The Maoists may not be able to repeat their spectacular performance next time round but chances are that their two major opponents will lose further ground. Under the circumstances, the principal leaders of these two parties would prefer to play backroom politics. That is why the NC and the CPN(UML) leadership will make every effort to ensure the Maoists do not head the government again and instead stake their own claim. But should a consensus evolve in favour of a Maoist-headed government, the two parties are likely to insist that the former rebels nominate someone other than Prachanda to be Prime Minister. On their part, the Maoists need to act with great maturity and restraint. Nothing should be allowed to come in the way of an arrangement that will facilitate the writing of the Constitution and the completion of the peace process through the integration of Maoist combatants and the democratisation of the Nepal army. It is clear that only a national unity government led by the Maoists can accomplish these tasks. The Maoists must be prepared to make reasonable compromises and concessions in order to win the trust of the other parties, and call their bluff.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Not-out-of-the-woods-yet/article16182339.ece
2,7,2010,A new benchmark?,"The introduction of a base rate mechanism that will set the floor for lending rates is hardly the seminal event it has been made out to be. Nor does the cluster of announcements by leading banks of their base rates give an indication of what the general level of lending rates will be after the new system settles down. The base rate mechanism is the same as the Prime Lending Rate (PLR) system that was in vogue in the early 1990s. The PLR mechanism was diluted over time, with too many categories of borrowers exempted from its purview. By 2001, it had become a mere reference rate, a far cry from what it was intended to be. There is a danger that the new system will meet a similar fate. For now, however, the Reserve Bank of India's directive to banks seeks to ensure transparency and uniformity in the methodology of calculating the base rate. Only a small number of borrowers — staff members, those availing of loans under the differential interest rate schemes, and a few other categories — will be charged rates that will be lower than the ones arrived at through the base rate method. The base rate will be calculated by each bank taking into account the cost of funds, possible loss incurred due to the reserve requirements, administrative costs, and the profit element. The actual rate to a borrower will be the base rate plus borrower-specific charges, product-specific operating costs, and premia on account of credit risks and tenure.
The point is that even though the base rates announced recently are in the region of just 7.5 to 8.25 per cent, they will not necessarily translate into lower borrowing costs. The chief merit of the new system is that it will make it difficult for top-rated customers to arm-twist banks to lend to them at rates well below the benchmark. That widely prevalent practice was regressive: small and medium borrowers were charged higher interest rates, thus subsidising the larger ones. The old system stood in the way of an orderly transmission of monetary policy signals. There is no guarantee that the new base rate system will not be circumvented by banks and their borrowers. However well laid down, it will be impossible to do away with subjectivity while calculating the final lending rates. Banks can be persuaded by their borrowers to subscribe to their commercial paper issue and thereby get funds at lower costs. As disintermediation gathers pace in the financial sector, banks will be facing greater competition from other intermediaries who may not be bound by central bank rules.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-new-benchmark/article16182337.ece
4,7,2010,Managing litigation sensibly,"Given the staggering number of pending cases in courts (estimated at over 30 million), any attempt to reduce the backlog deserves to be applauded. Since governments at the Centre and in the States are litigants in more than two-thirds of these cases, any official strategy to tackle judicial arrears must look inwards. The National Litigation Policy (NLP), unveiled recently by Law Minister Veerappa Moily, does exactly this by seeking to change governmental attitude towards litigation. Its central thrust is to transform government from being a compulsive litigant to a responsible, even reluctant, one. To achieve this aim, the NLP contains a series of guidelines for the filing of appeals, the availing of adjournments, and the seeking of arbitration as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism in certain kinds of financial cases. The policy envisages the appointment of nodal officers in government departments to proactively manage litigation and the setting up of empowered committees to monitor the implementation of the policy.
An interesting aspect of the NLP is that it addresses the issue of judicial backlog or delay not through the usual methods of structural reform (for example, by introducing amendments to existing acts to speed up cases) or raising additional resources (for example, having more courts or more judges). It does so entirely operationally — by attempting to change mindsets. But the goal of avoiding “litigation for the sake of litigation” is not easy in an environment where government officials are apprehensive about the consequences of making the right decision. Rather than risk criticism or come under some kind of scrutiny later, officials prefer to take the safe course — approach the court and let it decide. A climate of far greater security needs to be created in order to encourage them to take firm, independent decisions about which cases need to be pursued, which need to be dropped, and which are better suited to arbitration. It is important to stress here that such discretion is worthwhile only if it promotes rational and objective decision-making. Such discretion also carries a risk. If, for example, nodal officers are corrupt and choose not to file cases or not to go on appeal for wholly extraneous reasons, then justice will be subverted. The NLP cannot be faulted on paper but, as with any broad policy document, the key lies in the implementation. In this case, the challenge will be to ensure that the whole process of managing litigation, with the stated objective of reducing the number of pending cases involving government by half, is not allowed to be marred by corruption and bias.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Managing-litigation-sensibly/article16184827.ece
5,7,2010,Delhi gets a world class terminal,"In a country where infrastructure projects take inordinately long to complete, it is rare, if not unheard of, for the politician who lays the foundation stone to preside over its completion. The inauguration of New Delhi's new, gigantic airport terminal by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Saturday a record 37 months after he laid the foundation stone is a singular achievement in speed. But more than that, it has given the country an airport that is by many an assessment as good as any in the world. It had been a matter of great irony that the capital of a country with the ninth largest aviation market in the world should have an airport ranked a dismal 101 in terms of Air Service Quality performance. That was in 2007. With a vibrant private-public partnership taking over the modernisation of the airport, New Delhi has since improved that ranking to 21. The new Rs.12,700 crore Terminal-3 (T-3) should let it break into the world's top ten. The terminal has what it takes: 78 aerobridges and 168 check-in counters, automated baggage handling facilities, and security systems. And these promise to deliver passengers a service equal to the best in the world. From a strategic standpoint, T-3 will let New Delhi stake a claim to being a major international hub, with Air India planning to fully capitalise on this asset. Given the 35 million international passengers it generates, India and its airlines have let slip the opportunity to make this country the hub for international travel — allowing cities in west Asia and south-east Asia instead to thrive on India's travellers. This was due as much to a lack of good transit facilities at the country's airports as it was to the frailty of country's airlines. At least one of the issues now stands resolved.
It is to be hoped that the high standards of service quality the new terminal has set will be adopted by other airports round the country. Prime Minister Singh referred to the setting up of the Airport Economic Regulatory Authority to deal with matters relating to the new and modernised airports, including the levy of user charges. That holds the key. When airport developers invest so heavily in building such a facility, they will seek a viable return on that investment. That demand must be balanced with the need to keep air travel affordable and the sensitivities about passengers being asked to pay stiff airport charges. The Authority needs to engage both the developers and user agencies while fixing the levies. At airports elsewhere, non-aeronautical revenues come to shore up the balance sheet; Indian airports may need to turn to them as well.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Delhi-gets-a-world-class-terminal/article16184828.ece
6,7,2010,A blow for gender parity,"The creation of United Nations Women, an agency that will work for gender equality across the world, has come not a moment too soon. Over the last few years, there has been a growing feeling among women's rights organisations that gender-related issues had all but fallen off the crowded UN table. The decade that followed the high point of the International Year of the Woman in 1976 saw the UN spearheading some path-breaking developments, such as the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. But the spirit and promise of those years had faltered. The UN appeared helpless to drive the required systemic changes for improvements in the lives of women and children, although this is one of its Millennium Development Goals. Earlier this year, the UN Commission on the Status of Women, reviewing the implementation of the landmark 1995 Beijing Declaration, noted that progress was uneven or erratic at best. There are huge gaps between rhetoric and reality in key areas such as equal opportunities and access to education, health, and employment; ending violence against, and abuse of, women; and ensuring that women get paid equally with men for the work they do and that they have reproductive rights. A 2008 publication by the UN Development Fund for Women, Who Answers to Women?, brought out revealing statistics: women earn 17 per cent less than men; violence affects between 10 and 60 per cent of women and girls; worldwide, women are outnumbered two to one in political parties, and four to one in elected legislatures. Many member countries continue to have laws that openly discriminate against women. Across the world, when it comes to gender parity, governments are reluctant to put their money where their mouth is on issues. There is no system of accountability on commitments made.
The United Nations currently has four separate agencies, including UNIFEM, to work on women-related issues. This has resulted in fragmentation of its own work. Created through a unanimously adopted General Assembly resolution last week, UN Women will bring the four together, but is also expected to be stronger than the sum of its parts. This should enable the UN to track more effectively the resources being allocated worldwide for women's empowerment and determine the impact of these efforts. But it also has the hard job of persuading governments to commit more money to gender issues. Another challenge would be to enthuse the current generation of women to take up women's causes. It is with all this in mind that the UN must choose the Under Secretary General to head the new-born agency. As well as funding, the leadership of the new organisation will be the key to its success.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-blow-for-gender-parity/article16186033.ece
6,7,2010,Last four standing,"At the last 16 stage of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the South American teams seemed set to dominate the tournament. All the five nations from South America were in, and four of them (with Chile losing out to fellow South American Brazil) qualified for the quarterfinals. But things changed dramatically at this stage. Perennial favourite Brazil was outplayed by the Netherlands and the Seleção's principal rival from the same continent, Argentina, was routed by Germany. With Paraguay edged out by David Villa and Spain, only Uruguay from among the four qualified for the semi-finals. Europeans have never done well outside Europe but Africa is neutral territory. Uruguay is a winner of two World Cups but its triumphs came in 1930 and 1950, far removed from the world of football as we know it. The lone surviving South American team, which is in its first semi-final since 1970, is not exactly the favourite to win the title. For the first time, the World Cup should see a European team win outside its own continent. Brazil is the only team to have done that — in Sweden in 1958 and in Korea/Japan in 2002. Africa's hopes ended with Ghana, which lost tragically in a shoot-out to Uruguay after failing to convert an extra-time penalty kick.
Spain, who started out as the co-favourite with Brazil, now meets Germany, whose youngsters, especially Thomas Mueller and Mesut Oezil, have combined magnificently with veterans from the previous World Cup, Lukas Podolski and Miroslav Klose, to produce a flood of goals. Spain's possession football with a slow build-up towards attacking positions could more than meet its match in Germany's counter-attacking football that overruns rival defences. For Spain, striker Fernando Torres seems hopelessly out of form, but so long as Villa compensates with his purposive strides and accurate finishing, the Spaniards have the firepower to live up to their top billing. Both Germany and Spain had to overcome group-stage hiccups but have been in control in the knock-out games, overwhelming opponents in contrasting styles. The Netherlands is the only team to have won all its matches, that too in regulation time. Wesley Seneijder, now in the form of his life, is, along with Klose and Villa, in contention for the Golden Boot. Uruguay must count itself fortunate to get into this charmed circle but there is no question that the other three teams have been head and feet above the rest of the competition. Germany, with its combination of precise, fluid attack, formidable defence, and flair, is deservedly the bookmakers' favourite. Everything is set for an intriguing last four — and a rousing finale that was not quite part of the script.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Last-four-standing/article16186036.ece
7,7,2010,Common cause,"That ideologically polar opposites, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Left parties, chose to organise a nationwide bandh on the same day for the same cause speaks to the importance of the issue at stake: not just a hike in fuel prices but ushering in, without any public discussion, of a decontrolled price regime first for petrol, and later for diesel. Although they took to different platforms, constituents of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance and the Left parties ensured maximum impact in the States where they have a strong presence. Several partners of the United Progressive Alliance government are unhappy with the hike and indeed the bandh call held resonance for political parties across the ideological spectrum. While some of the parties not affiliated to the UPA, the NDA, and the Left — notably the Bahujan Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh and the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Lok Janshakti Party in Bihar — did not participate in the general strike, they too have expressed opposition to the price hike. Indeed, the RJD and the LJP are planning a protest in Bihar on July 10. States ruled by the NDA and the Left parties — Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal, and Kerala — witnessed near-total participation in the strike. The bandh call also evoked a significant response in several other States, including Congress-ruled Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Haryana, and Delhi. Even where the State governments were pre-disposed toward busting the strike, air, rail and road traffic were affected, and many shops and establishments closed.
By embarking on decontrolling fuel prices at a time of high inflation and rising prices, the UPA government showed it cared little for popular sensibilities. With Assembly elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Assam almost a year away, the Congress leadership seems to have cynically calculated that if there was such a thing as the right time for an unpopular measure, it was now. Decontrol of the price regime would not only benefit private oil companies, but also pave the way for the entry of multinational companies in retail of petroleum products. By linking the prices of petrol and diesel to international crude prices, the government is, in effect, surrendering the responsibility for protecting consumer interests. But there is no political insulation from rising prices. Although the bandh did cause inconvenience to the public by disrupting normal life in several States, it would have served its purpose if it forced the government to rethink deregulation in this case. If the government is serious about intervening in case of volatility in international crude prices, as stated by Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Murli Deora, why should it not cease and desist from decontrolling the price regime in the first place?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Common-cause/article16188251.ece
7,7,2010,Mark of the Taliban,"The act of a gang that cut off the hand of a college teacher, by wielding an axe on a thoroughfare in Kerala in broad daylight, had Talibanism writ all over it. The State has been noted historically for the peaceful co-existence of different faiths and beliefs. This act of barbarism, however, points to the rise of blood-thirst driven by religious fundamentalism that certain fringe elements may be seeking to impose on the State. That it was a planned operation carried out with brutal intent adds to the shock. Without reference to the nature of the alleged provocation behind the act, what has happened is a challenge to civilised society and the rule of law. After all, the management of the college concerned had suspended the teacher for an inappropriate reference to the Prophet that appeared in an examination question paper and apologised for the aberration. The law has been taking its course and a criminal case against the teacher was being pursued. What the criminal fanatics have managed to do is to put on the defensive those who support the secular-democratic cause, and give a handle to majoritarian intolerance. The culprits need to be apprehended and prosecuted immediately.
If there is a silver lining here, it is that every political party in Kerala, organisations across the country representing both the religions concerned, and democratically minded sections of society have been prompt in condemning Sunday's savagery. Hearteningly, several Muslim youth organisations came forward to offer blood to the victim as he lay fighting for life in a Kochi hospital. To its credit, the State government has acted swiftly and decisively at every stage — a fact acknowledged amply during the course of a discussion in the State Assembly. The House condemned the incident in one voice. Most important, the atrocity did not trigger any communal backlash. But there is a larger lesson here. Freedom of expression has increasingly come under attack from religious fanatics in democratic and secular India and it is the duty of society and the political system to intervene more effectively to defend those who are targeted even if they express unpopular views. At the same time, those who work in academia and those who value intellectual freedom and creativity must be sensitive to the political-social contexts, which are quite often fragile if not volatile. All sections must unite to ensure that the heart-rending tragedy of a teacher making a misjudgment and ending up losing his hand to an act of Talibanesque savagery is never repeated.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mark-of-the-Taliban/article16187113.ece
8,7,2010,Imperatives for Cancun,"Can Cancun do what Copenhagen could not? Negotiations have resumed after the failed climate conference of December 2009 but few believe that a strong agreement will emerge at the 16th Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to be held in Mexico later this year. Climate negotiations have generally lost traction, and the chances for a deal appear to have receded to the 2011 meeting in Africa. For the developing nations that are fighting poverty with fast-paced economic growth, even the idea of a low carbon economy is far from settled. That is not surprising because in the developed world, with its far greater capacities, industry is still waiting for agreed global standards on carbon accounting, which is essential to undertake voluntary actions. Also, there is justified concern at the policymaking level that the equity-based principle — of common but differentiated responsibility for the rich and poor countries — is under threat, post-Copenhagen. That was evident last month during the sessions of the UNFCCC Ad-hoc Working Group on Long-Term Cooperative Action in Germany, when the controversial concept of peaking of emissions for developing countries by 2020 was sought to be introduced into a fresh negotiating text.
Attempts to equate developing country liabilities with those of the developed world divert attention from the real issue. It is that rich countries need to cut emissions even deeper than what has been promised. That argument was firmly made by the outgoing executive secretary of the UNFCCC, Yvo de Boer, at the Deutsche Welle Global Media Forum in Bonn recently. The current pledges made by the industrialised countries cannot achieve the 25-40 per cent emissions reduction that the IPCC says is necessary to try and limit global temperature rise to less than two degrees Celsius. It is not helpful either that this wealthy bloc, which did not take its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol seriously, has left the reference year for emissions targets unspecified. There is a lot of disappointment in climate talks, but the global South is engaging in some enlightened cooperative actions. A promising example is Brazil's technology transfer programme with China, under which it is using satellite mapping to assess forest loss; the two countries are also helping Africa in the area of biofuels. These are good models. They cannot, however, replace a working global agreement. What is needed is a deal that enables liberal transfer of funds and technology in the short term for green energy production in the emerging economies, which will account for an estimated 93 per cent of the increase in energy demand in just two decades.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Imperatives-for-Cancun/article16188276.ece
8,7,2010,No surprise this,"The Reserve Bank of India's decision to hike the two short-term policy interest rates, the repo and the reverse repo, by 0.25 percentage point was not unexpected. In fact, macroeconomic developments since the April policy statement suggested a policy intervention even earlier. The relatively small hike in the policy rates suggests that there could be another increase after the July monetary policy review meeting. Economic growth in India has been on a fast track. The official revised growth estimates by the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) for 2009-10 and the fourth quarter of last year indicate that the economy is consolidating. There is a strong possibility that the various official growth projections for the current year, including the one by the RBI, will be revised upwards. Industrial output in April grew 17.6 per cent over what it was a year ago, aided in part by the recovery in exports. There has been a sharp upturn in the capital goods sector. Further corroboration is seen in the increase in credit and the widening current account deficit. Monsoon rainfall, though delayed in the beginning, is expected to be normal for the season as a whole. However, inflation that jumped to 10.2 per cent in May is clearly the worry. The recent decontrol of petrol prices and the hike in the prices of diesel, kerosene, and cooking gas may add one percentage point to headline inflation. What is particularly worrying is that while food inflation has come down slightly, core inflation, which excludes food and fuel prices, is on the rise.
However, while the case for anti-inflation measures has been very strong, the RBI cannot ignore the concerns of the fast-growing economy. It is this classic dilemma of having to balance price stability with the credit requirements of the real economy that explains why the RBI has been late this time and, by many yardsticks, is still behind the curve. Liquidity was particularly tight during June. Almost Rs.68,000 crore were paid to the government by the successful bidders in the 3G telecom auctions; and advance tax payments drained another nearly Rs.35,000 crore. Certain liquidity-easing measures put in place by the RBI in June are therefore being extended, though for a short period. Easing liquidity, while simultaneously raising rates, is not inconsistent with a policy of calibrated exit from an expansive monetary policy. The latest RBI action has come soon after the banks adopted a new and more transparent method of arriving at the base lending rate. The impact of the RBI's interest rate signals and indeed the efficacy of monetary transmission can therefore be more accurately gauged.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/No-surprise-this/article16188275.ece
9,7,2010,Nuclear talks with Japan,"Given the sensitivity surrounding the atomic issue in Japan, Prime Minister Naoto Kan's decision to begin negotiations on a nuclear cooperation agreement with India is especially bold and forward-looking. Until recently, the working group on energy was considered the sole vehicle for exploring nuclear trade. Mindful of Japanese public sentiment, the Indian side has been careful not to be impatient. In October 2008, while on a visit to Tokyo, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said India would move at “a pace at which the Japanese people and government are comfortable,” when asked about the prospect of a bilateral nuclear agreement. Since then, Japan has had two changes of government. Taro Aso made way for Yukio Hatoyama after this year's landmark electoral victory of the Democratic Party of Japan, and he, in turn, has been replaced by Mr. Kan. If the question of bilateral nuclear trade has acquired a new urgency, it is because American and French companies, which hope to conclude major deals for the construction of reactors in India, need to source key components from Japanese firms like Mitsubishi Heavy. The commercial pressure from these companies apart, South Korea's decision to negotiate an agreement with India for the supply of reactors seems to have nudged Tokyo in the direction of relaxing its ‘no nuclear trade with Delhi' stance.
Apart from ironing out the technical aspects of any bilateral nuclear agreement, it is natural that Japan will want India to reiterate its non-proliferation commitments. Already, the Japanese pacifist lobbies have stepped up to the plate to caution the Kan government about providing nuclear equipment to a country that has not signed the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty or even the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. India's position on both these treaties is clear enough: NPT membership is an impossibility; and though its attitude to the CTBT will depend on U.S. and Chinese accession, its test moratorium will remain firmly in place. Beyond these two issues, however, there is much that India and Japan share on the question of nuclear disarmament. India recently put forward an updated version of the Rajiv Gandhi Action Plan, many of whose proposals can serve as intermediate steps towards the ultimate goal of a nuclear free world. While the discussions on nuclear commerce will necessarily be handled by the atomic establishments from both sides, the 2+2 secretary-level dialogue provides a useful platform for India and Japan to evolve common positions on the wider question of nuclear disarmament.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Nuclear-talks-with-Japan/article16190594.ece
9,7,2010,Last two standing,"With Spain joining the Netherlands for the final at Soccer City in Johannesburg on Sunday, the FIFA World Cup will see a first-time winner. For Spain, which started as joint favourite with Brazil but whose World Cup record is poor, this is the first appearance in a final. The Netherlands, which lost to Germany in 1974 and to Argentina in 1978, is hoping to get third time lucky. On the previous three occasions the World Cup saw a first-time winner — France in 1998, Argentina in 1978, and England in 1966 — the triumphs were all on home soil. One of the finalists will join Brazil and Germany as the only teams to have won their first title away from home. Although the Spaniards seemed to control the flow of the game in all their matches except the very first, which they lost to Switzerland, they have not found the net as often as they would have liked to. Unlike Germany or Argentina, who looked to attack all the time and overwhelmed weaker opponents, they have not scored more than two goals in any match. Four of their five wins have been by the narrowest of margins. Yet, with their version of possession football, dominated by short passes with quick release of the ball and painstakingly slow progress toward goal-scoring positions, they have smothered opponents. Germany was never given the space or the freedom by the Spanish midfield, organised around Xavi and Andres Iniesta, which was quicker in falling back without the ball than in pushing ahead with it. Despite promising much, the youthful Germans, who clearly missed Thomas Mueller owing to suspension, were unable to run past the Spanish defence.
The Netherlands, which has won all its matches so far within regulation time, was clinical in both defence and attack, never doing more than what it needed to do. The Dutch won their opening match against the Danes by a two-goal margin, but in every subsequent match, only one goal separated them from the loser. But at no point in their matches did Oranje seem short of confidence, not even when they were a goal down against Brazil. Although they pale in comparison with the 1970s team that was synonymous with Total Football, Bert van Marwijk's men have what it takes to win the FIFA World Cup. Both Spain and the Netherlands have enjoyed their share of luck during the tournament, but then, the better teams are also likely to be luckier. In any case, none should grudge the role of luck in sport, and certainly not in a World Cup where Paul the German octopus is enjoying hundred per cent strike rate in picking winners. Breaking its rule not to soothsay about any game not involving Germany, the psychic mollusc will pick the winner of the final. It will surely pick Spain. In any case we do.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Last-two-standing/article16189445.ece
9,7,2010,Vultures cling on,"The successful captive breeding of vultures belonging to three critically endangered species in the flagship conservation centre at Pinjore in Haryana could be a turning point in the struggle to save these birds from extinction in the subcontinent. For many years now, conservation organisations such as the Bombay Natural History Society and its international partner agencies have been working diligently to bring the carrion feeders back from the brink. The Union Ministry of Environment and Forests must be commended for recognising, and acting on, the fast-spreading crisis that threatened the future of three species — the oriental white-backed, slender-billed and long-billed vultures. The action plan it formulated and adopted four years ago for their protection has begun to deliver. The real breakthrough came when scientific investigations identified the veterinary drug diclofenac as the cause of fatal visceral gout, which led to the crash in populations during the 1990s. Vultures feasting on carrion of cattle that carried traces of the drug perished not just in India but in neighbouring countries as well. That research consensus helped governments in the major range countries — India, Nepal and Pakistan — to impose a ban on diclofenac veterinary formulations.
The challenge before conservationists now is to create ‘safe zones' in areas where both rare populations and captive-bred birds can survive. Such areas require a mix of community participation, substitution of diclofenac with the benign drug meloxicam, and projects to acquire large numbers of dying cattle that pose no toxic risk. There are encouraging results from such measures in Nepal. Given the plenitude of cattle in India, it is eminently possible to start such safe shelters. Although they may not be the birds of heaven that cranes are to some, there is tremendous interest in watching these alert scavengers of nature in their natural setting. Africa has recognised the potential for revenue from vulture ‘restaurants' — where tourists can watch them dispose of a carcass. The BNHS has also proposed viewing platforms for eco-tourists at feeding sites. This can be a rewarding programme that also pays for itself. There are parallel initiatives under way in many countries in Africa and Europe to arrest vulture population declines. India can learn a lot from their good practice. What is most important is to safeguard the birds in forests and protected habitat by preventing encroachment by domestic cattle. Combined with a strong captive breeding programme, this should go some way towards stopping the tragic decline in vulture numbers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Vultures-cling-on/article16189443.ece
10,7,2010,Kashmir's politicians must act,"Indian troops drove through Srinagar's streets on Wednesday in an effort to quell the violence that has bloodied the city this summer: the first time military force has ever been used to assist riot control efforts in Jammu and Kashmir's summer capital. So why now? Fourteen protesters had died at the hands of police since June and there was no sign of the violence abating. There was the apprehension that pilgrims to the Amarnath shrine might be targeted by mobs and that in turn might spark off communal violence in Jammu and elsewhere. But tragic as the toll has been, there was no case for calling out the Army. Kashmir has seen higher fatalities, and more intense clashes, in recent years. The J&K Police and the Central Reserve Police Force have more than once demonstrated that they can deal with the violence — and, when well-officered, with minimal recourse to lethal force. Perceptions have been distorted by some hysterical reporting. Fortunately, Srinagar hasn't been handed over to the Army. But committing the military to crowd management duties will, sooner or later, lead to confrontation with unarmed protesters — and given that the Army isn't trained in riot control, bloodshed.
Is there a way forward? First, Jammu and Kashmir could start developing effective but non-lethal crowd control resources. Killings of unarmed protesters are a growing national malaise, the outcome of poor training and organisational flaws. Actually, in recent years, the police in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh have killed large multiples of the numbers of civilians shot by their counterparts in J&K. But the State must not draw too much consolation from this. Democratic political parties must immediately forge an agenda for political action and development in cities in the valley, where a combination of historical factors has ensured that young people are both angry and voiceless. Earlier this week, in a television interview marked by breathtaking honesty, a former Deputy Chief Minister lashed out at J&K's political class for blaming the Indian government, and its armed forces, for problems they had themselves created. Muzaffar Hussain Beigh of the People's Democratic Party charged politicians, himself included, with “betraying” the State's youth. He sharply criticised those who perpetuated a culture of hate by telling their children they had no future in a “Hindu country.” This is the kind of honesty and introspection needed if a way forward is to be found. Politicians in the State, as well as their counterparts in New Delhi, must ask themselves some hard questions — and accept unwelcome answers — if the senseless sacrifice of teenagers' lives is to end.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Kashmirs-politicians-must-act/article16190627.ece
11,7,2010,"China, India, and Pakistan","President Asif Ali Zardari's visit to China has caused predictable anxiety among those in India who tend to view relations with Beijing as a zero-sum game with Islamabad. Mr. Zardari has been a frequent flyer to China — three times last year — but this second official visit after October 2008 seems to have caused much apprehension in official India. First, there was China's reported plan to build two more nuclear reactors at Chashma. Then it was a proposed rail link from Kashgar in China's Xinjiang region, across the Karakoram mountains to Havelian in Pakistan's Pakhtunkhwa province (formerly North West Frontier Province). Just for perspective, during Mr. Zardari's five-day visit, the two sides signed six agreements on agriculture, healthcare, justice, media, economy, and technology. Presidents Zardari and Hu Jintao jointly pledged to fight the “three forces” of extremism, terrorism, and separatism. However, there was no official word from China on its nuclear cooperation with Pakistan, although it is definitely on the cards. The rail link is less certain. Envisaged as running parallel to the Karakoram Highway, across the Khunjerab Pass and through the disputed Gilgit-Baltistan region, the rail idea has been around since 2004; last year, both sides held preliminary talks for carrying out a feasibility study. Islamabad is keen but the extent of Chinese interest in the project is yet unclear. The Karakoram Highway, the highest paved road in the world, built with Chinese assistance, has proved an expensive link to maintain. A railway line would prove far more expensive.
It is true that the relations Pakistan has with China are the best it has with any country in the world. They have withstood the strain of shifting international relations for more than 60 years. However, it is by no means a problem-free friendship. There have been tensions over alleged training camps for separatist Xinjiang militant groups in Pakistan's north-west frontier region. Islamabad felt let down that its “all-weather friend” offered little help during a financial crunch in 2008, forcing it to knock on the doors of the International Monetary Fund. But this friendship has solid foundations, and it is time India recognised that it cannot alter the dynamics of the Pakistan-China relationship to suit its own needs. It would be more useful to focus on ways to improve India's own relations with China, and protect the substantial progress made since 1988. As National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon emphasised during his visit to Beijing, the India-China relationship has its own logic. Linking it with another bilateral relationship, which is driven by its own logic, would be self-defeating.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/China-India-and-Pakistan/article16193247.ece
11,7,2010,Protectionism amidst recovery,"A recent report of the World Trade Organisation, which has been monitoring trade and related developments since the end of the crisis, is generally positive on the prospects for open trade, although there are significant risks on the horizon. The report, which covers the six-month period ending May 2010, observes that many countries have resisted pressures to erect trade barriers. However, trade restraints of earlier periods remain, and there has been a marked reluctance to dismantle them. The WTO's two-point advice to countries — one, prevent further accumulation and two, exit from current restrictive practices — is unlikely to be acted upon in a hurry. The world economy has been recovering but the progress is too uneven to inspire confidence. The bigger emerging economies led by China and India are compensating for the lacklustre performance of the advanced economies. Merchandise trade is forecast to expand by 9.5 per cent in 2010, after an unprecedented decline of more than 12 per cent a year ago. Trade has an important role in anchoring the global economic recovery. However, despite the universal acknowledgment of the efficacy of open trade in realising important socio-economic goals — such as economic growth and poverty reduction — policymakers have been unable or unwilling to look at the big picture.
In many countries, open trade has remained captive to short-term political and economic compulsions. At this juncture, the two biggest threats are: the persistently high unemployment levels in the advanced economies, and the high level of public indebtedness in many European countries. In advanced economies, unemployment is projected to stay close to 9 per cent through 2011 and to decline thereafter, but only slowly. Jobless growth has spawned protectionist tendencies in the United States. These include tighter visa rules for skilled persons and steps to make outsourcing less attractive for domestic companies. The continued failure to revive the nine-year-old Doha development round shows, above all, the collective failure of all countries to institutionalise multilateral trade rules under the aegis of the WTO. At their recent meeting at Toronto, the G20 leaders skipped their 2009 pledge to finalise the Doha round this year. They, however, agreed to halve the budget deficit of their respective countries by 2013. This would certainly be good for their public finance, but in the absence of expansive government spending, these countries will need to look at exports for their growth. There is a fear that, in their bid to stay in competition, at least some of them would resort to unfair trade practices.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Protectionism-amidst-recovery/article16193246.ece
12,7,2010,Early humans in a colder climate,"When and how far did early humans venture into the cold climatic regions after they first moved out of Africa nearly 1.75 million years ago? Evidence for the earliest human occupation outside Africa has been reported from the island of Flores in the east to the Iberian Peninsula. Being restricted to latitudes not beyond 45º N, these locations were tropical, steppe, or Mediterranean settings. Even the early human presence at 52° N dating back to about 700,000 years ago in a forest-bed in Pakefield in Suffolk, U.K., was in a Mediterranean climate. A paper published online in Nature (“Early Pleistocene human occupation at the edge of the boreal zone in northwest Europe,” by Simon A. Parfitt et al., vol. 466, no.7303, p. 229-233) has found early humans to be more adventurous than anyone imagined. The rich haul of artefacts recovered at 52° N latitude of Happisburg, in East Anglia, U.K., is from the southern fringes of the boreal zone that is marked by a definite winter with snow. The artefacts aside, Happisburg turned out to be a treasure trove of well-preserved plant and animal fossils. These fossils strongly suggest summer temperatures between 16° and 18° C, and winter temperatures between 0 and -3° C; this means they approximated the present-day climate seen near the transition of temperate and boreal zones.
The last time a reversal in the polarity of the Earth's magnetic field happened (when South Pole became the North Pole of today) was 780,000 years ago. The Happisburg sediments exhibit reversed polarity and this helps in setting a lower age limit for the artefacts. Palaeobotanical studies enable us to further narrow down the time of human occupation. The pollen grains and vegetation strongly suggest that human presence would have happened during the warm interglacial period around 840,000 or 950,000 years ago. The plant fossils suggest a conifer-dominated forest characterised by poor plant and animal food resources during winter. The early humans, probably the Homo antecessor, who inhabited the upper estuarine zone of River Thames would have survived the winter by turning to the water bodies. There is no evidence on how the early humans adapted themselves to the harsh winter. But survival would have been possible because they lived in a transition area between resource-poor forests and resource-rich habitats of river, marsh, and coast. Only more studies can reveal if early humans arrived during the peak warmer interglacial periods or during the colder periods.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Early-humans-in-a-colder-climate/article16194582.ece
13,7,2010,Viva Espana & South Africa,"Spain started as a favourite and ended as the winner but the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa did not go along expected lines. La Roja themselves contributed to the twists and turns of a dramatic tournament, as they became the first team to win the title after losing the opening match. With both Spain and the Netherlands playing out an undistinguished final, tough, defensive, and risk-averse, the match turned out to be a scrappy affair. English referee Howard Webb adopted a no-nonsense, but not bloody-minded, approach. The final saw a record number of yellow cards (14), nine for the Dutch, and five for the Spaniards. Coming on top of the 15 yellow cards they collected in previous six matches, this did not earn Oranje any new fans in the World Cup. But Spain stuck to its tried and tested methods throughout: dominating possession in the midfield, and waiting patiently for good finishing at the forward line. In the end, Andres Iniesta's right-footer in the 116th minute (second half of extra-time) secured a 1-0 victory. In fact, Spain won its four knock-out matches by an identical margin, quite uncharacteristic for a champion side. With the ball at their feet, the Spaniards seemed more intent on playing among themselves than on sending it toward the goal. But with their captain Iker Casillas, the eventual winner of the Golden Glove award, under the bar, they did not have too much to worry about. Spain conceded just two goals in the entire tournament: a record for a winning team shared with France (1998) and Italy (2006). However, the second successive all-European final, and the eighth overall, was not without its bright moments. Arjen Robben had a couple of good runs only to be denied by Casillas. Likewise, the Dutch goalkeeper, Maarten Stekelenburg, made sure the scores stayed level by keeping David Villa and Sergio Ramos at bay.
This World Cup was not just about football of course. Africa's first World Cup was quite fittingly hosted by South Africa, standing up free and proud after the long dark night of apartheid. Anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela was the hero of the closing ceremony and was greeted by vuvuzelas and roars from the fans at Soccer City. FIFA owes a great part of the success of the tournament to the organisational capabilities of this liberated rainbow nation. Unfortunately, despite the natural talent and the foreign coaches, none of the African nations made it to the last four. Ghana, the sole African representative in the quarter finals, was unlucky to be denied by an appalling hand block by Uruguay. But this World Cup might mark the beginning of a new phase in world football — a phase in which African nations will hold a prominent place alongside the Europeans and the South Americans.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Viva-Espana-amp-South-Africa/article16194557.ece
14,7,2010,Checking child sexual abuse,"The sexual abuse of children is one of the most heinous crimes imaginable. It is an appalling violation of their trust, an ugly breach of our commitment to protect the innocent. Reliable estimates are hard to come by since this is a furtive form of abuse, often causing victims to suffer in dark and claustrophobic silence. A 2007 study by the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) found that 53.22 per cent of India's children have experienced some form of sexual abuse. Against this background, the lack of specific provisions for child sexual abuse in our criminal law is a serious lacuna. Rape is an offence under the Indian Penal Code, but lesser forms of sexual offences against children, which constitute a broad range including groping and harassment, are covered by grossly inadequate and inexact provisions such as “outraging the modesty of a woman.” The second working draft of the Protection of Children from Sexual Assault Bill addresses this weakness by specifying various forms of sexual abuse against girls and boys under the age of 18. The gender neutrality of the proposed legislation is noteworthy since sexual abuse against boys, despite naive presumptions to the contrary, is rampant. The MWCD report, which surveyed 12,447 children, found the majority of victims (52.94 per cent) were boys. Significantly, the draft Bill permits sexual activity if a person is above 16 years of age, provided such activity satisfies the definition of consent as laid down by it.
The provisional draft, which has emerged from consultations between the Law Ministry and NGOs, provides for stringent punishments, ranging from three years in prison for sexual harassment to life imprisonment for aggravated sexual assault. More importantly, it deals with sexual abuse in a comprehensive and sensitive manner. Apart from prescribing that all such cases be tried in special courts, the draft specifies procedures to be followed for recording a child's evidence, for protecting his or her identity, and for providing the child with assistance from NGOs and experts in pre-trial and trial stages. A grave flaw in the draft, which is strongly opposed by some activists who have been critical in its very formulation, is that the burden of proof has been shifted on to the accused. This could encourage the misuse of the law — for example, when bitterly estranged couples fight divorce or custody cases — and the Law Ministry must seriously consider deleting the ‘reverse onus' provision. It would be a shame if a sound and progressive law is allowed to be marred by something that controverts the basic jurisprudential canon that people accused of crimes are presumed innocent until found guilty.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Checking-child-sexual-abuse/article16195463.ece
14,7,2010,Behind Vostok-2010,"Russia recently conducted its largest military exercise since the breakup of the Soviet Union. More than 20,000 troops, 75 combat aircraft, 40 warships from the Pacific, Northern and Black Sea Fleets, and 5,500 pieces of heavy weapons were mobilised for 10-day war games code-named Vostok-2010. The military practised repulsing seaborne, air and land attacks and mounting counteroffensive operations in Siberia and the Far East. The western media were quick to suggest that Russia's muscle flexing close to the Chinese border was a response to the growing military challenge from China. That this was wishful thinking was evident from the fact that the Kremlin's relations with Beijing today are better than at any time in the past. Russia and China are strategic partners and co-founders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation;. Russia is a major source for state-of-the-art weapons for the Chinese army. The two countries have actually been staging joint war games. In fact, China was the only country other than Ukraine invited to watch the recent military exercises.
“This exercise is not directed against any specific country or military-political bloc,” explained Russia's Defence Minister Anatoly Serdyukov. “It has a purely defensive nature in ensuring our state's security and national interests in the Far East.” The Vostok-2010 war games must be seen in the context of the sweeping military reform Russia launched nearly two years ago. The objective was to modernise and strengthen the armed forces whose combat worthiness had suffered from a chronic shortage of funds and new weapons over two decades. The current military strategy relies heavily on the country's nuclear arsenals; Russia's conventional forces are no match either for NATO or for the China's People's Liberation Army. Under the reform — billed as the most radical overhaul of the Russian military since the time of Peter the Great — Russia is abandoning the mass-mobilisation principle in favour of forming mobile, permanent-readiness forces, capable of rapid-reaction deployment in any part of Russia's sprawling territory. The reforms involve downsizing the armed forces from 1.3 million to 1 million men, switching from a division-based to a brigade-based table of organisation, and overhauling the system of military education. The Vostok-2010 war games have been officially characterised as a test for the “new look” of the armed forces. By 2020, resurgent Russia plans to have a slim, mobile, well-equipped army that possesses network-centric warfare capabilities and is capable of securely defending the country's long borders east and west, and projecting power far beyond.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Behind-Vostok-2010/article16195480.ece
15,7,2010,Gubernatorial overreach,"Under the Indian Constitution, the Governor of a State is a symbolic repository of its executive powers and acts chiefly on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. At the same time, persons occupying such a position may properly provide counsel to the State government privately and without being intrusive. But Karnataka Governor Hansraj Bharadwaj has flagrantly shed the restraint required of his office by publicly demanding that Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa take action against two of his Ministers, by speaking to the media about their alleged profiteering from illegal mining operations, and by assuming an activist role in this matter. Apart from placing himself in direct conflict with the elected government, Mr. Bharadwaj has, by his impropriety, lent credence to the allegation that he has acted as an “agent of the Congress” in meddling with the ugly political controversy raging in Karnataka. If it is too much for him to show the restraint, dignity, and even-handedness expected of the Governor's office, he must resign or be replaced forthwith.
To deplore Mr. Bharadwaj's gubernatorial overreach is not of course to turn a blind eye to the issue of illegal mining, which is on the political front-burner in Karnataka. It is no secret that the two Ministers the Governor was referring to were the powerful Bellary brothers — G. Janardhana Reddy and G. Karunakara Reddy — who own and operate mines in Karnataka as well as in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. With Mr. Yeddyurappa himself admitting in the State Assembly that as many as 30 million tonnes of iron ore have been exported illegally over the past seven years, there is a serious case for a fast-track investigation into this scandal. The ongoing Lok Ayukta probe against the Reddy brothers has been marred by stonewalling by government officials and agencies. Given the inter-State ramifications of illegal mining — most of the iron ore mines owned by the Reddy brothers are in Andhra Pradesh — only the Central Bureau of Investigation is equipped to conduct a thorough investigation into the alleged illegalities. The Chief Minister's unwillingness to hand over the case to the CBI has compounded the impression that he is reluctant to act firmly against the Reddy brothers. This hesitancy is, in large part, a reflection of the support they enjoy with the Bharatiya Janata Party central leadership. The BJP leadership is badly mistaken if it believes the financial clout of the brothers outweighs the enormous political liability they represent. It did not require Governor Bharadwaj to step out of constitutional line for it to become clear that the Bellary brothers are best relieved of ministerial office.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Gubernatorial-overreach/article16196502.ece
15,7,2010,Gender & urban development,"The persisting urban gender divide and its adverse effects on women, particularly the poor and those living in slums, were highlighted at a special ministerial meeting of the U.N. Economic and Social Council held recently. The loud and clear message for India is that unless the gender divide is bridged, its cities will remain less inclusive and less safe and their development will be unsustainable. Women are more vulnerable in cities because of their subordinate housing rights; and they face difficulties in accessing social housing. The state normally allots social housing only to the head of the family who is invariably a man, overlooking the possibility of joint holding. (Tsunami rehabilitation housing was a progessive exception.) Determining housing rights with a male bias, as UN-Habitat studies report, also makes breaking away from violent relationships and seeking relief difficult. Further, women make up 60 to 80 per cent of the informal workforce in developing countries. The uncertain nature of their work and the small income it fetches denies them access to the formal credit system, making owning a house virtually impossible. Regular eviction of hawkers from urban spaces compounds their woes. As a result, women often suffer multiple shelter deprivations, including lack of access to safe sanitation.
Cities might appear equally accessible to men and women but in practice they are anything but that. Studies by Jagori, a non-governmental organisation, show that many women in Delhi find public transport and many public spaces traumatically unsafe. UN–Habitat's survey (Global Assessment of Women's Safety, 2009) has identified violence in public spaces as one of the three most widespread forms of violence against women. Unsafe cities shrink urban opportunities and reduce mobility for women. Cities such as Seoul faced a similar situation but responded by significantly improving women-friendly city projects. Public spaces such as streets, parks, and parking lots were evaluated through safety audits, and unsafe areas were mapped. This, in turn, helped improve the design and management of urban spaces. Such gender impact studies can be dovetailed into urban projects in India too. The UN-Habitat initiative in Jinja, Uganda, is another good practice that Indian cities could emulate. Exclusive housing projects for low-income women with a revolving fund and a credit guarantee scheme have produced heartening results. Developing gender-responsive cities is vital to the urban future and, in this respect, rising India has a great deal to learn from other countries.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Gender-amp-urban-development/article16196504.ece
16,7,2010,To ban or not to ban,"From the time President Nicolas Sarkozy declared in June 2009 that the burqa was “not welcome” in France, it has been clear that his government was serious about introducing a ban on the veil worn by some Muslim women and on another more severe garment called the niqab, which leaves only the eyes uncovered. The French government is now closer to this after the National Assembly approved legislation for it. It has to be passed by the Senate next, and a constitutional Council could yet void it. The proposed law is very much in line with France's inspiring secular traditions that keep religion strictly out of the public sphere, where the social contract is based exclusively on universal values enshrined in the country's laws. In April 2010, similar legislation was approved by the Belgian parliament's lower house, and a vote by the upper house is awaited later this year. Other European countries are also mulling a ban on the veil. But France, which passionately values a secular national identity over the ethnic or religious affiliations of its immigrants, has never shied away from forcing the pace on complex issues relating to religion and their place within the larger national identity. If this was first aimed at checking the influence of the Catholic church on public life, the spotlight is now on Islam. The proposed ban makes eminent sense through a feminist lens. The burqa (not to mention the niqab) is unquestionably an oppressive garment that seeks, as Mr. Sarkozy pointed out, to keep those who wear it imprisoned “behind a screen.” It is nowhere prescribed in the Koran but has been imposed on millions of women by sections of the clergy — all of them male — who have interpreted religious texts to suit their backward-looking religious or political agenda. That many Muslim women seem willing to embrace the veil these days as a symbol of their piety, modesty, and virtue, or as a political statement of their Muslim identity, is no indication of female agency. It speaks more of their successful co-option in a misogynist project that is the antithesis of liberté, égalité, fraternité — values that go back to the French Revolution and are the proclaimed national motto of France.
However, there is a serious downside to the move to ban the burqa and the niqab. In the post-9/11 atmosphere, such a law is likely to be viewed as an instrument to persecute and humiliate Muslims. It could lead to further radicalisation within the fold and inflame tensions between majority and minority populations in Europe. The reality is that only a small number of women in France's estimated five million Muslim population wear the veil. Fears that a ban could end up criminalising Muslims in European societies are not misplaced, given the Islamophobia in the west. The right-wing French government's unfavourable disposition towards immigrant populations does not help either. In March 2010, the Council of State, which will examine the proposed ban for its constitutionality, observed that a complete ban might, in fact, violate the French Constitution and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Conventional Freedoms. It seemed more comfortable with the idea of a limited ban rooted in reasons of security. But even if the Council strikes down the law, the intriguing social, philosophical, and political issues the burqa and the niqab raise will not go away. For literary guidance on what might happen if the tension between an uncompromisingly secular state and radical religious identity assertion — focussed in this case on the mysterious phenomenon of the “headscarf girls” committing suicide in Kars in Turkey during the early 1990s — is allowed to sharpen and grow, there is no better text than Orhan Pamuk's magnificent novel, Snow.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/To-ban-or-not-to-ban/article16197747.ece
16,7,2010,Europe’s foreign fancies,"The European Union's aspiration to speak in one voice seems odd in a world where the continent is still largely viewed as a multitude of nation-states, with divergent interests and concerns. Against this is the increasingly felt need for an effective counterweight to the predominance of the United States in international diplomacy. The European External Action Service (EEAS), a foreign ministry and diplomatic corps of a new genre, is in the process of being created following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on December 1, 2009. The European Parliament recently approved the final shape of the EEAS and the European Commission offices in more than a hundred countries are being converted into EU embassies. The office of EU Foreign Minister, known as the ‘High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy,' now combines external affairs responsibilities hitherto held conjointly with a EU executive and the incumbent rotating presidency. Internal fissures over the recognition of the independence of Kosovo, the two-state solution on Palestine, and the lifting of a EU embargo on arms sales to China remain. If deeper European divisions were exposed during the U.S.-led illegal war against Iraq (with Labourite Britain in obedient tow), current Franco-German differences over the approach to European economic recovery threaten to undermine a concerted global response. Nevertheless, the attempt to establish a coordinating foreign policy apparatus, with a 7,000-strong diplomatic corps, for a multitude of nation states is ahead of the times and must be wished the best of luck.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Europersquos-foreign-fancies/article16197748.ece
17,7,2010,Engagement must go forward,"India and Pakistan, as Atal Behari Vajpayee remarked famously in 1998, can alter their history, but not their geography. That sentiment has been voiced by other Indian and Pakistani leaders since. It is born of the wisdom that enmity between two countries with a shared boundary can only take both along a mutually undermining path and there must be a commitment to finding peace and cooperation. Only sustained engagement over the long term can bring these. Such engagement is possible only when both sides stop treating every episode as a make-or-break event. When Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and Yusuf Raza Gilani agreed that their Foreign Ministers should meet to find ways to bridge the “trust deficit,” it was clear that the road ahead would be difficult. The talks between Foreign Ministers S.M. Krishna and Shah Mahmood Qureshi are seen in this perspective. That they could not arrive at common ground in their discussions is disappointing but this should not be blown out of proportion. After the positive tone of the preparatory discussions between the Foreign Secretaries in Islamabad last month, there was an expectation that the ministerial meeting would flag off action on certain “doables” aimed at rebuilding confidence and trust. The inability of the two sides to do so only underlines the extent of the mistrust that has set in since the 2008 Mumbai attacks. India wants Pakistan to go after the perpetrators and masterminds of the attacks; Pakistan says it has already done all that it can and India must get over Mumbai to begin talking about other issues. Nevertheless, the agreement by the Ministers to meet again in New Delhi is a definite plus and both governments must now ensure that it takes place.
Meanwhile, both India and Pakistan can be more restrained in their public statements. An official of the position and experience of the Home Secretary, G.K. Pillai, should have known better than to state in an interview, a day before the Foreign Minister talks, that the interrogation of David Headley had revealed the role of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence in the Mumbai attacks “from the beginning till the end.” The relevant information must have been conveyed by Home Minister P. Chidambaram during his talks with his Pakistan counterpart Rehman Malik last month. Its public airing at a sensitive moment raises troubling questions about the motives for doing so, and about who really runs this government. This is not the first time Mr. Pillai has misspoken on sensitive issues. The Pakistan Foreign Minister too has been unnecessarily aggressive in his posturing towards India, perhaps out of domestic political compulsions. Far from being faulted, Mr. Krishna must be commended for the sobriety and statesmanship with which he handled a tricky situation. It is the responsibility of mature political leadership on both sides to take constructive engagement forward.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Engagement-must-go-forward/article16198914.ece
17,7,2010,Symbolic revaluation,"Symbols are important, and the United Progressive Alliance government has done well to choose one for the rupee. The days of the good old INR (Indian rupees) will become a memory as the world starts using the new rupee symbol. Of course, millions of computers all over the world will have to pick up the ASCII or American Standard Code for Information Interchange for the symbol and that could take time. But for a single geographic and cultural entity with a more or less unified currency for a few thousand years, a decade or so won't matter much. However, it is now also possible to do the conversion quite easily. There are websites that tell us how to do it by presenting the symbol first as a graphic and then in ‘Unicode-friendly' fonts. The new symbol is also symbolic of India's new-found self-confidence. Even China, which is altogether more assertive than India, has the same symbol for its yuan as the Japanese yen, namely a Y with two lines drawn across the stem (¥). Many countries have chosen to call their currency “dollar” and simply use the $ sign and, in a rare stab at joviality, the Singaporeans call their currency Singdols. Oddly enough, although one would have expected it as a natural given, the British pound is yet to find a symbol on most keyboards. The letters GBP have to be typed in each time. It was perhaps because they were mindful of the mild insult implicit in this that the Europeans got themselves a symbol for their Euro from the very start, ironically the Greek epsilon with a couple of stakes through its belly (€).
It is hard not to wonder why so many countries choose symbols with lines drawn across them, either vertically like the dollar or horizontally like so many others. The lines across the symbols for the Euro were supposed to stand for stability! These lines do not make an appearance when simple letters are used, like Kr for the Krona or RM for the Ringgit of Malaysia. So what is about a symbol that compels its designer to resort to these lines? It is probably one of those things that get done quite mindlessly. That said, will the new symbol launch the rupee into another currency league? Or is it going to be just one more of those vanities that we Indians are so good at embracing? Some people think that the rupee will become a greatly preferred currency if it is allowed to be fully convertible. Others disagree. Time will tell who is right.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Symbolic-revaluation/article16198915.ece
18,7,2010,Winning credibility in Kashmir,"“I need to rebuild my credibility brick by brick,” Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah admitted recently in an interview. He is right — and his opponents would be wise to draw the same lesson. The violence that bloodied Kashmir's urban streets this summer constitutes the most serious challenge the State's fragile political system has confronted since electoral democracy took the first steps towards re-institutionalisation in 1996. The ugly violence demonstrated that substantial numbers of young people in Kashmir's cities feel disenfranchised by the political system and are hostile to India. Growing numbers are turning to Islamist hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani for leadership. It is clear we haven't seen the last of these troubles, which have broken out every summer since 2005. Police stood by silently on Saturday as motorcycle-borne squads linked to Geelani's Tehreek-i-Hurriyat brutally enforced a shutdown. For all practical purposes, the fragile peace in Srinagar has been purchased by ceding control of parts of the city to the Islamist Right.
Putting more police on the streets to shoot at unarmed protesters cannot, and must not, be the answer. The reality is that Islamists have cashed in on the failure of their adversaries to address the concerns of swathes of young people. Neither the National Conference, which holds all eight Assembly seats in Srinagar, nor its main opponent, the People's Democratic Party, has chosen to organise a single peace meeting or rally. Neither has any immediate stakes in the areas where violence is taking place: the National Conference's legislators won because few people voted, and the PDP hopes resentment against them will eventually rebound in its favour. Earlier this month, the PDP chose to stay away from an all-party meeting called to discuss the violence despite a personal appeal from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to party chief Mehbooba Mufti. Ms Mufti's action was deplorably shortsighted. The growing power of the religious Right will eventually discredit both the ruling coalition and its opponents. New Delhi must do its part. Even if a peace deal with Pakistan seems beyond grasp, it could attempt to initiate a quiet process of engagement with pro-dialogue secessionists. But the principal responsibility rests with J&K's own politicians — who have often pointed out that many of the State's problems can be traced to interference from New Delhi. Experts have made many suggestions for first steps forward: for example, the setting up of local citizens' bodies to liaise with administrators and police along with investments in education and entrepreneurship as well as non-lethal crowd control technologies. But none of these can be realised unless the State's politicians step out to bat courageously.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Winning-credibility-in-Kashmir/article16201696.ece
18,7,2010,Hooliganism pure and simple,"To say that Friday's mob attack on the offices of Headlines Today carries the signature of the Sangh Parivar is to state the obvious. Leave aside the openly pro-Sangh placards sported by the rampaging protesters, the vandalism follows a pattern of aggression only too familiar. From the destruction of the Feroz Shah Kotla cricket pitch in 1999 to countless attacks on film crews, art galleries, and, in particular, the works of M.F. Husain, intolerant elements in the Sangh have given vent to their anger far too often for anyone not to be able to recognise their brand of violence. (At a different level, who can forget the trauma of December 6, 1992, when trishul-waving saffron hordes set upon journalists covering the dying moments of the Babri Masjid?) In the latest instance, the news channel — which, paradoxically, has been anything but unsympathetic to the Sangh's ideology and politics — was targeted because it telecast material that allegedly linked personages belonging to the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh and the Bharatiya Janata Party to acts of terror against the Muslim community. The channel also claimed to have uncovered a 2007 plot to assassinate Vice-President Hamid Ansari.
It can be nobody's case that the findings of investigative journalism should be treated as conclusive evidence. But equally, there is no denying that the Hindutva terror trail is inching towards the heart of the Sangh. Police investigations over the past couple of years have zeroed in on a shocking story that not too long ago was dismissed as a figment of secular fundamentalist imagination. Today that possibility has become disturbingly real with evidence in a string of terror attacks — among them the Mecca Masjid and the Malegaon blast cases — pointing to the involvement of the Hindu Right. Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad chief Hemant Karkare was closing in on this terror network when he was killed by the 26/11 terrorists from Pakistan. The pace has since picked up, and as much is evident from the RSS's admission that one or two of its minor functionaries could have been involved in the cases. Clearly, the high priests of the Sangh do not wish to relive the aftermath of Mahatma Gandhi's assassination when the RSS was banned and pushed to desperate straits. The BJP is in all manner of trouble, politically speaking. The Sangh has sleuths snooping around in its backyard. Hooliganism against the media — in the latest case, against a media organisation that cannot be labelled antagonistic — is the last thing the twosome needs right now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Hooliganism-pure-and-simple/article16201694.ece
19,7,2010,Terrible train of accidents,"Fourteen railway accidents in ten months, the second in West Bengal in two months. But this time the Railways cannot blame the Maoists, who were behind the blast in the track that resulted in a serious derailment and the death of 146 passengers on May 28. In the wee hours of Monday, about 190 km from Kolkata, a speeding Uttar Banga Express rammed into the Vananchal Express that was just leaving the Sainthia station. The fundamental safety procedure in the Railways is that when a track is occupied, the signalling system will not let in another train. There have been no reports of any sabotage. So there can be only two possible reasons for the latest tragedy on the tracks that claimed at least 60 lives: the driver of the Uttar Banga Express, who died in the collision, either disregarded the signal; or the signal failed. For all that, the Uttar Banga Express was supposed to stop at that station. So what could explain the speed at which it entered the very same platform from which the other Express train was just about to leave? The impact of the crash was such that one of the Vananchal Express coaches mounted the pedestrian overbridge ahead of it. As the tragedy occurred some time between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m., the passengers must have been fast asleep and rescue operations also took some time to get under way. Two of the Vananchal Express coaches that took the impact were unreserved compartments; so even the number of passengers in them, not to mention the identity of the dead, took some time to establish. In addition to the Railway relief teams, the Army sent a special contingent to help with the rescue effort, which involved the use of cutters to extricate bodies.
Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee is clearly not up to the job of ensuring safety on the tracks. Against the backdrop of tragedy, her modus has been to use the Maoist-caused railway accidents in West Bengal to blame the Left Front government. Her predecessors at the Rail Bhavan lost no time in accusing her of neglect and asking her to choose between Bengal politics and the Railway Ministry. The stream of accidents in recent months is a stark reminder that the Indian Railways needs to do substantially more to ensure safety and security on the tracks. Whether it was a signal failure or a human error this time, the Railway administration must urgently address the key issues — the modernisation of safety equipment, the maintenance of track and signals, the failure of top management to put in place state-of-the-art ‘fail-safe mechanisms,' and the re-training and fitness of the staff, especially drivers, their assistants, guards, and those at the stations — to prevent the recurrence of such mishaps.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Terrible-train-of-accidents/article16202858.ece
19,7,2010,Growth projections and caveats,"The International Monetary Fund's recent positive outlook on the global economy has attracted plenty of attention. The IMF was the first among the global financial institutions to spot the early signs of economic recovery from the crisis. Its periodic forecasts of economic growth, both for the global economy and individual countries, have tended to be upbeat, with every forecast reflecting greater optimism than the earlier one. The world economy is now slated to grow by a healthy 4.6 per cent in 2010. Around this time last year, its growth projection for 2010 was 2.5 per cent and this was successively raised to 3.9 per cent in January, 4.2 per cent in April, and now to 4.6 per cent. However, the growth projections have always come with caveats. Many of them remain to this day. For instance, economic growth continues to be uneven among countries. The larger emerging economies, China and India especially, are leading the recovery, and the advanced economies are trailing. The problem of correcting this looming imbalance remains. It is becoming fairly obvious that the lack of congruence in the objectives of the rich and the developing economies in this crucial area cannot be overcome without a strong political will on the part of all countries.
A major threat to global economic recovery has emerged more recently, with the severe debt crisis in a few European countries now becoming a generalised affliction. A sovereign default by a country such as Greece will have serious negative consequences for the global financial sector, since major European and U.S. banks hold a high proportion of bonds issued by its government. A few advanced economies led by the United Kingdom have felt compelled to go in for a rigorous fiscal consolidation programme. The IMF is extremely positive on India. It expects the Indian economy to grow by 9.4 per cent, up from its April forecast of 8.8 per cent. The most optimistic of official estimates do not place the growth rate above 8.5 per cent, but there are reasons to believe that the Reserve Bank of India and other forecasters will also mark up their figures. Monsoons have so far been satisfactory and the keenly anticipated turnaround in agriculture may happen. Industry, led by manufacturing, has been recording impressive gains. Tax collections have been buoyant, and surveys indicate heightened business confidence. Inflation has, however, become more intractable, while physical infrastructure continues to be totally inadequate in relation to the needs of an economy looking to grow in double digits.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Growth-projections-and-caveats/article16202857.ece
20,7,2010,No margin for error,"The killing of 43 people on Sunday outside Baghdad by a suicide bomber is a grisly reminder of the political instability that prevails in Iraq seven years after the illegal and calamitous U.S.-led invasion. The suicide bomber struck when members of the Sahwa or Awakening Councils had queued up to be paid. The group, also called ‘Sons of Iraq,' was once allied with al-Qaeda but was turned against that outfit in 2006 by the United States, which became its chief patron and paymaster. Sunday's attack, symptomatic of the cycle of violence that entraps Iraq, has highlighted the inherent contradictions of the post-invasion process of political reconstruction. American planners of the invasion, deficient in their sense of history, completely missed the point that resistance to their military misadventure in a country that traces its lineage to, and draws inspiration from, the great Mesopotamian civilisation was guaranteed to be deep and unrelenting. There are other structural reasons that explain why violence in Iraq has not abated. The U.S. decision following the invasion to rebuild state security institutions from scratch, after launching a virulent de-Baathification campaign, resulted in the emergence of a dangerous political vacuum in Baghdad. Well-seasoned militias, some of them trained abroad, attempted to fill this vacuum. In the process, they became vehicles for drawing in external influence, especially from neighbouring countries.
De-emphasising Iraqi nationalism and embedding an ethno-sectarian ethos in Iraq's new constitution also played a hugely divisive role, undermining national unity and contributing significantly to the cycle of violence. As though this was not enough, the al-Qaeda, squeezed out of Afghanistan, established sanctuaries of rabid intolerance and violence in Iraq. However, notwithstanding the grave challenges, all is not lost in Iraq. In the March 2010 elections, surprisingly large sections of the Iraqi electorate voted along non-sectarian lines. This resulted in the emergence of the secular Iraqiyaa formation, led by the Iyad Allawi, as a surprise winner. Such an outcome would not have been possible had only Sunni groups, which are in minority in Iraq, backed Iraqiyaa. It would be a real shame if squabbles primarily over the post of Prime Minister stand in the way of the formation of a national unity government. However small the window of opportunity, Iraq must be encouraged to complete its process of political reconstruction and return to normal dealings with the rest of the world. This cannot of course happen unless the U.S-led occupation ends and the people and politicians of Iraq are left free to carve out their own destiny.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/No-margin-for-error/article16204002.ece
20,7,2010,Ending the impasse,"The decision of the Chinese government to renew Google's licence to operate its website in China is a pragmatic response to what was turning into a political question. Beijing has displayed sagacity in allowing Google to develop some of its operations in the country, a conciliatory approach that has been reciprocated by the company. Under the agreement, Google will abide by the legal restrictions on what can be published by its China website within the mainland, and visitors can continue to access unfiltered results on its Hong Kong website. However, websites that do not meet legal requirements will remain inaccessible, although they may show up in the search results from Hong Kong. Such a solution does not come as a big surprise. Although Google raised a high profile dispute with political overtones just six months ago over online attacks on its databases and issues of censorship and free speech, no one seriously expected it to wind up its China operations. The issue has been speedily resolved, confirming the desire on both sides to pursue a beneficial path.
Everyone is aware that China, with an Internet user base of 384 million, including 346 million broadband users (as of December 2009), is the world's biggest online market. Ignoring it can seriously hurt growth and no one knows this better than Google. Online access on mobile devices is also growing rapidly; eight per cent of Internet users go online only on mobile. All this clearly points to the need for continued, realistic engagement with China on issues of free speech and cyber security, and for business imperatives to be appreciated in context. A prime interest for Google today is promoting its new Android operating system for mobile in China. Plans to popularise cloud computing are also high on its agenda. The prospects for growth are important to handset makers too, as they support the Android platform with new hardware and application software. Now that there appears to be a closure to the row over cyber attacks on Google's databases, the process of resolution of online free speech issues in China can begin. After all, ‘reasonable restrictions' are applied in the west to freedom of expression on the Internet, especially when security concerns and offensive content are involved. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has underscored this in the context of terrorism. Evidently, with positive, less doctrinaire engagement, it should be possible to open more windows to free expression in cyberspace. That can begin with social networking websites that are currently unavailable in China.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Ending-the-impasse/article16204000.ece
21,7,2010,Uphold regulatory autonomy,"An Ordinance, promulgated on June 18, was triggered by a highly publicised jurisdictional dispute between the Securities and Exchange Board of India and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority over regulation of the highly popular Unit-Linked Insurance Policies (ULIP). The dispute was resolved following the Finance Minister's intervention. However, the government has pounced on the opportunity to promulgate the Ordinance with the ostensible purpose of creating an institutional mechanism to resolve all future jurisdictional issues involving financial sector regulators. A new high-level body chaired by the Finance Minister and comprising the Finance Secretary and the four financial sector regulators will be asked to adjudicate on all future disputes within a specified time frame. Its decisions will be binding on all the regulators. The need to create a new mechanism has been questioned on a number of counts. Disputes such as the one between the SEBI and the IRDA have been rare. In any case, until the ULIP matter arose, the existing High Level Coordination Committee headed by the Reserve Bank of India and comprising representatives of all regulators and Finance Ministry officials was more than equal to the task of settling disputes. Besides, as in all well-functioning markets, informal channels of communication between the government and the regulators have ensured regulatory co-ordination.
The more substantive objection to the Ordinance is that it will undermine regulatory autonomy, especially that of the RBI which has been charged with the task of maintaining financial stability. As the economist Dr. A. Vaidyanathan noted in these columns, “the RBI has earned a richly deserved and enviable reputation among central bankers and regulators the world over for its prescience in anticipating the burgeoning of high-risk bank lending in the domestic financial system...and for weathering two major crises by taking effective preventive measures.” Moreover, he adds, there is a near-global consensus on “the need for stronger, stricter and more transparent mechanisms that are independent of the government to regulate the financial sector and coordinate among regulators.” It appears that the United Progressive Alliance government has recklessly embarked on a retrograde path of undermining the autonomy of the central bank in particular and regulators in general under external pressure. The Ordinance in its present form gives scope for the executive arm of the government to take effective control of the financial sector. If this is not reversed but is allowed to become a statute, it will be a severe blow to transparency, professionalism, and the integrity of the regulatory process.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Uphold-regulatory-autonomy/article16205061.ece
21,7,2010,Welcome Studsat,"Thirty-five undergraduate students from seven engineering colleges, four in Bangalore and three in Hyderabad, have done something that would have been unthinkable even a few years ago. One of the five satellites carried by the PSLV-C15 launched on July 12 is a pico satellite, named ‘Studsat,' which weighs less than 1.5 kg. A picosat is a miniaturised artificial satellite. This is the first time in India that a picosat with an imaging camera has been designed, fabricated, and built by students, under the guidance of scientists from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The students were also involved in testing the adequacy of the clean room and ground station built for fabricating Studsat, and in receiving data and commanding the satellite. The clean room and ground station were established at one of the seven institutes involved in the project. The camera has a low resolution of 90 metres. The panchromatic images will provide terrain information during the satellite's short lifespan of six months to one year. The idea behind this exercise was to provide students an opportunity to understand the mission aspects and gain hands-on experience in building a working satellite.
Satellite launches by ISRO have always attracted public attention. But it was the Chandrayaan-1 launch in October 2008 that fired the imagination of students. The outcome was an impressive increase in the number of young men and women showing interest in space research. What is more, the trend has been sustained. Studsat, a student initiative backed by some of India's finest higher educational institutions, is an inspiring first — and there is more to come. Two nano satellites (in the less-than-15-kg category) are being built by IIT Kanpur and IIT Mumbai, and two by Chennai-based universities. All four satellites will be launched before mid-2011. If this progressive trend is student-driven, ISRO has played an exemplary role in mentoring and nurturing it. The decision to sacrifice precious payload to accommodate the demonstration satellites shows that ISRO is playing for the future. With the educational institutions required to build their own clean room and ground station, the agency has ensured that they have a long-term commitment to promote space research. At a time when many developed countries are finding it difficult to promote science, ISRO's novel way of attracting talent stands out. With Chandrayaan-2 and human space flight in prospect, it is clear that rising India's space future is very bright.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Welcome-Studsat/article16205060.ece
23,7,2010,Scaling Mount Improbable,"Seldom are athletes allowed to choose their moment of leaving; often the decision is thrust on them. Muttiah Muralitharan, in leaving the grand stage of his own volition, has confirmed again that he is the rarest of the rare. The bewitching off-spinner's retirement from Test cricket brings to an end a game-changing career. The numbers challenge belief — 800 wickets from 133 matches at 22.72 is a record that, like Sir Donald Bradman's average of 99.94, will probably stand forever. However, it is Murali's role in broadening perception that offers a measure of his bowling. It was fitting that he was born in Sri Lanka, where cricketers are allowed to develop organically, free from the chains of petty orthodoxies. Blessed with singular physical gifts — the combination of a hyper-mobile shoulder and an elastic wrist helped him put more work on the ball than any spinner in the history of the game — Murali set about customising his craft. But his advent didn't revolutionise off-spin, for although his methods were widely imitated, they couldn't be replicated. Another perception he helped broaden was that of the ‘legal' delivery: his action forced world cricket to confront the inaccuracies of its definition and accept the limitations of the naked eye. Murali's action was as legitimate as anyone's — nearly every bowler was found to bend and straighten his arm in delivery, an inevitable consequence of the forces that govern bowling actions.
No single cricketer has meant more to the fortunes of his national side than this magician with a perennial smile to Sri Lanka. Before his debut, Sri Lanka managed two wins in 38 Tests. Muralitharan has since orchestrated 54 wins, claiming more than 40 per cent of his team's wickets in victories. In deciding that his farewell Test would be at Galle against the world's Number 1 Test side, he sportingly set himself the challenge of having to bag eight wickets to scale Mount 800. He did exactly that — and set up an emphatic win. But his influence has transcended cricket. He has borne the responsibility of representation with lightness, humour, and simplicity, remaining a conciliatory presence in an often strife-torn nation. Not content with being a symbol, Murali has embraced humanitarian work. He has driven the Foundation of Goodness's project to rebuild more than a thousand houses spread over 24 villages that were hit by the tsunami in 2004. He has also committed himself to a project in Mankulam that seeks to use sport as a medium for alleviating poverty. The cricket world will salute one of the greatest bowlers of all time. Society will cherish this Tamil of recent Indian origin as an upstanding human being whose very presence has united people.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Scaling-Mount-Improbable/article16206302.ece
23,7,2010,Governance and the ‘Fifth Estate',"Social media, relatively young participants in the fast growing technological boom based on the Internet, have started to make their mark on how governments and individuals interact. The announcement earlier this month by Philippines President Benigno Aquino III that his government would use Facebook and Twitter to enlist public cooperation for government campaigns, such as crackdowns on tax evaders and smugglers, is significant, especially for the developing world. Last year, U.S. President Barack Obama in a memorandum to departmental heads, listed transparency, participation, and collaboration as three priority areas for open governance and wanted government agencies to harness new technologies for realising those objectives. In India, where the digital divide is far more pronounced than in the wired west, government agencies (India Post, for example) have taken advantage of the technological advances to strike a blow for improved governance. What gives a revolutionary edge to these new and evolving media tools is their potential to replace the old mould of unilateral communication — from the state to individuals — with a vibrant two-way communication between the government and the governed.
Social media networks are starting to emerge as game-changers in the manner in which information is disseminated and administrations reach out to the people. Under this mode, networked individuals can have an impact on governance through the use of the Internet. For this global resource to be harnessed effectively, two ingredients are essential. A two-way flow of timely and credible information is one. Equally important is a response mechanism from government agencies. These media tools give governments the added advantage of continuously engaging citizens. This can help foster mutual trust and bring governance closer to the people, particularly given the personal nature of interaction in the social media environment. There are examples of heads of state taking to the social media, not just before elections but also after. In addition, the ‘Fifth Estate,' as sociologist William H. Dutton of the Oxford Internet Institute calls the social media, can make meaningful interventions in shaping public policy. This can be particularly important in speedily communicating disasters and epidemics, including early warning signals. India's governmental agencies, particularly those that have a direct bearing on employment, poverty reduction, and health care must wholeheartedly and intelligently adopt the new media.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Governance-and-the-lsquoFifth-Estate/article13893574.ece
24,7,2010,A deadline too far,"Another international conference on Afghanistan — the ninth so far, and for the first time held in Kabul — has ended with the pious refrain that Afghans should take charge of their country. Once again, it is clear there is little sincerity about it. President Hamid Karzai, whose chances of political survival without international help are slim, set a self-servingly generous deadline of 2014 for the foreign troops to withdraw. The conference, representing 70 countries, made no formal commitment to Mr. Karzai's deadline, and chose instead to endorse his call in general terms. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reiterated the Obama administration's commitment to begin scaling down troops as promised from July 2011 — but set no firm date for complete withdrawal. Despite domestic pressure on European leaders to end the Afghan misadventure, the NATO secretary-general was vague about the timetable, stating that “conditions, not calendars” would determine when foreign troops would hand over to Afghan forces. The only acceptable deadline for foreign powers to leave that country is immediately. The longer they stay, the more appalling will be the bloodshed and the illfare. All the experimentation with ‘surges' and ‘democracy-in-a-box' has led only to increasing civilian casualties at the hands of the U.S.-led NATO forces. And each civilian death has increased support for the Taliban to a point where Mr. Karzai himself now believes there is more political traction in reaching out to the militants. Persisting with this unjust and unwinnable Afghan war is turning out to be President Barack Obama's Great Folly.
The international conference missed a real opportunity to discuss a way forward in Afghanistan — through a paradigm shift. Writing in this newspaper in September 2009, the diplomat Chinmaya Gharekhan, formerly India's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, asked the international community to focus on restoring Afghanistan to its long-lost tradition of neutrality — where other countries pledge non-interference in its affairs, and it pledges non-interference in theirs — along the lines of the July 1962 Neutrality of Laos Declaration. This is an eminently sensible suggestion, considering that Afghanistan has been reduced to rubble mainly by the competing strategic objectives of international and regional players. Pakistan and, to a lesser extent, India have been only too willing to participate in these mutually undermining games. A neutrality declaration will help liberate Afghanistan from the military occupation and tutelage of foreign powers. It may also pave the way for an Afghan solution to national rebuilding — one that will hopefully reject the Taliban.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-deadline-too-far/article16207430.ece
24,7,2010,Vulnerable to torture,"Amnesty International (AI) has dubbed the tendency of European countries to rely on mere diplomatic assurances against the use of torture to deport, expel, or extradite persons as a violation of the principle of non-refoulement that prohibits the transfer of people to places where they risk facing torture. The danger of dilution of this important post-war democratic guarantee is ominous for the world's refugees and other repatriates fleeing violence and poverty in conflict zones. Western nations that were in the forefront of the struggle for universal human rights standards in the 1950s and continue to hold them up as the only enduring prospect for geo-political stability in the 21st century should review their recent retrograde policy stance which is a part of their current global counter-terrorism strategy. An AI report documents growing evidence, since the 9/11 bombings of the twin towers, of a number of European countries deporting terror suspects on the basis of mere diplomatic assurances that they would not be tortured. The complicity of many European states in the notorious Bush era legacy of renditions of terror suspects from the United States military base in Guantanamo Bay is a class apart. In an extremely reassuring contrast, the European Court of Human Rights and courts in individual European countries have ruled that, notwithstanding the assurances from authorities in the recipient states, the risks of ill-treatment are not mitigated.
Against such categorical and overwhelming judicial interpretations, states should honour their international obligation to prosecute those suspected of terrorist offences rather than shirk their legal responsibility under the pretext of potential threat to national security. Given their non-binding character, the Amnesty report argues, diplomatic assurances are unenforceable and promises of humane treatment of select individuals from states with a record of torture must necessarily be suspect. Equally, the effectiveness of sporadic monitoring of the situation would have to be weighed against the reality of secrecy surrounding acts of cruelty, routine official denial of involvement, failure to investigate allegations, and the consequent impunity the perpetrators enjoy. The relative advantages of an effective law enforcement machinery, transparency and accountability place the onus squarely on advanced democratic states to show leadership in combating terrorism and crime without putting suspects in jeopardy of torture abroad.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Vulnerable-to-torture/article16207425.ece
25,7,2010,A pragmatic approach,"Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee's latest proposals on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) might not quite meet the standards set by the Centre itself six months ago. At that time, a strong case was made out for a single tax rate over a wide base, with very few exemptions and a relatively low tax threshold. However, with a view to reaching a consensus with the States and bringing all of them on board, Mr. Mukherjee has adopted a pragmatic approach. The idea clearly is to embark on this important tax reform even if, in the first instance, it meant moving farther away from the ideal than earlier envisaged. The new proposals reflect the recommendations of the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers in its first discussion paper last November. There will be a dual structure: a Central GST and a State GST. However, over a three-year period, the two separate rates will converge in stages into a single GST. The Finance Minister has now proposed three separate rates: 20 per cent for normal goods, 12 per cent for merit goods and 16 per cent for services. The Centre has rejected the States' plea to set a high exemption threshold of Rs.1.5 crore for goods, preferring to have a much lower and uniform exemption limit of Rs.10 lakh for both goods and services.
To assuage the States' concerns over loss of financial autonomy, it is proposed to leave out petro products and electricity from the ambit of the GST. That would provide the States autonomy to levy taxes on these high-yielding items. Besides, the Finance Minister has promised to compensate the States for possible revenue losses on account of the introduction of GST. Even after all the flexibility shown by the Centre on critical issues raised by the States, it is still not clear whether the deadline of April 1, 2011, for introducing this tax will be met. There is very little perceptible movement in respect of almost all the legal and administrative steps that need to be taken before the GST could be put in place. An up-to-date technology platform is a vital prerequisite. There have so far been few concerted attempts at educating the public on the new tax. There ought to be a greater sense of urgency than what has been in evidence so far in taking the necessary legal steps — for instance, getting the Constitution amended to enable the States to levy a service tax and the Centre to tax goods beyond the factory gate. The existing VAT laws and also some others like the Central Excise Act, 1944 and the Finance Act, 1994 have to be repealed or amended. In the circumstances, even the new time frame for the GST seems unrealistic.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-pragmatic-approach/article16209993.ece
25,7,2010,Protecting livelihoods,"The revised national policy on urban street vendors that promised the small traders on the roadside and mobile traders better access to space and an end to their harassment by civic authorities appears to be moving all too slowly towards finality. One year has passed since it was announced and only a handful of cities have taken tentative steps to implement it. Even its original version (2004) met with a lukewarm response. This apathy towards street vendors is in sharp contrast to the enthusiasm shown for the cause of the organised segment, which constitutes hardly five per cent of the retail trade. More than 10 million people across Indian cities earn their livelihood through street vending, which is easy to enter and needs very little capital. Despite its useful role, street vending is yet to be legally recognised, often branded by the local bodies as an “encroachment”. This makes the vendors vulnerable to frequent eviction and to exploitation by the law enforcers. In order to protect them, the policy recommended a registration system for vendors and demarcation of city spaces for vending, apart from the setting up of town committees with vendor participation. These suggestions when acted upon would put all vending activity on a protective and regulatory legal framework. In implementing the new policy, care must be taken to ensure that the system does not restrict entry and the regulations are not burdensome.
The National Association of Street Vendors of India has pointed out that over 100,000 applications for licences remain unprocessed since 2007. Cities such as Surakarta in Indonesia have shown that co-opting street vendors in urban development could be mutually beneficial. The local government there worked with the vendors, earmarked new places for trading, issued free trade permits and provided tax exemption for the first six months. Soft loans and training were also arranged to improve their business. In the process, the city recovered valuable urban spaces that were encroached upon and the street vendors in turn were able to trade freely. Closer home, Bhubaneswar has taken a few pioneering initiatives. It has created 52 exclusive vending zones near the existing areas frequented by the vendors. More than 2,000 vendors have been rehabilitated in these markets without much dislocation or loss of earnings. Such progressive measures can be easily adopted by other cities and scaled up where necessary. The street vendors are a valuable part of city life and the state must ensure that they are not excluded. Policies conceptualised to support their livelihood must be implemented without any further delay.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Protecting-livelihoods/article16209992.ece
26,7,2010,Barking up the wrong tree,"The loud protests by the Bharatiya Janata Party leadership and Chief Minister Narendra Modi over the charge sheet against former Gujarat Minister of State for Home Amit Shah in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh-Kausar Bi murder case carry little conviction. Allegations that the charge sheet is fabricated and that Mr. Shah is a victim of political conspiracy won't wash. That the Gujarat administration had a hand in the 2005 killings of Sohrabuddin, who allegedly ran an extortion racket and had been convicted in 1994 for transporting assault rifles and grenades, and his innocent wife, Kausar Bi, is not contested. In early 2007, the State government admitted before the Supreme Court that Sohrabuddin was killed by the State police in a fake encounter and Kasur Bi murdered and her body burnt to eliminate evidence of the crime. It was around that time that a slew of policemen, including two senior Gujarat IPS officers, were arrested in the case. There has been suspicion that the murders were masterminded at the political level and Mr. Shah's name has been dragged into the controversy more than once. While his innocence must be presumed unless and until he is found guilty, he has behaved most inappropriately. As Minister of State for Home, Mr. Shah should have been upholding the law rather than dodging summons and delaying the inevitable arrest.
It is common knowledge that the CBI has often been pressured and put to political uses, especially by the Congress or Congress-led regimes at the Centre. But in this case, the agency was directed to take up the investigation by the Supreme Court, which has been closely monitoring the progress. Under these circumstances, the BJP's allegation that Mr. Modi and his government are being politically targeted lacks credibility. More importantly, such allegations deflect attention from the central issue: the need to unravel the full truth about these extra-constitutional killings. To cover up the atrocity, some Gujarat police officers falsely claimed at one point that Sohrabuddin was a Lashkar-e-Taiba operative. What is germane here is not what he was but the fact that he as well as his wife were murdered in cold blood by those entrusted with the duty of enforcing the law. Fake encounters — which have been strongly alleged in the case of the killings of 19-year-old student Ishrat Jahan and three others and more recently of CPI (Maoist) leader Cherukuri Rajkumar (alias Azad) in Andhra Pradesh — controvert the very principles on which the criminal justice system rests. The idea that the security forces can liquidate people so as to sidestep the demanding legal process is abhorrent and has absolutely no place in a civilised society.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Barking-up-the-wrong-tree/article16211068.ece
26,7,2010,Multiple betrayals,"Baroness Eliza Manningham-Buller, director-general of the British security service MI5 from 2002 to 2007, has given the most damning testimony yet to the Iraq Inquiry, also called the Chilcot Inquiry, into the United Kingdom's role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. She has stated that Saddam Hussein was not a credible terrorist threat to the U.K., though he might have used weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) if he had felt sufficiently threatened; that Iraq did not have the capability to mount attacks in the U.K. and there was no serious risk of Iraqi WMDs falling into other hands; that the CIA did not think there was a connection between Saddam and the al-Qaeda; and that the invasion of Iraq radicalised part of a generation of young British Muslims who saw the invasion as an attack on Islam. She also testified that MI5's domestic work had expanded sharply enough for the agency to receive an immediate 100 per cent increase in funding, and that invading Iraq had given Osama bin Laden his “Iraqi jihad” in the form of a foothold in that country.
Despite the authority of the Baroness's testimony, much of its content is already widely known. Another civil servant, Carne Ross, a former First Secretary at the U.K. Mission to the United Nations, has said the Blair government “intentionally and substantially” exaggerated the Iraqi threat before the invasion. These analyses raise serious questions about why the civil servants involved did not speak out more strongly or resign when political leaders dishonestly overrode their professional warnings and rushed headlong into the invasion with calamitous consequences. Tony Blair fabricated the case for war, and the U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld simply created another intelligence body, which presumably told him what he wanted to hear. The political repercussions, however, continue. The day after Manningham-Buller's deposition to Chilcot, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg told the House of Commons that the invasion was “illegal.” While he explained subsequently that he had spoken in a personal capacity, the fact that his comment came from the dispatch box during Prime Minister's Questions could render the U.K. more liable to charges under international law. The invasion of Iraq was a horrific set of war crimes. It also flowed from enormous failures on the part of several public institutions in two of the world's major democracies. The world owes it to the millions of innocent victims not to let the resultant political, legal, and institutional issues disappear.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Multiple-betrayals/article16211067.ece
27,7,2010,"Probe the policy, not the leak","The Obama administration has reacted predictably to WikiLeaks' release of thousands of classified military documents from the Afghanistan war on to the Internet. Almost immediately, National Security Adviser James Jones was fielded to denounce the leak as a threat to national security. There were no words of apology for having misled the American and global public about the scale of civilian casualties inflicted by the Unites States-led intervention force in Afghanistan. General Jones also insisted that the strategy the U.S. is now following is the right one and that the administration intends to stay the course. Behind his brave words, of course, is a tacit admission of the need to fix at least one part of the story the leaked documents tell: the double-game being played by the Pakistani intelligence services and military in continuing to encourage and even fund terrorists and insurgents inside Afghanistan. He praised the Pakistani offensives in South Waziristan and Swat but added a caveat: “Yet the Pakistani government — and Pakistan's military and intelligence services — must continue their strategic shift against insurgent groups. The balance must shift decisively against al-Qaeda and its extremist allies.” In other words, the strategic shift that the Pakistani military has made so far is not decisive enough.
Has Washington fully internalised what that means — and what it needs to do — in order to get GHQ in Rawalpindi to make a clean and complete break with its policy of using extremists as “strategic assets”? This is a key question the leaked documents throw up. Instead of addressing the host of concerns raised by the documents — including the issue of war crimes committed by U.S. forces — it seems the U.S. government is determined to treat the WikiLeaks affair as a matter of domestic law enforcement. The White House has called the disclosure of the war logs a breach of federal law. Going by the charges the U.S. has already slapped against Bradley Manning, a Pentagon whistleblower suspected of passing on information to WikiLeaks, and the ongoing investigation of James Risen, a New York Times reporter who leaked details of a CIA plot against Iran, the Obama administration is likely to pursue the latest leak with inquisitorial zeal. This would be a grave mistake. Leaks occur because there is something unsavoury (and often illegal) going on. The secrecy that has marked the ‘war on terror' since 2001 has served as a convenient cover for the violation of human rights and the laws of war on an unacceptable scale. As a candidate, President Barack Obama promised to change the policy. It would be a pity if he now goes after the whistleblowers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Probe-the-policy-not-the-leak/article16213250.ece
27,7,2010,A calibrated tightening,"With the economy expected to register a healthy growth rate, it is not surprising that the focus of the Reserve Bank of India's first quarter review of credit policy should be on the worrying problem of inflation. WPI inflation has been in double digits since February. Although food price inflation and, more generally, consumer price inflation have shown some moderation, they are still in double digits. Non-food inflation has been rising rapidly and demand side pressures are mounting, leading to a more generalised inflation. Given that growth is firmly on track, “the balance of policy stance has to shift decisively to containing inflation and anchoring inflationary expectations.” In fact, since October 2009, the RBI's policy stance has been tilting towards price stability without ignoring the other traditional policy objective of meeting the credit needs of the real economy. Until the latest announcement, the reversal of the relatively easy money stance was marked by cumulative hikes in the CRR of one percentage point and the repo and the reverse repo rates by 0.75 percentage point each. The RBI has now hiked the repo rate by 0.25 percentage point to 5.75 per cent and the reverse repo rate by 0.50 percentage point to 4.50 per cent. The narrowing of the gap between the two repo rates is expected to introduce a measure of stability to the short-term interest rates. A higher reverse repo rate will also encourage banks to park their surplus funds with the RBI when there is a surfeit of liquidity.
The RBI expects a number of factors to play a part in dousing inflation, which it projects to drop to 6 per cent by March, 2011. These include satisfactory monsoons, a good kharif harvest and softening global oil prices. Its growth forecast for the current year has been raised to 8.5 per cent from the 8 per cent (with an upward bias) it had predicted in April. According to the Bank, the main risk factors would emanate from abroad. If global recovery falters, the performance of India and other emerging economies is likely to be adversely affected. An even greater risk lies in a possible slowdown in capital inflows, which have become quite critical to India's balance of payments. On the other hand, with central banks in the developed countries persisting with accommodative monetary policy, the country could face the problem of plenty, with flows increasing substantially, straining monetary and exchange rate management. In a welcome move aimed at improving the frequency and content of its communication to the markets, the RBI will now also undertake four mid-quarter reviews, making for eight in a year.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-calibrated-tightening/article16212224.ece
28,7,2010,Afghan war exposed,"The governments of the United States and the United Kingdom have reacted with predictable shock and dismay to the appearance on the non-profit website WikiLeaks of some 92,000 U.S. military documents on the calamitous war in Afghanistan. Material on the conduct of German, French, and Polish troops — fellow-members of the International Security Force in Afghanistan (ISAF) — is a sort of bonus. The New York Times, the Guardian, and Der Spiegel collaborated in analysing and placing substantial amounts of the information on the Internet, though they have withheld details that are likely to heighten the danger to U.S. troops and their partners. The White House, however, says the leaks might put American lives and those of partners at risk and could threaten national security. The U.K. expresses similar concerns. The documents show that intelligence is unreliable and often unverifiable; that ISAF communications frequently break down; that there are technical problems with equipment, including drone aircraft; and that troops are so frightened of suicide bombers and Taliban collaborators that they have killed hundreds of civilians by shooting and bombing indiscriminately. Furthermore, large numbers of ordinary Afghans fear and hate the foreign troops and are victims of the corruption and brutality that pervade the U.S-backed Hamid Karzai government. Taliban forces, for their part, are increasingly well-trained and adept, and their roadside bombs have killed over 2,000 civilians.
The WikiLeaks exposé has been likened to the 1971 leak of the Pentagon Papers, the contents of which significantly strengthened worldwide opposition to the Vietnam war, and also to the publication of pictures of U.S. torture at Abu Ghraib in Iraq. It turns out that the CIA has its own secret operation to kill suspected Taliban leaders, that incident reports conceal civilian deaths and other failures, and that the U.S. military has covered up the Taliban's acquisition of heat-seeking missiles. Politically speaking, there is deepening international concern that the ISAF presence is not doing anything other than wrecking Afghanistan and strengthening the Taliban. The U.S., in particular, has persistently underestimated the weakness and incompetence of the Afghan government. Therefore, prosecuting anyone found responsible for the leak amounts to nothing more than shooting the messenger. That will address neither the chaos in Afghanistan nor the fact that a war effort that has already cost over $300 billion is totally directionless. The very concept of a victory, military or political, is now completely unintelligible and the official lies about Afghanistan can no longer be sustained.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Afghan-war-exposed/article16213303.ece
28,7,2010,Sun power,"When Andre Borschberg recently piloted Solar Impulse HB-SIA to a smooth landing at an airfield near Bern in Switzerland, he did what almost everyone believed to be impossible — fly a manned aircraft using only solar power through the night. The 26 hour and nine minute flight of the four-engine plane did not merely set an aviation record. It spotlighted the role of renewable energy. It was eloquent testimony to the vision of aeronaut-psychiatrist-innovator Bertrand Piccard, co-founder of the project. The Lausanne-born Mr. Piccard, who made the first non-stop, round-the-world balloon flight with Briton Brian Jones a decade ago, is keen to push back the limits of the impossible. It is quite natural, therefore, that he now wants to pursue his grand plan to fly around the world in a solar-powered aircraft. The key message to emerge from the programme is that consistent effort to enhance efficiency can enlarge the role of solar in the mix of energy sources. The proof lies in the fact that the 11,628 solar cells on the 1,600 kg Solar Impulse delivered enough energy to power the engines for take-off and for the aircraft to stay aloft for a day and more. Nobody is talking yet of flying 300 people in a solar plane but why is this renewable, risk-free option not used more widely for energy-intensive equipment, for example, air-conditioners and heaters, when unit costs are falling?
A move away from fossil fuel for energy production, and a speedy transition to power from wind, water, and solar is a progressive way to combat climate change. Such an energy pathway would make it possible for people to maintain a good quality of life and yet not degrade the environment. Indeed, some scientists have argued that a smart shift to renewables can reduce projected global energy demand in the coming decades, because massive electrification would enable more efficient technologies to emerge. Such an energy revolution would be impossible, however, if the energy mix continues to rely heavily on fossil fuel, primarily coal and oil, which are implicated in climate change. Dr. Piccard points out that most people are unwilling to give up comforts they are used to, a factor that is perhaps not adequately acknowledged by the Green movement. What is within the realm of the possible is tapping renewable energy. The countries in the global solar belt, of which India is a part, are making some encouraging moves to tap the potential of the sun. They need to speed up their efforts, and get goal-oriented in pursuit of technologies that can raise output from both solar photovoltaics and solar thermal power generation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Sun-power/article16213302.ece
29,7,2010,'Refudiate' Palin's bigotry,"Sarah Palin's language-bending tweet asking New Yorkers to “refudiate” a proposal to build a Muslim centre near Ground Zero has highlighted the truth that Americans still remain confused and divided in their reactions to Islam. Only two months ago, a Community Board representing Lower Manhattan residents voted in favour of the proposed building whose purpose would be to serve as a meeting point for people of all faiths. This endorsement is not binding but is regarded as a reliable indicator of public opinion. While the proposed 13-storeyed building, planned to come up two blocks from where the Twin Towers stood and named Cordoba House, will have a prayer hall, it is not conceived as a mosque. It will also house a basketball court and a swimming pool. The building that now stands at the site was damaged during the 9/11 attacks. It was bought by a Muslim businessman who is one of the main financiers for the project. Significantly, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has voiced support for building the centre — rightly describing it as being one with the city's tradition of tolerance, its liberal values, and the democratic freedom to practise any religion.
Opposition to the project remains strong and vocal, fuelled by a mix of prejudice, paranoia, and misinformation. There is opposition from the families of the victims of 9/11, who believe that building a ‘mosque' near Ground Zero would be an affront to the memory of those killed on that day. There is also the view that the centre would be a security hazard. Even the proposed name, Cordoba House, has provoked opposition on the grounds that it recalls the heyday of Islam in Europe. It is deplorable that Islam and Muslims are sought to be held responsible for the acts of a few who preach hate and practise terrorism in the name of saving the religion. There were Muslims among those killed in the 9/11 attacks. The hostility to the proposed centre, to which the 2008 vice-presidential candidate's tweet has added political overtones, reveals that considerable sections of American public opinion continue to believe that Muslims must collectively be punished for the attacks. Despite the celebrated U.S. constitutional guarantees on the freedom to worship, there have been instances of communities blocking the construction of religious buildings, usually non-Christian ones, for ‘civic' reasons. The final go-ahead for the building project has to come from the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which could turn it down on the ground that the existing building is a historical landmark. It would be a great pity if the most liberal-minded of American cities joins the list of places that suffer from Islamophobia.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Refudiate-Palins-bigotry/article16214462.ece
29,7,2010,Upbeat with caveats,"Given that the Economic Outlook for 2010-11 of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council and the Reserve Bank of India's review of the monetary policy were released within days of each other, it is hardly surprising that many of their observations on the macroeconomy are similar. The Economic Outlook has a wider canvas than the RBI's quarterly review. Both rely on practically the same set of official data sources — such as the CSO's growth estimates — and are equally upbeat in their assessment. Their growth forecasts for the current year are identical — 8.5 per cent. The EAC had projected an 8.2 per cent growth in February, while the RBI had until recently stuck to its conservative estimate of 8 per cent (with an upward bias). Over the recent past, all official forecasters have tended to mark up their figures progressively. Less than a month ago, the International Monetary Fund had forecast a 9.4 per cent growth during 2010. The EAC's expectation of a 9 per cent growth during 2011-12 does not seem unrealistic, given the strong recovery. Its assessment of 8.5 per cent for the current year is predicated on a strong rebound in agriculture, which is estimated to grow by 4.5 per cent with satisfactory crop yields. Industry is expected to grow by 9.6 per cent and services by 8.9 per cent.
The economy may well remain on a high growth trajectory, with a growth of 9 per cent and more looking achievable. However, all the upbeat assessments are subject to important caveats. Inflation, which stood at 10.55 per cent in June — more than twice the comfort level — has been a major worry over the past one year. The RBI's monetary tightening through higher interest rate signals was not unexpected. Inflation has become more generalised and the non-food inflation now accounts for a substantial portion of the WPI inflation. In addition to monetary tightening, the EAC has urged the government to release food stocks to dampen price increases. The problem of low farm productivity needs to be tackled through a package of measures including improved water management and rotation of crops. The infrastructure deficit, another persistent concern, has adversely affected India's competitiveness as well as growth. On a positive note, the EAC expects investments in fixed assets to recover strongly. The savings rate is expected to touch 34.3 per cent this year, going up to 35.5 per cent in 2011-12. Despite a widening current account deficit, the balance of payments is expected to remain comfortable. However, as pointed out by the RBI, capital inflows to bridge the deficit will still remain crucial.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Upbeat-with-caveats/article16214458.ece
30,7,2010,A deepening relationship,"Writing on his blog before his 2006 visit to India while he was Leader of the Opposition in the British Parliament, David Cameron said he was going for “a simple reason: India matters so much in the modern world …Our relationship with India goes deep. But I think it can and should go deeper … I think it's time for Britain and India to forge a new special relationship for the twenty-first century.” Visiting India again this week, this time as Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron went all out to prove his determination to make those words come true. It is no secret that the recession-hit United Kingdom is eyeing India primarily through an economic lens. On his two-city tour, Mr. Cameron made a strong pitch for improving bilateral trade and investment, particularly for India to relax rules on foreign direct investment in legal services, banking and insurance, and in defence manufacturing. Although the joint statement was short on specific economic commitments, both countries agreed to “substantially increase trade and significantly increase investment,” and find ways to double it in the next five years. But the British delegation had at least one substantial achievement to celebrate — the clinching of the Rs.5,100 crore deal to supply Hawk trainer jets to the Indian Air Force and Navy. The document notes the “opportunities for wide-ranging cooperation” in the nuclear field after the signing earlier this year of the U.K.-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation Declaration. The Indian interest in attracting foreign investment in infrastructure development was reflected in the joint statement, with both countries agreeing to explore how best to go about this.
With Mr. Cameron determined to woo India, both sides seemed to have deliberately avoided speaking on difficult bilateral issues publicly. If New Delhi reiterated its reservation on the British cap on immigration, it did so quietly. While there has been no change in substantive positions, the atmospherics this time were far better than during the final years of the Labour government under Gordon Brown when David Miliband's tone and comments, particularly on Kashmir, had not been received well. Prime Minister Cameron was careful not to mention the Kashmir issue at all. Unsurprisingly, his candid statements on terrorism emanating from Pakistan against India, Afghanistan, and the other parts of the world, have endeared him to Indians. That the same statements have caused outrage in Pakistan — casting a shadow over President Asif Ali Zardari's visit to the U.K. next week — and come under criticism in Britain, where Mr. Cameron has been attacked for antagonising Islamabad, only goes to show that in diplomacy, you cannot please all the people all the time.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-deepening-relationship/article16215676.ece
30,7,2010,The vote and beyond,"Quite understandably, the Telangana Rashtra Samiti is portraying the results of the 12 Assembly by-elections in Andhra Pradesh as a referendum in favour of a separate Telangana State. The party won all the 11 seats it contested; the twelfth went to the Bharatiya Janata Party with which it had an understanding. After all, the by-elections were a direct fall-out of the Telangana issue with the sitting MLAs — 10 belonging to the TRS, one to the BJP and another to the Telugu Desam Party— resigning in protest at what they saw as a delay on the part of the Centre in carving out a new State. Statehood was indeed the dominant issue right through the campaign, and the TRS won all its seats with huge margins, a marked improvement over its performance in the general elections just a year ago. Its chief, K. Chandrashekhar Rao, who spearheaded the Statehood agitation by undertaking an indefinite fast last year, must be feeling vindicated. Both the Congress and the TDP, which have been equivocal on the Statehood issue, received a drubbing. Indeed, in a high stakes contest for the Congress, the party's State president, D. Srinivas, lost to the BJP candidate in the Nizamabad Urban constituency. The TDP, apart from conceding one seat to the TRS, lost its deposit in several constituencies, finishing a poor third. A pro-Statehood sentiment was clearly in evidence in all the constituencies that went to polls.
However, with the Srikrishna Committee now seized of the Statehood issue in all its aspects, Mr. Rao must resist the temptation to capitalise on the popular mood to fall back on his brand of political brinkmanship. The issue concerns the whole of Andhra Pradesh, and any decision on dividing the State will have to be taken on the basis of a broad consensus after due deliberations on its social, economic, and political implications. Although popular support for a separate State seems to have increased considerably within Telangana, too much must not be read into the poll outcome. The 12 constituencies were in any case the core base of the TRS and the Telangana movement. But the by-elections should force a serious rethink within the Congress and the TDP. The two parties, whose political base is spread across the State, have spoken in different voices at different times and at different places. Instead of seeking to tap parochial sentiments, political parties must take a reasoned, long-term view of this complex issue. While the TRS might be emboldened by the results, the proper course for the party will be to await the report of the Srikrishna Committee.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-vote-and-beyond/article16215734.ece
2,8,2010,Transferring the problem,"After some initial reluctance, the Centre has accepted the Supreme Court collegium's recommendation that Karnataka Chief Justice P.D. Dinakaran be transferred to the Sikkim High Court. Evidently, the collegium effected the transfer from a large high court such as Karnataka to the smallest high court in the country as a show of displeasure over Justice Dinakaran's defiance of all canons of judicial propriety and sticking to office amidst a welter of corruption and land-grab charges. While the move might solve the immediate problem in Karnataka, where Justice Dinakaran has been facing determined opposition from the bar and not taking up judicial work, can it be justified in principle? The Sikkim High Court is not a bustling hive of judicial activity but how can a person considered unfit to preside over the Karnataka judiciary be regarded suitable to head any other high court? The transfer order contains the disturbing implication that the dignity of the Sikkim High Court is less important than that of Karnataka for the collegium, which is exactly what angered the bar association and fuelled protests in the hill State when the proposal was mooted this April. The collegium's proposal was a knee-jerk reaction to Justice Dinakaran's refusal to heed its advice to go on leave. It also exposes the helplessness of the panel in this situation, for while — following the Supreme Court judgments in the Second and Third judges cases — it has assumed the authority to make binding recommendations to the executive on the appointment and transfer of judges, it has no control over the functioning of the judges themselves. At the same time, it draws attention to a longstanding lacuna in dealing with errant judges — the absence of a speedy and efficient statutory mechanism, short of the unwieldy constitutional, and ultimately political, process of impeachment.
Impeachment proceedings against Chief Justice-designate of the Sikkim High Court are under way, with a notice admitted in Parliament and a three-member Rajya Sabha committee examining the charges. But there is still a long way to go before the various steps required under the Judges Inquiry Act, 1968, are taken and the impeachment motion comes up for vote in Parliament. Law Minister Veerappa Moily has announced that the draft Judges Standards and Accountability Bill, which contains many measures to strengthen the functioning of the judiciary — including a much less cumbersome mechanism to deal with errant judges — will be tabled in Parliament in the monsoon session. It has been delayed long enough and the Centre must ensure that it is passed quickly.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Transferring-the-problem/article16117964.ece
2,8,2010,Stronger state to state ties,"The recent visit of the head of Myanmar's military government, Senior General Than Shwe marks a clear shift and some clarity in India's policy towards its eastern neighbour. For a decade now, New Delhi has been trying to befriend Yangon in a bid to bolster its security architecture in the region and build a bridge to South-East Asia. In the mid-1990s, India was apparently more concerned over the continued detention of pro-democracy icon and Nobel laureate Aang San Suu Kyi. But, of late, there has been a gradual switch in focus, and the United Progressive Alliance government seems to have realised the importance of firming up ties with the ruling junta, which has proved enduring. This is in tune with the thinking of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) that it would make better sense to remain constructively engaged with the military regime than to toe the Western line of marginalisation and sanctions — a policy which in any case is unlikely to work, given Myanmar's proximity to and close strategic relations with China.
The bunch of bilateral agreements signed during the Senior General's five-day visit — they related, among others, to security, oil and gas exploration, trade promotion via the north-east region — reflect India's new priorities. The one on oil exploration needs to be viewed against the backdrop of India losing out in bids in 2006 because it needed to get Bangladesh on board for a gas pipeline project. Another major venture India will support relates to railway infrastructure. As for India's nagging worry about insurgent groups active in the northeastern States operating from out of Myanmar, the military rulers have promised to ensure that it does not happen. Whether New Delhi can expect the same level of cooperation from the military regime as it gets from Bangladesh on this front is a big question. For the ruling junta, the red carpet rolled out to Senior General Than Shwe should make a huge difference in the context of Myanmar's marginalisation. But any hope of the general election in Myanmar, due later this year, becoming an inclusive democratic event — with Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy allowed to participate in it — will be vain. No amount of nudging by New Delhi towards that end is going to help. The generals have floated their own political party to cling on to power and anyone wanting to do business with that country may well have to work with them in the future too. And the change in New Delhi's position should be seen in this perspective. Strengthening of state-to-state ties dictated by strategic imperatives ought not to be seen as approval of the military dictatorship.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Stronger-state-to-state-ties/article16115274.ece
3,8,2010,Back to founding principles,"The Bangladesh Supreme Court has made a progressive and far-reaching contribution to the project of national renewal that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed has undertaken since her return to power in December 2008. For much of its nearly four decade-long existence, Bangadesh has had the misfortune of having its national destiny determined not by the secular founding principles of its 1971 liberation struggle, but by military adventurers and — as in Pakistan — their hand-maidens, the religious parties. Under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the daughter of Bangladesh's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, and herself a participant in the liberation movement, there is a determined mood to reclaim those principles. With a two-thirds majority in Parliament, the ruling Awami League can easily make the required constitutional changes. But it now has a solid legal foundation in the Supreme Court's judgment upholding the annulment of General ZiaurRehman's Fifth Constitution Amendment. The amendment, introduced in 1979, legitimised the regimes that followed Sheikh Mujib's assassination. The Supreme Court has boldly struck down the Zia-era phrase “absolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah” in the preamble to the Constitution, and ordered the restoration of the original sentence containing the words “secularism, nationalism, democracy and socialism.” The judgment does not cover the 1988 Eighth Amendment introduced by General H.M. Ershad, making Islam the state religion. But by explicitly ordering the restoration of “secularism” in the preamble, the Supreme Court has left the door open for legal challenges to it. The judgment also makes clear its abhorrence of military rule.
The reinstatement of Article 12 — omitted in Zia's rewriting of the Constitution — prohibiting religion-based political mobilisation could have immediate implications for Bangladesh's rightwing Islamic groups, some of which are known to have foreign patrons and links with extremist and militant organisations. The Awami League government must take into account the possible political fallout before seeking to ban religious parties on the basis of the judgment, considering that these parties, including the Jamaat-e-Islami, are aligned with Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh National Party. The atmosphere in Bangladesh is already charged on account of the ongoing trial by an “international war crimes tribunal” of Jamaat leaders accused of collaborating with Pakistan in 1971. The Sheikh Hasina government must be careful not to permit the country's political polarisation to negate the recent positive achievements towards nation-building.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Back-to-founding-principles/article16117962.ece
3,8,2010,Behind Facebook's success,"From a start-up six years ago to the world's largest social networking site, Facebook has come to define contemporary social communication in the digital world. The exceptional popularity of this social networking site (SNS) in tricky cyber terrain is evident from the fact that the number of its active users has crossed 500 million. The imagination boggles: if Facebook were a country, it would be the third most populous in the world, behind China and India. Two other social network sites — MySpace (300 million) and Twitter (124 million) — would occupy the fifth and eighth slots, pointing to the magnitude of the revolution in cyberspace. The key to understanding the success of Facebook is that it rode on what social media theorist Clay Shirky characterises as the ability of the Internet to transform the manner in which information is created, shared, and distributed. The ease with which users can air their views and moods is an empowering attribute that prompts a global clientele to sign up. The SNS revolution started in 1997, and Facebook was not among the pioneers. Between 1997 and 2004, when Mark Zuckerberg launched the facebook.com as a site to share with his fellow Harvard students, many such sites came into being. Most of them vanished without a trace.
So why Facebook? Over the past six years, it went from being a closed user-group to one that gradually opened up: to high school networks, corporate networks, and finally anyone on Earth with an Internet connection. This expanding canvas for inter-personal communication has important lessons. At its most basic level, it reflects the success of an idea that forced society to sit up and take notice. Facebook's effectiveness is in its user-friendly approach behind which lies the application of cutting edge Internet technologies to serve a basic urge: the quest for information. It also ties in with contemporary knowledge society, marked by the ability of individuals quickly to create, package, and share content around the world. Mr. Zuckerberg's success is also closely linked to an innovation by which the site opened itself to other developers, thereby building a network of applications that piggyback on, and bring in users to, the site. Facebook's success has its caveats, such as privacy concerns, which it is obliged to address regularly. All said, these are still early days for social media. The path to success for rising social networking sites lies in their technology-led ability to connect people round the world seamlessly and capability to navigate the uncharted waters of business in cyberspace and actually garner revenues.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Behind-Facebooks-success/article16117963.ece
4,8,2010,Kashmir's crisis of authority,"Ever since July, when a tear-gas shell ended the life of a Srinagar teenager who had committed no crime other than being in the wrong place at the wrong time, Jammu and Kashmir has inched closer to the abyss each day. For all practical purposes, the authority of the state has collapsed. The State police personnel have been beaten on the streets; their weapons snatched; their homes torched. Most tragic of all, ever-growing numbers of young people have been shot in the course of increasingly desperate attempts to restore order. On Monday, Chief Minister Omar Abdullah called for additional central forces to restore order, and is believed to be considering a large-scale reorganisation of his administration. Even as Mr. Abdullah reiterated his demand for dialogue between the Indian government and a cross-section of political opinion in the State, he made clear that mobs could no longer “put a police station on fire and expect the policemen there to exercise restraint.” Even the harshest measures, though, are unlikely to immediately deter the young people leading the protests: appeals for restraint from politicians like Kashmir's Islamist patriarch, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, and even Hizb-ul-Mujahideen chief Mohammad Yusuf Shah, have done little to still the violent tide.
For all its scorching intensity, the violence this summer ought not to have overwhelmed the state. Secessionism has long been an entrenched part of the State's political life, fed by ideology, economic resentments and human-rights violations. There is no evidence, though, that its base has expanded dramatically in recent months. Far larger secessionist mobilisations were seen in 2008, after all, when competing ethnic-religious chauvinisms tore Kashmir and Jammu apart. The crisis is, in fact, the culmination of two years of drift. Ever since he took power in 2008, Mr. Abdullah reached out to the secessionist constituency — much as the opposition People's Democratic Party had done, with considerable success. The National Conference, Mr. Abdullah's advisers argued, had come to power only because it won eight seats in Srinagar, where there was little voter turnout, and its prospects would depend on developing a base in low-turnout urban areas where it has had little presence historically. But Mr. Abdullah's failure to develop effective administrative instruments and the resentments within his party cadre ensured that the National Conference ceded authority to secessionists. Mr. Abdullah is right: his overwhelming priority now must be the restoration of peace, with the very least bloodshed possible. But unless he begins focussing on building an administration and a political system that addresses those who voted him to power, the next crisis will not be far away.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Kashmirs-crisis-of-authority/article16117960.ece
4,8,2010,Long-acting insulin,"With animal studies trying out a single injection of a large assembly of insulin molecules (supramolecule insulin assembly) yielding promising results, the traditional method of treating Type I diabetes with multiple injections of insulin every day to maintain the normal glucose level can possibly be done away with. One injection of 200 microgram supramolecule was able to control and sustain the release of insulin in animals for a prolonged period of 120-140 days. The results of the study have been published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences —“Supramolecular insulin assembly II for a sustained treatment of type I diabetes mellitus,” by Sarika Gupta et al., of the National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi. The insulin supramolecular assembly was produced by altering the way the insulin protein folds. A slight misfolding of the protein attracted other insulin molecules to form a supramolecular assembly. The supramolecule, which is in itself an inert material, releases biologically active insulin on a sustained basis at a basal level (physiological range). Animal studies showed that sustained release of insulin through a novel drug delivery mechanism was able to maintain tight glycemic control both after a meal as well as during prolonged periods (12 to 18 hours) of starvation. Early morning low blood glucose level (hypoglycemia) episodes after a long gap between food intakes are a major problem with the traditional insulin therapy.
Unpublished data from studies on animals with Type II diabetes showed that the supramolecule was able to maintain normal glucose level for 30 days when higher doses were used. In India, there are more Type II than Type I diabetic patients who are on insulin. Human clinical trials, which will also include Type II patients, are set to begin next year. Initially, human trials are to start with once-a-week injection and will gradually switch to one shot in four weeks. Unlike in the case of Type I, maintaining tight glycemic control in Type II patients will be quite challenging. It often turned out that drugs producing excellent outcomes in animal studies are not so successful in humans. How exactly supramolecule acts on the humans remains to be seen. There is overwhelming scientific evidence of the number of new diabetic patients in India rising year by year. While new treatment methods will help those with the disease, making prevention a priority is the only way to reverse the trend. Healthy food habits and regular exercise can surely delay the onset of the disease; they can also go a long way in preventing it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Long-acting-insulin/article16117961.ece
5,8,2010,Resolute action needed,"London is ready to host mini Olympics-style games right now, two years away from the Olympics. Delhi, with less than two months to go for the opening of the Commonwealth Games, is in a mess, literally and figuratively. To the formidable technical and logistical challenges of getting the facilities ready in time has been added the task of cleaning up the financial act, with scams and scandals tumbling out every other day. As if the unedifying sight of the leaking stadia roofs was not enough, the charges of corruption and ‘doctored' e-mails against the Organising Committee (OC) officials have started flying thick and fast. The public authorities have not been spared either for some shoddy work in building stadia and beautifying the city. The so-called ‘world-class' facilities are still incomplete and have been found to be sub-standard or lacking in several respects. At least one of them, the swimming pool, has come in for adverse comments from the international federation's delegate. Low quality material and poor workmanship stick out at many a venue.
Extravagance had been the striking feature of Delhi's bid to host the Games. At the 2003 bid in Kingston, from offering free air passage, accommodation, and local transport to every member of a delegation to promising $100,000 to each participating country for training their athletes, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) was set on a splurging spree. The overall costs shot up from an original estimate of Rs.655 crore to the present Rs.11,490 crore, with the Delhi government expected to spend another Rs.17,000 crore. The promise of the OC to reimburse the government the organisational expenditure that could cross Rs.2,400 crore sounds rather hollow. The projected revenue is nowhere in sight, though IOA President and Chairman of the Organising Committee Suresh Kalmadi is sticking to his optimistic calculations. Even allowing for some cutting of procedural corners in the hurry to complete the facilities, the outlandish figures being quoted as hiring charges for air conditioners, treadmills, and chairs can only heighten the revulsion among the tax-paying public. Attempts at damage control through the new enquiry committee notwithstanding, with every passing day Mr. Kalmadi's position is becoming more and more untenable. With the deadlines long past, the government needs to show a greater resoluteness in the task of completing the facilities in the very short time left, and in starting enquiries to bring to book the perpetrators of the multiple scams, evidence of which is pouring out. The present Organising Committee has shown itself to be unequal to both these tasks",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Resolute-action-needed/article16119550.ece
5,8,2010,A green ban,"The European Parliament's decision to end the import of illegally harvested timber and timber products into EU member countries from 2012 is a welcome step towards better protection of the world's forests. Considering that an estimated 20 per cent of the wood coming into the European Union is felled in violation of the laws of the source country, the new rules that require the importers to document the chain of supply and the authorities to conduct periodic inspections are a major improvement on existing regulations that rely on certification in the country of origin. The importers will now have to identify the source of supply at every level. This provision ensures or enables transparency, traceability, and verification. The move to ban illegal timber could not have come sooner. There is grave concern for the forests in the Amazon, in several African countries, in Asia, and also in Russia, as rising consumption has contributed to massive deforestation. It is worth recalling that the State of the World's Forests 2009 forecast continuing deforestation in Asian countries, in Africa, and in Latin America owing to pressure for agricultural land, cultivation of biofuel crops, and higher consumer demand. It is significant, therefore, that the EU has struck a blow for forest protection with a law that makes import of timber obtained illegally a punishable offence. The national governments have been given time to legislate penalties for violations of the law.
A more aggressive international regime to save old-growth, biodiversity-rich forests from environmentally unsustainable logging is top priority. United Nations estimates put the share of industrial wood coming from illegal sources in the range of 20-40 per cent of the total. In some countries such as Liberia, the proceeds of such destructive commerce have been used to fund armed conflict. In the case of Madagascar, the military-compelled resignation last year of President Marc Ravalomanana has exposed pristine forests to felling. It is encouraging that the United States, which receives a lot of the illegal wood from this naturally unique island, has used the Lacey Act (which has objectives similar to the new EU measure) to prosecute importers. Preservation of forests is also central to the campaign against climate change. Here, the U.N.-mediated effort to create a compensation mechanism for countries that adopt conservation measures is a good way forward. With sufficient international legal cooperation to curb unlawful trade and a parallel mechanism to reward sincere national governments, it should be possible to make destruction of forests less and less attractive.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-green-ban/article16119551.ece
6,8,2010,A code for the times,"An overhaul of the regulatory rules on takeovers would follow if the key recommendations of a high level panel are accepted. The Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee (TRAC), headed by C. Achuthan, submitted its report in the third week of July. A fresh look at the takeover regulations has become necessary for a number of reasons. Although the rules on takeovers were notified for the first time only 16 years ago, the exponential increase in the number and type of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) has necessitated frequent tinkering with the rules. There was a major review in 1997, and as many as 23 amendments since then. There is an increased awareness of the fact that the world over M&As represent by far the most common route of cross-border capital flows, far outstripping direct investments in green field ventures. India too gets a significant part of its capital inflows through M&As. Indian companies have also become adept at playing the M&A game on the global stage, what with the Tatas, the Aditya Vikram Birla group and several others acquiring foreign companies. Easy availability of finance is one significant factor contributing to the rise in M&As. Private equity, dedicated funds, and even traditional bank finance are now available for the takeovers.
The TRAC recommendations seek to make the rules more transparent and also balance the interests of the acquirer, the target company, and the shareholders. The open offer trigger limit has been increased from 15 per cent to 25 per cent. After mopping up 25 per cent of the target company's shares, the acquiring company has to make an offer for the remainder. Hitherto, the minimum open offer size was pegged at 20 per cent. The latest move will benefit small shareholders, who can tender their shares during the open offer and get the same price for their shares as the larger shareholders. While the hike in the open offer trigger limit will give a greater leeway to the acquiring company to arrange the finances, it is feared the new rules might make acquisitions more expensive and thereby restrict an important capital market activity. The TRAC wants the independent directors of the target company to give their opinion on the offer. That should enhance transparency and benefit the small shareholders. But, given the level of corporate governance and the less than stellar role the independent directors play in many companies, it is by no means certain that the presumed benefits will accrue automatically. The proposed regulatory regime harmonises takeover regulations with the stock exchange rules by compelling the acquirer to disclose upfront whether it intends to remain listed or not.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-code-for-the-times/article16120854.ece
6,8,2010,New rights and old divisions,"In a landmark resolution, the United Nations General Assembly has recognised access to clean water and sanitation as a human right. The 39-state proposal, initiated by Bolivian President Evo Morales, was passed by 122 votes to zero, with 41 member states abstaining. The negotiations leading to the vote, however, were detailed and tense, and showed clear political divisions on North-South lines. The major opposition came from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Japan and several other industrialised countries together with developing countries known for siding with the U.S. and former colonial powers. Indeed, had Germany and Spain not stated that they would not oppose the resolution, opponents such as the U.K. and Sweden may even have succeeded in conveying the impression that the European Union as a whole had achieved a consensus against it. Some delegations, implausibly in this electronic age, said they did not receive their governments' instructions in time for the vote. Campaigning groups have also said that an attempt was made within the U.N. to derail the resolution, in the form of a prior letter sent by the U.N. Secretary General's Advisory Board to the President of the General Assembly suggesting alterations to the draft resolution; some have implied that this constituted an attempt to impose a neoliberal tone on the draft.
The fact remains, nevertheless, that nearly 900 million people lack access to safe drinking water; nearly two billion people live in water-stressed areas around the world, and three billion live a kilometre or more away from the nearest running water. Over 2.6 billion lack access to basic sanitation, and 1.5 million children under five die every year because of contaminated water or poor sanitation. Writing in The New York Times, Mikhail Gorbachev calls the situation “water apartheid,” and notes that since the end of World War II contaminated water has killed more people than all forms of violence combined. As to major diseases, AIDS, malaria, and measles together do not account for as many deaths as impure water does. The U.N. resolution is non-binding, but it has been hailed as a decisive move in the worldwide struggle for access to safe water as essential to human survival and dignity. Although the vote in the General Assembly has shown political cleavages, the passage of the resolution is a tribute to the tireless work of water-rights NGOs such as the Canada-based Blue Planet Project and to those Latin American states which, having learnt by bitter experience what neoliberalism means in practice, are leading the way towards significant alternatives.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/New-rights-and-old-divisions/article16120855.ece
7,8,2010,U.S. puts down roots in Iraq,"Iraqi insurgents have reacted to President Obama's talk of a “responsible end” to the Iraq war by killing 26 people in a day's attacks across Baghdad and the eastern city of Kut. The attacks cause serious problems for Mr. Obama's purported reduction of U.S. troop numbers to 50,000 by August 31 and for his long-term intentions. First, insurgents are widely thought to be regrouping around several Iraqi cities in preparation for the latest round of U.S. withdrawals. Secondly, Iraq's politicians are yet to form a coalition government, nearly five months after the general election. Thirdly, Washington's talk of reduction covers only combat troops and conceals the fact that the U.S. will maintain a network of gigantic bases in Iraq. The one at Balad, about 100 km north of Baghdad, can house 20,000 personnel; it covers 40 sq km and has an internal bus service and the usual American facilities. Inside, U.S. law applies and staff need not even set foot outside. The Al Asad base, 160 km west of Baghdad, holds 17,000 troops; one of its runways is 4.26 km long. The base is to be connected to the national electricity grid. Other U.S. stations in Iraq include Camp Falcon-al-Sarq at Baghdad, and Camp Victory near Baghdad International Airport, which can take 14,000 troops. The plan is apparently to maintain 70,000 troops and 200,000 contractors, or mercenaries by any other name, in Iraq.
The terms “enduring bases” and “permanent access” do more than evade the Congressional ban on permanent bases in foreign countries. The creation of such huge outposts in Iraq is entirely consistent with the Quadrennial Defense Review and the National Defense Strategy, both of which in effect put U.S. interests above the sovereignty or independence of other states. The possible counter that the Philippine Senate closed Clark Field and Subic Bay after nearly a century of U.S. tenure is negated by the subsequent Visiting Forces Agreement, under which Washington continues as before. In Iraq, the key document is the 2008 Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), signed between the U.S. and the then government in Baghdad. The Iraqi cabinet passed the agreement, but the ratifying referendum was postponed twice. It was then planned for March 2010 but nothing happened. So SOFA is de facto Iraqi law, despite being signed by a puppet regime in a country occupied and controlled by the U.S. According to one critic, instead of building the bases to wage war, the U.S. has waged war to build the bases. Noam Chomsky, for his part, calls the bases an empire, meaning they are not for U.S. security but for global dominance. In this, the Obama administration is indistinguishable from its infamous predecessor.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/U.S.-puts-down-roots-in-Iraq/article16122071.ece
7,8,2010,Major roadblocks,"The planned introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from April 1, 2011, was not expected to be smooth even though until very recently there were many reasons to be optimistic. By the end of July it seemed that the pragmatism displayed by the Centre matched by a conciliatory stance of most States would be able to deliver the most significant indirect tax reform on time. There have been, to be sure, some significant compromises by both the Centre and the States. The Centre which just six months ago had favoured a single tax rate over a wide base with very few exemptions and a relatively low tax threshold yielded considerable ground and more or less embraced the recommendations of the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers. A consensus was reached on key aspects of the GST: a dual structure comprising a Central GST and a State GST; and three separate rates to converge over a three year period into a single GST. The Finance Minister also promised to compensate the States for possible revenue losses. To assuage States' concerns over loss of financial autonomy, it was also decided to leave out petro products and electricity from the ambit of the GST. The Centre however stuck to its stated position of a lower and uniform exemption limit of Rs.10 lakh for both goods and services, while the States wanted a higher exemption threshold of Rs.1.5 crore for goods.
All these have shortened the odds, but it is clear that several major obstacles will still remain. High up in the list is the difficult task of restructuring the legal architecture to pave the way for the GST. Constitutional amendments are required that would, among others, enable the Centre to tax goods outside the factory gate and the States to levy a service tax. New institutional arrangements such as a GST Council and a GST Dispute Authority have to be put in place. Unfortunately the draft constitutional amendments circulated by the Centre are not acceptable to many States. A specific provision that confers veto powers to the Finance Minister even on matters relating to the State GST has been opposed. While an agreement is still possible, it is unlikely that the required constitutional amendments which require the support of two-thirds of the members present and voting in both Houses of Parliament and ratification by at least 15 States can be pushed through in time for the scheduled launch. It is certain that the States' opposition to the constitutional amendments is rooted in their lingering concern over loss of fiscal autonomy. The Centre should do all that it can to assuage their genuine concerns.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Major-roadblocks/article16122070.ece
9,8,2010,The right to food must be for all,"The recommendation by the National Advisory Council for a revised Food Security Bill is, in essence, a proposal to enhance entitlements in some spheres while reducing them in others. The enhancement lies in the fact that the Bill will recognise, for the first time, a justiciable right to food for all persons in the yet-to-be-identified 150 ‘most disadvantaged' districts. The reduction lies in the fact that the revised Bill will not envisage such a right to food as a universal right, but as one restricted to a target group — in this case, to be identified by geographical targeting. This is in contravention of the letter and spirit of Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which declares that the right to food must be for all individuals (and not circumscribed by region or any other factor) and that a variety of instruments must be used to respect, protect, and fulfil that right. The most unjust feature of the proposed revised Bill will be the restriction of the right to food to people living in a fourth of India's districts and not even necessarily comprising a fourth of the country's deprived population — the world's largest mass of poor, credibly estimated to be in the region of 800 million. A malnourished person must have recourse to the same justiciable right to food wherever she or he lives. The parallel the NAC draws with the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in this respect, that is, with a scheme begun on a pilot basis in 150 districts and then extended across the country, is misleading. The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act offered a new entitlement. By contrast, the institutional structure for the public distribution system and other measures of food and nutrition security — notably, school meals and supplementary nutrition for mothers and young children — are already in place throughout the country.
‘Rising India' is way off track in implementing the first Millennium Development Goal, that is, halving (during 2000-2015) the population in extreme poverty and hunger. The central government must wake up to the enormity of the task of ensuring adequate food and nutrition to our population. The least it can do here and now — in line with international covenants — is to make the right to food a universal entitlement. Tamil Nadu has shown that this is eminently achievable. Not committing the necessary financial resources to this end at the all-India level signals weakness of political will. It also means ideologically misconstrued social priorities. It goes without saying that the obligation to fulfil a right to food for all will require special and additional interventions and safeguards to serve the most vulnerable and food-deprived sections of our population.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-right-to-food-must-be-for-all/article16125786.ece
9,8,2010,Tactful decision,"The International Court of Justice's recent ruling, upholding Kosovo's 2008 Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) from Serbia, has evoked a predictable response, reflecting geo-political divisions. Whereas Pristina's mostly western allies have welcomed the non-binding verdict in support of the ethnic Albanian majority decision, countries contending with their own secessionist demands — Spain, Russia and China — have cautioned against the assertiveness of the breakaway groups elsewhere. The repression of ethnic Albanians by former Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic triggered Kosovan separatist demands in the 1990s. But the administration of the region, which is under U.N. peace-keeping for almost a decade since the 78-day long bombardment by the NATO forces, failed to produce a negotiated settlement. The Hague court has held that, as there is no bar under international law on the right to self-determination, Kosovo's declaration of independence does not constitute a violation. Nor is the principle of territorial integrity maintainable, since its scope is limited to the sphere of relations between sovereign countries. The court also ruled that the legitimacy of Kosovo's independence is a political fact that is determined by the recognition accorded by different countries, not a legal question. Such a general understanding perhaps explains why disputes over declarations of independence are rarely adjudicated at The Hague, and the case of Kosovo was the lone instance after the emergence of new countries from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
With the independence of Kosovo now a fait accompli and its membership of the U.N. a matter of time, the protection of its multi-ethnic character and the rights of Serbs and other minorities would be critical for peace and stability in the Balkans. The exuberant stance of the United States and its European allies on the secession of Kosovo was starkly at odds with their objection to Russia's recognition of the independence of the provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia in 2008. The widespread questioning of their double standards on nationhood did little to stop them. The rules on the making and unmaking of states are not drawn in chambers of law. They are lessons inferred from the unfolding pages of history and the situation on the ground including effective control. To that extent, conflicts over sovereignty and self-determination are better resolved through multilateralism and mutual respect.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Tactful-decision/article16126786.ece
9,8,2010,Nature’s fury in Leh,"With the death toll in the flash flood in Ladakh up to 150 (and 500 people missing), and hundreds of houses destroyed, the magnitude of the havoc wrought by the natural calamity cannot be underestimated. The floods affected Leh town and the surrounding villages, the main population centres of this thinly peopled district and also the focus of much of its economic activity. It is going to take many months for that remote corner of India to return to normal. The immediate priority is to ensure that survivors are rescued and taken to safety and provided medical care, and that all affected people have access to relief. The Army and the Air Force have already been deployed for rescue operations, to which the continuing bad weather poses a challenge. Moreover, sections of all roads leading to the ravaged area have been washed away. This means the only way to reach Leh now is by the air-link, itself dependent on the weather conditions. But all this only gives the task of rescue and relief an added urgency. Chief Minister Omar Abdullah's early visit to Leh, just hours after the calamity struck, has sent out a positive signal. It is to be hoped that his government, despite its preoccupation with the turmoil in the Valley, will not be found wanting in its response to the crisis in the days to come. The Centre must provide the Jammu & Kashmir government all the assistance it needs to cope with this emergency.
The devastating floods were caused by a cloudburst over Leh that lasted less than two hours. A cloudburst is high intensity rainfall in a short period of time, sometimes accompanied by hail and thunder, and can cause floods. A cloudburst over Mumbai in July 2005 saw the skies dumping 950 mm of water in eight to 10 hours, paralysing the city and claiming several lives. The exact measurement of rain that fell during the reported one-hour cloudburst over Leh on August 6 is still not available. While the rain on the two days may not come anywhere close to what Mumbai saw, for Ladakh it is a huge amount. This is what puzzles meteorologists. It never really rains in Ladakh, which is geographically categorised as a “cold desert.” The destruction in the floods was all the more because people in Ladakh, confident of dry conditions, have traditionally used mud in much of their architecture. The Leh disaster has come at the same time as Pakistan experiences its worst floods in a century. Across South Asia, weather patterns are changing in unpredictable ways, and require to be studied so that we are better equipped to deal with them.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Naturersquos-fury-in-Leh/article16124742.ece
9,8,2010,A timely effort,"If the number of species that live on land is not fully known, our knowledge of marine life diversity is much less. Even the scanty information available is not easily accessible. The Census of Marine Life (COML), a decade-long initiative involving 2,700 scientists from 80 countries, the largest-ever collaboration of marine biologists, has partially succeeded in addressing this issue. In a collection of papers published in the open access journal, PLoS One, COML has released an inventory compilation of known and new marine species along with their distribution and diversity pattern in key global ocean areas. The 25 biologically representative regions under study extend from the Antarctic through temperate and tropical seas to the Arctic. The results published do not include highly diverse areas like the Arabian Sea where the inventories continue, and the final findings are expected in October. The average number of known species in the 25 regions is about 11,000. On an average, crustaceans, including crabs, lobsters and shrimp, along with fish and molluscs, make up nearly half of all known species. The compilation challenges the notion that knowledge of diversity can be extrapolated from one location to another. For instance, about half of New Zealand and Antarctic marine species and a quarter of those seen in Australia and South Africa are endemic to those regions. South Korea, China, South Africa and the Baltic have most species relative to their seabed area. Evidently, marine species have not flourished uniformly across the world.
Though 230,000 marine species are known and, at least, 1,200 new species discovered by COML, 70-80 per cent still remain undiscovered. But there is a possibility that many species may be lost even before they are discovered and the diversity of known species affected, with over-fishing, pollution, and habitat loss posing great threats. Of grave concern is that these threats are real in all the 25 regions. Over-fishing occurred across a range of marine species harvested, and the spill-over of over-harvesting has resulted in the depletion of by-catch species abundance. Pollution and other human interventions such as dredging are affecting marine diversity in ways not fully known to us. While the threat from these activities is well known, enclosed seas such as the Mediterranean, Gulf of Mexico, and seas off China are at greater peril than the open seas. The effects of climate change, such as oxygen depletion and acidification, are beginning to affect marine life. The COML predictions of species loss may well come true unless the ecologically disruptive course is corrected.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-timely-effort/article16124780.ece
10,8,2010,Mamata's dangerous game,"In her eagerness to mobilise every dissenting section and use every available weapon against the Left Front government in West Bengal, Trinamool Congress chief and Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee is playing a dangerous game fraught with major, long-term implications for the internal security of the country. First, Monday's rally in Lalgarh was a joint Trinamool-Maoist enterprise, with the latter dominant in the mobilisation. Ms Banerjee not only called for the resumption of negotiations with the Maoists, but also pressed for withdrawal of security operations in the Jangalmahal region (though this time she set a condition: the extremists should declare a ceasefire). This is in direct opposition to the stance of the central government, which is struggling to meet the Maoist armed threat in West Bengal and other parts of the country. Although the Railways under her charge have been repeatedly targeted by the Maoists, the Trinamool chief spoke up for the Maoist front, the ‘People's Committee Against Police Atrocities,' whose members are known to take the law into their own hands. Ms Banerjee also managed to enlist the support of ‘social activists' Swami Agnivesh and Medha Patkar in this politically loaded endeavour. Both extended vocal support to the Trinamool Congress and the Maoists in the name of protecting the rights of Adivasis — speciously asking the ultra-left outfit to abjure violence and take to the democratic path. In such a situation, arms-wielding Maoists have seamlessly merged with Trinamool cadre in West Bengal, posing a serious threat to public order in the region.
Political India knows Ms Banerjee to be a law unto herself, and her politics to be irresponsible. But this cannot be a rationalisation for the United Progressive Alliance government to allow one of its important constituents and a senior Minister to publicly support, and collaborate on the ground with, armed extremism that does not have any compunction in unleashing terror against political opponents as well as civilians. The Congress, which heads the UPA, is itself mired in contradictions on this vital issue. Although Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has described the Naxalites as the “greatest internal security threat to our country,” his party extended moral support to the rally. Not surprisingly, the issue has rocked Parliament with the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Left parties questioning the commitment of the government in tackling the Maoist violence when one of its constituents is deeply enmeshed with Naxalite groups. With Assembly elections in West Bengal due in less than a year, political opportunism has given short shrift to internal security considerations. There will be a huge price to pay if the central government continues to look the other way as Ms Banerjee pursues her akratic course for power at any cost.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mamatas-dangerous-game/article16126890.ece
10,8,2010,For a more humane view,"Chairman of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and former Chief Justice of India K. G. Balakrishnan's recent defence of the death penalty is bewildering. His “deterrent effect” argument is starkly at odds with the near universal understanding that the fundamental right to life implies, among others, the abolition of the death sentence. In the 1951 A. K. Gopalan case, the Supreme Court of India effectively allowed unlimited restrictions on the right to life and liberty, so long procedures prescribed by law were followed. In the Maneka Gandhi case some three decades later, however, the court limited the scope to those procedures that were “right, just and fair,” not “arbitrary, fanciful and oppressive.” Significantly, in a 1985 ruling where execution by public hanging was declared unconstitutional, the court made the stinging observation that “a barbaric crime does not have to be met with a barbaric penalty.” This is the sequence of illustrious verdicts that culminated in the apex court's landmark judgment limiting the award of the death penalty to the “rarest of rare cases.” To be sure, the letter and spirit of that ruling has largely informed judicial opinion and public debate on capital punishment ever since. The Supreme Court has displayed sagacity and restraint in its appellate jurisdiction, even if the lower courts have tended to hand down the death penalty more readily. Recall the initial verdict and the subsequent pronouncements in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.
It should be fairly obvious to Justice Balakrishnan, more than to others, that his sanguine view on the legal safeguards for the death penalty is not borne out by facts on the ground. The accused in serious offences are often unable to get proper representation during trials; investigative agencies often resort to torture to extract confessions; and the complex web of corruption coupled with the suppression of evidence does not offer the assurance that no innocent person would be convicted. And, appealing to the higher judiciary is beyond the pale of the ordinary citizenry because of the huge cost. The cost-benefit analysis in terms of the “deterrent value” of capital sentence in the reduction of heinous crimes repudiates the very notion of punishment as a reformative process. The country's premier body vested with the protection of human rights is expected to take a humane and sympathetic view to soften the law's hard edges, and the right course for it would be to steer the public debate towards abolition.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/For-a-more-humane-view/article16126889.ece
11,8,2010,Spills & other shipping mishaps,"The collision of two large ships off the Mumbai coast and the resulting oil spill has come as a test of India's preparedness to handle shipping disasters. Any significant shipping accident has a serious environmental fallout, because oil or other hazardous cargo is discharged into the sea. As trade and demand for petroleum rise steadily, tanker and general ship movement to India, particularly along the western coast, is increasing. Against this backdrop, a strong oil spill response system is of paramount importance. Yet capacity-building efforts in major ports have not kept pace with the need. It is legitimate to ask, for instance, whether the spread of oil discharged by the container ship MSC Chitra off Mumbai could have been better contained had sufficient booms been deployed. Also, could the containers loaded with pesticides that slipped into the sea have been recovered quickly? It is precisely to meet such challenges that a National Oil Spill Disaster Contingency Plan (NOS-DCP) was drawn up in 1996. Based on this, all ports should by now possess functional spill response systems but they clearly do not. The proceedings of the 14th NOS-DCP and Preparedness Meeting held in 2009 highlighted the slow progress in achieving full response capacity even at the basic level at Mumbai and JNPT ports. At the very least, it must be ensured that these and other big ports and oil handling facilities have the primary Tier I capability, which by definition can combat oil spills up to 700 tonnes.
India has ratified key environmental and shipping conventions, including the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation. The national coastline is about 7,500 km long and has, in the assessment of the Coast Guard (CG), 11 major and 20 minor ports that must be equipped to combat oil pollution. A few ships sink in Indian coastal waters every year; in 2007, as many as five vessels with a total of 658 tonnes of oil went down. The importance of capacity building and infrastructure in the ports and coastal administrations to fight oil spills and manage hazardous and noxious cargo cannot be over-emphasised. Although the CG is the central coordinating agency, it is incumbent on the States to modernise their pollution control apparatus, which is responsible for coastal protection. Interestingly, in Maharashtra, the Pollution Control Board recently wanted the State Environment Department to take the lead in preparing local contingency plans. Without such plans, a district-level protocol is not available to prevent environmental damage. Finally, the CG suggestion to identify and list professional Oil Spill Response Organisations to serve as a national resource base must be accepted and acted upon.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Spills-amp-other-shipping-mishaps/article16127998.ece
11,8,2010,Promising microbicide,"Half of the 33 million people living with HIV worldwide are women. In South Africa, which accounts for 70 per cent of the global HIV burden, about one in three women in the 20-34 age group is estimated to be infected. Large numbers of women in countries like India get infected despite their being in monogamous relationships. Hence the scientific community has had a strong sense of urgency in its quest for a safe and effective gel (microbicide) that women can use for self-protection. Now there is promise of a safe and effective microbiocide, going by the results of a clinical trial carried out on nearly 900 women in South Africa and published online in Science (“Effectiveness and safety of tenofovir gel, an antiretroviral microbiocide, for the prevention of HIV infection in women,” by Quarraisha Abdool Karim et al.) The gel, which can be topically applied to the vagina, was tried out in two sites in KwaZulu-Natal province — the epicentre of HIV in South Africa — from May 2007 to December 2009. Where the clinical study found an average protection of 39 per cent, protection levels shot up to 54 per cent in the case of women who used it more than 80 per cent of the time. The positive outcome caps nearly 20 years of research and trials of six microbiocides. Unlike other microbiocides, which even increased the chances of HIV infection, the one tested in KwaZulu-Natal province contained one per cent of tenofovir, an antiretroviral drug that is currently used as tablets in many countries to treat HIV.
More trials involving many volunteers are needed to corroborate the results of the latest trial. A microbiocide with tenofovir (MTN 003) is already on trial in South Africa since September 2009, and the process is expected to be completed in 2014. Unlike the current trial, MTN 003 will enrol a larger number of volunteers — 5,000. Though only a minimal amount of tenofovir is being used, this and the future trials need to look for resistance to the antiretroviral drug. Another challenge is to improve compliance. The KwaZulu-Natal trial required women to use the gel twice — first less than 12 hours before sex and again within 12 hours after sex. It was felt that to ensure adherence to such a specific dosage might be difficult. Indeed, the adherence rate was found to be less than 50 per cent in as many as 367 of the nearly 900 women. The MTN 003 trial will have a daily dosage schedule. It is hoped the results of this trial will bring more clarity in respect of the dosage schedule, the levels of adherence, convenience, and the protection achieved.

12,8,2010,A healthy measure,"At a time when there is regulatory confusion and well-founded concern over the cost and quality of health care, the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Bill, 2010 passed by both houses of Parliament is an important step forward. Provided its objective is pursued sincerely, the legislation can go a long way in empowering patients who are now forced to deal with a medical establishment that is opaque, unaccountable, and often unethical in its working. Among other things, the Bill provides for compulsory registration of all clinical establishments in recognised systems of medicine (allopathy, yoga, naturopathy, ayurveda, homoeopathy, siddha, and unani); the publication, within two years of its commencement, of a national register of establishments; and the laying down of minimum standards, also within a period of two years. By prescribing penalties for violations by private as well as public institutions, it promises to raise standards of accountability. It can also eliminate quackery. The Bill protects the regulatory role of the State administration, as the district registering authority will have the district collector and the district health officer as members. Moreover, there will be a State Council involving senior officials and medical authorities.
A lot of work waits to be done to standardise protocols, define malpractice, and codify patient rights. The annual health expenditure in India is estimated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority to be in the region of Rs.300,000 crore. Nearly a third of this goes towards hospital-related procedures and treatment, and the rest for outpatient and domiciliary treatment, medicines, investigations, and so on. Much of this is spent out-of-pocket. Given the impoverishing nature of costs and the poorly evolved state of health insurance, there is an urgent need for comprehensive regulation. It is notable that the new measure has come about as a result of resolutions passed by the legislatures of Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Mizoram, and Sikkim, where it will automatically go into force along with the Union Territories. It is open for other States, including those that have similar laws, to adopt it. The IRDA, meanwhile, is expected to come out with draft norms for health insurance, including standard definitions of illnesses. Much time has been lost: a Bill with the same objectives introduced in Parliament three years ago lapsed. Regulation of quality and cost is doubly necessary considering that the State governments are now sending poor patients to for-profit private hospitals under subsidised health insurance schemes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-healthy-measure/article16129292.ece
12,8,2010,Mexico reopens the drugs debate,"President Felipe Calderón of Mexico has effectively signalled an end to the war on drugs declared 40 years ago by Richard Nixon; he has called for a debate on the legalisation of drugs. Drug-related violence in Mexico has claimed an estimated 28,000 lives in just the last four years. The major gangs are embroiled in savage turf wars. They give about $100 million a month in bribes to poorly paid police and officials across the country. The annual export of narcotics to the United States is now worth $39 billion, which is equivalent to 20 per cent of the Mexican government's budget. The main exports are harder drugs like cocaine and heroin, as most of the marijuana consumed in the U.S. is grown there. The gangs have also developed a parallel economy on the basis of people-trafficking, extortion, kidnapping, and the sale of pirated DVDs. Furthermore, the Mexican drugs cartels have gained fearsome firepower since the U.S. lifted its ban on the sale of assault rifles in 2004. Even the weapons seized by the authorities could equip an army; they include 50,000 AK47 and AR15 rifles, 6,000 grenades, 10 million rounds of ammunition, and armour-piercing rifles. Firearms are freely available along the 3,100-km U.S.-Mexican border.
The Mexican President is himself opposed to the legalisation of drugs. But he is not the first leader on the continent to note the near-impossibility of winning the war on drugs as it is now being waged. Several other former heads of state have made similar observations and the Argentine Supreme Court has ruled that punishment for the personal use of marijuana is unconstitutional. Mexico itself has ended prosecutions for the possession of small amounts of a range of drugs. The wider issues, however, have an ineradicable political dimension. First, the current militaristic and punitive approach has put many Latin American democracies at risk of collapsing into narco-republics. In Mexico, for example, the main gangs terrify local populations with strung-up corpses, paralyse traffic at will, and have even succeeded in shutting down certain operations by Pemex, the state oil company. Secondly, the export of heavily subsidised U.S. agricultural produce to Latin America has left millions of small farmers with no option but to grow coca leaf for sale to drug mafias and eventual export to the American market. Now Latin America has acknowledged that the damage caused by drugs goes far beyond the incontestably huge harm they do to users. President Calderón has his flanks well protected by his own position on drugs and by creating intelligent space for an honest debate.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mexico-reopens-the-drugs-debate/article16129288.ece
13,8,2010,Ashtiani exposes Iranian justice,"Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani's sentence of death by stoning has focussed renewed international attention on Iran's judicial system. A blog written by Ms Ashtiani's lawyer, and the public courage shown by her son and daughter, have provoked enough international outrage for the Iranian government to change the method of punishment to hanging. It is, however, feared that Ms Ashtiani will be executed soon, particularly because she has appeared on state-run Iranian television and ‘confessed' to involvement in the murder of her husband as well as adultery with a man who was convicted of that murder but was pardoned by her son. Ms Ashtiani's lawyer, Houtan Kian, says she was beaten and tortured in prison until she agreed to appear on camera. There seem also to have been several breaches of legal procedure. In 2006, she was convicted of “illicit relationships” and punished with 99 lashes; subsequently a charge of adultery while she was married was laid against her. This time she was convicted and sentenced to death by stoning. Since two of the five judges in the second hearing acquitted her, she should not have been sentenced to death under Iranian law. The second conviction, furthermore, was made on the basis of “judge's knowledge,” a weird provision that allows judges to make rulings even where there are no witnesses and conclusive evidence is lacking.
Brutalities of many kinds are involved here. Death by stoning is so cruel that Iran, which is heir to one of the world's great ancient civilisations, censors reports of it. The Chief Justice's 2002 moratorium on it has never been formalised in the national penal code. Secondly, male victims of stoning are buried only up to the waist and if they can pull themselves clear are allowed to go free; women are buried up to the neck lest their breasts be exposed, and almost certainly cannot escape. Thirdly, hanging in Iran relies on slow strangulation. The country is not alone in imposing capital punishment in extremely brutal ways; Saudi Arabia is a fellow-perpetrator. Iran has executed 100 people so far this year, and another 15 currently await execution. If there is any light behind this cloud, it is that Ms Ashtiani's case has triggered arguments among the country's highest leaders, at least about death by stoning. The overriding issue, of course, is the imperative need for all civilised societies to abolish the death penalty. No fewer than 130 countries have either abolished the death penalty or have not implemented it for ten years. It is to be hoped that Ms Ashtiani's case will lead India to consider abolishing this barbaric punishment.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Ashtiani-exposes-Iranian-justice/article16130529.ece
13,8,2010,Not so healthy,"A recent dispute between general insurance companies and certain categories of health-care providers has snowballed into a major controversy calling into question the relevance of health insurance for meeting medical expenses. Over a month ago, the four public sector general insurance companies, who collectively hold a majority of health insurance policies, decided to withdraw “cashless” facilities offered by them either directly or through third-party administrators (TPAs). Initially projected as a marketing tool, the cashless option is now a common feature in all health insurance policies. Since the insurance companies undertake to settle the bills directly, the policyholder is spared the burden of making the payment upfront and then getting it reimbursed, a tedious process in the best of times. The number of network hospitals, those that participate in the scheme through a contractual relationship, has increased enormously, aided substantially by the cashless facilities on offer. Health insurance has become the fastest growing segment of general insurance — it registered, on average, an annual growth of 35 per cent over the last decade. With less than 10 per cent of the eligible population covered so far, there is obviously a great potential to be tapped.
Given this context, the withdrawal of the most popular feature of health insurance plans is a setback for not only the policyholders but also, in a larger sense, the orderly growth of the health insurance business. The insurers have alleged that the network hospitals, in collusion with doctors, inflate the bills that are settled by the TPAs under the cashless scheme. Health-care providers are largely unregulated, and there are no standard treatment protocols, no benchmarks of costs to be charged, and no standardised data maintenance. Insurers complain that the present business model is becoming unviable with loss ratios running in excess of 120 per cent. The public sector insurance companies are trying to provide some of the benefits of the cashless policies through a newly created category of preferred provider-network of hospitals with agreed payment schedules for standardised treatments. On the other side, the leading hospitals have their own reasons to offer: the cost of health care, like everything else, is rising, and in the course of treating the patients they cannot stint on tests and procedures that could turn out to be expensive. Policyholders and insurance companies as well as hospitals and doctors would all be better off if a greater degree of transparency is introduced in health insurance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Not-so-healthy/article16130526.ece
15,8,2010,A Red-letter day,"FRIDAY, August 15, 1947
BY the grace of Providence India enters the comity of free nations to-day, an equal among equals. It is an occasion for rejoicing not only for her people but for all who value human freedom as an end in itself. So long as this country with her hoary civilisation and many-sided culture, her wealth of resources and matchless opulence of spirit remained in political bondage, that very fact constituted an implicit denial of those values to which the dominant nations of the West were wont to pay lip service. That India has at long last achieved her independence by agreement with Great Britain is a fact for which the sagacity and statesmanship of Britain is entitled to the fullest credit. Other imperial Powers are bound to follow in her footsteps sooner or later; for the heart has gone out of Imperialism. The harrowing experience of two wars within a single generation is to a large extent responsible for this awakening among the ruling Powers. But the way in which the people of India have conducted their struggle for emancipation has not been without its influence in bringing about a change in the world outlook. The outstanding marvel of this century is the faith inspired in millions of people that truth may prevail, unbacked though it be by the big battalions,, that you may win over your adversary by putting him on his honour, relying on his good faith and appealing to his reason. By imbuing his countrymen with this faith and sustaining it through the long night-of darkness and despair Mahatma Gandhi has not only won for himself a secure place in our affections; he has placed all humanity in his debt. To him and to the countless men and women who sacrificed themselves cheerfully that others might live to breathe the ampler air of freedom, our hearts turn to-day in reverent homage.
We have achieved freedom; But at what cost! A country and a people that by every test are a unity have been arbitrarily divided. And the wound will take long to heal; for, as Mr. Nehru has sadly remarked, ""division has taken place in the hearts of the people of India"". But it is idle to brood over what has happened and foolish to get angry and cast about for scapegoats. Many think that there is bound to be a reunion when there has been time enough for people to reflect coolly on the disastrous consequences of this unnatural partition. That is as it may be. But those who are perpetually harping on it, whether from genuine distress or in a fractious spirit, will not be hastening that consummation. It can only act as an irritant. The temptation for the protagonists of a united India and of Pakistan to talk at each other from a distance should be set aside. And both sides should concentrate on the thousand and one practical tasks that will have to be tackled in a spirit of mutual accommodation if life is not to be unnecessarily hard for large masses of men. The responsible leaders have shown a praiseworthy desire to conciliate the minorities and to reassure them. But so long as Lahore, Calcutta, and other big cities remain in the grip of madmen drunk with blood and the civil power stands helpless in the face of organised murder and loot, it is idle to expect the minority communities to be satisfied with verbal assurances however ample. From today the responsibility for ending this disgraceful state of affairs is solely ours. Neither the Government of India nor that of Pakistan must overlook the fact that our new-won freedom is itself gravely menaced by this chronic lawlessness. Every effort should, of course, be made to rally the vast majority of peaceable citizens in support of law and order. But the long arm of the law should be not less ready to collar and swift to punish the malfactors however deeply they might be entrenched.
We have won freedom. And the first thing our people must learn is that it is no picnic. They will have to gird their loins and work as they have never worked before. Any number of paper plans will not usher in the millennium if we go on interminably arguing their relative merits. The consensus of instructed opinion in the country is that our urgent need is to increase production. Dr. John Matthai. in stressing the other day the fact that the redressing of the present gross inequality in distribution is no less essential, was no doubt applying a healthy corrective. But, while admitting this, we would point out that there is some risk in envisaging the pursuit of economic equality in terms of a struggle. Dr. Matthai argued that like all national movements for freedom ours too, has had to lean heavily on vested interests and the latter have taken the fullest advantage of this; and that a determined effort should now be made to shake off this strangle-hold and this could be done, and the energy released by the achievement of freedom could be best utilised by casting vested interests for the role of enemy as we cast British Imperialism for that role till the other day. Dr. Matthai was, we are sure, merely using picturesque language to emphasise his point. But there is a danger in simplifying these things, especially with a people who are still novices in the art of political democracy. We have to deal, not with lifeless things that stay put, but with a dynamic situation which changes under our very eyes. Those who led the fight for freedom yesterday may themselves come to be regarded as vested interests by their self-styled successors of to-day who claim to lead the struggle for economic equality. In act, the epidemic of strikes that has broken out in many key-industries and that is further impoverishing an economy that is already dangerously on the verge of collapse, is often sought to be justified on the ground that the bourgeois leaders are in league with the capitalists. If these ideological recriminations are given their head, we must bid farewell to all hopes of a united drive for maximising production and for opening up new and fruitful fields of economic activity.
Having pinned our faith to the method of peaceful persuasion in our struggle for emancipation it would ill become us to look upon the coercive exercise of the State power as the inevitable instrument for building up a strong and well-knit nation. Among us, as in other parts of the world, there are bound to be wide differences of opinion as to the objectives of State policy. All rational men aim at the good life as the goal of the State; but. though there is general agreement in regard to the material conditions which the term implies, there are considerable differences of opinion over the spiritual values which are no less essential to the good life, such imponderables, among others, as freedom of thought itself. Far from regarding it as necessary in the interests of the public welfare to steam-roller opinion at the behest of a dominant clique, our age-long tradition, to which totalitarian tyranny is profoundly repugnant, has always favoured the allowing of the maximum liberty to people to live their Own lives without denying others their due. If we are to be true to our own best impulses we should depend on education rather than legislation, on the catalytic action of creative thought and not on mass agitation and crude propaganda, to bring about those changes which may be necessary to eliminate poverty, wretchedness and strife and to enable every citizen of free India to attain to fullness of life and that inner freedom which the Vedic seers termed Swaaraajya",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-red-letter-day/article13797798.ece1
16,8,2010,Kashmir's missing government,"“Hurling a shoe,” remarked Omar Abdullah wryly, “is better than hurling stones.” In his August 15 address to the people of Jammu and Kashmir, Chief Minister Abdullah finally found the words many have been waiting months to hear. But it remains unclear how he intends to deliver on his calls for dialogue and peace. Ever since the anti-India protests, which have dogged Mr. Abdullah's time in office, started to escalate this June, his administration has displayed few signs of having a coherent vision for action. The arrests of secessionist leaders followed by efforts to buy peace with them; the arrests of stone-throwing youth and simultaneous promises of jobs for them; appeals for dialogue matched by murderous police action: all these have been deployed in bewildering, aimless succession. The reality is that the Islamist extremists spearheading the anti-India protests that have led to the loss of almost 60 lives this summer have no interest in peace. The protests have allowed a new generation of radical Islamist leaders, like Massrat Alam Bhat and Asiya Andrabi, to seize leadership of the anti-India movement in Kashmir. But the protests aren't, as some polemicists have claimed, a Kashmir-wide mass uprising. The violence remains concentrated, as it has been since the summer of 2009, in urban parts of the districts of Srinagar, Baramulla, Pulwama, and Anantnag — the historic heartlands of the anti-India movement in J&K. The current protests are nowhere near as large as those that tore the State apart in 2008: and that makes the failure to address them inexplicable.
Fine words and promises cannot stem the rising tide of blood on Kashmir streets. It will need governance — a task the ruling National Conference-Congress alliance in the State has shown little interest in. Ever since he took power in 2009, the Chief Minister has relied on administrators of breathtaking incompetence. The rot has been most marked in the State police. Much of the killing on Kashmir's streets came about not because the protests threatened to overwhelm authorities, but because lethal force was indiscriminately used by panicked, wretchedly led police. J&K's civil bureaucracy has done just as badly. High officials have proved unable to secure a semblance of governance in the face of secessionist fiat — or to build bridges with communities devastated by the violence. As though this were not enough, politicians from the National Conference and the Congress have been missing in inaction. Only a few have been visible on the streets of their constituencies, reaching out to those who need them. Mr. Abdullah needs all the help he can get from the central government but he must first act to demonstrate on the ground that Jammu & Kashmir has a government.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Kashmirs-missing-government/article16135352.ece
16,8,2010,Banking on India Post,"India's search for viable methods of creating a financially inclusive economy has a ubiquitous, albeit underutilised, ally — India Post. The world's largest postal network has over 1.55 lakh post offices, 89.76 per cent of which are in rural areas. On an average, a post office serves 7,175 people and covers an area of 21.21 sq. km, giving it a natural advantage to take financial services closer to the unbanked. A recent expert committee report makes a strong case for harnessing the Post Office Savings Bank (POSB) for achieving financial inclusion, as the reach of post offices is twice as extensive as that of all commercial banks put together. The time-tested credibility of POSBs, started in 1882, and the wide customer base of 206 million savings accounts, which held Rs. 56,369.77 crore as on March 31, 2009, make out a strong case for full-fledged banking operations for India Post. Against this backdrop, the XI Five Year Plan's proposal to set up a Post Bank of India merits serious consideration.
Key policy changes are in order, however. India Post now carries out its banking and insurance operations as an agency function of the Ministry of Finance. This raises issues relating to operational autonomy. To overcome this limitation, the expert committee's suggestion that India Post should engage with the Finance Ministry to “re-examine and expand its presently limited agency function” is an important starting point. The possible start of full-fledged banking operations, including lending, will also necessitate post office banks to be governed by the country's banking laws. For now, however, India Post is striving to be in sync with the times. Its recent step to facilitate remittances by NRIs is one indicator. Such efforts need to be taken further to make financial inclusion meaningful. As the expert committee points out, the advantage of India Post taking to banking operations is that it can bring a multiplicity of stakeholders on a common platform, for instance, central and State governments, microfinance institutions and technology providers, and serve the financially excluded. The tying up of user-accounts for rural job schemes is a welcome start, and can be expanded to include cash transfer schemes that benefit the poor. The committee's suggestion that post offices open low-cost accounts and provide micro-loans strengthens the case for post offices doubling as banks. The most important determinant of how well India Post rises to its potential to emerge as a lead player in financial inclusion, however, will be the quality of services it renders to its customers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Banking-on-India-Post/article16134239.ece
16,8,2010,Superbug threat,"Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae strains resistant to carbapenem, a powerful antibiotic, and one of the last lines of treatment for infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, are becoming more widespread in India. The resistance arises on account of a new gene that codes for metallo-beta-lactamase enzyme. The drug-resistant bacterial gene, the so-called superbug, was named New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) in 2009 when it was first identified in a Swedish person admitted to a hospital in New Delhi. A study, reported online in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, (“Emergence of a new antibiotic resistant mechanism in India, Pakistan, and the UK: a molecular, biological, and epidemiological study,” by Karthikeyan K. Kumarasamy et al.) found that apart from several locations in India, the carbapenem-resistant strain was seen in 37 U.K. patients who had undergone elective and cosmetic surgery in India and two neighbouring countries. According to a study published in March in the Journal of Association of Physicians of India (JAPI), 22 cases of carbapenem-resistant NDM-1 were collected within three months from a Mumbai hospital. The spread and increasing numbers come as no surprise as the drug is overused. Resistance to extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) drugs like third-generation cephalsporins is between 60 and 70 per cent on average in India, compared with less than 15 per cent seen in many developed countries. A common way of treating the severe form of ESBL infections is the use of carbapenem — which becomes the drug of choice as it has the lowest resistance rates and the broadest action against Gram-negative infections.
Inappropriate and indiscriminate use of carbapenem, a reserved antibiotic, has played a major role in the development of the carbapenem-resistant gene, including the new NDM-1 strain. From being absent a few years ago, NDM-1 is beginning to show up. Unlike ESBL, which has become a community infection, NDM-1 is, in all probability, still a hospital-acquired infection. Drug-resistant NDM-1 strains are being seen only now but they are a cause for worry because only a few drugs are available to treat Gram-negative infections. The prevalence can increase within a relatively short time, since the NDM-1 gene is carried in the plasmids of the Gram-negative bacteria. These plasmids can move from one bacterium to another, and even to different species. There is still a good chance of keeping the prevalence low, provided a two-pronged approach is adopted: instituting a national antibiotic policy that restricts the use of carbapenem and other higher-end antibiotics to hospital settings and only for patients with severe infections, and having a national registry of drug-resistant strains.
Correction
The editorial, “Superbug threat” (August 16, 2010) referred to third-generation drugs, cephalsporins. It should have been cephalosporins",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Superbug-threat/article16135206.ece
16,8,2010,Pragmatic rollback,"On the face of it, it does look surprising that the Central government should roll back some of the important capital market rules that were put in place barely two months ago. In early June, the government significantly altered the relative proportion of the public and promoters' shareholdings in the capital of a limited company. The threshold limit of public shareholding was raised from 10 per cent to 25 per cent. Companies that fell short of the minimum were asked to comply with the norm in phases, by adding five per cent to the public holding every year. These changes were expected to result in a substantial increase in the pool of quality stocks open to the domestic, non-promoter shareholders, since many profit-making companies, including several government-owned ones, would be forced to divest. In the process, small retail holders will stand to gain, with the equity habit too getting a boost. Despite all the presumed benefits flowing from the new guidelines, the government has opted to go back on them in some important aspects.
Two of the changes are significant. First, public sector companies need to maintain a public shareholding of just 10 per cent, not 25 per cent as stipulated earlier. Secondly, listed private companies are now free from the obligation of divesting at least five per cent of shares every year, although they will still have to attain the 25 per cent public holding mark within the prescribed time frame. They now have some leeway in phasing the public offer according, inter alia, to the market conditions. It is evident that some practical considerations have weighed with the government in modifying the rules within so short a period. For one, there were apprehensions that adherence to the June guidelines would result in a glut of public offerings, which could be beyond the capacity of the primary and secondary markets to absorb. To be specific, a slew of public issues by central public sector enterprises are on the anvil and even a target level of 10 per cent minimum float would, in all probability, have depressed the share prices. A few of the major public sector units, such as Coal India, are entering the capital market for the first time. The government needs to ensure that an abundance of shares on offer, however temporary, does not drag down the market valuations of the public sector units as a whole. Besides, there is the key question of whether some of these entities really need the large funds that their share issues will mop up.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Pragmatic-rollback/article16133135.ece
17,8,2010,People before profits,"If there is a single conclusion the Ministry of Environment and Forests can arrive at based on the report of the four-member committee led by Planning Commission member N.C. Saxena on the proposed open cast mining in Orissa's forested Niyamgiri hills, it is this: drop it. The violation of laws protecting the environment and the rights of tribals to facilitate the project proposed by Vedanta Resources is nothing short of scandalous. It is unconscionable that the Orissa government, in its eagerness to remove all obstacles to mining, has trampled over the rights of primitive tribal groups such as the Dongaria Kondh and Kutia Kondh residing in the areas proposed to be mined. The panel appointed by the Ministry of Environment and Forests makes it clear that due process was not followed to get the consent of the tribals for diversion of forest land. What is particularly egregious is the steamrolling of the people's opposition, ignoring the protection that Scheduled Tribes enjoy under Schedule V of the Constitution. The provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, and the Environment (Protection) Act have been ignored by the district collectors of Rayagada and Kalahandi. The only proper course open to the MoEF, therefore, is to reject the proposal and ask the applicant to go back to the drawing board to explore alternatives.
It is natural that in a populous country such as India, alienation of land is bound to be contentious as people are sought to be displaced in favour of profit-oriented extractive industries with no long-term stakes in the environment. There is also the question of externalities. Perhaps the best-known example in this regard is the loss of ecology and devastating water pollution caused by mining in Kudremukh. The mines here silted dams and affected agriculture in surrounding areas before the activity was ended five years ago. It is welcome that the Saxena Committee has sounded a warning on the ecological fragility of Niyamgiri, and underscored the estimated losses from the proposed project. That includes a staggering 121,337 trees, innumerable ground flora, habitat of elephant and some rare fauna, not to speak of tribal livelihoods. Also, the mountain is sacred to the beleaguered Dongaria Kondh, who have become emblematic of global tribal struggles and even inspired comparisons with the fictional Na'vi people of James Cameron's Avatar. The MoEF and the Orissa government must now unsparingly investigate the reported violation of Environment Impact Assessment guidelines by Vedanta at its alumina plant and uphold the process of law in Niyamgiri and elsewhere.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/People-before-profits/article16135363.ece
17,8,2010,Tighter guidelines,"The Reserve Bank of India's discussion paper on entry of new banks in the private sector collates various, often conflicting, views on what is turning out to be a key aspect of banking policy and financial sector reform. It also brings up to date the central bank's thinking and international experiences with private sector banks. The Finance Minister in his budget speech, while calling upon banks to extend geographical coverage and improve access to banking services, had said that the RBI would be giving a few licences to select private sector players, including non-banking finance companies. The discussion paper, open for public debate, is a major step at framing new guidelines for entry. The recent financial sector crisis showed the private sector banks in the United States and other advanced countries in a poor light. Almost all major banks in the U.S. and a sizable number in Europe had to be baled out by governments. Prudent regulation might have saved the Indian banks from the worst consequences of the crisis, but the RBI's experience with the private sector banks since the beginning of financial reforms has not been wholly satisfactory. Out of the 10 new banks licensed under the 1993 guidelines, only the four promoted by leading institutions have flourished.
An important lesson from the experience of the 1990s is that neither a high capital adequacy requirement — of Rs.200 crore to begin with — nor advanced technology has been of particular help to many of the new entrants. The RBI has rightly chosen to address some of the key issues of bank licensing by listing out the pros and cons. On the hotly debated issue of letting leading industrial houses in, there are, to be sure, significant advantages in allowing them to run banks — among them are deep pockets and managerial ability. On the negative side, the banks might easily find ways to circumvent regulatory guidelines relating, for example, to group exposures and patronisation of promoters. Also, framing capital adequacy requirements for the new banks is not going to be easy. A higher entry level capital of Rs.1,000 crore might put off some genuine and otherwise worthy applicants but it is highly desirable in the context of the growing financing needs of the country. Non-banking finance companies seem to be the obvious candidates. They already deal with most of the banking products and are also regulated, though compared to banks they are subject to much lighter controls. It is just as well that an independent expert group is envisaged to vet and recommend eligible applications to the RBI.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Tighter-guidelines/article16135364.ece
18,8,2010,Signalling a transition,"China is now the world's second largest economy, having overtaken Japan in terms of the size of its GDP. It is true that this is partly due to Japan's poor performance. The change in rankings coincided with news that Japan's GDP grew at just 0.4 per cent in the three months to the end of June, well below an expected 2 per cent plus. It is also true that in per capita terms China's GDP is less than a tenth of that in Japan. Yet the fact that the change in China's ranking is the result of a scorching pace of growth sustained over a period of three decades, which shows no signs of relenting, suggests that this is by no means the end of a journey. Hence, despite the many statistical issues relating to estimation procedures used in different countries and the exchange rates at which local currency figures are converted to a common currency, the new GDP numbers are seen as signalling a transition to a new era in terms of the global balance of power.
China has responded with much maturity and not displayed any triumphalism after the release of these numbers. This is partly because, measured in purchasing power parity exchange rates, its GDP has been ahead of Japan's for quite some time now. It has also had a more important role and greater influence in the global system. But Chinese caution may also be because of concern regarding the quality of its growth process. For example, there is a call within China for measures to dampen growth and redress the problem of “overheating,” the most important sign of which is a speculative boom in the property market. But of greater concern for the country is the dependence of its growth on global markets in general and that of the United States in particular. This makes growth vulnerable, as governments respond either with protectionist measures or with demands for adjustments on China's part that could be expensive. It also increases international hostility towards the rapidly rising power. An influential view outside China is that its growth contributes to global imbalance and economic fragility. That argument is buttressed with data on the size of its trade surplus. Often these arguments are a cover for the ideological and political hostility generated by fear of a country which till recently was substantially centrally planned and even now has an economic and political system with unique characteristics. China must respond well; and it has clearly done so in recent times. It is making an effort at reorienting growth to the domestic market. It is making careful and calibrated adjustments of the value of the renminbi. It is seeking to rebalance growth in ways that make it more equitable and more environmentally friendly. It must now also take on a global role indicative of its status that favours justice and equality and helps make the current period of transition orderly and peaceful.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Signalling-a-transition/article16136486.ece
18,8,2010,Young and jobless,"The tally of the world's youth (15-24 years) without work has touched an all-time high, but the situation can be redeemed says the International Labour Organisation (ILO). It is perhaps time the focus is turned away from what Amartya Sen called the other day (in characterising Europe's response to the global economic crisis) “the fetish with fiscal figures.” Figures for the jobless jumped by a staggering 7.8 million in 2007-2009, as against an average annual increase of some 200,000 for a decade up to 2006. Similarly, the proportion of the unemployed to the employable rose from 11.9 per cent to 13 per cent between 2007 and 2009, reversing a declining trend since 2002. In fact, the one percentage point increase in 2008-09 marked the biggest annual change in the 20 years for which estimates are available. The figures, says the ILO, suggest that the youth have greater sensitivity than adult workers to the impact of the global financial crisis. About 28 per cent of young workers belong to households surviving on less than $1.25 per day, a segment that is likely to behind the adults in the recovery phase.
The developing world is home to nearly 90 per cent of the economically active youth, with Asia alone accounting for some 60 per cent. India, with half its population under 25 years of age, has huge stakes in shaping the prospects of an entire new generation. The importance of guaranteed minimum income and social welfare protection for this segment of the working population cannot be overstated in a context where employment is created predominantly in the informal sector, which is under-regulated. Relevant here is also the absence of compulsory education beyond 14 years in countries such as India, which induces premature and forced entry into the labour market. Raising the national legal age of children to 18 years, as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child stipulates, is an important first step to address many shortcomings linked to education, skills, and employment. Given that a strong base in skills is pivotal to the emerging knowledge-based economies of this century, it is only logical that skills development should receive priority. On most accounts, the prospects of regaining the momentum of economic growth globally and narrowing inequities depend heavily on the performance of Asian countries. It is inconceivable that this could happen save through a fresh impetus to school education and conditions of decent employment.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/young-and-jobless/article580531.ece
19,8,2010,Mitigating Pakistan's miseries,"Since the end of July, floods caused by an unusually heavy monsoon have devastated Pakistan. Under relentless rain, the Indus breached its banks almost along its entire route within the country — washing away people, their homes and animals right from Khyber Pakhtunwa province and southern Punjab, down to Sindh and Balochistan. The disaster is of a magnitude unparalleled in Pakistan's history, even bigger than the 2005 Kashmir earthquake in terms of the sheer number of people affected by it. That number could be as high as 20 million across 74 districts. More than 1,500 people are dead and if water-borne diseases take hold, the toll could rise. Five hundred thousand people are homeless, and 700,000 hectares of cultivable land are inundated. Pakistan simply does not have the capacity to cope with a tragedy of this enormity and geographical spread. The resources-strapped government has been unable to mount rescue or relief services in many affected areas and people have been left to deal with the situation in whatever ways they can. Militant groups such as the Jamat-ud-dawa/Lashkar-e-Toiba have stepped in to fill the vacuum in some places, further undermining the fragile democratic government. The fury of the floods having subsided, Pakistan still needs help to deal with the aftermath. A U.N. appeal for $459 million has evoked a disappointing response from the international community. The pledges made so far total only 47 per cent of the target, with the United States and United Kingdom making the most substantial commitments.
As the region's biggest economy, India should have been first off the blocks in offering help to its beleaguered neighbour. Its belated offer of $5 million in relief assistance is measly compared to what it has done for other neighbours. At the time of the 2004 tsunami, India did well to give Sri Lanka an assistance package of nearly $200 million. Prime Minister Mamohan Singh took the right step by calling his Pakistan counterpart Yusuf Raza Gilani on Thursday to express India's readiness to do more for the relief effort. This rectifies New Delhi's earlier position that it would give more only if Pakistan responded positively to the “initial offer,” which was as small-minded as Islamabad's response that it was yet to decide whether or not to accept Indian assistance. Despite difficult bilateral relations, there have been instances in the past of spontaneous solidarity. Pakistan sent relief materials after the Gujarat earthquake; India did the same after the Kashmir earthquake. It is unfortunate that the two countries are letting present animosities come in the way of addressing a humanitarian situation. If Pakistan can accept assistance from other countries, there should be no problem taking it from India. For its part, New Delhi must unreservedly raise the assistance amount, and give it to Pakistan, if required, as part of the United Nations fund.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mitigating-Pakistans-miseries/article16137765.ece
19,8,2010,Urban lessons from Brazil,"India has valuable lessons to learn from Brazil's urban failures as much as from its innovations. A recent report, published by the United Nations Population Fund and the International Institute for Environment Development, concludes that Brazil's urban policies over the last four decades failed because they were too slow to respond to changes and address inequalities. Successful planning measures adopted in cities such as Curitiba and Porto Alegre remained isolated exceptions. The growth of Brazilian cities coincided with a decline in agricultural production. There was an exodus from rural areas. Instead of paying attention to the housing needs of the migrants and other workers, policymakers left them at the mercy of market forces. Numerous underserviced and crime-ridden slums sprang up in the peripheries of the cities. Corrective efforts were too little, too late. As a result, these cities now face severe inequalities, tensions, and ecological deterioration. This is a warning to Indian cities with inept housing policies. The urgent need is for a bold plan that reserves sufficient land and built units for those who cannot access formal housing markets.
Brazil's experiment with regional planning is also of relevance to India. From the 1970s, the South American country relied on incentives to encourage growth in 130 small cities so as to relieve pressures on larger cities. This did not work as planned. India has tried similar policies from the mid-1970s with the same lack of success. Brazil's experience demonstrates that unless infrastructure, including schools and hospitals, are developed, growth cannot be directed to second- and third-tier cities. The City Statute enacted in Brazil in 2001 is a unique legal instrument appreciated worldwide for its potential benefits. Among other things, it helps municipalities democratise urban management through public hearings and participatory budgeting. Indian urban local bodies must adopt similar instruments. However, they should guard against their misuse, as evidenced in Brazil. Municipalities are empowered to negotiate with public groups and create Special Zones of Social Interest. This is meant to protect low-income areas from real estate speculation but in practice these powers have often been subverted by influential high-income groups. Urbanisation offers tangible benefits but to realise them, planning must keep pace with growth and be equitable.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Urban-lessons-from-Brazil/article16137763.ece
20,8,2010,The importance of mathematics,"The fields of work of the seven recipients of the four high global awards at the ongoing International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) at Hyderabad are indicative of the fast-disappearing boundaries between pure and applied mathematics. The field of mathematics has evolved tremendously since the great G.H. Hardy proclaimed in A Mathematician's Apology that it was the very fact that pure mathematics had no practical applications that made it beautiful and of permanent aesthetic value — as against applied mathematics, which was dull and trivial. It was for the same reason that mathematics did not enter Alfred Nobel's mind when he established the Nobel Prize primarily to honour inventions and discoveries of great practical benefit to humanity. The Fields Medal, the most important of the mathematics awards and regarded as the equivalent of the Nobel Prize, is traditionally given for exemplary achievement like solving an outstanding problem of great significance in pure mathematics. In recent years, this too has begun to recognise mathematical achievements in problems arising in physics and other subjects. This is very much in evidence in this year's awards.
The institution by the International Mathematical Union of awards other than the Fields Medal to recognise significant mathematical achievements in information theory and other technologically important areas is yet another indicator of the increasing relevance of mathematics to diverse fields. The Rolf Nevalninna Prize and the Gauss Prize this year have honoured improved error-correcting codes in communications, which have applications in high speed modems, and the mathematical theory of wavelets, which has resulted in efficient data compression in imaging technologies with applications in digital movies and space-based astronomy. Public-key encryption, which is widely used in data security, is rooted firmly in number theory, Hardy's field of specialisation, which he said was beautiful but of little practical value. Recent developments in theoretical computer science, financial mathematics, and derivative pricing are examples of important emerging applications in mathematics. Indeed, some very important talks in the Hyderabad Congress are in areas of pure mathematics inspired by problems in applied mathematics. It is this wonderful duality of mathematics — the joy of pursuit of pure mathematics for its intrinsic aesthetic experience, and its increasing relevance to real-life problems — that must be projected in greater measure to school and college students. It must become an essential component of mathematics education to promote the idea that successful careers are possible through the pursuit of mathematics.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-importance-of-mathematics/article16138903.ece
20,8,2010,No room for stealth,"But for the last minute protests of the Left and the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Manmohan Singh government would have diluted a crucial provision in the proposed civil nuclear liability Bill allowing for the recovery of damages from foreign suppliers in the event of an accident arising from negligence on their part. As it is, the Bill is structured in such a way that all liability for nuclear damages is legally channelled on to the operator of the concerned facility on a no-fault basis. The rationale for this channelling is to make it easier for victims to receive prompt compensation without litigation against the full range of corporate entities whose acts of omission or commission contributed to the accident. In reality, the channelling of liability on to the operator is inefficient from the economic point of view because it leads to the sub-optimal provision of safety measures by everyone else in the production chain of nuclear power. Faulty or poorly designed equipment produced by a supplier may contribute to a nuclear accident. But since the supplier is absolved of any liability in the event of a mishap, it has no incentive to do the best it can to ensure an accident does not occur.
The prevalence of legal channelling in international nuclear liability regimes can be explained by the fact that they were all designed with the supplier's priorities in mind. The Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC), which India has told the United States it is willing to sign, allows the operator to hold its supplier accountable for an accident only if the latter had agreed to a ‘right of recourse' in a written contract. The Indian law proposes to go beyond the CSC by allowing the operator a right of recourse in the event that an accident is caused by gross negligence on the part of the supplier or by faulty or defective equipment. Although this was the consensual understanding in the Standing Committee of Parliament, hidden hands sought to negate the effort to hold suppliers liable by linking this expanded right of recourse, as defined by Clause 17(b), to the existence of a prior contract as envisaged by 17(a). Thanks to the Left and BJP, the government has had to back off. But in the light of persistent official efforts to protect suppliers from any liability for nuclear damage, Parliament must insist that the new law bar operators from signing contracts with foreign companies that negate or cast aside the rights that are now being given to them in statute. It is also necessary to subject the final text of the Bill to a close reading to ensure that the same hidden hands have not introduced ‘minor' changes that could end up having major implications.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/No-room-for-stealth/article16138904.ece
22,8,2010,‘Withdrawing' from a wrecked country,"As with everything else the United States has done in respect of Iraq since September 11, 2001, nothing about the claim to have withdrawn can be believed. The official line is that the last American combat troops moved from Iraq into Kuwait in the early hours of August 20. They departed not in a display causing shock and awe but in silence and darkness. They had arrived on a monstrous lie, the claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and they have left on a whopper. Over 50,000 U.S. troops are to remain in Iraq, and their numbers could rise to 70,000. They will be called ‘Advise and Assist brigades'; they have warplanes and helicopters and will accompany Iraqi troops into combat. The U.S. also has several big, effectively permanent military bases in Iraq; and intends to maintain about 200,000 mercenaries as ‘protectors' of western business and other interests across the country. The troops who have left have done so seven years after President George W. Bush made his ‘Mission accomplished' proclamation.
The effects of the illegal U.S.-led invasion of 2003 and the subsequent occupation have been catastrophic. There is no accurate record of how many Iraqis have died or been wounded in the seven years: estimates range up to a million deaths. About five million Iraqis are refugees, with 2.7 million of them displaced internally. Unemployment is at 40 per cent. With temperatures around 50°C for several months a year, power supplies fail, which means water-treatment plants shut down, increasing the risk of epidemics. The administrative chaos was caused by Washington's assumption in 2003 that much of the population was fanatical in supporting Saddam Hussein; this led the occupying powers to disband the Iraqi army and much of the police and civic administration around the country. The effects of war include the poisoning of Iraq and beyond by an estimated 1,000 tonnes of depleted uranium used in U.S. munitions. As for the lives of ordinary Iraqis, the population of 30 million faces another descent into vicious sectarian violence. This is driven by extremist elements out to exploit the political vacuum as the country's elected politicians squabble interminably over forming a government, five months after the election. Indeed the invasion has been a gift to the al-Qaeda, which now has expanded influence in West Asia. Furthermore, Iran, which Washington openly hates and fears, has strong influence on Iraqi Shia leaders. The U.S. may have removed Saddam, who by 2003 was so weakened that even neighbouring states no longer feared him; but it has wrecked a whole country that represents one of the world's great ancient civilisations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lsquoWithdrawing-from-a-wrecked-country/article16141484.ece
22,8,2010,More space for small investors,"Arecent proposal mooted by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) seeks to create more space for small investors in initial public offerings by expanding the definition of a retail investor. Henceforth applications up to Rs.2 lakh — double the present limit — will come under this category. This is expected to motivate many more investors to apply in the retail category. On analysing the allotment patterns in recent public offers, the regulator has found that the majority of retail applications is in the range of Rs.80,000 to Rs.1 lakh. It is more than likely that many of the applicants have the capacity and appetite to go for shares even beyond the Rs.1 lakh limit but are not doing so because that would push them out of the retail investor category. Current SEBI guidelines require the issuing companies to earmark 35 per cent of the allotment to the retail investors and just 15 per cent to the non-institutional category. The chances of success are greater if shares are applied for in the retail category. Some very large issuers would welcome the hike in the limit for retail investors. For an issue size of Rs.4,000-6,000 crore, the limit of Rs.1 lakh would mean that the issue has to attract a minimum of 1.5 to 2 lakh applications for the retail category quota to be filled, a truly daunting task.
The government is also obviously concerned over the outcome of the forthcoming large disinvestments by public sector enterprises such as Coal India. There have been other moves to enhance the level of retail participation in the share market. The most recent example was the directive to listed companies to keep the level of public float at 25 per cent. A three-year time frame was given to comply with this norm. However, for certain practical reasons the government reduced the size of the minimum float to 10 per cent for public sector companies. A change in the regulatory rules, by itself, is unlikely to increase participation by small investors. Recent public offers by government companies were over-subscribed but retail participation was disappointing. The low discount allowed on the offer price and the complexities of the new auction method were some of the factors that discouraged small investors. A variety of developments such as large-scale technology application and the enhancement of capital requirements for brokers have improved efficiency and security, and the large investors are comfortable with the system. At the same time, small investors are feeling alienated, and the recent steps should go some way in addressing their concerns.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/More-space-for-small-investors/article16141485.ece
23,8,2010,No winners in Australia,"Although the final tally is not in yet, the elections just held in Australia have produced no clear winners. Neither of the main political blocs — the ruling Australian Labour Party and the Coalition, which comprises the Liberal and National parties — has managed a majority in the 150-member House of Representatives. They are expected to finish dead-heat with 73 seats each, three short of the required number. Prime Minister Julia Gillard is still in the race to form the government, provided she can win over at least two independents. What is incontestable is that Labour is the main loser in this election. Only three years ago, the party won a decisive victory under the inspired leadership of Kevin Rudd, removing John Howard's Coalition government that had been in power since 1996. Unfortunately, the Rudd government's honeymoon was all too brief, its popularity plummeting over failure to implement a key election promise on reduction of carbon emissions. A panicked Labour removed Mr. Rudd and anointed Ms. Gillard in his stead. As borne out by the election results, the internal coup, meant to repair Labour's image, contributed to the swing away from the party. Coalition leader Tony Abbott, who unexpectedly rose to the leadership of the Liberals and until recently was not seen as a dynamic enough personality, used the incident to project Labour as a party of crippling internal divisions. Ms Gillard had hoped to cash in on the public enthusiasm for the country's first woman Prime Minister. But that appears to have given way rather quickly to distaste over her perceived disloyalty to Mr. Rudd at the altar of ruthless ambition. It did not help Ms Gillard that an important Labour achievement — successfully insulating the Australian economy from the global economic downturn — was under Mr. Rudd's watch.
With the results of this close contest now effectively in the hands of three independent winners, both Ms Gillard and Mr. Abbott have descended into the race to woo them. This is Australia's first hung parliament in seven decades; the political class as well as voters are unused to the horse-trading and wheeling-dealing that the situation demands. Neither of the leaders wants to be seen as making a deal that goes against voter expectations; nor do the independents. The complicated system of preferential votes, which will determine the percentage of votes polled by the two parties, will also play a role. It may take days after the final results are in for a new government to fall in place. The main challenge for such a government would be its ability to take important political and economic decisions. How long it will last is a question that is bound to be asked sooner than later.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/No-winners-in-Australia/article16142488.ece
23,8,2010,New light on Stonehenge,"The recent discovery of a new henge, close to Britain's world-famous vast site, is regarded as a major find. This ceremonial monument, the first to be found over the past half-century, has opened up fresh possibilities of unravelling one of the long standing puzzles in history — the purpose of 4500-year-old Stonehenge. The cutting-edge technologies that uncovered the henge hold promise for the future of archaeology. Stonehenge, with its ring of stones, is unique in architecture and remarkable in scale. It was constructed using wonderful woodworking techniques. It is one of the most researched ancient sites in the world, yet a clear understanding of its purpose remains elusive. Was it a place of worship? Was it used for calibrating a cosmic calendar? Questions like these have found no reliable answers. A recently advanced theory even suggests that it functioned as a place of healing. So far, most of the research has focussed narrowly on Stonehenge and the latest discovery could expand the scope for research. The existing henge and the new one, which appears coeval, are inter-visible and on the same orientation. This relationship between the two has drawn attention to the entire landscape; as archaeologists probe further and deeper, they may arrive at a new understanding of the whole ensemble.
Archaeology, often poorly funded, finds excavating vast sites such as Stonehenge, which is spread over 14 sq. km., difficult. The fear of damaging the site in the event of a wrong dig has also been a deterrent. As a result, excavations tend to get less explorative, limiting the understating of the sites. On the other hand, emerging technologies are a great boon to archaeology. The international Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project, a collaborative effort involving seven institutions, mapped the entire site using a variety of technologies. Ground-penetrating radar, magnetic surveys, and electromagnetic studies were deployed. Improvised and scaled-up detectors hooked to vehicles travelling at a speed of about 10 km an hour scanned the entire site in just three weeks without compromising the quality of data. This virtual excavation, using the digital information collected, pointed out the exact location of the new henge. Conventional excavation can now be precisely directed to unearth the hidden structures. There is a lesson here for the Indian archaeological establishment. Substantial investment in the application of science in archaeology is vital for improving the quality and scope of research. New technologies can help prioritise areas for immediate excavation while protecting the rest for future study.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/New-light-on-Stonehenge/article16142487.ece
24,8,2010,Enforcing environmental law,"Union Minister of State for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh has acted boldly and impartially by relying on scientific expertise and rejecting the application from Vedanta Resources for forest clearance to start bauxite mining in Orissa's Niyamgiri hills. In doing so, he has laudably upheld due process, human rights, and environmental laws. The transparent manner in which the Ministry went about assessing environmental concerns and the impact the project would have on tribal groups in the proposed mining area before arriving at a decision is particularly noteworthy. Evidence collected by the Saxena Committee of the MoEF clearly warrants rejection of the proposal. The 72 million tonnes of bauxite ore deposits estimated to be available in Niyamgiri hills can feed the aluminium refinery of Vedanta Alumina Limited in Lanjigarh only for about four years at the expanded capacity being created. To sacrifice the rich ecology of the area for such a purpose would be unconscionable. There is little doubt that the mine would destroy the 7 sq km of forests that await inclusion in the Niyamgiri Wildlife Sanctuary, and deal a devastating blow to the Dongaria Kondh and Kutia Kondh tribal folk, who sustain themselves largely with forest produce.
Beyond the rejection of the forest clearance for the mining project, the Vedanta case is turning out to be an example of the forces eating into the environmental vitals of the country. If the violation of key laws such as the Forest (Conservation) Act, the Environment (Protection) Act, and the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act by the mining company and its subsidiaries is brazen, the enabling role played by the Orissa government is deplorable. The State government has an interest in the project through a joint venture involving the Orissa Mining Corporation. Rather than adopt the legal process, it chose to file false certificates on forest rights claims of tribals to speed up MoEF clearance, and did little to stop illegal occupation of forest lands by the private mining company. Equally disturbing is the fact that the Vedanta refinery has expanded its capacity six-fold without environmental clearance. Against such a backdrop, Minister Jairam Ramesh deserves the nation's commendation for stopping the activity in its tracks. He should now launch investigations into violations by other mining leaseholders across the country, applying environmental laws with full force. The Vedanta case should also persuade the Supreme Court, which gave some approvals to the proponents, to rely on scientific data and reports in deciding appeals from extractive industries.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Enforcing-environmental-law/article16143614.ece
24,8,2010,Fixing India's transport troubles,"India that aspires to be an economic superpower is visibly in need of a transport policy that is in tune with the times. The constitution of a high level Transport Policy Development Committee, headed by the former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Rakesh Mohan, reflects this. The last time a comprehensive view of transport was taken at the national level was in 1980 when the B.D. Pande committee submitted its report. Much has happened since then. India's economic transformation from a near-closed economy to a fast liberaliser led to a significant stepping up of economic activity, particularly by the private sector, and resulted in higher individual spending capacity. While the former meant increased flow of goods and services, calling for better freight facilities, the latter translated into both higher purchasing power for personal transportation modes and higher effective demand for better public transport. Liberalisation has also spawned its own huge inequities. A fresh policy has to factor in the harsh reality that the overwhelming majority, in the region of 800 million Indians, live in poverty. This calls for a more active state role as a provider of subsidised transport and as an effective regulator, particularly since the trend is to move towards a system that facilitates private players.
The terms of reference of the Rakesh Mohan committee are wide: they range from “assessing the transport requirements for the next two decades” to “assessing the investment requirements” of the sector. Although there are several issues that jostle for attention, there is an urgent need to develop a comprehensive policy for road transport as this mode carries 87 per cent of India's passengers, moves 60 per cent of its freight, and is in serious disarray. Efficient inter-State, intra-city, and rural transport systems will reduce losses, improve connectivity, and open up more economic opportunities. The most shocking lapse of state policy is the decline of public transport. As a Parliamentary Standing Committee rightly pointed out, the decline of buses in the total fleet of vehicles from 11 per cent in 1951 to a paltry 1.1 per cent in 2004 has meant an increase in personalised transport. This leads to avoidable economic losses due to higher fuel expenditure, apart from widening inequalities. The retrogressive trend needs urgent reversal. A policy that accords primacy of space to an affordable, efficient, and integrated public transport system will be key to fixing India's transport troubles.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Fixing-Indias-transport-troubles/article16143609.ece
25,8,2010,Oil on the coast,"The proposal of Union Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh to provide additional funding to the Bombay Natural History Society and the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History, Coimbatore, is to be welcomed for the strong impetus it can give to research on ecology. Both these institutions have built a good foundation for original, peer-reviewed work on the environment. In fact, BNHS will soon prepare a rapid assessment report on the ecological impact of the oil spill from the ship collision off Mumbai, and follow it up with a detailed report. It has undertaken vital work on reviving the fortunes of India's vanishing vultures, an achievement that has won it the support of the international ornithological community. In the aftermath of the spill, the 125-year-old non-governmental organisation has a key role to play in determining the long-term effects of oil pollution on coastal ecology. There is early evidence of conspicuous harm befalling mangroves in Vashi, near Mumbai, apart from the less-noticed species such as fiddler crabs and mudskippers and, of course, birds. The big challenge before the scientific community is to study the impact of the oil on the entire marine ecosystem, including the community structure of plants and animals along the western coast. It is a region that has witnessed a rising trend of oil pollution.
Disasters in the oil industry and shipping accidents are now a global phenomenon. In the recent Gulf of Mexico catastrophe, scientists are researching, among other things, the outcome of releasing a large volume of dispersants in deep waters. The Mumbai incident has sent a large volume of oil into the inter-tidal zone and mangroves. Yet, in both places, it is nature's resilience that will ultimately solve the pollution problem. The data on this ‘nature cure' phenomenon need to be gathered to enrich coastal ecology studies in India. A similar approach, pursued in Alaska during the two decades following the Exxon Valdez spill, provided valuable insights. With liberal funding, research can be taken up to expand the knowledge base in several Indian States, including Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Orissa, and Kerala. The scientific literature here is far from comprehensive; it needs augmentation by systematic studies. In the beautiful Lakshadweep islands, the supportive policies of the administration have helped scientists produce detailed research findings on the coral reef ecosystem (the reefs escaped major damage recently, when a ship ran aground but had its oil tanks emptied quickly). The Mumbai spill must be turned into an opportunity for scientific study of what oil pollution does to coasts.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Oil-on-the-coast/article16144649.ece
25,8,2010,Uncertain trade environment,"The annual supplement for 2010-11 to the five-year Foreign Trade Policy (2009-14) is quite understandably devoid of major surprises. Union Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma had to reckon with two developments that have constrained the trade policy. At home, the emphasis is on fiscal consolidation and the scope for substantial fiscal largesse to exporters is more restricted than last year. Secondly, the global economy is climbing out of the recession, but in the advanced countries— notably the United States, Japan, and many in the European Union — economic growth has been uneven and, in some cases, fragile. The contraction of demand in India's most important markets has adversely affected export-oriented sectors such as textiles and leather goods. Last year, when the five-year policy was announced, the growth in merchandise exports was negative. Some measures were announced in January and March to help the worst-hit sectors. Exports, which staged a recovery in the last quarter of 2009-10, grew by a measly five per cent between April and June, 2010. The expectation that exports will soon climb back to the pre-crisis 2008 levels has been dashed for now. The government, however, expects the figure to cross the target of $200 billion this year, sharply higher than the $178 billion of 2009-10.
A slew of incentives at a cost of Rs.1,050 crore — mostly by way of revenue foregone — to help the crisis-hit export sectors have been announced. The objective is to intervene selectively and maintain the stability of the policy. Under the focus products scheme, 135 products are to get two per cent bonus. The Duty Entitlement Pass-Book (DEPB) scheme, which neutralises customs duties on the imported components of export products and helps exporters remain competitive, has been extended up to June 2011, even though it is not strictly compatible with the WTO rules. The zero duty export promotion capital goods scheme, which encourages technological upgradation, will be in force for one more year, with its scope expanded. There is, however, precious little in the policy statement that addresses the pressing problem of high transaction costs. On this issue as well as in addressing the deficiencies in physical infrastructure, the Commerce Ministry cannot, by itself, do much and the task calls for a coordinated effort by several ministries. Another trade-related issue that has assumed serious proportions is the rise in protectionist sentiment. The recent U.S. decision to hike the visa fees payable by Indian information technology companies is a challenge that will have to be addressed at the highest levels.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Uncertain-trade-environment/article16144648.ece
26,8,2010,Iraqi realities,"The spate of murderous attacks in cities across the whole of Iraq over the last 10 days has taken the August 2010 death toll to 535, with nearly 400 wounded. This exceeds the July total of 500 deaths; the authorities attribute the bombings to Sunni-militant followers of al-Qaeda. Only one attacker was stopped in advance: in Mosul, Iraqi soldiers spotted and killed a suicide bomber before he could blow his car up. Above all, the intensified attacks show how little control the United States and the Iraqi authorities have. For example, in Baghdad on August 17, a single attacker had no problem joining about 1,000 men lined up at an Iraqi army recruitment centre outside the former defence ministry buildings in the Bab al-Muazam district. He then detonated the explosives he was carrying, killing more than 60 and injuring over 125. How the attacker sneaked in, evading the electronic screening and body searches that were in place, remains a mystery. A particularly poignant aspect is that the toll might have been lower had the Iraqi economy been in better condition. It was the prospect of stable employment that attracted substantial crowds to the area, and recruitment was to end that day. A ghoulish detail: people were so desperate for work that some rejoined the queue after having their wounds treated.
The attacks make nonsense of the U.S. claim that the ‘surge' commanded by General David Petraeus in 2007 succeeded in reducing the threat of violence in Iraq. The key problems are political and they exacerbate the violence. Five months after the general election, the main parties have not agreed on the composition of a government. Their failure has enabled insurgent factions to revive sectarian antagonisms between the main Shia groups, led by former Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, and the largely Sunni alliance under Ayad Allawi. The latter won the election but fell far short of an absolute majority. The latest round of talks, in fact, collapsed the day before the August 17 suicide bombing. Some senior Iraqi politicians are criticising themselves for their inability to stop behaving as if they were still opposition figures in exile. But intrigue, clandestine deals, and backroom manoeuvres are on overdrive. Party leaders continue to be heavily influenced by neighbours like Turkey and Iran. What is more, insiders speak of the development of a culture of greed and corruption that is tantamount to kleptocracy. With the U.S. purportedly removing the last of its combat troops a fortnight before the August 31 deadline, the soul-searching by Iraqi leaders is too little, too late. Ordinary Iraqis, who face the threat of violence every day, will continue to pay for this unholy mess with their lives.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Iraqi-realities/article16145900.ece
26,8,2010,Understanding leopards,"As the most abundant of the big cats of India, the leopard generally manages quite well, living quite close to habitations unobtrusively. A recent study in the Pune region recorded a density of 12 adult leopards in a 100 sq km, human-dominated landscape with a density of 200 people per sq km. Happily, there was no report of fatal leopard attacks in the study area. What then could be the cause for the seemingly large number of encounters involving the spotted cats and humans in some parts of the country? The hill temple of Tirumala, encircled by forests, has recently witnessed more than one instance of leopards creating panic among pilgrims. There are similar distressing episodes of the carnivore crossing the path of humans in hill estates and agricultural areas, and even suburbs of cities such as Mumbai and Chennai. Invariably, such incidents lead to retaliation by terrified local communities and tragically, in some instances, the cat does not survive the encounter. This is a sad course of events because it is largely an avoidable conflict. It can be mitigated effectively if State governments look at scientific evidence on leopard behaviour and work to reduce man-animal confrontations.
Unlike other wild cats such as tigers, a large number of leopards live outside forests and protected areas. Their density depends on the abundance of prey. As scientific research done at the Kaati Trust in Pune shows, the increasing availability of a large number of cattle and dogs is proving to be a major attraction for leopards. It is possible, therefore, that pilgrims walking up the Tirumala hills at night are drawing the cats to the monkeys and dogs they feed. It is useful to remember that although leopards avoid humans, a startling encounter can provoke an attack. Moreover, leopards that have been captured and released in the wild, away from their previous territory, are known to turn aggressive. Studies have tracked them walking even a few hundred kilometres back to the site of capture. The research clearly shows that conflict mitigation requires a scientific, community-oriented model. Here, it would be worth looking at the Jammu and Kashmir programme, supported by the wildlife authorities. It relies on a core group of trained youth who quickly move to the scene of a leopard appearance, enable the animal to find its way out, and thus prevent a violent confrontation. An insurance-based compensation scheme for lost livestock, on the lines of the one successfully tried out for the snow leopard in the Himalayan region, may also reduce animosity towards the species.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Understanding-leopards/article16145899.ece
27,8,2010,Terror has many faces,"The Home Minister, P. Chidambaram's cautionary remark at a conference of State police chiefs, security and intelligence officials a few days ago, that apart from the well known threat of the infiltration of jehadi terrorists, there is also now the phenomenon of “saffron terrorism” has set off a storm of protest in Parliament. The main opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, and its ally, the Shiv Sena, have repeatedly disrupted proceedings in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, demanding that the Home Minister apologise for use of this description. That the Home Minister has chosen to bring this disturbing point to national attention should not be made an issue of partisan politics. Bomb blasts in 2007 targeting the Mecca Masjid in Hyderabad and the Ajmer Sharif Dargah, the September 29, 2008 bomb blast at Malegaon in Maharashtra, and last year's bomb blasts in Goa highlighted a trend of directed attacks intended to rattle the Muslim community. Painstaking investigations conducted over the last three years, led by the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) of Maharashtra, have pointed to a larger network of Hindutva groups such as Abhinav Bharat, Rashtriya Jagran Manch, and Sanatan Sanstha as being implicated in these bomb blasts. Those involved in these indefensible crimes are members of fringe groups claiming allegiance to Hindutva, their intention clearly to ignite fresh polarisation between the majority and the minority communities.
It is evident that the heavy stakes invested in the Sangh Parivar's political campaign that terrorism in India is linked mainly to Islamist fundamentalists prevent the BJP and its allies from reacting responsibly to what is an emerging threat. Militancy and terrorism thrive on cycles of hate and retaliatory violence. The Home Minister's carefully chosen words were intended to warn the security establishment to sharpen its counter terrorism capabilities in the face of the new forms of terror emerging on the national landscape. Saffron terror, along with infiltration of jehadi terrorists and the simmering Maoist insurgency, are all real threats to internal security and must be treated as such. The BJP, which prides itself on being a party with a strong commitment to national and internal security, must acknowledge the seriousness of this new dimension to terror and take this issue out of the realm of partisan politics. The government for its part must resist the temptation of drawing political conclusions from what is essentially an internal security challenge and formulate a serious and credible strategy to deal with these new forms of internal terrorism.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Terror-has-many-faces/article16147140.ece
27,8,2010,Shrinking Moon,"After last year's discovery of traces of water across the surface of the Moon, particularly at higher latitudes, challenged the long-held notion that Earth's only natural satellite is bone dry, scientists have now come up with another interesting find. Images of the Moon captured by high-resolution cameras on board the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), launched in June 2009, have revealed 14 steeply sloping cliffs. These cliffs, known as lobate scarps because of their semi-circular shape, have a maximum height of 130 metres and lengths no more than tens of kilometres. They are tectonic landforms produced by thrust faulting. The significance of the landforms, previously identified only near the equator by Apollo missions-15, 16, and 17, was not understood and they were dismissed as local phenomena of little significance. But according to a paper published online in Science (“Evidence of recent thrust faulting on the Moon revealed by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera,” by Thomas R. Watters, et al,) lobate scarps were identified on the nearside and farside at both low- and mid-latitudes, and also in the higher latitudes, even very near the poles. Their global distribution tells a different story: the Moon is shrinking. However, it is just a 100-metre reduction in the Moon's 3,500 km diameter. Shrinking induces stress on the crust, which in turn results in thrust faulting, where one edge of the scarp moves upward relative to the other. The faults are pristine in nature and have undergone little degradation. The scarps should be as young as a hundred million years and not older than a billion years. The age is inferred based on the scarps cutting across smaller craters, which are quickly destroyed by other impacts.
Contrary to the long-held notion that the Moon had shrunk in its early history as it cooled, the presence of recently formed faults indicates that it may still be cooling and shrinking. This in turn indicates that it is not a cold mass of rock that is geologically dead. Unlike the large-scale scarps (nearly 2 km high and about 600 km long) seen on Mercury, the small-sized scarps seen on the Moon signify that it has not shrunk significantly. Small-scale scarps, which signify low compressional stress acting on the Moon, along with only a small change in its radius, are consistent with the thermal history model of our natural satellite. But more detailed studies are required to rule out the role of regolith on the Moon's surface and the underlying fractured zone in reducing the compressional stress that prevents large-scale thrust faults from forming.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Shrinking-Moon/article16147139.ece
2,9,2010,Guantánamo horrors,"The United States faces severe problems in attempting to avoid federal trials for Guantánamo Bay detainees. The very first case is that of Omar Khadr, a Canadian now aged 23. He was inducted by his father into al-Qaeda at the age of 15; was seriously injured in a battle with U.S. forces in Afghanistan; and has spent eight years in prison. His military trial started at Guantánamo a few weeks ago but was halted when his lawyer was taken ill. Mr. Khadr had already been charged at the time President Obama froze the military commissions, in January 2009. So he remains in the military system. The difficulties are legal and political. The charge is that Mr. Khadr made roadside bombs and threw a grenade, which killed U.S. Sergeant Christopher Speer. But the defence holds that his ‘confessions' of being a terrorist and throwing the grenade are invalid, because he was terrorised by his interrogators' fictitious stories about a young boy who was gang-raped and killed in prison. His initial questioning took place when he was sedated and shackled to a bed. The U.N. says the legality of the trial is doubtful and it could set a dangerous precedent for all child soldiers.
The military commissions themselves are highly questionable. The U.S. Supreme Court struck them down in 2004 but Congress, pressured by the Bush administration, passed the Military Commissions Act 2006, which enables the President or the Secretary of Defense to declare anyone in the world an enemy combatant. It allows no habeas corpus challenge and admits evidence obtained by torture before December 30, 2005. Mr. Obama has never ruled out using the commissions. Much of the relevant information is already public. Secondly, military trials will continue to taint American democracy. Thirdly, the federal courts may well be better at conducting the trials. Since September 11, 2001, they have convicted more than 300 people on terrorism-related charges while military tribunals have convicted three, of whom two were later released. Unsurprisingly, the administration is considering a deal whereby Mr. Khadr pleads guilty to lesser offences and gets a light sentence — but that is only possible in a federal court. In sum, the Obama administration can act like a civilised democratic government and order a federal criminal trial, or it can return to the wild, lawless ways of the Bush administration and abandon Mr. Khadr to the wolves.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Guant%C3%A1namo-horrors/article15900305.ece
2,9,2010,Protecting whistleblowers,"The Bill to protect whistleblowers, introduced in the Lok Sabha, is a belated but welcome move to shield those who stand up, often at great personal risk, for the sake of truth and the public interest. The Public Interest Disclosures and the Protection to Persons Making the Disclosures Bill 2010 is the circuitous and protracted outcome of the Supreme Court's strong pitch for a mechanism to protect whistleblowers. This it did while hearing a public interest litigation on the murder of Satyendra Dubey, the Bihar-based engineer with the National Highways Authority of India who was killed for exposing irregularities in road contracts. The pressure applied by the Court led the central government, in early 2004, to issue an order authorising the Central Vigilance Commission to receive and act on the complaints of whistleblowers and to protect their identities. This interim arrangement is finally set to become law, after a Bill introduced in the Rajya Sabha in 2006 was allowed to lapse. Like other whistleblower laws around the world, the proposed legislation has two main aims: to protect the identity of those who call attention to corruption and misuse of power in an organisation, and to safeguard them against punitive disciplinary action. It empowers the CVC, which will have the powers of a civil court, to punish those who reveal the identity of whistleblowers.
The Bill, criticised for having been introduced in Parliament without a proper consultative process with stakeholders and the public, does not go far enough. While the whistle may be blown on malpractices committed by employees of the central and State governments, and companies and societies controlled by them, the Bill (unlike its predecessor in 2006) does not extend confidential disclosures to the private sector as legislation in some other countries does. The United Kingdom's Public Disclosure Act 1988 extends “protected disclosures” to private and voluntary sector employees. In the United States, a slew of federal and state laws protect all employees who complain about economic malpractices as well as actions that affect the health and safety of individuals and the environment. Another drawback: while promising to protect the identity of whistleblowers, the Bill is vague about the measures needed to ensure this. Whether the new law will be much more effective than the existing government order in encouraging the public exposure of corruption and malpractice remains to be seen. But it is a step forward insofar as it stands up for acts of ethical resistance and for those courageous enough to risk paying a high personal price for speaking out.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Protecting-whistleblowers/article15899113.ece
2,9,2010,Persisting uncertainty,"Economic indicators from the United States and other developed countries, since the beginning of August, strongly suggest, at the very least, heightened uncertainty over their near term growth prospects. That the industrial countries, as a group, were expected to trail the developing nations in the recovery phase was anticipated. But now even the modest growth rates they were expected to register seem to be slipping out of their reach. According to recent data, the GDP of the OECD countries increased by 0.7 per cent on a sequential basis in the second quarter of 2010, same as in the first. Germany with a 2.2 per cent growth, its highest since unification, tops the table. Growth in the United Kingdom at 1.1 per cent was fairly satisfactory, while the economies of Japan and the U.S. slowed to 0.1 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively. Although there appears to be no real danger of a “double-dip” recession, it is clear that the rebound has not only been uneven but remains fragile in a majority of the developed countries. Recent developments in the world's largest economy, the U.S., are hardly reassuring. There is a realisation at the highest levels that the economy, which has slowed down, is not expected to recover soon. Recently, the U.S. Federal Reserve, while pledging to keep interest rates low, has identified major obstacles to growth that are of far-reaching socioeconomic significance: high unemployment, modest income gains, eroded housing wealth, and tight credit markets.
The financial markets, forever focussed on the macroeconomic news emanating from across the globe, have few definite trends to latch on. On balance, negative news outweighs positive ones. In the developed countries, investors are waking up to the painful reality that growth will be slow in many parts of the world. Policymakers in many countries are facing a difficult situation. Certain decisions, such as withdrawing the stimulus measures, are particularly hard to reach with any degree of confidence and, even if decided upon, are difficult to implement. It is highly unlikely that a consensus on the lines reached at the G20 is possible at this juncture. Indian stock markets, propped up by generally positive domestic economic news, nevertheless face a great deal of uncertainty as well. The theory that India and other emerging markets are “decoupled” from the developed ones has been disproved long ago. Not just stock markets, but the entire macroeconomy has to reckon with the trend of foreign capital inflows that have become crucial to the country's external sector. Either too little or excessive flows would entail substantial costs for the domestic economy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Persisting-uncertainty/article15899112.ece
3,9,2010,Not so much of a liability now,"In its final form as legislated, the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill, 2010 represents an improvement over the government's initial and intermediate drafts. Weaknesses remain but Parliament has done well to exclude private nuclear operators from the ambit of the law, widen the scope of the operator's right of recourse against suppliers, and raise the liability cap of an operator in the event of an accident to Rs.1,500 crore. The earlier limit of Rs.500 crore was woefully inadequate. Even though the new cap will not cover the scale or extent of nuclear damage in the event of a serious accident, the law at least allows future governments to raise the cap. The most important change introduced is, of course, in Section 17(b), dealing with the right of recourse. The first draft allowed the operator to recover damages from a supplier in the event an accident was caused by gross negligence on the latter's part. Under pressure from foreign companies and governments, the United Progressive Alliance government tried to delete this section or nullify its significance by linking its operation to the existence of a contract or to mens rea on the part of the supplier. Eventually, however, it was forced to swallow the strengthening of this provision. The operator will now have a right of recourse against the supplier if a nuclear accident is caused by equipment with latent or patent defects or by sub-standard services.
Predictably, foreign and Indian private sector lobbyists like the U.S.-India Business Council and various chambers of commerce have launched a campaign against 17(b). They say the section is inconsistent with international norms and will lead to a collapse of the Indian nuclear industry because private vendors won't supply equipment for fear of being held liable. These arguments are untenable. International ‘norms' in such matters do not fall from the skies but are the product of market conditions. With India looking to buy as many as 40 large reactors over the next decade or so, it has every right to expect that suppliers shoulder at least the liability burden from an accident caused by defective products. Moreover, the operator will be able to make a claim only if it can prove in court that an accident for which it has paid compensation was actually caused by an act of the supplier. If some private lobbyists are worried about the supplier being held liable after “80 years” for products sold now, they should at least concede that the operator will not find it easy to establish fault liability eight decades on. In any event, with operator (and hence supplier) liability capped around $320 million for a plant likely to be sold for more than $5 billion, the insurance burden will be far from onerous — especially if it is set against the human lives, welfare, and futures at stake.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Not-so-much-of-a-liability-now/article15900316.ece
4,9,2010,Andhra Pradesh in safe hands,"Oftentimes, survival itself is an achievement. But in his first year as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Konijeti Rosaiah not only provided political stability in a State rocked by the Telangana statehood agitation; he also went about the tasks of governance with poise and purpose. Although Andhra Pradesh had to weather a financially difficult period, he did not allow welfare measures to suffer: in fact, under his leadership, the pro-people measures have been sustained and put on a more realistic basis. Years of administrative experience had taught him to approach knotty issues with sensitivity and caution. Thus, on the Telangana issue, his steadying influence and clarity of vision eventually guided a wrong-footed central government to a reasoned stance. More than anyone else, he realised the grave implications of allowing the formation of a Telangana State without broad-based consultations and a true political consensus. On being catapulted to power under unexpected circumstances following the death of Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, Mr. Rosaiah handled the power thrust upon him with modesty, sobriety, and a sense of responsibility. Not one to hanker after posts in party or government, he carried out the tasks of governance with a quiet, reassuring efficiency.
At the helm in South India's largest State, Mr. Rosaiah found that the biggest challenge was not in administration but in politics — and it has taken the form of Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, son of the charismatic YSR. Not for a moment did the son let anyone forget that he regarded the chief ministership as his divine right; and in consequence, he has spared no effort to unseat Mr. Rosaiah. After enduring for a year Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy's political antics motivated by blind ambition, the Chief Minister now needs to deal with his political mobilisation through the “Odarpu Yatra” to ‘console' the families of those who committed suicide or died of ‘shock' following the untimely death of YSR. Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy is holding up the yatra as a demonstration of political strength, in the hope of undermining the political authority of the Chief Minister. Without politically meeting this crude challenge, Mr. Rosaiah will not be well prepared for the tougher tests ahead. The Srikrishna Committee is to submit its report on the Telangana issue by the end of the year, and the matter will require the full attention of the State government. Political provocations and irritants can only be dealt with politically. Now that he knows he enjoys the full confidence of the national leadership of the party, Chief Minister Rosaiah must assert his political authority and raise the level of governance and development to the next notch.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Andhra-Pradesh-in-safe-hands/article15901622.ece
4,9,2010,A pragmatic approach,"The decision to defer the implementation of the Direct Taxes Code (DTC) by a year to April 1, 2012 is based on pragmatic considerations. The government will have more time to gauge the revenue implications of the changes in tax laws and procedures. Initial reports suggest that if the DTC bill, now before a parliamentary select committee, is implemented without substantial modifications, the Central government may have to forgo over Rs.50,000 crore in the first year. That would clearly be unacceptable, given the large fiscal and budgetary deficits the government is trying to rein in. The extended deadline gives businessmen and investors more time to evaluate the cost and implications of doing business under the new tax regime. As with the Goods and Services Tax (GST), which seeks to overhaul the indirect tax structure, the government is adopting a flexible approach to the DTC also. The draft code first released in August 2009 was substantially revised in June this year, incorporating the feedback and suggestions including from professional and business bodies. The bill is based substantially on the June draft and, although it is still open for scrutiny and modifications, what emerges is likely to fall somewhat short of the original objective of ushering in a simplified tax system with low rates and minimal exemptions.
Individual tax payers have reason to be both satisfied and disappointed over specific provisions of the DTC bill. There has been no reduction in the tax rates, only a tinkering with the tax slabs benefiting certain categories. There has been no rush to embrace the EET method (exempt savings, exempt interest on savings, but tax withdrawals) that would have radically altered the tax treatment of retirement benefits to the detriment of senior citizens and pensioners. Tax deductions for contributions to provident funds and certain other eligible schemes remain, and the overall limit has been enhanced. Home loan borrowers will be disappointed as only the interest payment on the loan will qualify for deductions. Both Indian and foreign companies will be taxed at a flat rate of 30 per cent, which is lower than the current effective rates for both categories. The bill has introduced greater clarity in the tax treatment applicable to the purchase and sale of securities. As with mature economies, the share of direct taxes in total tax collections will go up and the proportion of overall tax in GDP will climb to around 25 per cent. While the compromises make the bill in its present form much less radical than the original proposals, it will still be a major step forward in simplifying the law and streamlining procedures.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-pragmatic-approach/article15901623.ece
5,9,2010,Meaning of withdrawal,"In his much-hyped recent address, President Barack Obama solemnly declared that U.S. combat operations in Iraq had ended, and the countdown to a full assertion of Iraqi sovereignty had begun. ‘Operation Enduring Freedom' had given way to ‘Operation New Dawn,' a phase of transition that would wind up at the end of 2011. All American troops would then head home from Iraq, which would be free to run its affairs in accordance with the wishes of its people. The home of the world's most ancient civilisations, crushed under the weight of its tyrants but now liberated by the good Americans, would have a chance to regain its lost glory. This was political theatre and it was lapped up by the gullible round the world. Through his televised address, President Obama attempted to obscure the ugly truth with his trademark eloquence. But for the less gullible, it was clear that under the cover of Iraq's liberation, the U.S. President had unrolled a road map for entrapping for the foreseeable future oil-rich Iraq as America's prized new satellite state. The mechanics of cloning Iraq into a twenty-first century banana republic are in place. Fifty thousand American troops, including Special Forces teams, remain deployed in Iraq to undertake “stability operations.” Thousands of “security contractors” with a mercenary core, increasingly outsourced from the developing world, are being pumped in to push the privatisation of the occupation to a new level.
All key Iraqi institutions are being packed with civilian “advisors,” many of whom will be stationed across the Tigris in the gigantic U.S, embassy, whose 21 buildings are spread across 104 acres. Mr. Obama himself acknowledged that “our dedicated civilians — diplomats, aid workers, and advisers — are moving into the lead to support Iraq as it strengthens its government, resolves political disputes, resettles those displaced by war, and builds ties with the region and the world.” As the Americans gear up for post-war stabilisation and consolidation in Iraq, positioning a suitably pliable government in Baghdad remains the next major undertaking. Here again, they have a head start. The Iraqi constitution, drafted under U.S. tutelage, is a deeply flawed document. It has inbuilt provisions to prevent the emergence of a strong central executive capable of reinforcing Iraq's national sovereignty. The Iraqis now have a hard choice: either surrender to Washington's diktat and witness the emergence of their country as a full-blown American satellite state in the heart of West Asia, or revive at all levels a sophisticated anti-occupation resistance that steers clear of al-Qaeda terrorism and Iraq's sectarian fault lines.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Meaning-of-withdrawal/article15904216.ece
5,9,2010,For more effective cash transfers,"For over a decade now, conditional cash transfers (CCT) have become an important part of the toolkit of economic policymakers to reduce poverty in the developing world. The core principle of this strategy, linking cash to verifiable behavioural attributes, has two advantages: short-term monetary benefits and long-term investments in human capital. That this policy intervention has started paying dividends is evident from Latin American experiences. In those countries, important socioeconomic indicators such as education, health, and nutrition showed improvements after the introduction of CCT schemes. For India, which has pursued the goal of redistributive justice through a mix of policies since Independence, the post-liberalisation period has seen a recalibration of its approach to equity. If the ‘Food for Work' programme evolved into the rights-based Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, the National Maternity Benefit Scheme was modified and the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) was put in place. Both are instances of cash transfers based on conditions to improve the lot of the needy. While work was the eligibility condition for benefits in the employment guarantee programme, maternal health check-ups and institutional deliveries were the conditions for the JSY.
Five years on, an evaluation of the JSY — one of the world's largest conditional cash transfer programmes in terms of the number of beneficiaries — has pointed to the beneficial effect as well as the lags in India's latest effort to provide for safer motherhood. A paper published in The Lancet in June reported a substantial increase in the number of beneficiaries between 2005-06 and 2008-09 (up from 0.74 million to 8.43 million) and other positive outcomes such as reduction in perinatal and antenatal deaths. Although these point to the advantage of linking cash to welfare, there are inter-State disparities to be corrected. In addition, better staffing and infrastructure for public sector health facilities is an imperative for cash transfer schemes to be truly beneficial. Another constraint identified by the paper which needs to be remedied urgently is improper targeting. The finding that “the poorest and the least educated women do not consistently have the highest odds” of becoming the beneficiaries is a critical pointer to the manner in which cash transfer schemes are implemented in India. The solution to such lags lies in proactive governance that reaches out to the needy, including through greater publicity and greater transparency, and filling the gaps in the provision of public health facilities.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/For-more-effective-cash-transfers/article15904215.ece
6,9,2010,Dim summit outlook,"The Obama administration initiative to bring together Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestine Authority President Mahmoud Abbas for face-to-face talks in Washington is notable for two reasons. It has set the tone for future negotiations. Instead of dealing with peripherals, Israelis and Palestinians will from now on focus on issues that are at the heart of their dispute — the status of Jerusalem, the borders of a future state of Palestine, and the right to return of millions of Palestinian refugees who were uprooted by the wars of 1948 and 1967. Secondly, the Washington summit has set a demanding one-year timeline to resolve all the outstanding issues. The whole world knows that, notwithstanding the positive spin imparted, nothing short of a miracle will fulfil the lofty aspirations spelt out for these talks. The reason is perfectly obvious: Israel's obsession with its security and its fixation with its Jewish majority status will continue to undermine the emergence of a viable Palestinian state. Citing security considerations, Israel's ruling elite has virtually dismissed the formation of a Palestinian state defined along 1967 frontiers.
Some influential Israeli think tanks, which are believed to reflect the Netanyahu administration's thinking, have advocated that Israel should exercise complete physical control over the entire Jordan valley, the eastern part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, as well as the airspace to the west of it. Such a hawkish stance on borders conflicts fundamentally with the Palestinian territorial aspirations — and is bound to be rejected. With its Jewish majority status being cited as central to its national identity, there is also not much hope that Israel will lower its hostility towards the right to return of millions of displaced Palestinians, most of whom are currently packed in impoverished refugee camps across West Asia. This unwillingness to contemplate a just solution to core final status issues implies that once again Palestinian negotiators will be left empty-handed. Without substantial gains, Mr. Abbas and his team will be powerless to carry the majority of Palestinians with them. Mr. Abbas's failure will also greatly embolden militant Hamas, which, in any case, has to be drawn into negotiations at some point. A serious shortcoming of the Washington summit has been its inability to address the relevance of Iran and Syria in the resolution of the Israel-Palestine dispute. Without the involvement of Tehran and Damascus — the core supporters of Hamas, which rules the coastal Gaza strip — there is little hope that a stable and independent Palestine, at peace with Israel, will emerge any time soon.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Dim-summit-outlook/article15905350.ece
6,9,2010,Ideology ruins science,"Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research in the United States has hit a major roadblock once again. A temporary injunction by the Federal Court for the District of Columbia has turned the clock back and brought to a halt all federally funded research on hESC. The court's order comes a year and a half after President Barack Obama, through an executive order, broke the shackles on embryonic stem cell research, and provided the much-needed federal funding. However, this came with a rider. Money would be provided only after stem cells were harvested from the embryos, and could not be used for extracting embryonic stem cells, which would lead to the destruction of the embryos. This manoeuvre allowed the administration to sidestep the tricky Dickey-Wicker Amendment, a 1996 law that bars federal funding of any research that results in injury to or destruction of human embryos. Funding was also subject to certain conditions: that the embryos were no longer required for reproductive purposes, the donors provided informed consent, and no payments were offered for the embryos. But the judgment was based on a totally different reading of the Dickey-Wicker Amendment that federal support for the entire project should be denied even “if one step or ‘piece of research'…results in the destruction of an embryo.”
The consequences of the Federal Court judgment are dramatic: it can derail the entire field of hESC research. It is unclear if the court order would make ineligible even the 21 embryonic stem cell lines approved for federal funding by President George W. Bush in August 2001. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has approved 75 stem cells lines for funding, and invested nearly $400 million since 2005. About 125 projects worth $155 million are due for renewal within the next year. The retrogressive judgment asserts that it is only “speculative” and “not certain” that hESC research will eventually result in successful treatment for cell-based diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. While the main objection to the destruction of condemned embryos to facilitate research reeks of right-wing ideology, to challenge, without any basis, the potential of the research to treat certain kinds of diseases goes against the spirit of enquiry, the cornerstone of science. To bank solely on adult stem cells, which — unlike embryonic stem cells — are not pluripotent and hence cannot become any of the nearly 200 specialised cell types, is myopic and goes against the grain of scientific research. Finally, to close the door on hESC research as it competes with adult stem cell research for funding is nothing but reactionary fundamentalism.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Ideology-ruins-science/article15905347.ece
7,9,2010,Treat the malignancy,"Cricket might be facing the worst emergency in its history — the challenge of ridding itself of the stench of cheating and corruption. The International Cricket Council (ICC), headed by Sharad Pawar, has done the right thing in finding that Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif, and Mohammad Amir have “a really arguable case to answer,” charging them with “various offences” under Article 2 of its anti-corruption code, and suspending them pending a decision on those charges. But unless cricket's administrators act resolutely to plumb the depths of the nexus between players and rogue bookmakers and betting syndicates, crack down on laxity, and hand out exemplary punishment to everyone found guilty of corruption, the game will lose its biggest asset — the trust reposed in it by millions of fans, young and old, who love it for many things but above all for its authenticity and “glorious uncertainties.” There are already signs of mutiny by players as well as by fans against the betrayal of this trust. As far as we know, match-fixing, including its no-less crooked variant, spot-fixing, is of fairly recent origin. The world of cricket woke up to it a decade ago following the disgrace and downfall of Hansie Cronje and the banning of South African, Indian, and Pakistani players for varying periods. The response of the ICC was to constitute an Anti-Corruption and Security Unit to investigate and act against player-corruption.
The ICC's anti-corruption unit functions under serious limitations when it comes to policing and uncovering evidence. To be fair, it has raised the level of awareness among players, managers, and administrators of the game. Cricketers are now required, on pain of punishment, to report every instance of contact made by bookmakers and members of betting syndicates. How effective the preventive role is — how much temptation the system has helped resist — is hard to say. What is clear is that the ACSU needs more teeth. For a start, it must be allowed to strengthen its intelligence-gathering capabilities in ways not contemplated earlier. Betting syndicates and rogue bookmakers have extended their reach alarmingly. Fixers seem to have fairly easy access to players, and not just in South Asia. But these are merely symptoms of a deep-seated malignancy, what Mike Atherton, one of the best thinkers and writers on the game today, diagnoses as “the pervading culture” of “grasping, from administrators to players to commentators,” a culture of greed in which conflicts of interest abound and “once money is involved, anything goes.” If the disease is not tackled aggressively, root and branch, cricket lovers round the world will be hapless witnesses to the decline and fall of a wonderful game.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Treat-the-malignancy/article15906487.ece
7,9,2010,Inhuman crackdown,"France's controversial crackdown on the Roma, Europe's single largest minority, spotlights a continent-wide concern and a collective failure to honour the imperatives of the European Union's eastward enlargement. Ironically, the countries that imposed stringent conditions — in relation to crime, trafficking, and the observance of human rights — ahead of the EU accession bids of Romania and Bulgaria are themselves now found wanting on some of those criteria. While most of the countries of the former Soviet Union were admitted to the EU in 2004, Bucharest and Sofia were kept in waiting until 2007. France is in the midst of a mass repatriation operation of hundreds of Roma migrants in response to recent incidents of violence in the suburbs of Paris. Even some of the partners of the ruling coalition have criticised the action as stoking anti-immigration fears in the backdrop of sluggish economic recovery and the upcoming general election. Enlightened public opinion is building up in Bucharest and elsewhere against the deportation of EU citizens of one ethnic group. More recently, the Roma populations of Italy and Hungary have been targets of accusations of abetting crime, lending substance to suspicions that their governments were playing on familiar prejudices and stereotypes against ethnic minorities to woo their right-wing constituency. The European Commission has blamed the plight of the continent's gypsies on the reluctance of member-states to utilise available funds for their effective integration. The U.N. Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has dubbed the current French deportations as racially motivated.
Freedom of movement across national borders is one of the founding principles of the EU. Therefore many EU states, including France, have sought refuge in a transitional measure to restrict (until 2014) Romanians and Bulgarians from working in their territories. President Nicolas Sarkozy, eyeing a second term, should ease the curbs on migrant workers that have proved a costly gambit morally and diplomatically and reinforce his country's traditionally liberal credentials. The region's Roma, estimated at around 10 million, have an average life expectancy that is only half of that in Europe, while their rates of illiteracy and infant mortality are far higher. These are embarrassingly dismal figures for a continent that has relatively small national populations and boasts some of the best human development indicators.

8,9,2010,Perils of squeaking through,"It is a sign of the times that the political battle in Australia began over climate change and was settled in favour of the side with the more advanced Internet vision. Labour's failure, under the leadership of Kevin Rudd, to implement a promised carbon emissions trading scheme led to a dramatic fall in the party's ratings. It also triggered an internal rebellion that catapulted Julia Gillard to the office of Prime Minister earlier this year. Ms Gillard called the August 21 snap election to legitimise the coup. But in a massive setback to her, it produced a hung Parliament, the first in 70 years, with Labour and the Coalition deadlocked with 72 seats each in the 150-seat House of Representatives. With the lone Greens member, the first ever in the lower house, and an independent announcing their support for Labour early on, the focus was on a group of three conservative independents. After 17 days of negotiations with both sides, two members of the trio decided to go with Labour, citing its campaign promise of a high-speed optical fibre national broadband network. That two issues that do not carry the here-and-now urgency — of the kind voters usually look for in an election manifesto — should have played such a big part in the Australian political drama is illustrative of the expanding agenda of modern democratic process. Still there's no getting away from the numbers in Parliament: Labour's wafer-thin majority, pieced together with politicians from the right and the left, signals plenty of difficulties ahead for Prime Minister Gillard.
The Greens have given their support on condition that the government will set a price on carbon emissions, a more ambitious scheme than Labour's emissions trading proposal. They support Labour's plan for a tax on the profits of mining companies but an independent supporter of the government has indicated he opposes the tax. With just two seats behind the ruling party and sore at losing the race for government formation, the Coalition — comprising the Liberal and National parties — has made clear its intention to underline the split mandate by acting as a “credible alternative government.” The Coalition is sceptical about climate change science and it opposes the mining tax. The government's immigration policy — the Prime Minister has opportunistically indicated she favours tightening of the rules — may prove to be another flashpoint. Given the delicate political balance, international affairs may have to take a back seat, at least for the immediate future. All in all, this seems to be a good time to be in the opposition rather than in government.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Perils-of-squeaking-through/article15907571.ece
8,9,2010,Uncovering secret hoards,"The recent protocol to amend the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) between India and Switzerland offers a glimmer of hope to those in India seeking access to bank accounts held by Indian nationals in Swiss banks. It paves the way for the sharing of certain types of banking information so far protected by the Swiss secrecy laws. The caveat is that only prospective information, and that too mostly tax related information, can be shared. An omnibus clause that provides for the use of information for purposes allowed under the laws of the two countries appears to be too general and in any case will not give a carte blanche to the authorities here to go after Indian money said to be stashed away illegally. As the Finance Minister has pointed out, the agreement is between two sovereign countries and it will be extremely difficult to wrench concessions relating to anything that is so closely identified with the other country's financial sector. In fact, it is the assurance of secrecy, besides some positive features — notably, the extremely stable political and economic environment — that has made Switzerland and some other countries most attractive for overseas investors.
Even the United States with far greater financial muscle has been only partly successful. In August last year, after a long and frustrating legal battle, Switzerland's second largest bank, UBS, agreed to disclose the names of 4,450 American account holders — far fewer than in the wish list — suspected by the U.S. authorities of tax evasion. In return, the case against the bank was dropped. In India, there is a deep-rooted public perception that huge sums of Indian money have been secreted away overseas. But the situation is unclear. As of now, there are only vague estimates and they range from Rs.30 lakh crore to Rs.70 lakh crore. Whatever the actual figure, it would be naïve to think that all of such deposits have sought foreign sanctuaries only to avoid Indian laws. A large proportion of them might well belong to those who do not come under Indian tax or other jurisdictions. The fact, however, remains that tax evasion facilitated by foreign tax havens is a big threat to India's public finance. Despite lower taxes and liberalised exchange control regulations, indications are that the flow of money to tax havens has increased substantially. Fortunately, there has been a growing international backlash against tax havens within the OECD and in other forums such as the G20. India needs to buttress its case through hard facts and evidence gathered through systematic investigation. The tax protocol with Switzerland is welcome but it is only the first step.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Uncovering-secret-hoards/article15907573.ece
9,9,2010,A law that's past its use-by date,"If the armed forces are going to be used within the country to deal with insurgencies and other serious internal disturbances, it is reasonable to expect that they must have the right to use force. But the requirements of democracy and even military discipline make it imperative that this right be exercised at all times and places in a lawful and reasonable manner. Regardless of what specific statutes may authorise, the use of force in both international and municipal law is considered reasonable only when it satisfies the twin tests of necessity and proportionality. It goes without saying that rules governing the use of force are meaningful only when there is some mechanism to ensure compliance. International law is often criticised for the absence of such a mechanism, especially when it comes to disciplining powerful states. But there is no excuse for civilised societies failing to take action when the laws that define what kind of violence is permissible are wilfully violated. By this yardstick, India is not doing well at all. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, which grants soldiers far-reaching powers to arrest and kill, has impunity scripted into it. In line with Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Section 6 of AFSPA prohibits the prosecution of a soldier accused of misusing its provisions unless the central government grants sanction.
In Kashmir, the Army brass has used this section to protect its men from going to trial even in incidents where they stand accused of heinous crimes such as the abduction and murder of unarmed civilians. In States like Manipur, so powerless have the civilian authorities become in the face of the Army presence that no one is even willing to take cognisance of serious crimes allegedly committed by soldiers. In 2004, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh promised the people of Manipur that he would seriously consider replacing AFSPA with a more humane law. He appointed a committee headed by Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy to examine the functioning of the law; and the committee, noting the way in which the law was being abused, suggested its replacement by an amended version of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. In the face of the Defence Ministry's objections, however, the report was quietly shelved. Now, in the wake of the resurgence of mass protest in the Kashmir valley, the central government has once again started making vague promises about amending AFSPA. The time to make these changes is now. Section 4 should be amended to explicitly incorporate the principles of necessity and proportionality and Section 6 must be changed to allow for the prosecution of illegal acts in all cases except where the government is able to convince the courts otherwise. Expedient steps like taking some districts out of the ambit of “declared areas” just won't do.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-law-thats-past-its-use-by-date/article15908762.ece
9,9,2010,Human costs of recession,"Three years after the world suffered its biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Labour Organisation (ILO), have come out with two significant messages. First, the scars of the 2007-09 recession on the world's labour markets would last long. Secondly, a right mix of fiscal, monetary, and social protection measures needs to be put in place at the national and the international levels to ease the pain of unemployment and ensure job-creating economic growth. Two papers, one by the IMF on the human costs of recession, and the other by the ILO on building an employment-oriented framework for sustainable and balanced growth, take stock of the recent economic turmoil, and offer palliatives for a world that is just emerging out of recession. Unemployment increased by more than 30 million since 2007, taking the global figure to 210 million. The IMF's paper makes it evident that the human costs of the downturn will have a debilitating impact on the succeeding generation as well. Lower lifetime earnings, health impairment of the workforce, and diminished educational attainments of children are three important factors that will have inter-generational consequences. Moreover, youth unemployment and long-term unemployment have increased alarmingly in the advanced economies.
The ILO cautions that “a return to the pre-crisis unbalanced growth patterns could sow the seeds for future and perhaps even more damaging crises.” It goes on to emphasise that for recessions to be avoided, national and global imbalances have to be corrected. The brunt of the downward economic spiral was borne by the advanced countries. Although these two assessments are intended as a discussion document for the forthcoming Oslo summit of developed nations, they hold some lessons for developing economies too. What stands out is the need to put in place measures that do not accentuate inequalities. As the ILO points out, an effective way to ward off a recession is to ensure that “employment growth matches the expansion of labour supply and that wages broadly keep pace with productivity.” While this could be a long term goal, in the interim, the most important requirement is for governments to implement strong social protection measures that act as a cushion in times of economic adversity. The time has come for a rights-based basic social protection floor for all citizens in both advanced and developing countries.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Human-costs-of-recession/article15908758.ece
10,9,2010,Jharkhand's revolving door,"It might seem easier waltzing through the complex passageways of a labyrinth than tracking the political processes that have entertained the nation by producing a procession of governments — eight in ten years — in Jharkhand. The State's revolving door has once again deposited the Bharatiya Janata Party's Arjun Munda, who twice before donned the role, in the chief ministerial chair. Mr. Munda is unlikely to know how he got there considering the legion of names thrown up in the course of several rounds of on-again, off-again negotiations between the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and the BJP. Shibhu Soren and his son Hemant Soren, not to mention a variety of contenders from within the BJP, all vied for the post before the BJP leadership, recognising Mr. Munda's wider support in the legislature party, settled for him. Yet this might not be the end of the story, judging from Lal Krishna Advani's reported decision to skip the swearing-in-ceremony in a symbolic protest against the flagrantly opportunistic alliance between his party and the JMM.
Originally cast as an ideological opponent of the BJP, the JMM has shown itself capable of plumbing the depths to grab power. Mr. Soren lasted all of 11 days in his first term because he did not have majority backing. His second stint was a prize for extending life-support to the Manmohan Singh Government during the 2008 confidence vote in the Lok Sabha. That ended for the astonishing reason that as Chief Minister he could not win an Assembly election. Following fresh election in 2009, Mr. Soren was back as Chief Minister — this time by a pact with the BJP. The latter was morally bound to renounce power, having won far fewer seats than in 2005. Yet such was the desperation on both sides that the BJP-JMM alliance materialised. It was another matter that Mr. Soren made one more somersault, voting with the United Progressive Alliance Government on the Opposition-sponsored cut motions. Stung to the quick, the BJP withdrew support to its partner only to begin wooing the JMM all over again. Given the State's rocky political history and given the brevity of his own previous tenures, Mr. Munda can make history by just completing his term. Jharkhand was carved out of Bihar to address the mineral-rich tribal region's endemic deprivation. That promise has been tragically betrayed by its self-serving politicians. The Maoist challenge in a State where they have a strong presence will have to be met. The saving grace is that constitutional proprieties have been followed scrupulously this time, with the Union government recommending the revocation of President's Rule as soon as the political situation became clear.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Jharkhands-revolving-door/article15910034.ece
10,9,2010,Tackling the doping menace,"The build-up to the Commonwealth Games, till now mired in controversies over financial dealings, has been hit by a series of doping scandals. Of the 19 sportspersons reported for doping offences, eight were part of the Indian teams or probables for the Games. A dozen of them tested positive for the stimulant methylhexaneamine, a substance banned in competition. It is hard to recall a situation where such a large number of athletes from the host nation returned ‘positive' tests on the eve of a major multi-discipline games. Since the 2002 Manchester Commonwealth Games, India's image in international sport has taken a beating with a large number of doping episodes. In the intervening period, the weightlifting body was suspended twice for a year each; it recently had to pay a fine of $500,000 to the international federation in order to be eligible to compete in the Commonwealth Games.
There are indications of a clean-up in weightlifting. But this cannot be said of athletics and swimming — two sports perennially affected by this menace — and wrestling, boxing and judo, which are relatively new to this categorisation in the Indian context. From the 1843 tests conducted by the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) in Olympic disciplines since January 2010, 46 results (2.50 per cent) turned out to be positive. This is disturbing when compared with 0.90 per cent of 1,87,029 samples testing positive in the worldwide testing statistics for 2009 in Olympic sports. Among Olympic disciplines in India, athletics (11) and weightlifting (10) are in the lead this year while kabaddi, with 32, tops the overall charts. The complaints of sportspersons about lack of information regarding the prohibited list must of course be taken seriously. The United States Anti-Doping Agency, which tests about 8,500 samples a year, has a drug reference hotline and online facility to help athletes readily gain information. NADA should set up a similar facility to inform and educate sportspersons on the prohibited list and also on the consequences of cheating. Sportspersons are constantly on the look-out for better career opportunities and medals that bring financial and material rewards. Despite the risks, the temptation to take shortcuts proves too strong to resist, especially when unscrupulous coaches and demanding officials exert pressure. So let us be clear about the diagnosis of the spreading sports disease: ignorance may play its part but it is the grasping, win-at-all-costs mentality that strikes at the root of the spirit of fair competition.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Tackling-the-doping-menace/article15910033.ece
12,9,2010,What's the sense of it?,"The central argument in favour of caste enumeration has a plausible ring to it. Given the strong, if complex, correlation between caste and socio-economic status, the exercise seems to offer the promise of yielding relevant data so that social and economic disparities can be more accurately targeted by policy. On closer analysis, the advantage turns out to be largely illusory. In fact, the political demand for reviving the colonial practice of caste enumeration — given up by independent India except for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes — has been driven less by ameliorative ideals than by expediency and self-serving, divisive political agendas. At best, fresh caste enumeration can provide only marginal benefits because, as sociologist Nandini Sundar points out, it holds out only an “illusory promise of formal employment.” The long-term societal benefits of reservation — in terms of making a constitutionally sanctioned statement against social inequality and actually providing educational and economic opportunity to historically and socially disadvantaged or oppressed communities — are there for everyone to see. But with the majority of India's workforce languishing in the informal sector and the state's role in providing jobs declining over the past two decades, it is clear that reservation is becoming less and less potent as a countervailing force.
But the objections to the Cabinet's nod for a “focussed,” standalone house-to-house caste headcount between June and September 2011 are not only political-ideological. They are also practical. As any modern sociologist knows, answers to the question, ‘What is your caste?' can be notoriously variable, subjective, and influenced by contingent factors. Caste has an elusive arithmetic in a country that is home to a staggering number of sub-castes, where caste names vary depending on context (for marriage or for religious rituals), and where the social implications of a caste tag vary from region to region. Any 21st century caste enumeration that relies on self-certification will face the same problem encountered by the colonial censuses — what legal scholar Marc Galanter describes as the “unseemly scramble to use census listings to…inflate numbers for political advantage.” But there is yet another objection, pressed in fact by progressive advocates of caste enumeration in the main census exercise: a standalone headcount of caste will be a “futile” exercise because it will be impossible to integrate it with “the socio-economic, educational and demographic data” gathered during the census headcount (see the statement published in Op-Ed). If such integration is ruled out by the subsequent standalone headcount, then why do it?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Whats-the-sense-of-it/article15911498.ece
12,9,2010,Testing time for Sarkozy,"President Sarkozy faces widespread opposition to his recent proposals to reform the French pension system. The controversies are centred on the idea of raising the retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018, and the age of full pension entitlement from 65 to 67 by 2016. The size and nature of the protests on September 7 have shaken Mr. Sarkozy, whose ratings languish around 35 per cent. In terms of figures alone, the protests were a huge success, surpassing the trade unions' expectations. Some 2.5 million people participated in over 100 marches round the country; transport, schools, government offices, and the media were affected. Just as importantly, people of all ages and from all walks of life took part, including senior figures from prestigious professions such as medicine. François Chérèque, leader of the CFDT union, joined world-renowned French academics in signing an open letter that offers alternatives and calls for more extensive dialogue.
That the situation is serious is admitted on all sides. France, like other major European Union states, has an ageing population. Its state pension fund shows a projected deficit of about €30 billion for 2010. Mr. Sarkozy has mentioned concessions, particularly for those doing dangerous or very arduous work. Nevertheless, much wider issues are involved, and a fierce public debate is taking place around questions of gender equality, age discrimination, and fairness across generations. Older people in work face a decline in the growth of their pensions as the world economic crisis damages their future earnings. Younger people will face enormous uncertainties for several decades in the form of insecure and irregular employment. These factors will adversely affect future payments into the state pension fund. The poorer classes, furthermore, start work earlier than those in the well-paid professions. The so-called reforms would, in general, give them significantly longer working lives in more hazardous occupations. Mr. Sarkozy's many opponents point out that this would be unfair and guaranteed to increase inequalities. Martine Aubry, leader of the Socialist Party, says the reforms will be unjust and ineffective. Others make the point that the whole issue of pensions must be addressed not as a techno-financial matter but as one of national solidarity under concepts of a decent life for all. The French people have forcefully reconfirmed their commitment to long-held ideals of fairness and justice. President Sarkozy will be taking an enormous political risk by going against these ideals.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Testing-time-for-Sarkozy/article15911497.ece
14,9,2010,A bonfire of vanities,"Nearly a hundred people have died in clashes between police and protesters in Kashmir this year — more lives than have been lost in combat between troops and terrorists. The protests have made a bonfire of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's central policy vanity: the promise that he would pull off a grand resolution of the six-decade old conflict between India and Pakistan over Jammu and Kashmir, where so many of his predecessors had failed. Monday's horrific religion-fuelled violence, which claimed at least 15 lives, was sparked off by television images of the desecration of the Koran by a mischievous protester in New York. But the fact that Islamists were so easily able to exploit the issue points to a larger breakdown of faith in both democratic politics and dialogue with the state. For that, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's ambitious but pathetically executed pursuit of peace is at least in part to blame. Efforts to engage secessionists in dialogue, promises of phased demilitarisation, and a final peace deal with Pakistan itself: each of these enterprises ended in impasse. Each failure engendered cynicism and bitterness, which in turn legitimised Islamist hawks who contended from the start that peace was a miasma.
By talking big while having little to offer, New Delhi has unwittingly fanned the flames in J&K. Earlier this month, in an ill-advised gesture intended to inject fresh capital into Chief Minister Omar Abdullah's battered political fortunes, the central government let it be known that an Eid peace initiative was imminent. Made up in the main of a promise to withdraw the Armed Forces Special Powers Act from some parts of Kashmir, the decision would have meant little change on the ground: the areas from which AFSPA was to be lifted have a minimal or zero military presence. But even this move was stalled by differences within the Cabinet. The abortive Eid package strengthened the hands of Islamists. If the central government wished to build bridges with ordinary people in Kashmir, all it had to do was allow the prosecution of soldiers charged with human rights violations. The State government, for its part, could have placed before the public a clearly thought-out, credible programme for rebuilding the police force. It could have thus paved the way for a phased pull-out of troops now involved in counter-terrorism duties. Both the State and central governments could have begun a serious dialogue on the content of federal autonomy, which must form the basis for any sustainable political solution in the State. Jammu and Kashmir is poised on the edge of an abyss. Firm, generous-spirited action to win over the people is needed, not post-dated promises and grandstanding.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-bonfire-of-vanities/article15926002.ece
14,9,2010,Make-believe elections,"Recent developments in Myanmar indicate that the ruling junta is on a quest for a smokescreen of legitimacy before tightening its grip on the nation in the November 7 election. In the second major reshuffle this year, 70 senior military officers, including the Army's number three, General Thura Shwe Mann, quit their posts and are expected to join the Union Solidarity and Development Party, a proxy political party of the military. The first shuffle, in April, saw the exit of another group of senior military men, including Prime Minister Thein Sein. The moves are intended to give a civilian face to the new parliament, in which a quarter of the seats are reserved for serving military officers. The retired officers are expected to contest the remaining seats with no fear of defeat. By the August 30 deadline for registering candidates, the USDP had filed over 1,000 nominations while another pro-junta formation, the National Unity Party, is fielding over 900 candidates. On the other side, the two main democratic parties — the National Democratic Force, which split from the election-boycotting Aung San Suu Kyi-led National League for Democracy, and the Democratic Front — have been able to put up fewer than 500 candidates between them. With the registration fee fixed at $500, they did not have the money to nominate any more.
It has been clear from the start that this election — the first in Myanmar since the historic 1990 contest in which Ms Suu Kyi's party emerged victorious but was barred from taking power — is no transition to democracy. New election laws barred Ms Suu Kyi, who remains under house arrest, from contesting because of her convictions by the junta. Under the rules, the ensuing boycott by her party led to its dissolution. The military, whether in uniform or in civvies, and pro-military politicians will dominate the 224-seat House of Nationalities and the 440-seat House of Representatives. What is less clear is the role “Senior General” Than Shwe, head of the State Peace and Development Council, the official name for the junta, has reserved for himself. It was believed that he too had stepped down from his post to contest the election as a civilian. But that has turned out to be unfounded. He is likely to continue at the helm even after the election and might quit as military chief only when he is assured of a successor he can trust. But even if he became a civilian ruler, and for all his engagement with the international community, including India, the Myanmar strongman cannot hope to acquire real legitimacy after denying Ms Suu Kyi her rightful place in the country's destiny.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Make-believe-elections/article15926001.ece
14,9,2010,Dealing with India-Pakistan prisoners,"Nothing could be more repulsive in modern-day diplomacy than a country arresting civilian nationals of another country and then cynically using them as bargaining chips in bilateral issues. Yet India and Pakistan have followed this egregious practice for decades. They have kept hundreds of people from the other side in their jails, releasing them only when it suits one or both governments, irrespective of when an individual prisoner completed his sentence. Some of these hapless cross-border prisoners end up spending as long as two decades in jail for offences such as smuggling, overstaying their visa, or crossing the border illegally. Almost all of them are poor; at the time of their arrest, some are not even aware of committing an offence. Clearly, the fishermen who regularly get arrested in the Arabian Sea for crossing the international boundary line do so only for livelihood reasons. An Ajmal Amir Kasab, caught while committing a terrorist offence, is rare on either side. In recent years, responding to the outrage among activists at this blatant violation of human rights, the two governments have made some attempts to tackle the “prisoners' issue,” as it is now known, but it is way down on their list of priorities. Fortunately, the judiciary in both countries has emerged as a counter-force on behalf of the prisoners. Commendably, the judges have taken non-nationalist positions and assessed the issue purely in terms of the universality of human rights. A few months ago, the Supreme Court of India ordered the release of a group of Pakistanis held in Indian jails well after they had completed their sentence. An intervention by the Pakistan Supreme Court last week led to the release of 442 Indian fishermen.
New Delhi responded by announcing the release of 31 Pakistani prisoners. But beyond implementing the court's orders, both governments must wake up to the need for a mechanism that can ensure humane treatment of a person from the other side who has been charged with committing an offence. The objective must be to send such people back as soon as possible, especially when the offences are minor. At present, there is a reluctance even to inform the other side of an arrest or grant the detainee access to a diplomatic representative of his country. The poor shape of bilateral relations cannot be an excuse for the present shabby treatment of these people. As a country that calls itself the world's largest democracy, India must take the lead in setting up a fast-track process for dealing with Pakistani prisoners without waiting to work it out reciprocally with Pakistan.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Dealing-with-India-Pakistan-prisoners/article15912591.ece
14,9,2010,"Economic growth gets stronger, real","The recently released data on industrial output are significant in two ways. During July, industrial growth accelerated to 13.8 per cent from 7.2 per cent in the corresponding month last year. Secondly, and perhaps more relevant in a contextual sense, the Index of Industrial Production reinforces the optimism that characterised the Central Statistics Office's estimate of 8.8 per cent GDP growth during the first quarter of 2010-11. The growth drivers of the first quarter have continued into July. During the first quarter (April-June 2010) industry as a whole grew by 11.4 per cent and manufacturing by 12.4 .The corresponding figures for 2009-10 were 4.6 per cent and 3.8 per cent respectively. The IIP figures have been boosted by the spectacular performance of capital goods and consumer durables sectors, which expanded by 63 per cent and 22.1 per cent respectively. The IIP data for July, which broadly corroborate the GDP growth trends for the first quarter, in a way dispel apprehensions over the quality of economic data in this country. The GDP estimate for the first quarter, when released, seemed to suffer from several inconsistencies, although the authorities clarified them subsequently. Data analysed from the demand side did not indicate the same robustness in the GDP growth. Equally puzzling was the wide discrepancy between the CSO's estimate of the first quarter real GDP growth at market prices and that calculated on the basis of factor cost.
There is no doubt that the recent economic news augur well for overall growth during 2010-11. Indeed the current official forecast of 8.5 per cent growth may well be marked up by a few notches. Fortunately there are indications that the rebound is becoming broad based. Services grew by 9.40 per cent in the first quarter, up from 7.49 per cent a year earlier. Agriculture, which was badly hit last year by drought and floods in different parts of the country, grew by 2.86 per cent in the first quarter, compared to 1.86 per cent last year. With reasonably good monsoons so far, the sector is expected to do even better during the remainder of the year. There are two major threats to growth. Inflation remains persistently high. Given the positive trends, the Reserve Bank of India is almost certain to continue with its policy of monetary tightening. The second threat is statistical. The first quarter GDP growth rates were buoyed by the low base of last year. As the economy moves further away from the downturn and goes deeper into recovery, the statistical benefits will disappear.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Economic-growth-gets-stronger-real/article15912589.ece
15,9,2010,Nadal's march to greatness,"In becoming only the seventh man to complete the Career Grand Slam, Rafael Nadal has joined an elite group of players who have conquered all surfaces. Even before he won his history-making U.S. Open title, Nadal offered enough evidence of being a champion of the highest order. Eight majors; two back-to-back triumphs at the French Open and Wimbledon; dominance over the great Roger Federer (14-7) in head-to-head battles: these are exceptional achievements by any yardstick. Yet there are few feats as legitimising as winning at least one title at each of the Grand Slams. This is an achievement that confirms beyond doubt the range and roundedness of the tennis player, for it demands mastery of dissimilar conditions. In winning his ninth major and collecting the complete set, Nadal has banished the ghosts of past failures at the U.S. Open. The 24-year-old Spaniard's victory over Novak Djokovic has secured his special place in history.
The most impressive aspect of Nadal joining Fred Perry, Don Budge, Rod Laver, Roy Emerson, Andre Agassi, and Roger Federer is his evolution into an all-court player. Like Bjorn Borg before him, Nadal has built his game on movement and topspin — not uncommon attributes in themselves. But both men, thanks to their unmatched athleticism, have pushed the boundaries of each element further than their competitors. Several critics saw the style of Borg and Nadal as being enormously successful on clay; they didn't however recognise its universality and the space it offered for adjustment so it could be transported to faster courts. While Nadal started off with a broad-based foundation, fabricated at home by his uncle and coach Toni, he has constantly pushed himself to advance his skills. For years, Toni worked on improving his gifted nephew's positioning on hard courts. A couple of days before the U.S. Open, Nadal experimented with a different way of holding the racquet to serve and discovered he could hit it consistently faster. Both facets were vital in the world champion's triumph. Central to his success is his strength of mind, which has allowed him to recover from the 2009 season, when chronic knee trouble and the emotional upheaval caused by his parents' divorce appeared to enfeeble him. It's Nadal's intense will to win, his competitiveness, and his habit of winning “the long rallies on the important points” that impress Rod Laver, arguably the most emphatic champion in tennis history and the last man before Nadal to win three successive majors in a year. Laver, who won all four in 1969, calls Rafa “the real thing.” He should know.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Nadals-march-to-greatness/article15949235.ece
15,9,2010,A new measure and old worries,"The quest for an updated wholesale price index ended on Tuesday with the government launching a new series that captures price movements of many more goods and with a change in the base year from 1993-94 to 2004-05. The new series is more representative in character than the one it replaces. Many of the 241 items added to the portfolio are consumed by the fast growing middle class, which means the index will more efficiently capture the structural changes that are taking place in the economy. Many commodities now in the list, such as cell phones, were not in widespread use 15 years ago. The cities and towns from which data will be sourced have also been increased and there will be a uniform method for collating the data. Even with all the improvements, the new series does not quite capture the change in the cost of living in this fast growing economy. Services, which contribute over half of the economic activity, remain excluded. The WPI data will continue to be released at monthly intervals and the data on the prices of food articles and commodities at weekly intervals. Over the medium term, India should move towards the international practice of relying on a representative consumer price index for policy purposes.
The new index showed that inflation in August declined by 1.3 percentage points to a seven-month low of 8.5 per cent, although by the old index, which will continue to be published in the foreseeable future, inflation dipped only marginally to 9.5 per cent in August from 10 per cent in July. The battle with inflation is hardly over and the government will naturally have to remain vigilant. Despite the overall decline in the WPI, prices of primary articles — food, non-food articles such as fibre and oil seeds, and minerals — shot up by 15.76 per cent on an annual basis. Inflation expectations in the wake of high prices of food and other essential commodities are unlikely to moderate because of the lower overall inflation index for just one month. The Reserve Bank of India, among others, has pointed out that the supply side factors, which have been pushing food prices up, are far less likely to be contained by conventional monetary policy measures. However, with inflation spilling over into the demand side and becoming more generalised, and the economy remaining buoyant — spurred by strong industrial performance — it seems certain that the central bank will hike the policy rates in its forthcoming policy review.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-new-measure-and-old-worries/article15949226.ece
16,9,2010,Turkey's 'yes' vote,"The resounding 58 per cent ‘Yes' vote in Turkey's referendum on constitutional reforms marks a turning point in the history of a country trying to shed its image of a praetorian state. A secular democracy with a 99 per cent Muslim population, Turkey has long defied the stereotyping of Islam and its followers as being inherently incompatible with modern political systems. Paradoxically though, the military has had a massive influence on how the nation has evolved, partly because Mustapha Kemal, the founder of modern Turkey, was himself a soldier. The military, which sees itself as the guardian of the Kemalist vision of a secular Turkey, staged four coups between 1960 and 2000, and has remained an influential political voice in the country, even drafting the 1982 Constitution. Among in the 26 amendments to which the people have given their assent are changes to make the military accountable to civilian power. The referendum itself was held on the 30th anniversary of the 1980 coup, and one amendment explicitly does away with the bar on prosecuting the generals who led it. The amendments also seek to curtail the judiciary, which has often acted as a limit on the powers of parliament, in tandem with the military. This radical reforms package comprises several measures to strengthen individual freedoms, and brings Turkey's Constitution closer in line with the European Union requirements for accession. Indeed, it may not have been possible to pull off such a package without the country's aspiration to join the EU.
What really complicates this referendum is that the political party steering the changes is rooted in political Islam. The ‘yes' vote is a political victory for the conservative Justice and Development party (AK), which has sought to change the Constitution from the time it first came to power in 2002. Its relations with the military and the Constitutional Court, the country's highest judicial body, have been strained, particularly over the government's attempts to remove the ban on women wearing headscarves in public institutions. The referendum victory is a personal boost for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan ahead of next year's parliamentary elections. Not surprisingly, it has raised concerns for Turkey's famed secularism. These fears formed the basis of the opposition campaign and led to 42 per cent voting against the changes. It is to be hoped that Prime Minister Erdogan and his government will use the referendum result in a way that will not detract from Turkey's standing as a modern secular and democratic nation of Muslims that can fulfill its role as a bridge between east and west in these troubled times.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Turkeys-yes-vote/article15952066.ece
16,9,2010,Building mobile health,"Mobile wireless technologies have the potential to aid speedy disease detection, treatment, and monitoring in remote communities. When combined with the power of computers and special software, they can work in real time and enable interventions by health authorities to prevent communicable diseases from turning into epidemics. The experience gained from a two-year bio-surveillance programme in Tamil Nadu's Sivaganga district indicates that this elegant idea, of using mobile phones and computers to generate and analyse health data, can deliver good results. The project, led by the Rural Technology and Business Incubator of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, and LIRNEasia, a Colombo-based ICT policy think tank, is worth studying as a model. Central to the initiative is a team of health workers, who used simple java-enabled mobile phones equipped with a custom application to record and transmit disease symptoms reported by patients. The combination of data and computer analysis mapped the disease patterns for health administrators who then worked on interventions. The Tamil Nadu trial, which will be scaled up to connect more secondary and tertiary care institutions, makes one thing clear: measurable public health benefits can flow if governments take greater interest in the emerging area of mHealth, or mobile health. In fact, the benefits can go beyond disease-tracking and extend to such areas as remote patient monitoring, health education, and creation of community-level health profiles.
With recent advances in wireless, governments can today launch mHealth initiatives in several countries, notably those with weak health infrastructures in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The platform is supported by the GSM Association, the umbrella organisation of the mobile communications industry, and by non-profit organisations such as the United Nations Foundation-Vodafone Foundation Technology Partnership. The mHealth initiatives undertaken so far also highlight the barriers to scaling up. Lack of good broadband mobile connectivity is the main obstacle. For India, the anticipated rollout of 3G and Wimax facilities should help resolve this problem, as should the fact that a number of States already have a broadband State-wide area network for exchange of data. There are major advances in public health and preventive medicine to be made with policy that is informed and empowered by a comprehensive mobile-enabled health database. For a complete picture to be available, private medical institutions, which cater to a large number of patients, should also be roped in.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Building-mobile-health/article15951997.ece
17,9,2010,End of monetary tightening?,"Presenting its first ever mid-quarter review of the credit policy, the Reserve Bank of India surprised the markets on Thursday with a larger than expected hike in the short-term policy rates. The reverse repo and the repo rates have been marked up by 0.50 percentage point and 0.25 percentage point respectively. This, while narrowing the gap between the two short-term rates, underscores the central bank's unrelenting focus on inflation. Inflation at 8.5 per cent according to the new, updated series and 9.5 per cent according to the old series is well above the RBI's target range of 6 per cent by the end of the year. The higher reverse repo rate will help the RBI mop up surplus funds in the banking system. However, there is no surfeit of liquidity at the present moment, going by such indicators as sluggish credit off-take, widening current account deficit, and subdued money multiplier. Hence it is very likely that commercial banks, which are beginning to pay more for their deposits, will heed the other short-term rate signal and increase their lending rates. The process will be gradual since the new base rate mechanism gives them some leeway in fixing their lending rates.
Without in any way lowering its guard against inflation, the RBI has said that the monetary policy will henceforth be based on the totality of the macroeconomic circumstances. The obvious inference is that the period of aggressive monetary tightening is finally coming to an end. From now on, policy action will be guided equally, if not more, by the dynamic macroeconomic situation at home and the still uncertain outlook abroad. Recent economic data in India are positive: a GDP growth of 8.8 per cent for the first quarter and a 13.8 per cent industrial growth during July. Monsoon rainfall has been good and agriculture is expected to stage a recovery. However, there are genuine concerns that the external economy is dependent on volatile capital flows. The developed countries, though well out of recession, are witnessing a feeble recovery. Europe has been resilient in the face of the severe debt crisis but the situation in the United States is still gloomy. Finally, the need to keep a handle on the fast-changing economic environment explains the Bank's decision to increase the number of policy reviews in a year from four to eight. Leading central banks the world over communicate with the markets frequently, anything between eight and 12 times. Even as the RBI retains its right to step in whenever necessary, any increase in frequency reduces the scope for monetary intervention between two policy statements.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/End-of-monetary-tightening/article15972180.ece
17,9,2010,Endangered Iraqi heritage,"The illegitimate war on Iraq has ravaged the country and severely eroded its capacity to manage not only its future but also the past. Despite timely cautions by archaeologists, the occupying troops irreparably damaged Iraq's heritage, some of which is more than 2,500 years old. Within a few days of the forces entering Baghdad, the looters ransacked the National Museum and stole about 15,000 priceless artefacts. (This was reminiscent of the grievous loss of heritage in Kuwait following Saddam Hussein's brutal invasion and occupation of 1990-91.) Post-invasion, the United States set up a military base atop the archaeological site of Babylon; the Polish troops dug trenches through an ancient temple; and American personnel damaged historic ruins to make way for a helipad. In the face of mounting criticism, the U.S. government tried to mend the situation by initiating the Iraq Cultural Heritage Project but its $13 million grant to the project is small change considering the loss inflicted. As the troops prepare to withdraw, the surviving parts of heritage stand exposed to further pillage. With a poorly funded and inadequately staffed antiquities police force (created in 2008) unable to offer adequate protection, illegal excavations and systematic looting of antiquities have resumed.
The Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (adopted by UNESCO in 1954) is meant legally to bind the state parties to protect the cultural properties during war and occupation. But it has hardly helped in Iraq. The United Kingdom, one of the two main aggressors, is yet to ratify the convention and the U.S. accepted it only in 2009, long after the invasion. Acceptance of it would have compelled these countries to integrate heritage protection in their invasion plans. This omission, as pointed out to the Chilcot Iraq Inquiry by 13 major heritage organisations, facilitated the extensive looting of priceless cultural heritage and contributed to the alienation of much of the Iraqi population. The reality is that the big powers responsible for damaging the Iraqi heritage will not be penalised — they can be held accountable morally and politically. From the standpoint of heritage protection, the lesson is this: when good sense fails, international and internal pressure is the only way to try and make countries behave decently. Parallel to this, the Hague Convention should be reviewed and the post-withdrawal obligations of occupying state parties expanded. It will be crucial to address the demand side by taking tough action against buyers of stolen antiquities, including museums.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Endangered-Iraqi-heritage/article15972178.ece
19,9,2010,Show magnanimity,"The second court martial of Sarath Fonseka, Sri Lanka's former Army commander, has ended predictably with a verdict of guilty on the charge of violating procedures in military procurement. Last month, he was convicted of engaging in political activity while being in office. As punishment, the military court then handed down a dishonourable discharge, stripping him of his rank and all medals he had received in his 38-year career as a soldier. This time the court has recommended a three-year term in jail. Undeniably, there was a strong element of Bonapartism in many of Mr. Fonseka's actions during his final months in office. The success of the military campaign under his leadership against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam appeared to have gone to his head, as evident from his many transgressions of the red lines that govern civilian-military relations in a democratic set-up. As a military leader, Mr. Fonseka's action in contesting for presidentship as the candidate of the joint opposition against incumbent Mahinda Rajapaksa was plainly adventurist. His entry into the political arena raised fears that the military would become politicised and Sri Lanka's civilian democracy would also be adversely affected.
However the inherently opaque nature of a military trial ensured that the government was never really able to dispel the cloud of political vendetta that hung over the proceedings. Indeed, the specifics of the charge that the retired general had violated tender rules were publicised only after the trial ended. Chellenging the trial on the grounds that as a retired officer, he should not be tried under Army law, Mr. Fonseka refused to testify before the tribunal. Given that there will always be questions about the fairness of a court martial, a trial in an open civilian court would have been less controversial. The recommended jail term now awaits confirmation by President Mahinda Rajapaksa. This is an opportunity for the Sri Lankan leader to display statesmanship and sagacity of a high order. Mr. Rajapaksa has emerged as Sri Lanka's politician numero uno after decisive victories in the presidential and parliamentary elections. The parliamentary strength of the ruling alliance has helped him consolidate his powers through constitutional changes that removed the two-term bar on the President. While there might be real doubts about Mr. Fonseka's integrity as a soldier, he remains a hero to large sections of Sri Lankans for his leading role in the nearly three-year-long military operation against the LTTE. Mr Rajapaksa stands to lose nothing by waiving the three-year jail sentence handed downto Mr. Fonseka. A pardon would only add to the president's political stature.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Show-magnanimity/article15974940.ece
19,9,2010,Gift to Germany’s far-Right,"Senior figures in central banks rarely hit the headlines but Thilo Sarrazin of the German central bank, the Bundesbank, has done just that. His recent book on German society has been attacked for xenophobia, racism, and serious factual errors. Senior politicians, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, have condemned Mr. Sarrazin. He has apologised for writing passages on a “Jewish gene,” and faces expulsion from the Social Democratic Party. It is clear however that he has tapped into a vein of deep disquiet. Even many who reject the author’s attitudes and language feel that the German political class has neglected the real-life difficulties faced by a major European country of over 80 million people in accommodating and integrating a minority of about two million whose antecedents are largely in rural and strikingly different cultures elsewhere. One problem people cite is that of parallel societies, with whole neighbourhoods in some cities occupied almost exclusively by Turkish-Germans. Another concern is over Turkish-descended children who are victims of an earlier policy that did not encourage cultural integration. A third concern is about unemployment and welfare dependency among Turkish-Germans.
The furore, however, diverts attention from several important facts. Starting in 1961, Germany imported workers from the poorer parts of Turkey to meet the demand for labour in its rapidly expanding economy. Turkish workers were paid less than German workers. Housed in barracks, they were given translators at work so that they did not have to learn German. They paid German taxes and national insurance. They were as productive as homegrown workers but were regarded as temporary workers. Furthermore, Turkey’s decades of political instability gave the Gastarbeiter an incentive to stay away but German law did not give their children automatic citizenship by birth. Germany is one of several European countries that got away with such policies. The United Kingdom’s record is far from blemishless but it is better than the comparable record of most other European countries. It has never excluded its Commonwealth settlers from significant participation. Provided they meet specified conditions for U.K. residence, they are required to be on the electoral roll, even if they remain non-U.K. nationals. They have rights to trade union membership and the right to stand for elected office. The ignorance and bigotry of Mr. Sarrazin and his followers is a gift to Germany’s extreme Right and must be countered without vacillation by all democratic players across the political spectrum.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Gift-to-Germanyrsquos-far-Right/article15974939.ece
20,9,2010,Delhi's terror wake-up call,"Last year Indian Olympic Association chief Suresh Kalmadi assured the estimated 4,000 athletes and tens of thousands of fans who will participate in next month's Commonwealth Games that their safety was his “number one concern.” Sunday's terrorist attack in Delhi, which left two tourists injured, has made clear that the promise — like so many others to do with the Games — wasn't worth much. Delhi is supposed to have a central control room manned by personnel trained to respond in real time to a terrorist attack. It didn't function. There were several police squads around the historic Jama Masjid area on Sunday, but no plans to seal off exit routes and ensure an orderly evacuation. Delhi Police commando units took too long to reach the area to launch an effective cordon-and-search operation. Police believe the attack was most likely carried out by one of the Lashkar-e-Taiba-linked cells that are collectively referred to as the Indian Mujahideen — a prospect India's intelligence services have been anticipating for months. It is possible that the systematic degradation of the Indian Mujahideen's network since 2008 prevented a larger attack: the terrorists were equipped only with pistols, and a bomb planted in a nearby car failed to detonate properly. But that is no reason to believe other attackers might not be better equipped and prepared.
For more than a year, alarm bells have been ringing in India's intelligence services on the poor state of Games-related security — but not loud enough, it would seem, to compel the Delhi Police to wake up. Instead of paying attention to the need for careful planning, Games security has relied on an ineffective method: pumping in large numbers of personnel in the hope of deterring attackers. The central government has made available 175 companies of the Central Reserve Police Force to supplement Delhi's own 64,000-strong force. Police in neighbouring States, including Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, have also pitched in to help. But it is clear that the bulk of the forces deployed to protect Delhi during the Games are there to ‘reassure' the public — not to serve any useful counter-terrorism function. Few of the personnel now visible on Delhi streets seem up to handling a crisis. No drills have been conducted to test emergency-response preparedness in hotels, malls, and markets. Institutions and crowded public areas have been fitted with closed-circuit television cameras but many, including those at the Jama Masjid, aren't working. Delhi is fortunate that lives weren't lost on Sunday — but good luck is no substitute for good management. The Delhi Police must be pushed to set their house in order as best as is possible in the days that remain before the Games begin.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Delhis-terror-wake-up-call/article16010245.ece
20,9,2010,Limiting monsoon floods,"After a torrid and unusually hot summer, the monsoon rains could not have been more welcome when they set in over Kerala at the end of May. But the progress of the rain-bearing clouds northwards was sluggish and, by the end of June, the nationwide rainfall deficit stood at 16 per cent. After last year's bad drought, there were some jitters over whether the monsoon might slip once again into the red. In its first seasonal forecast issued in April, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted that it would be a ‘normal' monsoon with a deficit of only two per cent. In a normal monsoon, the nationwide rainfall is within 10 per cent of the long-period average. An updated forecast issued in late June said that the monsoon could finish with a slight surplus of two per cent, and it mainly relied on the “very high probability” of a La Nina developing in the Pacific Ocean. A La Nina, characterised by the waters of the equatorial eastern and central Pacific being cooler than usual, is beneficial for the Indian monsoon. That is indeed what has happened. From the third week of July, the rains have been bountiful. With the exception of eastern and north-eastern India, which currently shows an 18 per cent deficit, the rest of the country has received above-average rain.
Year after year, floods create havoc in some place or other during the monsoon. This year the focus has been on Pakistan where the rising waters have caused millions to flee their homes with livestock and destroyed crops across the country. Although India was spared disaster on such a scale, reports of heavy rains and consequent flooding have come in from many places. The ravages wrought by torrential downpour can be compounded by water being suddenly released from dams and reservoirs that are rapidly filling up. Of course, it is only when the water rises alarmingly that it is released. However, scientific methods are now available to monitor rainfall as it occurs and then estimate the amount of the water that will in due course flow into a reservoir. These methods aid better management of the reservoir, helping to decide in advance when and by how much various sluice gates need to be opened. Such real-time monitoring and management systems are expensive and need extensive customisation. Moreover to minimise flooding downstream they must be put in place for all reservoirs and dams in a river basin. With the grim possibility that climate change could make extreme rainfall a more frequent occurrence, the government needs to take all possible steps to limit flooding and the damage it causes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Limiting-monsoon-floods/article16010244.ece
21,9,2010,Fuelled by foreign flows,"On Tuesday, India's benchmark stock indices, the Sensex and the Nifty, surged past the important psychological milestones of 20,000 and 6,000 respectively. Given the current momentum — the markets have gone up by 10 per cent in a short two-week period — it is very likely that the indices will surpass their all time-highs recorded in early 2008. Government spokespersons have reacted with moderation: there have been no exaggerated claims about the heady rise. Nor have there been hasty inferences. The continuing positive macroeconomic news from the domestic front is boosting the investor sentiment. The economy seems capable of registering a nine per cent annual growth rate and possibly moving on to an even higher trajectory. Manufacturing especially, and also services, have shown robust performance, and agriculture seems poised to recover on the back of good monsoons. However, it would be wrong to attribute the stock market behaviour to just one or two factors. While strong corporate earnings and a sound capital market edifice have been two other positive factors, India's strength has to be seen also in relative terms. With cross-border capital flows into stocks becoming a major factor in a globalised economy, Indian markets are perceived as a haven by those who fear a double-dip recession in the United States and are concerned about the debt crisis in Europe. Foreign institutional investors have pumped in more than Rs.3,300 crore in just two trading sessions recently.
Indian stock markets have consistently been outperforming their peers. The crucial question is whether Indian stocks are overpriced. Stock indices are currently quoting at more than 21 times earning for the trailing 12-month period. Brazil, Russia, and even China have lower price-earning (P.E.) multiples. Unlike in the stupendous rally of early 2008, domestic investors, especially the retail investors, have been circumspect. Even the domestic institutions and mutual funds have been sellers, preferring to book their profits. The over-dependence on overseas investors is surely a handicap. The rally can reverse itself without any warning. The foreign flows are guided, to a large extent, by the economic circumstances in the developed countries. This was amply proved by the abrupt reversal during the second half of 2008 when the financial crisis acquired menacing proportions. High stock prices, insofar as they are prone to sharp corrections, pose a variety of threats to the individual investor and the economy. Small investors might be tempted to enter the markets at these high levels. For the macroeconomy, the foreign inflows have not been an unmixed blessing. Apart from fuelling asset price inflation, they have brought about a sharp appreciation of the rupee.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Fuelled-by-foreign-flows/article16011368.ece
21,9,2010,Meaningless elections,"It is remarkable that an estimated 3.6 million people braved threats from the Taliban to vote in the September 17 elections to the Afghan parliament. More so is that the election could be held at all. Officials of Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission are already calling it a “success.” But it would be delusional to assume that as a result Afghanistan is now a more stable place. NATO counted 500 incidents of violence on voting day, and at least 23 people, among them four candidates, were killed in the run-up to the election. In many places, the candidates were afraid to step out of their homes to campaign. More than 1,000 polling booths, out of nearly 6,835, could not open because of security concerns. To top it all, allegations of ballot-stuffing, fake voter-cards, not-so-indelible ink, and other electoral fraud are rife. As for the voter turnout this time, it was the lowest for any of the four elections held since 2001. As well as an indicator of the steadily deteriorating security situation, the number is a stark illustration of people's weakening faith in the ability of the system to provide governance. In contrast, seven million people voted in 2004 in the first presidential election, as many as 6.5 million voters queued up for the parliamentary elections a year later, and even as late as last year, 4.6 million exercised their franchise in the presidential election.
Contested as they will be, the results could take weeks to be announced. If the allegations of fraud are proved, it can only further undermine President Hamid Karzai's position, already weakened after his controversial re-election last year. Even if the elections are pronounced free and fair, installing a new parliament in Afghanistan is akin to giving band-aid to a patient suffering from multiple organ failure. The 249-member Wolesi jirga, as the parliament is called, does not have teeth and can hardly demand accountability from the President or his cabinet or even lower officials on issues such as governance-deficit and widespread corruption. The political party system is almost non-existent. Those who contested the elections are mostly warlords or ethnic leaders seen by the people not as their representatives but as members of a political elite fattening themselves on Western patronage. The election has just served to highlight that such a self-serving system would only increase the hold of the Taliban and make it more difficult for Afghans to retrieve their country from the mess that the United States has made of it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Meaningless-elections/article16011367.ece
22,9,2010,Crisis-hit Games on the brink,"Will New Delhi be ready to host the Commonwealth Games in time? That was the question on every informed Indian's lips around six months ago. That question is no longer relevant. The doubt should now be about the Games getting the final go-ahead from participating countries and the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF). The ever-escalating embarrassment for the country on the global stage in the chaotic and corrupt build-up to the Games turned into an emergency on Tuesday when a footbridge collapsed near the main stadium and several foreign delegates trashed the Games Village as filthy, unhygienic, and uninhabitable. How much more can the nation be shamed by a bunch of bungling sports officials, Ministers, and government agencies? If the top people in government failed to take their cue from CGF President Mike Fennell's criticism more than a year ago, when he warned of serious slippages in operational areas, it continued to dither even after Organising Committee (OC) chairman Suresh Kalmadi's position became untenable following corruption charges against his key aides. A few superficial changes were made by bringing in more bureaucrats into key functional areas after a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. But there was no saving the benighted project because quality had been compromised by incompetent and corrupt officials in every area connected with the Games.
To put the blame solely on the OC for every bridge and false-roof crash and incomplete Games Village blocks would of course be unfair. The government agencies were responsible for all construction work and they should be held accountable for the delays and mishaps as well. But the OC cannot escape criticism for the mess it allowed to remain in the Village in honour of the advance delegations from participating countries. The Games were supposed to showcase India's organisational ability to go with its rising stature on the global stage — as the spectacularly organised Beijing Olympics did for China. After creditably hosting the Asian Games in New Delhi in 1982 under the inspired leadership of a rising Rajiv Gandhi, India might have expected to stage a memorable show with the CWG nearly three decades later. But the script has gone tragi-comically sour. At something like Rs. 30,000 crore of the taxpayers' money, the Games are the most expensive sports event hosted by India. It is certainly an extortionate price to pay in exchange for shame and disgrace. India perhaps should never have gone in for these Games but there is no question of a bail-out now. The task is gigantic. The organisers and the government must hold their nerve and make up for lost time. Several Olympic and world champions have withdrawn from the Games. The least that can be done is to ensure that the rest do not follow their footsteps.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Crisis-hit-Games-on-the-brink/article16043500.ece
22,9,2010,Reducing the risk of meltdown,"The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a group of regulators from 27 countries including the United States, reached an agreement on September 12 on a new set of norms — Basel III. Under it, banks will be required to significantly raise their capital adequacy levels thereby reducing the risk of another financial meltdown. The agreement more than doubles the amount of equity capital that banks must hold in relation to their assets. Apart from enhancing the requirement to 4.5 per cent of their assets from 2.5 per cent, it calls for the creation of a “conservation buffer” of 2.5 per cent that can be used in an emergency. However, in such an eventuality they will be forced to conserve capital by, for instance, halting dividends. There is also a third, optional rule — a counter-cyclical buffer that regulators can impose when credit is flowing freely. On top of all this, banks have to hold 1.5 per cent of capital, which may or may not be in the form of equity, as an additional margin of protection, should the first line of defence — the core equity reserves — be breached. Basel III has been welcomed around the world as a substantial improvement over Basel II. Particularly, its recognition of the role of counter-cyclical measures in times of both boom and bust is a valuable lesson learnt from the latest crisis.
However, there are weaknesses which banks are likely to exploit for reducing the levels of capital they have to set aside. There are no clear guidelines on how liquid assets are to be valued. The new rules are risk-weighted: the more speculative their investment the more the capital banks must set aside. The risk will be evaluated by the rating agencies whose track record was not at all impressive during the crisis. The new rules are to be brought into force in phases starting 2013 and so they will not be fully in place until 2018. Banks in India are sufficiently capitalised and are unlikely to need additional capital as they migrate to Basel III. However, their profitability might be curtailed as the implementation of the new norms would result in a lower leverage. Also, the dominant public sector banks that rely on perpetual debt instruments to shore up their Tier-I capital will have the challenging task of maintaining a minimum common equity of 7 per cent. Even without the new norms, a few leading government banks feel constrained in their efforts to raise resources through capital market equity offerings. The government's shareholding in them cannot fall below 51 per cent.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Reducing-the-risk-of-meltdown/article16043499.ece
23,9,2010,No more than a breather,"Administrations at the Centre and in the States that have their hands full with daunting law and order challenges have obtained a breather from the Supreme Court's order deferring the Allahabad High Court's verdict on the Ayodhya title suits. Among the issues to be decided in the suits are: whether the Babri Masjid was built on the site of a Hindu temple after demolishing it and what the legal effect of such an action is; and whether Muslims had offered prayers from time immemorial at the Babri Masjid and if Hindu idols were placed inside. Some of the suits date back to 1950 and after consolidation in 1989, four have survived and it was in these four that judgments were to be pronounced today. The plea before the Supreme Court was that, given the implications of the impending high court decision for communal harmony and in the circumstances in which the Central and the State security forces were overstretched in dealing with the Maoists, the situation in Kashmir and the security for the Commonwealth Games, the parties should be given one more chance to work out a settlement through negotiations. This unusual last minute plea on a matter that has defied a negotiated settlement for over 60 years, and more particularly since it flared up in the 1990s, hinges on the hope that the parties would change their attitude and work towards an agreement when the Supreme Court takes up the matter. If that hope fails to materialise, the relief for the administrations would be short lived. It was with some reluctance that the Supreme Court bench decided to order the high court to defer its verdict for five days, with one of the two judges inclined to dismiss the petition.
The Babri Masjid-Ramjanmabhoomi issue would no longer seem to inflame passions to the extent that it did in the 1990s, although the court verdict could still have a significant impact on communal harmony. No one would quarrel with the desirability of a fair and equitable negotiated settlement if only that were possible. Yet, if the judicial process itself were to be held hostage to fears of disturbances, it would amount to giving rioters a veto over the law-abiding and would have disturbing implications for the rule of law. The country has come a long way since the turbulent 1990s, and the lessons of that period have hopefully been learnt — the appeals for calm from all parts of the political spectrum are a good augury. Reasonable people on both sides of the communal divide should have no problems in accepting the judicial verdict whichever way it goes, and it would in any case be open to appeal. The nation as a whole should face the Allahabad High Court verdict squarely and demonstrate its commitment to the rule of law, with issues being resolved in judicial and other institutions of the state rather than on the streets.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/No-more-than-a-breather/article13660637.ece
23,9,2010,The far-right gains,"As expected, the centre-right Alliance has won the Swedish general election, but is short of an outright majority in the 349-seat unicameral Riksdag. Under the almost fully-proportional modified Sainte-Laguë electoral system, initial results show the Alliance, which comprises the Moderate, the Centre, the Liberal, and the Christian Democrat parties, as winning 172 seats. The Moderates' leader and incumbent Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt therefore heads the first conservative government to be re-elected in Sweden since the 1930s. If the coalition holds, it will have a four-year term. The Social Democrats, who have governed for 65 of the last 78 years, have in Mona Sahlin their first leader never to have become Prime Minister. Ms Sahlin, on behalf of her own party as well as the Greens and the Left Party, conceded on the evening of the September 20 poll. As the Alliance had based its campaign on the evidence of a slow but definite economic recovery, the opposition failed to persuade voters to oust the ruling coalition. It seems now that the Greens will hold the balance of power. The Alliance agenda is relatively predictable and involves spending cuts and more privatisation, even though the national budget deficit is relatively small.
The election has, however, been dominated by the far-right Sweden Democrat Party, which has gone far beyond the threshold four per cent vote-share to win no fewer than 20 Riksdag seats. The party claims to have abandoned its skinhead past, but it has clearly attracted voters by combining near-xenophobic campaigns aimed at immigrants with brazen evocations of an idyllic — and fictitious — monocultural Swedish past. The success of this far-right group is further evidence of the strong and exploitable streak of racism and anti-Islamism in contemporary Europe. The rise of the far-right party with its pronounced anti-immigration bias is a shock for Swedish society, which takes pride in its tolerance. Its economy, one of the most successful in Europe, depends heavily on exports. Analysts even say Sweden needs more immigration, and believe that the country's exports will be at risk if it is perceived as xenophobic or racist. Clearly it is a tough road ahead for the new government, which must ensure that the advances made by the far-right do not imperil Sweden's traditional political stability and social cohesion. If the new Swedish government does not address the resulting cultural tensions, it could well provide the far-right with even more future successes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-far-right-gains/article16044758.ece
24,9,2010,First steps forward in Kashmir,"It achieved nothing, the cynics claim. But this week’s visit of an all-party delegation of Members of Parliament to Jammu and Kashmir could mark a paradigm shift in political India’s engagement with the troubled State. The MPs provided a graphic demonstration of what Chief Minister Omar Abdullah’s administration and the State’s politicians ought to have been doing: reaching out to the victims of violence and giving a fair hearing to hostile voices. But the real gain is this. For decades, India’s major parties have had little real engagement with politics in J&K. Instead of developing a genuine political dialogue on Kashmir, successive regimes in New Delhi have relied on opaque deal-making. The Delhi Agreement of 1952, which endorsed the main elements of the State’s Constitution, was forged through negotiations between governments, not political engagement. The Accord of November 1974 was concluded between two individuals with no constitutional or democratic legitimacy. In more recent times, New Delhi has sought deals with Kashmiri secessionists, often through the dubious offices of the intelligence services, bureaucrats, or quasi-official envoys. In practice, this has created a dysfunctional political culture built around the twin poles of supplication before, and defiance of, New Delhi.
New forms of political engagement are desperately needed. The India-Pakistan crisis of 2001-02 brought home the potential costs of failing to arrive at a resolution of the six-decade old conflict. In secret meetings that began in 2005, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s envoy, S.K. Lambah, and General Pervez Musharraf’s representative, Tariq Aziz, hammered out the contours of an agreement — demilitarising the Line of Control, allowing for free movement across it, ensuring autonomy for both sides, and creating joint administrative institutions. But the political gale that swept President Musharraf out of office caused significant shifts in Pakistan’s strategic thinking. The military decided that, at a time of grave internal crisis, it could not be seen to be making concessions to India. Now political India has taken the first, tentative steps forward. Secessionist leaders like Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Yasin Malik have endorsed the process by “asking not for unilateral political concessions but rather a joint commitment to a meaningful process.” Even Kashmir’s Islamist patriarch, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, met with MPs who visited his home — and that hours after he rejected calls for a formal dialogue. This fledgling dialogue did not aim to bring about a final resolution of the conflict. Nor will it automatically still the anger on Srinagar’s streets. The challenge now is to institutionalise these conversations and build a durable dialogue between political India — not just the government of the day — and the troubled State’s politicians.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/First-steps-forward-in-Kashmir/article16046045.ece
24,9,2010,Niger neglected by the world,"Aterrible famine has taken hold of Niger, despite warnings sounded almost a year ago by aid agencies and the United Nations. Nearly 12 million people, or about 80 per cent of the population, are now food insecure. In the four worst-affected provinces, one child in five is malnourished, and the country's Global Acute Malnutrition rate for under-fives has risen from 12.3 per cent to 16.7 per cent in a year. Comparisons have been made with the 1984 Ethiopian famine. Niger, for its part, is one of the poorest countries on the planet, and its Human Development Index is the lowest. It has the world's highest raw birth rate; on average, every woman has seven children, and 20 per cent of the children are unlikely to reach the age of five. Secondly, this year's drought, which followed the unusually heavy and destructive rain in 2009, has been a severe setback to the people's own success in reclaiming three million hectares of desert; in addition to destroying crops and killing cattle, it has wrecked the purchasing power of the 90 per cent of the population who depend on agriculture. Thirdly, neoliberal agriculture policies mean that Niger exports food to neighbouring countries. Unlike many other countries, Niger cannot import enough food to compensate for insufficient domestic production.
The international response to the famine has been slow and grudging. Donations so far amount to less than half the $348 million promised. The U.S., the U.K., and the EU have met their commitments, but several other states are yet to contribute. Some of the latter have lucrative uranium mining operations in Niger; those have, however, been criticised for causing radioactive contamination and related diseases. The news magazine Der Spiegel has called Niger the Saudi Arabia of uranium production, but ordinary citizens have hardly benefited from this industry. If there is anything good about the situation, it is that the military government which took over in a coup earlier this year is, unlike its civilian predecessor, not denying the problem. Given the country's poverty, sheer size (it covers nearly twice the area of Texas), and woeful infrastructure, the government cannot deal with the famine on its own. Unless the rest of the world responds much faster and more generously, Niger will continue to suffer what the former U.N. Special Rapporteur on Food, Jean Ziegler, calls “silent mass murder.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Niger-neglected-by-the-world/article16046044.ece
27,9,2010,Retrieving lost authority,"Cabinet reshuffles are crisis-laden affairs for governments that have only a wafer-thin majority in the legislature. But for Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa, the reshuffle was an opportunity to assert his constitutional authority, seriously eroded last year during the dissident activity spearheaded by the mining lobby of the Reddy brothers. Although Mr. Yeddyurappa did not touch the portfolios of the two brothers, G. Janardhan Reddy and G. Karunakara Reddy, he did bring back their bête noire Shobha Karandlaje as Minister. Ms Karandlaje, a close associate of the Chief Minister, had been dropped from the cabinet in November 2009 as part of a compromise formula to appease the Reddy brothers, who found her too meddlesome in the reported illegal aspects of their mining interests. In the latest reshuffle, marked by uncharacteristic boldness, Mr. Yeddyurappa also dropped the Independent, Gulihatti D. Shekhar, who was considered a part of the coterie of the Reddy brothers. The changes have strengthened Mr. Yeddyurappa and diluted some of the extra-constitutional authority wielded by the brothers within both the cabinet and the bureaucracy. The post-reshuffle dissidence also appears to have died down with many of the party legislators being promised posts as heads of government boards and corporations. There are no more ministerial berths to be offered as sops, with the cabinet strength now at the maximum permissible limit of 34.
Mr. Yeddyurappa found it easier to have his way because of the legal tangles that the Reddy brothers had got into on account of the charges of illegal mining. The brothers from Bellary have deep pockets, and could boast of friends in high places, especially among the national leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party. But with the Supreme Court suspending mining activity in the iron ore mines owned by the brothers, and the backroom manipulations of the mining lobby out in the open, any blatant support for the brothers would involve a huge political cost. In the months after the revolt inspired by the Bellary mining magnates, Mr. Yeddyurappa slowly won the full backing of his party leadership, as also of many of the legislators in the rival camp. His hands were also further strengthened by the successes of the BJP in the by-elections. The Chief Minister can now concentrate on the tasks of governance without having to constantly look over his shoulder. The hard-won political authority should not be wasted in petty factional wars, but must be spent in ensuring a better-functioning government than what was provided in the first half of his term.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Retrieving-lost-authority/article16048677.ece
27,9,2010,Living with Gajah,"The death of seven elephants in a train hit in West Bengal's Jalpaiguri district is a grim reminder that little has been done to stop such slaughter in various States. Assam and West Bengal account for two-thirds of elephant mortality in train hits, followed by Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, and Orissa. Only a month ago, a comprehensive report of the Elephant Task Force of the Ministry of Environment and Forests titled “Gajah: Securing the Future for Elephants in India” presented a road map to reduce elephant mortality in train accidents. Aided by extensive research, it identified key factors that raise the risk for the animals. These include dispersed water sources, steep embankments along rail tracks, sharp turnings, and sheer speed of trains. Scientists have empirically tested the evidence in Rajaji National Park, Uttarakhand, and achieved excellent results in saving elephants.
Overall, elephants may be doing better than tigers in India going by their estimated populations. But their long-term future depends on a science-based conservation plan. Gajah's historical range may have shrunk but the fact that 18 States host elephant populations making up an estimated national total of 26,000 (not counting the 3,500 in captivity) is cause for some optimism. Besides train hits, there are significant issues affecting conservation, such as human-elephant conflict, the diversion of land for mining and similar incompatible uses, the degradation of habitat, and the loss of forest cover. The Task Force is correct in its view that, given the magnitude of the task, it will take a statutory National Elephant Conservation Authority to address the problems. A virtue of the panel's report is that it is imbued with as much concern for communities as it is for the species. State governments should welcome the recommendation to substantially increase the allocations made for compensation to be paid to victims of conflicts. Agricultural losses suffered in elephant raids affect nearly half-a-million families annually. Enhanced financial compensation for such losses is a must. States that have the privilege of enabling elephant movement must also support the 32 existing and proposed elephant reserves, and secure the identified corridors used by the animals. Crucially, the Forest Conservation Act must be vigorously applied wherever diversion of land is proposed, and elephant habitat declared ecologically sensitive under the Environment (Protection) Act. Finally, why not make the Indian elephant the national heritage animal, as the Task Force recommends? This newspaper made it a centrepiece of its masthead, symbolising strength and power, many decades ago.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Living-with-Gajah/article16048675.ece
28,9,2010,Cheerless outlook on crucial goals,"The conclusions of the United Nations summit on the world's progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) present a gloomy picture. Some goals such as universal primary education, reducing child mortality, and improving maternal health are unlikely to be reached by the 2015 deadline. The world may be on track to meet the target of halving the number of people living under $1 a day, but the numbers suffering from hunger and malnutrition have risen between 2007 and 2009; one in four children in developing countries is still underweight. Employment has declined. Gender equality is elusive. Ditto for environmental sustainability — the rate of deforestation is declining but remains alarmingly high; the 2010 target on biodiversity conservation has been missed. The target of halving the number of people without access to drinking water can be achieved, but not so the number without access to sanitation. The U.N. fears that the progress made in some areas is “fragile” and if the world drops the ball on commitment and funding, even these limited gains may be reversed. Indeed, building a global partnership on development is one of the MDGs, but as the U.N. notes, only five donor countries have allocated the targeted 0.7 per cent of their gross national income for official aid.
Part of the U.N. Millennium Development Declaration in 2000, the eight MDGs were accepted by member-states and 23 international organisations who pledged to improve the lives of the world's most impoverished people. Yet, as the U.N. has noted, inadequate resources, lack of focus and accountability, and insufficient dedication to sustainable development are the main culprits in the unsatisfactory march towards meeting the 21 MDG targets. In India, the government's optimism, reflected in its country report released in June, that many of the MDG targets can be met by 2015, is hard to share. While the report estimates 27.5 per cent of Indians lived below the poverty line in 2004-05, compared to 36 per cent in 1994-95, the methodology for arriving at this figure is disputed. The U.N. differs with India's claims on reducing maternal mortality. The country is nowhere near reducing child mortality to the targeted 42 per 1,000 live births. Nearly half the under-five children are malnourished. Bringing this down to 26.8 per cent in five more years is impossible. India will also clearly miss the deadline for universal primary education. The failures are a reminder of the dismal truth — despite India's impressive economic growth over the last decade since the MDGs were accepted as policy goals, large chunks of the country have yet to benefit from it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Cheerless-outlook-on-crucial-goals/article16049796.ece
28,9,2010,Better news on the HIV front,"Although nearly 7,500 new cases of HIV infection are reported every day globally, the good news is that incidence rates are steadily declining in most parts of the world. HIV incidence has fallen by more than 17 per cent globally over the past nine years. But what is of greater significance is that it is happening in many African countries, the core of the epidemic and which for years had a disproportionately high number of new cases. According to the latest UNAIDS report, the incidence rate has dropped by more than 25 per cent in 22 sub-Saharan African countries, and many of them are well on the way to achieving the U.N. target of reducing HIV rates among the young this year. They include Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe — some of the countries with the largest HIV epidemics in the world. Better awareness of the risks and education on the different modes of transmission has been identified as the key factor that made it possible. A study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology in April this year attributes the decline in Zimbabwe to changes in sexual behaviour, particularly the use of condoms in non-regular partnerships. A dramatic reduction was also seen in the case of women in the 15-24 age group in South Africa. Despite the group reporting the highest incidence rate, the drop has been nearly 60 per cent between 2005 and 2008.
In a striking contrast to the picture emerging from sub-Saharan Africa, HIV incidence in Eastern Europe and Central Asia is showing an upward trend. Russia has the largest AIDS epidemic in Eastern Europe and Eurasia. Injection drug use is the main mode of transmission across Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Similarly, once praised for drastically cutting down the prevalence rate from 30 per cent in the late 1980s to six per cent by late 1990s, HIV prevalence in Uganda is on the rise once again. Widespread use of anti-retroviral treatment and the resultant reduction in mortality has led to the increase. But the availability of drugs has also meant greater indulgence in risky behaviour. This, combined with the scaling down of prevention programmes due to complacency, has played a major role in pushing up the incidence rate. Uganda offers a good case study for India. The prevalence rate in India is low at approximately 0.36 per cent. The lesson in this for India is that there should be no let up in the drive to increase awareness and risk avoidance in the campaigns for AIDS prevention. There is absolutely no room for complacency on this vital front.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Better-news-on-the-HIV-front/article16049795.ece
29,9,2010,Labour breaks with recent past,"It is often said about Britain's Labour Party that it is at its best when it is bold and adventurous. In electing Ed Miliband to replace Gordon Brown as its leader, it has certainly shown an extraordinary streak of boldness. The choice of a young, left-of-centre leader in the face of a strong challenge from right-of-centre Blairites represents a decisive break with the past as the party begins the long march back to power. It also signals the arrival of a younger generation of leadership not tainted by the excesses and fatal blunders of the ‘New Labour' era. Using his maiden speech intelligently to distance himself from the “old” ways of doing things, Mr. Miliband proclaimed: “I lead a new generation not bound by old thinking.” Part of his diagnosis was that New Labour had “lost its way” and stopped listening to people. He courageously denounced the Iraq invasion, saying it was “wrong, wrong, and wrong.” In a sign that the party is desperate to move on, every time he mentioned the word “young” and called for a new direction, he was loudly cheered. At 40, Mr. Miliband — non-Marxist son of a noted Marxist theorist Ralph Miliband — is the youngest leader in the party's modern history, overtaking Tony Blair by a few months. He was elected an MP only in 2005 but quickly rose to ministerial ranks and became a Cabinet Minister in 2008.
Ed Miliband, a surprise late entrant to the leadership contest, was widely regarded as an underdog against David Miliband, his more experienced and high-profile brother. There were three other contenders: Ed Balls, Andy Burnham, and Diane Abbott. But from the moment the younger Miliband entered the fray, it effectively turned into a two-horse race, with the elder Miliband seen as the favourite. As the contest tightened, it took on aspects of a psychodrama. While David appears to have taken his victory for granted and readied a Blairite speech that would have been totally out of sync with the mood within the party, Ed approached the contest with the relaxed air of someone who had nothing to lose. What tilted the balance in his favour was the solid backing of Labour-affiliated union members who were impressed by his passionate defence of the role of the unions and his attacks on the savage cuts in public spending. Mr. Miliband has contemptuously rejected the ‘Red Ed' tag sought to be foisted by the Tories and the right-wing media. To the unions, his message was that while he sympathised with their cause, he would not support “irresponsible” actions. He is seen to have made a good start with a speech that, as The Guardian noted editorially, Labour “needed, a pointed break with the worst of the recent past but a strong reaffirmation of its best.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Labour-breaks-with-recent-past/article16051920.ece
29,9,2010,Job creating growth,"The UNCTAD's analysis of the relevance of export-led growth strategies in the post-crisis global economy, in its Trade Development Report (2010), provides valuable lessons for countries like India. These strategies have served many countries well, and China, South Korea and Japan, among others, have relied heavily on external demand to achieve spectacular growth. However, there is a flip side. Going by the experience over a 30-year period, the TDR says economic growth, however strong, does not by itself generate decent jobs to absorb the labour surpluses typical of developing countries. This became apparent recently when the global financial and economic crisis was seen to push unemployment to unprecedented levels in many countries. Of special concern is the situation in the United States, where there is no sign of improvement on the job front. The U.S. may no longer remain so huge a market for exports. Since other major economies are unlikely to take its place as a dominant market in the near future, the size of the global export market may shrink.
There is something inherently wrong with the agenda of boosting exports pursued by countries that depend almost entirely on keeping domestic wages low so as to gain a competitive edge in global markets. Persistently high unemployment is attributable to labour market rigidities that kept wages from falling to levels low enough to increase the demand for labour. UNCTAD points out that such reasoning ignores the important role of wage increases in spurring domestic demand, and boosting employment to meet that demand. Moreover, it is the expectation of rising demand and favourable financing conditions rather than a reduction in unit labour costs that drives investment in productive capacities. More employment can be generated if the productivity gains from investments are distributed equitably between labour and capital in a way that lifts domestic demand. Secondly, macroeconomic policies should aim at ensuring that real incomes of the people keep pace with productivity growth. Thirdly, countercyclical fiscal policies that proved a great success during the crisis in stabilising demand will be useful even in normal times. Fourthly, adjusting wages with productivity gains will check both production costs and demand growth from rising above supply potential. It will also pave the way for an employment friendly monetary policy. Institutional arrangements such as collective bargaining will help in framing a suitable incomes policy. Finally, in many developing countries, public employment schemes are found to have had cascading effects on the rest of the economy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Job-creating-growth/article16051919.ece
29,9,2010,Kashmir's peace challenge,"Since street battles broke out in Kashmir this summer and took on an ominous character of a full scale agitation, New Delhi has finally laid out a plan for political action. After an all-party delegation of members of Parliament visited Jammu and Kashmir earlier this month which he led, Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram has promised that New Delhi will appoint a group of interlocutors to engage with the State's people. The Union government has also signalled that it will respond to the youth rage driving the current flare-up by addressing key issues like the chronic unemployment engendered by the State's dysfunctional economy. It has also made clear that it expects the State government to apply a healing touch to the inflamed situation. None of these ideas is new. Ever since 1996, successive governments have wanted to remove the obtrusive bunkers set up to combat a massive urban insurgency that no longer exists. But they failed to evolve creative solutions that could meet community needs and address counter-terrorism imperatives. However, the appointment of interlocutors to take the dialogue with the Kashmiris forward is a positive step. It will work — but only if key actors in New Delhi and Srinagar have the will to make it work.
New Delhi's interlocutors will have the unenviable task of negotiating a way through the maze that has claimed so many peace efforts. Various Prime Ministers from Atal Behari Vajpayee to Manmohan Singh have launched serious efforts at making peace. Both Mr. Vajpayee and Dr. Singh have held direct meetings with key secessionist leaders. Dr. Singh's latest efforts included two round tables which threw up key recommendations to institutionalise the peace process in the troubled State. In essence, the idea was to build a consensus around a future where Jammu and Kashmir would have significant federal autonomy, while protecting India's concerns about sovereignty. The problem, though, was that the secessionist leaders were unwilling to sign on to a deal that did not have Pakistan's backing. Prime Minister Singh and President Pervez Musharraf came close to such a deal in 2006. Since then, crisis-ridden Pakistan has shown little interest in moving forward. New Delhi can unilaterally arrive at an arrangement with some key actors who have salience in the Valley. But such understandings may not prove durable unless backed by a real consensus. Each past failed peace effort has left behind a trail of betrayed hopes, engendering frustration and cynicism. But the overwhelming sense of national solidarity with Kashmir's suffering as demonstrated by the visit of the all-party delegation should ensure that this time, the peace process does not fail.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Kashmirs-peace-challenge/article16050862.ece
29,9,2010,Dead water zones,"Levels of dissolved oxygen in the tropical oceans are dropping at a rate that threatens the survival of fish and other marine organisms. This reduction is seen off the coast as well as further away from the land where the water-depth exceeds 1,500 metres. The ‘dead zones' off the coast are primarily the result of booms in phytoplankton growth due to nitrogen-rich fertilizers leaking from agricultural lands. If the incidence of hypoxia (low dissolved oxygen) has risen ten-fold globally in the past 50 years, the jump is nearly 30-fold in the case of the United States' coastal waters. The Pacific coast has witnessed a six-fold increase in the number of hypoxic sites in the last 20 years. A recent study (“Scientific assessment of hypoxia in U.S. coastal waters”) by key U.S. federal agencies reveals that nearly half of the 650 waterways covered are experiencing hypoxic conditions. Particularly worrying is the reconfirmation of hypoxic condition in the waters off Oregon and Washington, the second largest hypoxic region in the U.S. and the third largest in the world. The inner continental-shelf waters off Oregon, which exhibit hypoxic conditions only during summer, have no nutrient supply. Climate change may be the cause, as warming reduces solubility of oxygen, thereby affecting the mixing of warmer surface water with deeper oxygen-deficient water. But a definite link cannot be established in the absence of long-time oxygen measurements. A news item published in Nature last month has it that water at 50 metres depth off the Oregon coast was turning hypoxic as water above the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) is “steadily losing oxygen.” The OMZ, which is permanently oxygen-deprived and occurs naturally at a depth 600-1,200 metres, is slowly expanding vertically and extending towards the coast.
The outcome in both dead zones — one caused by pollution and the other by hypoxic water, probably due to climate change — is a large-scale migration of fishes and other free-swimming marine organisms, and the death of bottom dwellers like crabs and starfish. Fish-kills happen when oxygen levels drop suddenly as reported in Oregon during certain years. Fish-kills or large-scale migration of fish can have enormous economic and ecological consequences. Since the effects of climate change cannot be reversed even in the mid-term, marine organisms can be saved only through immediate and drastic action to reduce the quantum of fertilizer leaking into the oceans. Strategies to reduce nutrient loading have proved successful in reducing the level of hypoxia in the Long Island Sound estuary, for instance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Dead-water-zones/article16050863.ece
1,10,2010,Intriguing compromise could work,"The majority verdict of the Allahabad High Court on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute is a compromise calculated to hold the religious peace rather than an exercise of profound legal reflection. This search for a compromise informs the orders of Justice S.U. Khan and Justice Subir Agarwal even if they would seem to stretch the law and, at times, logic as well. The third judge, Justice D.V. Sharma, decided that the disputed structure could not be regarded as a mosque and ruled in favour of the Hindu plaintiffs. The effect of the majority judgments is that the disputed land of 2.77 acres is to be divided equally among the two Hindu plaintiffs, the Nirmohi Akhara and Bhagwan Sri Rama Virajman, the deity regarded as a jurisdic person that can own property, and the Sunni Central Board of Waqfs U.P. The portion of the inner courtyard where the central dome of the Babri Masjid stood before its demolition and where the makeshift temple now exists is to be given to the Hindu plaintiffs. The rest of the area where the Babri Masjid stood, including part of the inner courtyard and some part of the outer courtyard, is to be allotted to the Waqf Board. The Nirmohi Akhara is to be allotted the buildings that stood in the outer courtyard of the premises, including Ram Chabutra and the Sita Rasoi, while it is to share the unbuilt area of the outer courtyard with Bhagwan Sri Rama Virajman. To facilitate such a three-way division, and also to provide access, some part of the land acquired by the Central government around the disputed land could be used.
In arriving at his decision on the three-way division, Justice Khan has concluded that the disputed structure was a mosque constructed by or under orders of Emperor Babar and that it was built not after demolishing any temple but on an area where some temples were already in ruins. He notes that before the mosque was constructed, the Hindus believed that somewhere in the large area of land where the Babri Masjid came to stand later was the spot of birth of Lord Ram. After the mosque was constructed, they came to believe that the place where the mosque stood contained the birth spot, and much later in the decades before 1949 they came to identify that spot as the one under the central dome. He also holds that much before 1855, the adjoining Ram Chabutra and the Sita Rasoi existed and Hindus were worshipping there. According to his finding, the idol of Lord Ram was placed for the first time under the central dome of the Babri Masjid in the early hours of December 23, 1949. In view of the side-by-side worship and joint possession of the disputed site, he would declare both parties as joint title holders. However, that part of the land under the central dome of the Babri Masjid where the idols were placed and the makeshift temple now stands after demolition would be allotted to the Hindus.
However, Justice Agarwal who also favoured the division of the land differed from Justice Khan on some critical issues. He does not find evidence of Babar having built the mosque or any material to support the exact date when it was built, though he finds it was in existence before 1776. He finds also that the idol had been placed under the central dome on December 23, 1949 but wants that spot to be allotted to the Hindus. The Sunni Central Board of Waqfs is to get no less than one-third of the total area in dispute, including the rest of the area on which the mosque stood and some part of the outer courtyard. Justice Sharma finds that the idol was placed under the central dome on December 23, 1949 but in his other findings and conclusions he differs radically from his fellow judges on the Bench. He has ruled that as the disputed structure was built against Islamic tenets, it could not be regarded as a mosque.
At one level, from the standpoint of political morality, the verdict could be viewed as partially rewarding those who placed the idol overnight under the central dome of the mosque and those who in 1992 razed it to the ground. Nevertheless, the confusing mass of findings the reasons for which are not entirely clear and the compromise nature of the verdict along with the substantive outcome of dividing the disputed land have restrained any party from claiming outright victory or sulking in total defeat. The Sunni Waqf Board and the Sri Ramjanmabhoomi Trust have indicated that they would appeal against the verdict to the Supreme Court.
All sections of political opinion had issued appeals for calm and restraint on the eve of the verdict but apprehensions of disturbances remained, and a last minute effort was made to halt the judgment. The Supreme Court struck a blow for the rule of law and decided that the judicial process that has been winding slowly over the last 60 years ought not to be halted at the last minute for fear of disturbances and under some imaginary hope of the parties arriving at a negotiated settlement. If overall the reaction from the public and from large sections of political opinion has been subdued, much of it has to do with the mood of the nation in which the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid issue does not find much traction any more — in striking contrast to the 1990s. On balance, the nature of the Allahabad High Court verdict should help the nation as a whole put a longstanding dispute behind. Secular India needs to move on and not be held hostage to grievances, real or imaginary, from the distant past. A great deal of the responsibility lies with political parties and religious groups to maintain harmony in the face of fundamentalist forces seeking to disturb the peace and profit from raising communal issues. They ought not to allow revanchist sentiment and any talk of revenge to come to the fore as many of them did in the 1980s and 1990s by their passivity or collaboration. For too long has the Ayodhya dispute remained an obsession with large sections of the people. It is to be hoped that after this major, even if not final, step in the judicial process it will cease to occupy the political stage.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Intriguing-compromise-could-work/article13883648.ece
2,10,2010,Currency concerns,"The general weakening of currencies across the global markets has been described by Brazil's Finance Minister Guido Montego as a manifestation of an “international currency war” that is threatening to take away his country's competitiveness. Indeed for a variety of reasons, many governments have been pursuing policies which, directly or indirectly, lower the external value of their currencies. The United States and a few other issuers of reserve currencies have embarked on a monetary expansion to check falling domestic demand while a few others, notably China, have intervened to keep their currencies from rising. The alleged “currency manipulation” by China has invited some strong words and, even threats of counter action by the U.S. In the past, there have been currency conflicts and efforts to prevent the situation from getting out of hand. In September 1985, the U.S., the U.K., France, West Germany, and Japan jointly decided to push for dollar depreciation. Even earlier, in 1971, the U.S. abruptly ended the dollar's convertibility into gold, signalling a preference for cheaper currency. What makes the present situation different is the emergence of China as the world's second largest economy. Besides, an agreement at the global level is not easy to arrive at because of the variation in the pace of recovery and the divergence in strategies among the major economies.
India, Brazil, and other emerging economies have had to reckon with a surfeit of capital inflows which, unless properly handled, can threaten macroeconomic management. Brazil has tried a Tobin-type tax, with only limited results. India has traditionally depended on a two-stage intervention by the RBI to check a sharp rupee appreciation. Surplus dollars were mopped up and it was followed, wherever necessary, by sterilisation of excess domestic liquidity. Reducing the volatility of the rupee and building up adequate reserves to guard against risks have been the other objectives. Yet, for reasons that are not clear, the RBI has stayed away from the foreign exchange markets since August 2009. The rupee has appreciated sharply in relation to the dollar. More light on India's apparently contrarian stance might be shed in the next credit policy statement, due in early November. Given the present levels of coordination in international forums, these concerns across the world may not result in currency wars or mutually injurious “beggar thy neighbour policies.” However, since currency-related disputes are but a manifestation of the bigger problem of global imbalances, the ongoing efforts at correcting the imbalances in an orderly way need to be pursued vigorously.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Currency-concerns/article15765172.ece
2,10,2010,How Berlusconi survived,"The Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, has survived a vote of no confidence in an episode that confirms him in office but has much wider repercussions for Italian politics and democracy as a whole. He and his Freedom People movement remain in office because a group of MPs attached to the Prime Minister's former ally, Gianfranco Fini, decided to reject the no-confidence proposal; Mr. Berlusconi won by 342 votes to 275, with three abstentions. The ostensible reason for the potential rebels' change of heart was Mr. Berlusconi's restatement of his party's election-winning programme, including reforming the justice system, giving regions greater fiscal autonomy, supporting the poorer south of the country, and fighting organised crime and illegal immigration. (Tax cuts were also mentioned.) Significantly, there was no mention of legal immunity for senior office-holders; an earlier law providing immunity was declared unconstitutional in 2009. The atmosphere on the Italian Right nevertheless remains acrimonious. Mr. Fini proposes to create a new party, but his group's recent vote may well have had to do with the fact that the newspaper Il Giornale, which is owned by Mr. Berlusconi's brother, has linked Mr. Fini to shady property deals and to companies in overseas tax havens.
There is nothing new about the Prime Minister's use of his vast media empire and contacts to intimidate rivals or the judiciary. But his political survival means that highly unsavoury episodes will continue to loom large. For example, an associate who admits paying women to attend parties hosted by the Prime Minister has been investigated for drug trafficking and for aiding and abetting prostitution. As for the restated policies, they could cause serious problems. Tax cuts could exacerbate Italy's budget deficit, which at 5.3 per cent is lower than the euro-zone average. Secondly, regional fiscal autonomy could widen the north-south economic gap. Thirdly, populist talk on immigration will encourage the extreme Right. Furthermore, judicial reforms will strengthen suspicions that Mr. Berlusconi, who has already been named as jointly responsible for bribing a judge in a media-takeover case, will try to limit the judiciary's powers. On the other side of Italian politics, however, the Left has a real opportunity to put behind it corruption scandals and some lacklustre election campaigns, both of which greatly helped Mr. Berlusconi. If the main centre-left body, Pier Luigi Bersani's Democratic Party, can revive the opposition, it will dominate the lead-up to the next general election in 2013 and improve the entire tone of the country's politics.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/How-Berlusconi-survived/article15765171.ece
4,10,2010,"Delhi delivers, the Games are on","Over the last few weeks, as the events leading up to the Commonwealth Games (CWG) in New Delhi unfolded like scenes from a B-grade Bollywood disaster movie — featuring a collapsed foot overbridge, flooded building basements, stained bedcovers, and dirty, stinking toilets in the Games Village — sports fans might have forgotten that what was scheduled to take place in the nation's capital was actually a sports event. But now that CWG 2010's rocky ride towards the starting grid has culminated in an extravagant Opening Ceremony that showcased India's rich and pluralistic culture, sport can at last take centre-stage. The central government and the Delhi administration, as well as the reconstituted Organising Committee, did well to respond to what was pretty much an emergency. The Games Village was cleaned up on a war footing and the Army did commendable work in putting up a Bailey foot overbridge in under six days. The eleventh hour damage-control exercise has apparently pleased all the visitors, going by the feedback from the teams. Disastrous consequences were averted by a late response, but a lot remains to be done over the next 10 days if the host is to turn the Games into a widely acclaimed success. This alone can advance India's cause if the world's second most populous nation hopes to bid for the Olympic Games in the conceivable future.
But now that ‘play' has been called in New Delhi, attention must turn to the athletes who have gathered in the nation's capital in quest of glory. The Delhi Games feature a record number of 6,700 athletes and officials (it was 5,766 in the last edition in Melbourne). India itself is fielding a 619-member contingent and, following rigorous preparation in several disciplines, expects to double its 2006 tally of 50 medals. While CWG standards are not comparable to world standards in sports such as tennis, wrestling, archery, weightlifting, and boxing, shooting may be an exception. India may be confident of reaping a good harvest in most of these sports. But despite the withdrawal of a few superstars such as Usain Bolt, the world and Olympic record holder in 100 and 200 metres, and the multiple Olympic gold medalist swimmer Stephanie Rice of Australia, the focus will not necessarily be on Indian athletes. There are several world-class performers in athletics and swimming: world and Olympic pole vault champion Steven Hooker of Australia, Nancy Jebet Langat, the women's 1500m Olympic champion from Kenya, and Liesel Jones, the Olympic breaststroke champion from Australia, are just the best-known among several visiting athletes who have it in them to provoke clucks of awe from the fans in the stadia and those watching on television.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Delhi-delivers-the-Games-are-on/article15767787.ece
4,10,2010,The Dear Enigmatic Leader,"The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is showing clear signs that it is likely to confirm a successor to its 68-year-old leader, Kim Jong-il, before long. Mr. Kim's son Kim Jong-un was appointed a four-star general in the days leading up to the first major meeting of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) since 1980. Then, on the day of the meeting, September 28, the younger Kim was named vice-chairman of the party's central military commission. The meeting was not a full party conference but was convened to elect the supreme leadership board. North Korea, in fact, has no president. The enigmatic Kim Jong-il, who prefers to be known as ‘Dear Leader,' left the presidency vacant after the death of his father, President Kim Il-Sung, in 1994; and, in 1998, had the post abolished by means of a constitutional amendment. The Dear Leader himself became party general secretary and chairman of the National Defence Commission (NDC) in 1997.
Kim Jong-il is reported to have suffered a stroke in 2008; analysts note that he made no public appearances for several months until some time into 2009, and he was said to look frail during recent visits to China. The political and economic issues facing the DPRK are problematic, to put it mildly. Kim Jong-un, who was educated in Switzerland, is thought to be about 27, but has been groomed for high office; he accompanied his father on an official visit to China in August and has been appointed to the NDC. His youth and inexperience, however, mean that a mentor will almost certainly be named. The probable mentor is Jang Song Thaek, 64, the Dear Leader's brother-in-law, vice-chairman of the NDC, and a former head of internal security. His experience could be valuable in a de facto power vacuum following a succession, and he may deal with foreign affairs while the young Kim initially takes internal responsibilities. Mr. Jang is said to regard China favourably, but domestic economic policy is unlikely to be adapted to follow the Chinese pattern. Foreign policy will continue to be challenging. North Korea has in South Korea a U.S.-backed, and often hostile, southern neighbour; relations between the two Koreas worsened following the sinking of a South Korean warship in the Yellow Sea in March. Imminent U.S.-South Korean anti-submarine exercises will not help. The nuclear issue remains on the agenda. Kim Jong-il, who has stood up to U.S threats and pressures especially on this issue, may not disappear any time soon — and Pyongyang's secretiveness and extreme caution over changes in policy laid down at the time of Kim Il-Sung are likely to continue.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-Dear-Enigmatic-Leader/article15767788.ece
5,10,2010,Getting social,"If the Internet challenged information hierarchies with generativity — defined as the capacity of unrelated and unaccredited audiences to create and share content and code — social networking has set off the next wave of innovation. A constantly expanding web of people-to-people connections now exists, and it has profound implications for democracy. To Clay Shirky, author of the influential book Cognitive Surplus, and several other scholars, social media services such as Facebook and Twitter are making history. People are not merely connected to websites now, they have linked-up and are holding discussions. As governments recognise, it is not easy to confine information exchange to national borders. Citizens using mobile phones send out text messages, photos, and videos to friends and followers in far corners of the world on natural disasters, corrupt regimes, and anything else that interests them. In some cases, they provide the first report to newspapers and television stations, even governments, of extraordinary domestic events; lies are also quickly exposed. So convivial is the medium that despite privacy concerns, the membership of six-year-old Facebook, arguably the best-known face of social networking today, is 500 million plus. India, with some 15 million members and high mobile phone penetration, is sufficiently promising for Facebook to open an office in the country.
But can social networking websites usher in a revolution that goes beyond expressions of solidarity with friends and acquaintances? Mark Zuckerberg, the youthful and sometimes controversial head of Facebook, spoke some time ago about his aim to start a revolution for advertisers, as people publicise their choices and provide referrals to friends. More significant is the contribution of his forum to different causes. Activists have used it admirably to pursue issues as wide-ranging as cultural policing by Hindutva groups, the arrest of civil rights activist Binayak Sen, help for Darfur refugees, and cancer awareness. Twitter is often credited with doing even better, by quickly sending out crisp 140-character messages around the globe. All this is exciting, but a caveat is in order. Like revolutionary technologies before them, such as the telephone, radio, and television, social media can achieve their full potential only when everyone has easy access to them. Open standards can help build several inter-connected platforms and strengthen social media. It must, however, be underscored that this evolution will depend heavily on the attitude of governments and the telecom networks. They must not erect censorship barriers or violate the principle of net neutrality, which ensures equality of access to all users.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Getting-social/article15768779.ece
5,10,2010,Chávez faces stronger opposition,"President Hugo Chávez's United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) has, as expected, held its majority in the 165-seat National Assembly, winning 96 seats along with its allies. The opposition United Movement for Democracy (MUD) alliance, which boycotted the 2005 general election and was led this time by Ramón Guillermo Aveledo, put up a decent fight, taking 64 seats. The single-chamber Assembly, which serves a five-year term, is elected by a combination of the proportional closed party list system, a single-member simple majority system, and a plurality multi-member system. The Assembly also has three seats reserved for indigenous peoples, and nominations for these are open to all parties. The main political outcome of the election is that the ruling party has lost its earlier two-thirds majority. This means the President can no longer appoint judges and get major legislation passed without effective opposition.
The 66 per cent voter turnout reflected the intense interest this election aroused in the region and beyond. Mr. Chávez effectively turned the campaign into a referendum on himself, with blanket coverage on state radio and television and compulsory live broadcasts of his speeches on the private stations. The opposition, for its part, focussed on issues such as rotting food, high crime rates, the quality of public services, and the effects of the recession on the overall economy. It got substantial propaganda support from influential sections of the international media, which have all but replaced Cuba's Fidel Castro with Mr. Chávez as their pet Latin American hate-figure. Secondly, between 2003 and 2008, the United States Agency for International Development increased the number of Venezuelan programmes it funds from 66 to 623, with a total input of $20 million; it has been publicly accused of aiming to remove Mr. Chávez. Thirdly, this year alone has seen $40-50 million channelled to anti-Chávez groups, particularly opposition parties. On the other side, poorer Venezuelans have strongly backed Mr. Chávez, often stating in public opinion polls that he has ended their political exclusion. Like most Latin American voters, they know what it is to be victims of brutal U.S.-backed dictatorships during the Cold War and of the economic destruction visited upon them by international financial institutions in the 1990s. With unemployment down from 15 per cent in 1999 to 8 per cent today, they can also point to substantial improvement in their economic condition. Mr. Chávez and the PSUV face tough challenges but Venezuelan voters have given them a strongly renewed mandate.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Ch%C3%A1vez-faces-stronger-opposition/article15768777.ece
6,10,2010,The real thing,"There is nothing quite like Test cricket. Despite the success enjoyed by the abridged, dumbed-down versions of the game, cricket spread over five long days remains the truest measure of genuine sporting skill. For those who thought it lacked drama and excitement, the first Test between India and Australia at Mohali must have been a revelation. India, the current top team in Tests, and Australia, who dominated all forms of the game not too long ago, fought for every run and every wicket on each of the five days. Fittingly, the match swung this way, and that before reaching a climactic end, with India winning by the narrowest possible margin. If fielding errors influenced the early course of the Test, the final few overs of the match were sheer theatre, with umpiring errors contributing to the excitement of the struggle (on a wearing but far-from-unplayable pitch) between the Indian batsmen and the Australian bowlers and fielders. Two episodes of the endgame captured the essence of the Test. Ishant Sharma, who intelligently partnered an ice-cool, free-stroking V.V.S. Laxman in a remarkable 81-run stand that brought India to 11 runs short of victory, was adjudged leg before wicket by Ian Gould when even the naked eye could see that the ball was missing leg stump. Next, needing 6 runs to win, the Number 11 batsman, Pragyan Ojha, seemed trapped plumb in front by Mitchell Johnson, but umpire Billy Bowden thought otherwise; Ojha set off for a run, was sent back, and was nearly run out by a substitute, whose throw narrowly missed the stumps; with no Australian fielder backing up, the home team earned four runs as a well-deserved bonus.
India's number one status in Tests now looks secure. Although M.S. Dhoni's team is nowhere near the dominance Australia achieved under Steve Waugh, and until recently under Ricky Ponting, India is a deserving champion. A point to note is that this surge was made possible not by the youngsters who have bloomed under Dhoni, but by the priceless old guard of Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, and Laxman. Dravid and Laxman no longer play the limited over formats of the game; and Tendulkar wisely stays away from international T20s, conserving his genius and strength for a higher purpose. As for Test cricket, it can do with some careful induction of technology to minimise the impact of umpiring errors. Making a referral system mandatory will only benefit umpiring, which is a stressful business at the best of times. The Mohali Test had two good umpires in Gould and Bowden but both made mistakes. Thankfully, they seem to have evened out, so neither team has too much cause for complaint. On to Bangalore now where more excitement is guaranteed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-real-thing/article15769883.ece
6,10,2010,Nobel for making test-tube babies,"The wheels of the selection process for the Nobel Prizes can turn in inscrutable ways. This was evident yet again when this year's prize for Physiology or Medicine was awarded to the British biologist Robert G. Edwards for his pioneering role in the development of human in vitro fertilisation (IVF) therapy. He had teamed up with gynaecologist Patrick Steptoe to work out techniques to safely extract eggs from women, fertilise them externally, and implant the tiny embryos back into the womb. As the result of their efforts, the world's first test-tube baby, Louise Brown, was born in July 1978. Some four million more babies have since followed her into this world (thanks to the use of similar methods), giving immense joy to countless infertile couples across the globe. The technique has long since proved its worth. In 2001, Dr. Edwards was given the Lasker Award, which often presages a Nobel Prize. However, according to Christer Höög, a member of the Nobel selection committee, recent follow-up studies that showed that IVF children are as healthy as the normally conceived ones were “a contributing factor” in this year's award. Dr. Edwards, now 85 and in poor health, and Dr. Steptoe, who died in 1988, had to cope with technical hurdles, lack of official support, and much flak in order to achieve their goal. After the U.K. Medical Research Council refused to back their effort in 1971, the duo relied on a private donation to continue. Even after Louise Brown's birth, no governmental support was forthcoming.
But Drs. Edwards and Steptoe were more fortunate than an Indian team led by Dr. Subhas Mukherjee, who developed markedly different IVF techniques. The world's second and India's first test-tube baby was born in Kolkata just 67 days after Louise Brown. But Dr. Mukherjee was prevented from continuing these efforts and could not even publish all the details of his work; he finally committed suicide. As IVF techniques have gained acceptance, much of the scientific controversy that surrounded the early work in this field has subsided. But the widespread use of such methods has created new ethical issues. For example, ‘rent-a-womb tourism' has become a thriving business in India, with wealthy couples from abroad paying poor women large sums of money to carry IVF embryos to full term. Consequently, in a report submitted to the central government in August 2009, the Law Commission of India came out in favour of legislative intervention to legalise altruistic surrogacy arrangements and prohibit commercial ones. As always, government and society must find ways to get the best out of a technology while being vigilant to limit its misuse.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Nobel-for-making-test-tube-babies/article15769884.ece
7,10,2010,Extending the Lula road,"The fact that the Brazilian presidential election will be decided by a runoff brings into focus several key issues facing this emerging economic and political power. The campaign front-runner, Dilma Rousseff of the Worker's Party (PT), was halted by a late surge in the support for Marina Silva of the Green Party (PV); Ms Silva garnered no less than 19 per cent of the vote, leaving Ms Rousseff on 47 per cent and short of an outright win. The first question that arises from this is whether the October 31 runoff will see Ms Silva's supporters back Ms Rousseff or the second-placed Jose Serra of the Social Democrats (PSDB), who polled 33 per cent in the first round. Both are experienced politicians with very different backgrounds. Ms Rousseff is a former left-wing revolutionary who survived torture under the 1970s' dictatorship, has a formidable mind, and has been a career civil servant. Mr. Serra was a regional politician and served as a Minister under President Henrique Cardoso. It is notable that the PT candidate failed to score a clear win despite the backing she received from outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
The eventual winner will have a good starting point, not least because millions have been lifted out of poverty with Lula's Bolsa Familia (family grant) programme of state benefits paid directly to women in the poorest classes. Lula's use of oil revenues for the larger public good has helped in other directions as well. Brazil's current economic growth rate is an impressive 7.5 per cent. This has created higher expectations, for example in respect of the vital public education system, which is widely held to be crucial to the economy and especially to the formerly excluded groups of the poor. As in the case of India, Brazil faces formidable infrastructural challenges. The transport infrastructure especially needs substantial modernisation. The new President is likely to come under international pressure to rely on the private sector for this, and a PT government will put up some resistance to this. Secondly, in the light of the first-round vote, the new President will need to pay more attention to a range of Green concerns and issues and modify development policies accordingly. If Ms Rousseff prevails in the runoff, as she is expected to do, she will not only be Latin America's sixth woman head of state in the last two decades. She will also outrank German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in status. Substantively, she will be a catalyst for women to play a much greater part in all areas of Brazilian public life. The best runoff outcome would therefore be a Rousseff win with Green support.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Extending-the-Lula-road/article15772027.ece
7,10,2010,"“Playful” discovery, profound results","In an era in which the Nobel Prize is awarded mostly to research far removed from the world of touch-and-feel and the familiar, there is, on the face of it, something prosaic about the subject of this year's award. Graphene, for whose discovery the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to researchers Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov of the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom, is something every child who has used the humble pencil may have unwittingly produced. The very method of producing this new two-dimensional crystal, a single layer version of the graphite crystals that constitute the ‘lead' in pencils, using adhesive tape to separate the various layers, reinforces this feel of the familiar. Yet this material has unexpected properties that appear to open the door to an astonishingly varied range of applications, something that have been the subject of intense research since the discovery in 2004. For those whose expectations of cutting edge physics is firmly fixed on the exotic, graphene provides that too, with its one-atom thick structure furnishing a unique table-top setting for the exploration of the relativistic phenomena of the micro-world. “Playfulness,” as the press release from Stockholm noted in an unusual emphasis (a sort of studied departure from gravitas), is one of the hallmarks of the awardees' work. Andre Geim has levitated frogs using magnets, levitation without meditation as a wag observed, as a pedagogical illustration of the phenomenon of diamagnetism. At a more serious level, Geim's research has produced material that, in its ability to adhere to surfaces, mimics the sticking power of geckos' feet.
This playful research though was done on no sandlot but at a university that boasts no fewer than 23 Nobel Prize winners among its past and present faculty, a line that began with the pioneer of atomic and nuclear physics, Ernest Rutherford, in 1907. On a pessimistic note, this suggests that the Mathews effect in science, as the pioneering sociologist of science, Robert Merton, christened it, holds for institutions as well. “For to all those who have more will be given, and they will have an abundance”; success breeds yet more success and later arrivals to scientific competition in the era of the knowledge economy will have to struggle ever harder. The consoling part of the story is that at the individual level, as the record of Geim and Novoselov demonstrates, the credo of making do with what is available combined with creativity and the ability to leave the beaten path still counts — leading from playful discovery to an enduring entry in the record of science.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ldquoPlayfulrdquo-discovery-profound-results/article15770966.ece
7,10,2010,A challenging task,"India's management of the external economy helped a lot in weathering the economic crisis. To a large extent, it is helping in the recovery in the post-crisis period as well. However, certain recent developments, although not threatening economic stability as yet, call for a constant policy vigil and may even warrant active intervention. The rupee has been appreciating in relation to the dollar both in real and nominal terms and that is eroding the competitiveness of exporters and domestic producers competing with imports. For nearly a year now, the Reserve Bank of India has been, rather surprisingly, adopting a hands-off approach in dealing with the strengthening rupee. This policy stance is at variance not only with the central bank's own record of intervening to keep the rupee within reasonable bounds but also with the policies of China and many other countries that are actively holding their currencies from rising so that their competitiveness is retained. This shift has come about without much of a debate. There is a strong case for the RBI articulating its exchange rate policy in far greater detail, particularly because, like the other central banks, it is facing the challenge of dealing with the copious capital inflows, which are flooding the stock markets and contributing to the rupee appreciation.
The Finance Minister has ruled out capital controls for now, and evidently the more traditional method of intervention by the RBI will be expensive, given the volume of flows. Since the last budget, more than $26 billion of capital inflows have come to the capital market, a substantial portion of them in equities. The rupee appreciation is happening at a time when both trade deficit and current account deficit are increasing. According to the RBI, during the first quarter of this year, current account deficit has trebled to $13.7 billion from $4.5 billion a year ago, primarily due to higher merchandise trade deficit and larger payments for certain types of services. The government is banking heavily on faster economic growth to limit the deficit in the current account to around 3 per cent. From all indications, it will be difficult to narrow, or even to contain, the trade deficit. Buoyant industrial activity would in fact result in higher imports. Petroleum prices are hardening. Exporters face infrastructural constraints, besides an adverse exchange rate. It is obvious that, for quite some time, foreign capital flows will be needed to bridge the gap in the balance of payments. The key task before the government is to encourage flows that are of a more permanent nature such as foreign direct investments.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-challenging-task/article15770967.ece
8,10,2010,One crisis to another,"Just when he seemed to have weathered one political crisis, Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa finds himself caught in another. After successfully dealing with the challenge from the ‘Bellary brothers,' he is face-to-face with another revolt, this time featuring independents and new entrants to the party. Last year's crisis, spearheaded by the mining lobby of the Reddy brothers, had more legislators ranged against the Chief Minister, but it was less of a headache for the national leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The demand then was for replacing Mr. Yeddyurappa; and there was no real threat of the legislators walking out of the party. This time the rebels have gone straight to Governor H.R. Bharadwaj and withdrawn support to the government. Whether this is a bargaining ploy will become clear only closer to October 11, when a confidence vote will be taken on the floor of the State Assembly. But unlike last year, the opposition parties, the Congress and the Janata Dal(Secular), are active behind the scenes, and the BJP has little room for manoeuvring the government to safety.
Paradoxically, the crisis is, at least in part, the result of Mr. Yeddyurappa's growing clout within the party and government. The Chief Minister is no longer dependent on the support of the independents for the survival of the government. The BJP national leadership freed his hands for the recent Cabinet reshuffle, allowing him to bring in some of his favourites and weed out some of the detractors. While the independents realised they were being put on notice, those who were left out of the Ministry or were not hopeful of getting plum postings in boards and government undertakings knew they were likely to remain on the sidelines for the rest of the Assembly term. What could be the undoing of this band of rebels is the absence of a common programme or any kind of glue other than narrow self-interest. Whether Mr. Yeddyurappa passes or fails the floor test, Karnataka is set for a spell of political uncertainty. While the dissidents are unlikely to disappear in a hurry, they do not look capable of forming a stable government, not to mention offering an alternative programme of development. The BJP continues to pay the price for opportunistically cobbling together a majority in the Assembly after the 2008 general election with the help of independents, and then carrying out ‘Operation Lotus,' a euphemism for engineering defections from other parties. Karnataka, which has tremendous development potential led by India's internationally admired IT capital, Bangalore, seems set to limp from one political crisis to another till the next general election.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/One-crisis-to-another/article15772028.ece
9,10,2010,Literature Nobel for a world citizen,"The award of the 2010 Nobel Prize for Literature to Mario Vargas Llosa marks the Academy's recognition of one of Latin America's most celebrated authors, one who is not only a great storyteller but also a remarkable essayist, playwright, journalist, cultural commentator, and man of letters. A public intellectual who believes in the necessity of a writer's engagement with the important issues of the day, Mr. Vargas Llosa has been an outspoken political activist, who, like Vaclav Havel, once ran for the office of President in his country, Peru. Although he lost narrowly and later left active politics, his firm belief in the power of the pen to shape politics and culture underlies the bulk of his writing. According to the Nobel citation, he was being honoured “for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt and defeat.” Mr. Vargas Llosa, the first South American writer to win the Nobel since the great Gabriela Garcia Marquez was given the Prize in 1982, has written more than 30 novels, plays, and essays. Among the most acclaimed are Conversation in the Cathedral, The Green House, The Feast of the Goat and the brilliant semi-autobiographical work, Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter. His journalism and critical writings have been compiled into compelling anthologies that reflect what a literary critic calls a “fascination with the human craving for freedom and the liberation conferred by art and imagination.”
Critics have also written of Mr. Vargas Llosa's persistent desire to demonstrate to the reading world “the important place of fiction and literature in the life of nations.” And as he wrote in a magazine essay, “without it, the critical mind, which is the real engine of historical change and the best protector of liberty, would suffer an irreparable loss.” While storytelling is largely the way through which he engages with this world, Mr. Vargas Llosa's concerns are very real; his complex narrative structures and the philosophical underpinnings of the issues he raises are very current, whether it is about the struggles of Peru or of the wider world. His political views, however, changed over the years and he moved from the left to a centrist-right position, campaigning for the presidency of Peru as a proponent of a market economy and free trade. He later left Peru for seven years, explaining in an interview that his ideal was “to become a citizen of the world” and that “if there is for me a fundamental idea of civilisation, it is this.” While his importance in the cultural life of his country has not diminished in any way, in winning the Nobel the writer has obviously achieved his dream of becoming a true world citizen.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Literature-Nobel-for-a-world-citizen/article15773317.ece
9,10,2010,Building smart cities,"Cities have much to gain by adopting Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and must earnestly harness the opportunities they provide, urged the recently held Global Informatisation Forum at the Shanghai World Expo 2010. The forum, hosted by two United Nations agencies and the Shanghai municipal government, spotlighted how cities with the help of ICT can deliver public utilities better, improve mobility, reduce the carbon footprint, and enhance public participation in governance. Existing urban systems are unable to meet the complex demands of their burgeoning number of users. They often fall short of environment standards. Countries such as Malta and Japan have proactively addressed these issues with the help of technology. Malta opted for a smart grid system to manage power supply better. Unlike conventional grids, this bi-directional system allows consumers to get information about their energy use in real time. This enables them to make intelligent choices, regulate their consumption, and become energy-efficient. The utility companies too have optimised their power supply. Tokyo has mobilised technology to help the visually impaired to move freely. The electronic tags and markers placed at strategic places in the city helped the disabled to navigate by using either a portable computing system or special white canes with embedded sensors.
But how do Indian cities fare? The use of technology is often limited to a few municipal functions such as issuing certificates and collecting property tax. Initiatives such as the National Urban Information Systems, which are meant to support urban planning with the help of GIS applications, have not progressed well. Despite the Eleventh Plan stressing the need for using technology to relieve congestion, improve safety, and enhance the productivity of the public transport system, not much has been accomplished. After much delay, efforts to create the first intelligent transport system have begun in Mysore. Cities such as Chennai have put in place a GPS system to inform commuters about bus routes and timings — this however covers only a fraction of the bus fleet. The city mangers must quickly implement existing programmes and scale up the use of technology to improve all urban services. Urban policies often tend to be myopic: to them, building smart cities is about creating special enclaves with enhanced facilities for investment purposes. On the other hand, the experience of successful cities shows that the adoption of technology produces good outcomes when the city as a whole improves and the resulting benefits are shared equitably.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Building-smart-cities/article15773318.ece
10,10,2010,Funding the climate clean-up,"The United Nations climate change talks in Tianjin, China, witnessed some progress on the issue of financing of climate change mitigation and adaptation but there is a significant gap between the level of funding required and what has been committed so far. Fast-paced action on climate financing, including identification of new sources of funds, is essential to bring about an agreement on key issues such as forest protection and aid to vulnerable communities. Only then can a plan for the countries most affected be outlined at the Cancun conference of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change next month. Sustained negotiations on funding can deliver results, since the issue is less contentious than emissions reduction. A modest start was made at Tianjin to identify the modalities for allocation of the $30 billion fund promised for 2012 at last year's Copenhagen conference. Yet the donor countries came up with no big announcement at the Tianjin talks, and failed to convince the least developed and developing nations that they are doing their best. The costs of adapting to climate change in 2010 are estimated by the World Bank to be $100 billion a year. The initiatives outlined clearly fall far short of such sums. Moreover, there is need for clarity on the sources. What is offered should be “new and additional” as outlined in the Copenhagen Accord, and not a reassignment of other development aid.
The Tianjin talks also featured a public dispute between the United States and China on the question of steep emission cuts necessary to meet the goal of the Copenhagen Accord, which is to keep the increase in global temperature below 2° Celsius. There can be little question, as China points out, that the lead should come from the countries historically responsible for accumulated greenhouse gases, led by the U.S. Emerging economies such as China and India can engage in voluntary actions to lower their emissions but it is unrealistic for America or anyone else to expect that these nations enjoying the first fruits of economic growth will accept binding cuts. The way forward is for the industrialised world to cut its emissions unilaterally in the spirit of the Kyoto Protocol, while persuading the newly industrialising countries to reduce the carbon intensity of their growth by liberally sharing technology and providing finance. The good thing is that there is convergence on a major issue such as deforestation, which is estimated to produce more emissions than the transport sector. It is essential, therefore, that a comprehensive REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation+) is formalised at Cancun for implementation post-2012.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Funding-the-climate-clean-up/article15775832.ece
10,10,2010,It's no revelation,"In an interview to Der Spiegel, Pakistan's former military dictator Pervez Musharraf laments that the world blames Pakistan “for everything” and sees it as “a rogue.” Unwittingly, in the same interview, he provides a likely explanation in the admission that Pakistan trained militants to fight in Kashmir in order to force a discussion on the issue with India. The admission is only further confirmation of the well-documented proxy war that the Pakistan has waged in Kashmir. If there is anything surprising about the remarks, it is that the former strongman, who was forced out of the presidency in 2008 by the elected government, should have chosen this moment to spill the beans. Only last month, he launched with much fanfare a political party under his leadership, declaring he would return to his homeland and plunge into active political life. He, of all people, should have known better than to antagonise the Pakistan Army right at the start of a planned new political career. The implications for General Musharraf's political future aside, the statements reveal an alarming inability to connect the dots between Pakistan's policies with regard to militant groups, its unsavoury reputation as a hotbed of terrorism, and the difficult situation in which it finds itself today. Indeed, the ex-dictator's view is that Pakistan has the “right” to promote in this way its interests in the region.
The worrying part is that sections of the Pakistan establishment seem to share the former army chief's belief in this “right.” How else to explain the stubborn refusal to crack down on India-centric militant groups, even after the whole world condemned the horror of the November 2008 Mumbai terror that was traced to the Pakistan-based militant group Laskhar-e-Taiba/Jamat-ud-dawa? As the United States and NATO have realised, there is similar reluctance to take on the Haqqani network of Afghan Taliban militants in North Waziristan, linked to the Pakistan establishment's interests in Afghanistan. The recent battering of Pakistan's north-western tribal regions by U.S. drones is said to be connected to the discovery of a terror plot targeting Europe and indicates the level of international frustration with Rawalpindi's double-games. Pakistan has cried foul at the violation of its territory; the more telling response was the torching of NATO supply trucks en route from the Karachi port to Afghanistan. The mess in which Pakistan finds itself today, and its international reputation, neatly summarised by General Musharraf, show the high price to be paid for using a weapon as dangerous as militancy in the pursuit of strategic interests.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Its-no-revelation/article15775831.ece
10,10,2010,Holding the flock together,"The notice issued by the Speaker of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly to 11 Bharatiya Janata Party legislators, who had joined the revolt against Chief Minister Yeddyurappa and given letters to the Governor withdrawing their support to the government, raises interesting constitutional issues regarding the operation of the anti-defection law. The anti-defection provisions of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution specify two grounds on which a member of the legislature would lose his membership on the ground. The first is “if he has voluntarily given up his membership” of the political party that set him up as a candidate in the election. And secondly, if he votes or abstains from voting “contrary to any direction” issued by the political party. If the members who declared their withdrawal of support were to go ahead and vote against the government when the motion of confidence comes up on Monday, they would clearly incur the disqualification except in the unlikely circumstances of the party either permitting them to vote that way or condoning their vote later. The Speaker's notice to the MLAs has sought their reply by Sunday, even before they would have voted, and the question arises if they would have incurred any disqualification by then.
Desperate governments and obliging Speakers in the past had sought to shore up their prospects through anticipatory disqualification before any voting had taken place, using the provision dealing with a legislator voluntarily giving up the membership of his political party. The question arises as to what would be the type of conduct that would amount to a legislator voluntarily giving up his membership. It is clearly not necessary for the legislator to formally resign but if by his conduct he has obviously severed the link with his party, it can be inferred that he has voluntarily given up his membership. The Supreme Court's decisions on this area are not very specific on what type of conduct could lead to such an inference. On the one hand, it let stand the disqualification of legislators in Goa who, after being elected, had gone with members of another political party to the Governor to express support for the formation of a government with that party. Again, in Bihar, members elected on the ticket of one party to the legislative council were deemed to have given up their membership of the party when they contested elections to Parliament on the ticket of another party. However, in the Bihar Assembly dissolution case, the court held that the Governor could not anticipate that the Lok Janshakti Party legislators who had expressed support for the formation of a Janata Dal(United)-led government would incur disqualification and act on that supposition.
At this stage in Karnataka, the notice seems to be another way of exerting pressure on the legislators who in any case cannot be unaware of the consequences of their revolt. The fluidity of the situation in the State with some members first revolting and then being persuaded to change their minds makes it all the more difficult to assert with certainty that any of the legislators has firmly and finally cut off their links with the BJP. Even after the vote, there is the possibility, however unlikely it might seem now, of the party condoning their vote against the government. It is thus debatable if the dissident BJP legislators can be disqualified at this stage of the unfolding drama. It is also impossible for the Speaker to hold and complete a proper enquiry within just one day before the vote. Any hurried disqualification of legislators on the eve of the confidence motion would be constitutionally suspect, and one would hope the BJP government would not resort to that stratagem even in a situation such as the present. Karnataka can certainly do without a constitutional dispute on top of the political crisis triggered by the quest for ministerial office.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Holding-the-flock-together/article15774712.ece
11,10,2010,A vitiated floor test,"The BJP Government in Karnataka ought to have adhered to higher standards of political morality, and not sought to “win” the floor test in the Legislative Assembly through summary and wholesale disqualifications. Sixteen of the legislators were hurriedly disqualified by the Speaker to enable the government to “win” the confidence vote, with the Assembly strength so reduced. Those disqualified included 11 BJP MLAs who had revolted, and also five independents, who were ironically disqualified for having joined the BJP as associate members soon after the elections. The Yeddyurappa government was formed after an inconclusive election verdict with the support of independents and defectors from the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular), many of whom were rewarded with ministerial offices. The JD(S) and the Congress did not really create the present crisis, though they have sought to use the situation to their advantage. Dissidence manifesting itself in open defiance and attacks on BJP leaders in the State, threats of withdrawing support, and demands for ministerial berths have been a feature of the BJP government since its inception. It has been moving from one crisis to another, with the Reddy brothers representing the mining lobby playing the roles of trouble-makers and trouble-shooters at different times. After giving in to the dissidents the first time round, Mr. Yeddyurappa sought to reassert his authority by dropping some ministers and inducting some others but this attempt has now triggered a major crisis touching on the very survival of the government.
It is a moot question if the BJP legislators in announcing the withdrawal of support to the government could be said to have voluntarily given up their membership of the party and incurred disqualification. On the other hand, in contrast to such anticipatory disqualification, the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution allows a party to condone the action of a legislator voting in defiance of its whip within 15 days after the vote. In an unwarranted move to thwart disqualification before the vote, the Governor had directed the Speaker to maintain the strength of the House as on October 6, but the Speaker chose to ignore the direction. This gubernatorial overreach notwithstanding, the Speaker's hurried and summary disqualification, the unruly protests in the Assembly by the opposition, and the manner of voting have vitiated the floor test which is the constitutionally mandated process to demonstrate the support for a government. Clearly, the motion of confidence will have to be voted upon all over again to establish the legitimacy or otherwise of the government. For this test, the relevant strength of the House will turn on the question of whether the disqualification of the 16 legislators is valid — an issue that is before the Karnataka High Court which can examine if there has been any “violation of the constitutional mandate, mala fides, non-compliance with the rules of natural justice and perversity.” All constitutional players ought to wait for the judicial determination of this question to be followed by a proper floor test. President's rule at this stage would be wholly unwarranted, and the Central government would do well to hold its hand and not accept any recommendation from the Governor for the imposition of President's rule.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-vitiated-floor-test/article15776852.ece
11,10,2010,Counting the disabled,"The Centre is set to enumerate an unprecedented number of disabilities in the February 2011 population count. The move is an advance over the last decennial exercise where this vast and vulnerable segment was enumerated for only the second time since Independence. Information will be sought from persons who suffer multiple impairments. The mentally ill and the mentally retarded are to be counted under separate heads. People can also declare any impairment they may be afflicted with, other than the ones specified. Finally, disability-related queries have been moved up in the questionnaire, enhancing the chances of better reporting and coverage. Contrast this with the official thinking in the past, as reflected in the fact that the first three headcounts in free India did not enumerate the disabled. The reasoning was that given prevailing stereotypes and prejudices, the overwhelming tendency would be for families to conceal rather than disclose the relevant information.
This exclusion should explain, at least in part, the wide discrepancy between official figures and global estimates of the percentage of the disabled in the overall population, and also the government's failure on the policy formulation and resource allocation fronts. The overall benefits from an increasing thrust on data collection on a wide gamut of impairing conditions far outweigh the problems of accuracy and certainty, which is in any case inherent to the census operation as a whole. The advantages cannot be dismissed lightly, especially since disability is known to be both a cause and a consequence of poverty. The issue of age-related impairments is another important dimension in view of the increase in longevity as a consequence of India's unfolding demographic transition. And, one should not lose sight of the innumerable instances of limbs and livelihoods lost owing to prolonged armed conflicts. Come February, the enumerators and voluntary organisations will have their task cut out.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Counting-the-disabled/article15776850.ece
13,10,2010,Magnificent and moving,"The rescue of miners trapped in the bowels of the earth in Chile's San Jose mine in Copiapo has inspired awe and admiration round the world — for the way humanitarian values fused with state-of-the-art technology to score an unparalleled and moving triumph. To keep 33 miners trapped in a gold and copper mine 700 metres under the earth's surface safe and in reasonably good physical and mental health for 69 days was a challenge with few precedents. On Wednesday, the world exulted as 31-year-old Florencio Avalos, who had done wonders for the morale of his comrades, emerged from a special rescue capsule. The workers whose bare-chested images in their sweltering dwelling had become familiar to people worldwide were reborn, thanks to a modern-day secular miracle. Those who were reunited with their families naturally felt that life meant much more to them now. Some wanted more attention devoted to safety. The operation was executed with tremendous preparation, precision, and orderliness, without which there would have been no question of success. There are heart-warming stories such as those of 19-year-old Jimmy Sanchez, the youngest member of the group who preserved himself with thoughts of his two-month-old daughter, and 63-year-old Mario Gomez, who has been working the mines from the age of 12 and was thinking of retiring when the world seemed to come down around him. Happily, they have won their freedom weeks earlier than was thought possible.
There are several lessons in disaster management to be learnt from this heroic rescue. Most important was the commitment of the Chilean authorities led by President Sebastian Pinera in pursuing the complicated rescue plan. Although the government made the ill-advised move to reopen the mine two years ago despite a fatal accident in 2007, it lost no time in seeking international expertise to come up with the capsule-and-winch plan. U.S. expertise in drilling and a NASA-aided design effort for the capsule — appropriately named Phoenix — proved to be a big winner. The grit and determination of the families of the trapped workers, and the trust they sustained in the rescue operation, were crucial factors behind its success. Medical science was intelligently deployed to provide adequate nutrition for those trapped (including a diabetic who was pulled out quite early in the operation) and keep their morale high by ensuring regular exercise. The miners could send up pictures that reassured their families and ensured emotional well-being. A tube to deliver glucose, rehydration tablets, and high-protein and high-calorie food to the miners proved to be a lifeline. Workers in all countries, particularly those risking life and limb in hazardous occupations, will see in the Chilean ordeal hope for change — that in its wake, the world will pay greater attention to worker safety.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Magnificent-and-moving/article15778942.ece
13,10,2010,India in the Security Council,"India's election as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council after a gap of 19 years shows how differently it is perceived by the world compared with 1996, the last time it contested and lost to Japan. Only 42 countries voted for India then. This time there were no other contenders for the Asia seat that Japan vacates at the end of December 2010 but the backing of 187 out of 192 countries for India's entry into the UNSC — only its seventh time since 1946 — speaks for itself. Getting the seat was only a small part of the challenge. The bigger trial lies ahead in the course of the two-year term, when India will be called upon to take positions on crucial global issues of war and peace. As a rising economic power that is seen as a strategic partner of the United States in Asia and routinely juxtaposed against China, India will be critically scrutinised for the stand it takes on the U.S.-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the sanctions and threats against Iran, the Darfur crisis in Sudan, and the Palestine question. Each is a test for the independence of Indian foreign policy. Even though the council is dominated by the P-5, New Delhi must ensure that it makes its voice heard without being seen as anyone's stooge.
For India, this is a timely break to push for the expansion of the UNSC and its own case for permanent membership. As Minister of External Affairs S.M. Krishna has pointed out, the P-5 are not at all enthusiastic about opening their club to others. But the present configuration of the Security Council should help in projecting the argument that the permanent membership needs to reflect the changed realities of the world. Of the Group of Four countries in the forefront of the campaign for U.N. reforms, Japan will soon serve out its term in the UNSC; Brazil was elected last year; and India will take its place alongside Germany. South Africa, a key player in the IBSA grouping of emerging economic powers along with India and Brazil, has been elected. Further, all four countries in BRIC — the grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, and China — are now represented in the UNSC. Amidst these propitious circumstances, a note of caution needs to be sounded: having a burning problem in Kashmir ill serves New Delhi's aspirations of joining the international big league. The good augury is that Pakistan was among the countries that voted for India to take its place in the Security Council.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/India-in-the-Security-Council/article15778908.ece
13,10,2010,Global disharmony,"The recently concluded annual IMF-World Bank meetings of finance ministers and central bankers did not yield a breakthrough in ending or even moderating the intensity of the ongoing currency battles among countries. The result was not unexpected, given the stridently opposite views held by the two main protagonists, the United States and China. China has accused the U.S. of destabilising the emerging economies by flooding their financial markets, including those of Brazil and India, in order to prop up its own domestic demand. The U.S., on the other hand, wanted greater surveillance by the IMF of China's exchange rates and its accumulation of reserves. So far, China has resisted revaluing the Yuan except gradually. Other countries have been forced to actively manage their exchange rate policies to safeguard their interests. Brazil has doubled its tax on certain types of foreign currency inflows. In India, the flood of portfolio money is posing major challenges for the exchange rate policy and macroeconomic management. With countries such as Indonesia and Taiwan taking steps to hold down the value of their currencies, the exchange rate crisis may soon assume critical proportions. Although it might confer short-term advantages, competitive currency depreciation is injurious over the medium term and at the present juncture might choke the nascent global recovery.
The communiqué at the end of the main IMF meeting hinted at greater cooperation in tackling the pressing economic problems of the day. However, there is very little evidence that the world's biggest countries would find common ground to tackle any of the issues that divide them. The mutually injurious currency wars will not end unless a solution is found to the issue of correcting global imbalances in an orderly manner. The severity of the problem notwithstanding, the world's biggest debtor and creditor countries have not been able to make any progress even towards identifying its true dimensions. Cooperation might be lacking also because problems such as those relating to rebalancing of the global economy require a new, special mechanism in the IMF or in the G20. With the economic crisis abating, individual countries probably do not feel the urgency to act. The lack of cooperation is also symptomatic of a major shift in economic power away from the rich countries towards the emerging Asian and Latin American countries. Previous G20 meetings have clearly demonstrated the ascendance of the emerging economies, and the forthcoming meeting at Seoul will see a further consolidation of their position.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Global-disharmony/article15777914.ece
13,10,2010,Toxic threat to the Danube,"The highly toxic red sludge that has reached the famed river Danube after a reservoir holding industrial waste burst in Hungary is a major environmental disaster, exposing major weaknesses in the European Union's environment protection regime. At the MAL Zrt aluminium plant near the Hungarian village of Ajka, 165 km south-west of Budapest, a dam restraining highly toxic red sludge ruptured on October 5 after prolonged rain. Seven villages were inundated; seven people have been killed so far and 150 have been injured. That figure could rise as chemical burns take effect. The sludge is highly alkaline and contains lead; it may also contain the radioactive elements cadmium and cobalt. The sludge is now drying into dust which the wind can carry up to 15 km. The chemicals killed all life in nearby rivers and then entered the Mosoni branch of the 3,020-km Danube. Ominously, further risks of sludge-flooding have emerged. The Hungarian government, having declared a state of emergency in three counties, has evacuated one of the affected villages. Workers are making frenetic efforts to counter its alkalinity, efforts which have been partially successful.
The fact that local groups had been warning of the risks for several years highlights major systemic problems. The EU Environmental Liability Directive, issued in 2004, requires member-states to achieve a common result by a set date; governments have to ensure prevention or remedial action by private or other bodies. A hurdle in this regard is that it is not compulsory for private bodies to obtain insurance for environmental damage, and insurers can reject applications for cover. The Directive excludes natural disasters, thereby creating pressure to describe all environmental damage as naturally-caused. Too much depends on member-states' own will and the quality of their public institutions; the MAL plant, privatised in 1995, had passed an official inspection a fortnight earlier and an internal inspection on the very day the dam ruptured. The key problem however lies in the implications of the “polluter pays” principle, which was incorporated into the European Economic Community Treaty in 1987. This places the burden on the private bodies which, in this case, have not been held to any fixed standard of accountability. It is difficult to envisage any private body willing or being able to redeem large-scale environmental damage. Until the EU devises much stronger environment-protection systems that are more demanding of the private producers responsible for these disasters, more such unfortunate events are bound to happen.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Toxic-threat-to-the-Danube/article15777913.ece
14,10,2010,Safe for now,"If politics were an amoral numbers game, the Yeddyurappa government in Karnataka could draw comfort from winning this round. Yet the passage of the confidence motion in the Assembly by a margin of 106 to 100 has come at considerable cost to its legitimacy and moral standing. The result was brought about, in the first place, by a clever but dubious stratagem of getting the 16 dissident legislators disqualified in a hurry on the eve of the vote. That elected representatives from all parties had to be herded into seclusion and placed beyond the reach of poachers from the other camp speaks to the strength of their conviction and party loyalty — and to the magnitude of the blandishments in this high stakes game. The opposition has not covered itself with glory either, using means more foul than fair to wean away the disgruntled MLAs. The flagrant use of money power by both the BJP and the Janata Dal(S), and the unrestrained bargaining for ministerial berths have combined to take Karnataka politics to a new low. Some measure of uncertainty hangs over the government in that the challenge to the disqualification of the 16 legislators is before the Karnataka High Court. Here the case of the five independent MLAs seems to be on a different footing from that of the BJP legislators who gave a letter to the Governor withdrawing support to the government. As the numbers stand, any relief the court may grant to the five independent MLAs cannot overturn the result. In any case, considering the time it normally takes for the final judicial determination of a case of this type, there does not seem to be an immediate threat to the government.
In this episode, Governor H.R. Bhardwaj has functioned in a blatantly partisan manner unbecoming of the high constitutional office. His initial direction to the Speaker to maintain the strength of the house as on October 6 in order to pre-empt the disqualification of the legislators was wholly out of line. If his recommendation after the sham floor test on Monday to impose President's rule was unwarranted, he was quick to retrace his step and ask the Chief Minister to go through another floor test. What was most shocking, however, was his public accusation of the government of corruption in illegal mining, land grabbing, and land de-notification, which was music to opposition ears. His primary function is that of the head of state acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers with whom he must maintain correct, if not close, relations. His intemperate attack, which demonstrates that he has not got out of a partyman's mindset despite elevation to the Raj Bhavan, has made his position as an impartial and fair constitutional functionary untenable.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Safe-for-now/article15780112.ece
14,10,2010,No. 1 beyond question,"India consolidated its position at the top of Test cricket with the 2-0 win over Australia — its first clean-sweep against that country in a series spanning two or more matches — and in so doing, confirmed the role reversal in world cricket's most absorbing rivalry. For nearly a decade, India was Australia's counterpoint, the contender who helped define the champion's legacy. But as victories in Mohali and Bangalore showed, the challenger has surpassed the champion — who, it must be noted, has slipped from the world-beating standard it set for so long. Ricky Ponting's side contained perhaps the weakest Australian bowling unit ever to visit India. The tourist's batting was vulnerable to reverse-swing and finger-spin, skills India is adept in. The out-cricket, for which Australia is renowned, repeatedly broke down when pressured by the home side. Vitally, the home side mastered its opponent in the battle of wills, a contest Australia seldom loses.
India's triumph was led by its council of elders but encouragingly, its young cricketers played their part with aplomb when called on. While V.V.S. Laxman saved his side from going one-down at Mohali, playing an innings of high art under extreme pressure, Sachin Tendulkar extended his Bradmanesque sequence of run-making in 2010. Where batsmen normally fade as they age, Tendulkar has got better at 37. This year alone, the great man has scored 1270 Test runs with six centuries (two of which were doubles) at an average of 97.69; consider that earlier this year he also became the first batsman to make an ODI double-hundred and it's clear we're witnessing something very special. Zaheer Khan, India's spearhead, played a decisive part in the series win with his penetration with the new ball and his artfulness with the old. Harbhajan Singh didn't reach the heights expected of a major lead-spinner but managed crucial wickets. Although Pragyan Ojha performed creditably as second spinner, India's bowling remains an area of concern; there wasn't a satisfactory audition for the role of Zaheer's new-ball partner. Suresh Raina, Murali Vijay, and Cheteshwar Pujara offered hope that India's batting transition, when it happens, won't be as painful as initially feared. But they require considerate handling. For Australia, Shane Watson and Ben Hilfenhaus impressed, but it was the heroic Ponting, yet to win a Test in India as captain, who most enhanced his reputation. Most significantly, the sides gave the fans a grand, dramatic Test series, showing the classical format at its many-splendoured best. In fulfilling their pledge to the game at a time of desperate need, they did Test cricket the greatest service possible.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/No.-1-beyond-question/article15780111.ece
15,10,2010,"In the event, a success story","Twenty-four hours before the opening ceremony, it looked as though Delhi had made a complete mess of the preparations for the Commonwealth Games. On Thursday, in front of 60,000 spectators, including chief guest President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, when the Commonwealth Games Federation president Michael Fennell declared, “Delhi, you have delivered a truly exceptional Games,” there was justifiable pride among Indians. Despite the shambolic build-up, the Organising Committee (OC) pulled it off in the end, overcoming seemingly insurmountable problems at the eleventh hour — such as repair work on the track at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on the eve of the athletics event — with generous support from the Central and State governments. Some of the venues, the Games Village, and the quality of food served came in for lavish praise from visiting athletes and officials. The transport department, after taking its time to warm up, functioned smoothly. The ‘Games lanes' operated without a hitch and Delhi's notorious traffic snarls seemed to be a figment of the imagination.
The tightest security ever experienced for a sports event in India might have caused some irritation among participants and spectators. But as Mr. Fennell pointed out, there could have been no compromise on this front. Defying predictions, the show went on with clockwork precision even when there were some organisational hiccups. But more than all this, what helped Indians put out of mind the chaos and tragi-comic mishaps witnessed during the run-up to the Games was the nation's unprecedented haul of 101 medals, including 38 gold. Ascent to the No. 2 spot, although a long way behind Australia (74 gold medals), was made possible mainly by the performance of the shooters (led by the versatile Gagan Narang), wrestlers, archers, and boxers. Saina Nehwal's hard-fought win in the badminton final was memorable and so too were the medals sweep in women's discus throw and the triumph of the Indian quartet in the women's 4x400 m relay. These were India's first gold medals in athletics since the legendary Milkha Singh won the 440-yard race in Cardiff in 1958. The major disappointment on the final day was India's debacle in the hockey final; perhaps the Australian stick wielders were keen to avenge the Test series loss suffered by Ricky Ponting's men at Bangalore the previous day. After the CWG success, the idea of bidding for the Olympics is likely to gain some traction. It would be unwise to rush into this venture without cleaning up the Indian Olympic Association and doing a cool appraisal of infrastructural and organisational capabilities and cost.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/In-the-event-a-success-story/article15781430.ece
15,10,2010,The threat of lifestyle diseases,"No longer can it be said that non-communicable diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and risk factors like hypertension, high cholesterol, and obesity are seen only among the urban rich in India. In the past, several localised studies undertaken in rural areas found evidence of an epidemiological transition from communicable to non-communicable diseases. A large-scale study published online recently in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) (“Sociodemographic patterning of non-communicable disease risk factors in rural India: a cross-sectional study,” by Sanjay Kinra et al.) has confirmed this trend. The study involved nearly 2,000 people drawn from 1,600 villages across 18 States. The key finding is that India faces a double whammy. While those belonging to the lower socioeconomic group are underweight, those from the higher strata are obese, diabetic, and have high levels of total cholesterol, bad cholesterol (LDL) or triglycerides, as well as low levels of good cholesterol (HDL). South Indians tend to be obese more than north Indians. One reason for this may be that people in the four southern States show a marked preference for polished rice. Cardiovascular disease and diabetes are currently the most prevalent lifestyle diseases. Considering that the number of people chewing tobacco or smoking bidis is increasing, the incidence of certain cancers linked to these habits is likely to rise in the conceivable future.
The effects of globalisation and urbanisation may be some of the reasons for the increasing numbers of rural folk with non-infectious diseases. Sedentary lifestyles combined with increased intake of calorie-rich food are at the root of many lifestyle diseases. The challenges posed by non-communicable diseases are very different from those by communicable and infectious diseases. Diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and risk factors like hypertension and high cholesterol require prolonged care, unlike the transmittable diseases. The requirements of diagnosis and treatment are also very different. The healthcare system obtaining in rural areas is not equipped to handle these challenges. Making people more aware of lifestyle changes and running educative campaigns against junk food and in favour of healthy food, especially among children and youth, should go some way in stemming the tide. A recent report in The New England Journal of Medicine spotlights the magnitude of the challenge India faces: going by the present trends, it will lose $237 billion over the next decade owing to non-communicable diseases.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-threat-of-lifestyle-diseases/article15781429.ece
18,10,2010,Facing up to Kashmir realities,"Chief Minister Omar Abdullah’s observations in the State Assembly recently on the Kashmir crisis must be appreciated as much for their candour as for the honest acknowledgment that it is essentially a political problem requiring a political solution. His point that Kashmir is a dispute between two neighbours and must be recognised as such has evoked an angry outcry from Opposition parties, which implicitly accused the Chief Minister of pandering to secessionist sentiment. The volatile situation in the Valley is slowly returning to normal thanks to the concerted efforts of the Central and State governments to ease up security measures and to heal the wounds of the recent agitations, by making gestures such as ex-gratia payments to the families of those killed in the disturbances. It is evident that the turbulence has left Mr. Abdullah somewhat chastened and he appears to be hastening to address the core elements of the longstanding dispute over Kashmir’s status in the Indian Union. His observation that Kashmir had not merged with the Union of India but had only acceded to it under an agreement was not just historically accurate; it also provides the key to the concept of a special status for the troubled State. By underlining the fact that while Kashmir had adhered to the Indian Union, it had been promised by the makers of India’s Constitution that the unique circumstances of its accession would be respected, the Chief Minister was building the case for a substantive devolution of powers to the State.
The second important aspect that Mr. Abdullah has not shied away from addressing is that Kashmir is decidedly an issue between India and Pakistan and that this is an inevitable aspect of any process of finding a solution. The Chief Minister’s emphasis on these two points is designed to open up strategic space for negotiations with the other political forces within the State and with Pakistan for a permanent solution that can bring peace to the Kashmir Valley. New Delhi’s approach has been deliberately low key, preferring to let Mr. Abdullah lead from the front. This explains the choice of its three non-political interlocutors who, it is hoped, will open up a dialogue with Kashmir’s civil society as well as politicians. But given that there have been three round tables that served as fact-finding missions, the expectations of the people have been dampened by the prospect of witnessing another low-key fact-finding exercise. It is vitally important to reverse the mood of cynicism and lack of faith in a political solution that is widespread in Kashmir today. Chief Minister Abdullah’s candour and boldness in outlining the key features of the required approach must be welcomed as a constructive basis for substantive negotiations towards a permanent solution.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Facing-up-to-Kashmir-realities/article15783793.ece
18,10,2010,Improved data for policy making,"There have always been concerns over the integrity of official economic data, although lead indicators are now updated more frequently, thanks to the official efforts at complying with the IMF's Special Data Dissemination Standards. But, as some recent instances show, there are big question marks over their accuracy. The index of industrial production (IIP) figures for August indicated a growth rate of just 5.9 per cent, in sharp contrast to the July tally of 15.2 per cent. Such a steep fall could call into question the sustainability of the high growth the country has been registering or some part of the fluctuation could well reflect flaws in data gathering and assessment. This is not the first time that the IIP has fluctuated by such a wide margin over successive months. During April and May 2010, industry grew at a scorching pace, only to fall sharply to 5.8 per cent in June. Going by the numbers, the trend line for industrial growth does not point firmly towards any one trajectory. Also, based on such uneven performance, it will not be possible to extrapolate growth accurately for the whole year.
Besides, there have been frequent and fairly substantial revisions. The July figure was marked up from 13.8 per cent to 15.2 per cent, while that of April was brought down equally sharply. The figures for sub-sectors too have seen inexplicably large fluctuations. For instance, growth in capital goods came down from an unbelievable 63 per cent in July to minus-2.6 per cent in August. Even allowing for some bunching of production, a fluctuation of this magnitude calls into question the very reliability of the IIP data. A GDP growth rate of 9 per cent for this year is said to be within reach. A glaring discrepancy in the GDP data for the first quarter (April-June) was noticed immediately after they were released. At factor cost, the growth was estimated at 8.8 per cent but the number slumped to 3.65 per cent when reckoned at market prices. The error, attributed to the use of wrong deflators, was quickly corrected and GDP growth at market prices is now placed at 10.1 per cent. With India's growth story so keenly watched, it is essential that official statistics do not lose any of their credibility and become more contemporary. Nearly a decade after the National Statistical Commission headed by C. Rangarajan produced a comprehensive report, many of its recommendations still remain unimplemented. Policy-making clearly needs more accurate data than have been available in the recent period.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Improved-data-for-policy-making/article15783791.ece
18,10,2010,Beyond resettlement,"The presence of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was in New Delhi as chief guest at the closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games, gave Prime Minister Manmohan Singh another opportunity to flag the need for a political settlement of the Tamil question and urge the Sri Lankan leader to act decisively in this regard. The resettlement and rehabilitation of Tamils displaced during the war remains an important issue, and the Sri Lankan government did well by attending to this task with the urgency it demanded at the end of the military operations against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. But more than 16 months after that historic military victory, this is not the most difficult challenge before the Sri Lankan government. During this period, President Rajapaksa has won a second term in office. The ruling coalition, which he leads, has also been re-elected; after a few crossovers from the opposition benches, it enjoys a two-thirds support in Parliament. Indeed, Mr. Rajapaksa has already made use of the coalition's parliamentary domination to remove the constitutional two-term bar for a President. As any substantial political package addressing the aspirations of the Tamil and Muslim minorities is likely to require constitutional amendments, the present Parliament offers the best chance in nearly three decades to provide for genuine ethnic reconciliation.
It is true that the political leadership of the Tamil community, such as it is today, is divided on the specifics. However, like most conflict resolution experts, it seems agreed that the best way to resolve the Tamil question is through substantial devolution of power to the Tamil region, going beyond the 13th Amendment, within the framework of a united Sri Lanka. President Rajapaksa is absolutely correct in holding that any political solution to the conflict must be home-grown. He has projected the recently set up Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission as the vehicle for building a consensus among all stakeholders. But the terms of reference of this commission, set up to inquire into events from 2002 until the final stages of the military operations against the LTTE, may be too narrow to form the basis for a solution to a conflict whose roots go back more than five decades. Further, the findings of the All Parties Representative Conference are yet to be made public. All this has given rise to an impression of drift. President Rajapaksa must be aware of these concerns as he gets ready to begin his second presidential term next month. Here is an unprecedented opportunity to turn the page, once and for all, on the country's ethnic dispute. Sri Lanka's powerful leader should seize time by the forelock.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Beyond-resettlement/article15782745.ece
18,10,2010,Fighting hunger,"A timely reality check on public policies in the developing world, the Global Hunger Index 2010, (GHI) released by the International Food Policy Research Institute, reveals the disturbing fact that the number of hungry people in the world hovers around the one-billion mark. Although this year's estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organisation place the figure at 925 million, barely a year ago, at the height of the recession, “the number of undernourished people crossed one billion.” The recent dip notwithstanding, the messages from the GHI are quite discomforting. For one, there is a striking divide between the haves and the have-nots of the world. Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are among the 29 that face either “extremely alarming” or “alarming” levels of hunger. Secondly, glittering economic growth rates do not mean a hunger-free nation; India, with its large economy and robust growth, is ranked among countries that face an “alarming” situation. Thirdly, nothing works like meaningful state-led intervention policies that directly address hunger; Brazil has improved its performance by more than 50 per cent between 1990 and 2010, thanks to effective state intervention.
The GHI rightly identifies the high prevalence of “child under-nutrition as a major contribution to persistent hunger”. Although past policies targeted children under the age of five, it is pointed out that the “window of opportunity” to improve nutrition is much shorter — the period spanning (-)9 months to (+)24 months (from conception to the second birthday). This observation should lead to a reordering of public policies to ensure that this crucial period is not missed out. At a wider level, malnutrition is a consequence of multiple deprivations that call for action on related issues as well. For instance, a study earlier this year by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative showed that while 38.9 per cent of the poor in India were undernourished, they encountered severe deprivations in respect of other critical and related indicators as well: cooking fuel (52.2 per cent), drinking water (12 per cent) and sanitation (49.3 per cent). Malnutrition cannot be tackled effectively as a stand-alone issue and what is needed is a comprehensive policy that addresses multiple deprivations. In addition, there is evidence from Brazil that well-conceived conditional cash transfer schemes help in reducing hunger. India must fine-tune its social sector programmes, including the conditional cash transfer schemes, to wage a successful battle against hunger.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Fighting-hunger/article15782740.ece
19,10,2010,Digging for value,"Coal India's initial public offer (IPO), which opened for public subscription on October 18, is expected to fetch over Rs.15,000 crore, making it by far the largest public offer ever made in India. Coal India is the only Navratna that has remained unlisted, and its entry into the capital market has been welcomed with a rare degree of unanimity by a wide range of analysts and investment bankers. Three of India's credit rating agencies have accorded the highest rating to the offer. The government is divesting a 10 per cent share in the company and, there being no additional share offer by CIL, the entire proceeds from the issue will accrue to it. This IPO will give a pig push to the government's disinvestment programme, and the annual target of Rs.40,000 crore seems achievable. The CIL's success is expected to lead to a flurry of share offerings by other companies, including some leading ones in the public sector. The company's financial performance is extremely impressive. Its profit after tax increased from Rs.6,113.6 crore in 2006 to Rs.9829.4 crore in 2010. As of March 31, 2010, the company's net worth was estimated at Rs.25,843.74 crore. The total debt at Rs.2086.85 crore is a small fraction of its cash and bank balances.
CIL derives its robust financial position from its competitive strengths. The company is the largest coal producer in the world and is well positioned to exploit its reserves, among the largest anywhere. Demand for coal is slated to surge as more coal-based power plants come up. CIL, which boasts a sound track record of growth and cost efficient operations, has demonstrated capabilities in exploration, mine planning, research, and development. The company plans to move up the value chain by increasing its sales of beneficiated and higher quality coal. It has a lot to gain from the reforms that are under way in the pricing of coal. However, it has also to reckon with a number of risk factors. They include extensive regulation at different levels, high compliance costs, and remoteness of mining operations in many cases. Some of its mines are located in politically unstable areas. Environmental concerns have led to the stoppage of mining activities of some other companies. Still, CIL's public offer at a price band of Rs.225-245 per share presents an attractive investment opportunity for most types of investors. Retail investors who had been lukewarm to earlier offerings of government companies are now expected to respond enthusiastically. Overall, it is a healthy development that should at once reduce the budgetary deficit and invigorate the market.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Digging-for-value/article15784886.ece
20,10,2010,Why we need GM labelling,"Our right to know includes the right to know what we eat. We live in a transgenic age, one in which it is no longer sufficient for food labelling to stop with listing such things as nutritional values, chemical additives, and possible allergens. Although there is no evidence that approved genetically modified food is unsafe for human consumption, people have the right to choose not to eat it for ideological, ethical, or other reasons. Informed consumer choice demands that a mechanism for mandatory labelling of GM foods is put in place. In India, the issue assumes significance with the possible commercial release of the country's first transgenic food crop, Bt brinjal, which has been placed under an indefinite, open-ended moratorium. Although Bt cotton, approved for commercialisation in 2002, is not a food crop, it is well known that cotton oil produced from these transgenic plants is used as a cooking medium in many areas. Moreover, the lack of a proper labelling regime has resulted in the import of processed foods made from genetically modified material. At a time when the European Union and countries such as Australia, Japan, and China have mandatory labelling requirements of GM foods, which require food processors, retailers, and sometimes producers to display whether their products contain genetically engineered material, it is strange that India has not enforced a strict labelling regime. This despite the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issuing rules in 2006 to include compulsory GM labelling in the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules 1955.
Not surprisingly, the lobby against the mandatory labelling of GM foods is led by companies such as Monsanto. One of the world's leading transgenic seed producers, it pioneered the beneficial introduction of Bt cotton into India and awaits clearance for Bt brinjal, which it co-developed with the Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Company (Mahyco). Claiming unconvincingly that mandatory labelling would put a huge burden on regulatory agencies, the lobby piously declares it has no objection to voluntary labelling, under which companies would be free to declare their products to be GM-free. Such a voluntary regime is likely to strangulate consumer choice as many companies are likely to prefer staying clear of the attendant risks and liabilities of going in for GM-free certification. Leaving GM labelling to the whims and fancies of food processors, packagers, and retailers would compromise one of the basic principles behind the demand for mandatory certification — offering consumers a clear-cut choice. Anything less than mandatory GM labelling is an unacceptable compromise of the public's right to know what it consumes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Why-we-need-GM-labelling/article15784887.ece
21,10,2010,The Headley saga,"David Headley, the Pakistani-American arrested in Chicago in October 2009 by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for plotting a terrorist attack in Denmark, pleaded guilty earlier this year to charges of involvement in the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. As part of a bargain to avoid a death sentence, in addition to the FBI charges of conspiring to blow up the offices of a Danish newspaper, he pleaded guilty to the charges of scouting terrorist targets in Mumbai during visits to that city, providing material support to the Lashkar-e-Taiba, and aiding and abetting the killing of U.S. citizens in the Mumbai attacks. But a year after his arrest, there are more questions than answers not only about the planning behind the attacks and Headley's links with LeT and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence, but also about his alleged connections with U.S. intelligence agencies. In recent days, information has emerged that two of his three wives told U.S. authorities at different times that the man had links with the LeT and might be planning a terrorist attack. One wife told the FBI as far back as 2005 that he was training with the LeT during his visits to Pakistan and of his boast that he was an American spy. Another wife told an official of the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad in 2007 that Headley's so-called business trips to India seemed to be a front for something more sinister.
Did U.S. intelligence agencies deliberately not act against Headley, as has been alleged, because he was supposed to be their man in the LeT? Or to prevent antagonising the Pakistan security establishment which has known links to the LeT? It is possible that the information from the two women was too vague to be acted upon. That the U.S. warned India of a terrorist strike in Mumbai in 2008 and specifically on the Taj Mahal hotel is known. Did the warnings emanate from the monitoring of ‘agent' Headley? If so, did U.S. authorities have more specific information on the Mumbai attacks? The other disclosure, that Headley told his Indian interrogators of the direct involvement of certain mid-level officials of the ISI in the Mumbai attacks, does not help solve this bewildering jigsaw. Islamabad's reluctance to crack down on the LeT/Jamat-ud-dawa even after the Mumbai attacks showed that the group continues to wield clout. But there is still no evidence to conclude that the Mumbai operation had official Pakistani sanction. The clearest thing that emerges from the Headley saga is that the American and Indian intelligence agencies had several opportunities to avert the Mumbai terror attacks. They missed them.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-Headley-saga/article15786847.ece
21,10,2010,French resistance,"President Nicolas Sarkozy's attempt to reform the French pension system has catalysed fierce public anger over a much wider range of questions than the proposal to raise the retirement age from 60 to 62 and the age of full pension entitlement from 65 to 67, starting in 2018 and 2016 respectively. Six major countrywide demonstrations, with average turnouts of over three million, have already occurred, with remarkably little violence. The public and private sectors have been affected, including public transport, education, postal services, energy, and ports. Now, with refineries blockaded, petrol stations are running dry too. Mr. Sarkozy says he is reforming pensions in order to reduce the budget deficit, currently 7.7 per cent of GDP, but his position is increasingly fragile. He has made several concessions in the draft legislation, even though the Senate has passed the age-related clauses. He has to bear in mind the stinging electoral backlash his Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) suffered in the regional elections in March, when the Left-Green alliance won 23 out of 26 assemblies. Most interestingly, the President's own poll ratings are languishing around 30 per cent while the strikes are getting better than 70 per cent in public support.
The political issues are of worldwide importance. As happens when the French public are really angry, university students and older school pupils have joined in, thereby continuing a national tradition in political education. Other new participants are the residents of poorer and often neglected suburbs. Older citizens resent the contempt shown for their own productivity, which has kept the French economy in better condition than most developed economies during the global crisis. Younger people, the first French generation for nearly 200 years to face a worse future than their parents did, fear for their prospects in the short and long term under a government noted for its arrogance, the brutality of its police, and corruption. In all age groups, there is great bitterness towards the banks, which caused the crisis and continue to make colossal profits after being bailed out by the public. The pension reform will hit the working classes hardest; they have lower life expectancy and can expect shorter retirements than the rich, and now they will have to work for a greater part of their lives. Mr. Sarkozy's project of recreating France in the neoliberal image is crashing around him. Infuriated by his implementation of neoliberal solutions to problems caused by neoliberalism, the people are making France the first major industrial country to pose a direct challenge to the world's dominant orthodoxy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/French-resistance/article15786845.ece
21,10,2010,Landmark achievement,"The first-ever Census of Marine Life (CoML), a mammoth decade-long exercise involving more than 2,700 scientists from over 80 countries, has been successfully completed. The painstaking research has unearthed nearly 250,000 marine species of an estimated one million. About 6,000 new species have also been discovered. The landmark exercise marks a remarkable beginning in identifying and mapping the diversity, distribution, and abundance of marine organisms. Though long-distance migration of many predators like tuna and sharks was tracked, large areas of the oceans, mainly the Indian Ocean, have not been fully explored. While ten marine hotspots were identified, including one in the Indian Ocean, many biodiversity hotspots await detailed investigation. This is because the oceans cover 75 per cent of the earth’s surface, and investigating their surface and depths requires tremendous scientific expertise and huge investments. The good news is that even though the census has been completed, several national and regional initiatives started during the CoML programme will continue to operate with support from government and non-government agencies. Unlike other major projects such as the mapping of the human genome, the scope of this study is undefined. Thus the CoML provides an ideal platform for incorporating diverse inputs from future studies to help us understand the big picture. It will also serve as the baseline for evaluating the future impact of human intervention on sea animals.
The CoML facilitated the use of diverse technologies on a large scale, technologies that are of continuing use. For instance, there are special sonar devices which allow us to see how marine life assemble in schools and move both vertically and laterally over thousands of square kilometres. Thanks to the use of modern techniques, scientists were also able to have a glimpse of the hitherto unknown world of marine animals. One finding of the study which is a cause for concern is that the fate of many animals living in easily accessible habitats appears gloomy. Large fishes and marine mammals like sea turtles and tuna have declined by 90 per cent on an average due to over-fishing and/or pollution. Apart from being an invaluable source of food, the oceans produce 70 per cent of oxygen present in the atmosphere, and also absorb one-third of global carbon dioxide emissions. All these are warning signs that oceans, the lifeline for all things living on earth, may well turn into a watery grave if damage to marine life continues unabated.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Landmark-achievement/article15786019.ece
21,10,2010,Rescuing biodiversity,"Homo sapiens may not have been responsible for the five distinct spasms of extinctions in geological time that began an estimated 440 million years ago, but humans are centrally implicated in the ongoing sixth wave of severe biodiversity loss. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was drafted in 1992 to stem the decline. It entered into force a year later with the avowed aim of significantly reducing loss of species and even using them where compatible to alleviate poverty. But nearly two decades later, the treaty has largely failed to meet its targets. There is now another opportunity available to make it work. The parties to the CBD are holding their 10th conference in the Japanese city of Nagoya and with sufficient political will they can reverse the tide of species losses. The member-countries have done well to acknowledge the all-round disappointment that their renewed commitment made in 2002 to reduce biodiversity loss remains a dead letter. They are now challenged to deliver on their assurances and act more intelligently on climate change, habitat loss and degradation, excessive exploitation, spread of invasive alien species, and pollution, all of which affect plant and animal survival. What provides some hope is the persistence of a large amount of biological diversity.
The key to conservation is to recognise the role of nature in providing ecosystem goods such as fodder, fibre, genetic resources, fresh water, and services such as cleansing of air, nutrient flow, erosion prevention, flood control, pollination, and disease regulation. That this economic dimension of nature is being increasingly accepted the world over is heartening. At the Nagoya conference, the Group of 77 and China have made the forward-looking suggestion that countries of the South should forge closer cooperation to protect biodiversity, and use financial resources available from developed-country partners. In particular, fast-developing China’s focus on protecting 35 priority conservation areas making up 23 per cent of the country is extremely promising. India is also focussed on growth, but it needs to do more for ecosystems facing the onslaught of poorly planned development. It must begin by showing genuine recognition of nature’s value. National development policy cannot afford to ignore the central role played by biodiversity. At the global level, the CBD has the opportunity once again to arrive at a consensus on sustainable use of plant diversity. Such an agreement will help local communities access and benefit from use of invaluable genetic resources. The ethical imperative to save the world’s species is to restrict consumption of all natural resources to a sustainable level and allow for natural renewal.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Rescuing-biodiversity/article15786066.ece
22,10,2010,Rising tide of intolerance,"Anyone remotely familiar with the Shiv Sena knows that it routinely attempts to thrust itself in the public eye by protesting stridently, and sometimes violently, against the contents of books, films, and paintings. However, its recent campaign against Rohinton Mistry's Such A Long Journey — which resulted in the Man Booker Prize-shortlisted novel being withdrawn from Mumbai University's curriculum — has raised the question: Why did the Shiv Sena suddenly decide to target a work of fiction published two decades ago, which has been a part of the university's B.A. English literature syllabus for the last four years? The answer is this is in honour of Aditya Thackeray, recently inducted into politics by grandfather Bal Thackeray and appointed head of the Yuva Sena. The new youth wing chief and his party have argued that parts of this finely crafted, socio-politically sensitive novel — which is set in the early 1970s and revolves around a middle-aged Parsi bank clerk struggling to stay out of poverty — are offensive to the Shiv Sena and Marathi manoos. Such expressions of simulated hurt sentiment were used to justify the Sena's campaign of intimidation, which included burning the book on campus. Even more cynically, they were used to provide a platform for the young Mr. Thackeray to make a dramatic entry into politics.
Books have been banned before by governments on account of threats but it is unusual for a university to capitulate as meekly as Mumbai University did. Following the protest, the matter was referred to the Board of Studies, which recommended withdrawing the book from the syllabus — a decision Vice-Chancellor Rajan Welukar, who echoed some of the Sena's views about the novel, seemed tacitly to endorse. It is shameful that instead of standing up to political intimidation and preventing book-burners from influencing the curriculum, a reputed institution of higher learning cravenly abdicated its responsibility to foster and protect intellectual freedom, critical thinking, and creativity. Not surprisingly, Mr. Welukar and the university authorities have come in for strong criticism in Mumbai's academic circles. Another distasteful aspect of this episode is the stance of Maharashtra's Congress Chief Minister Ashok Chavan. Agreeing readily with the Sena that the novel contained abusive language, he has chosen to distance himself from the withdrawal issue — saying it was for the university to decide. In fact, the complicit attitudes of Maharashtra's major political parties only legitimise and strengthen the Sena's intolerance as it attempts to erode the shores that protect freedom of thought and expression in India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Rising-tide-of-intolerance/article15788217.ece
22,10,2010,Limits to monetary policy,"Policymakers in the United States and a few other developed countries are running out of options to deal with their economic situation characterised by weak growth and high levels of unemployment. Nowhere else is the dilemma so acute as in the U.S. The lacklustre economic recovery has not created jobs. In the midst of an important election season, unemployment has become a highly emotive issue.The attempts to discourage outsourcing of jobs and impose restrictions on visas for technical professionals from India and other countries are all examples of a changing policy mindset. It is likely that some or all of these will be toned down once economic recovery starts delivering jobs. But the right mix of monetary and fiscal policies has been elusive so far. Last week the U.S Federal Reserve seemed to have reached the limits of its conventional monetary policy. With short-term interest rates — which central banks the world over rely upon — already at near-zero levels, non-conventional tools will have to be resorted to. The expectation is that the Federal Reserve will start buying up treasury bonds to push down long-term interest rates. That would weaken the dollar, increasing the competitiveness of exports and cutting imports. The overriding objective will be to head off deflation such as the one that has stalled Japan since the 1990s.
When it begins buying up the securities of the government, the Federal Reserve will not be the only central bank to do so. The Bank of Japan announced recently that it had purchased a small amount of long-term government paper. If the U.S. resorts to quantitative easing, that will have several unintended consequences for the rest of the world as well. Already its ultra-soft monetary policy has flooded emerging markets with cheap dollars, posing major policy challenges to their governments. The latest move will add to the liquidity. With rates at historic low levels, any meaningful monetary intervention will have to be very large. Not all the intended beneficial effects of such unorthodox intervention will accrue automatically. For instance, though having access to funds, banks may not be willing to lend during the current weak phase of economic recovery. Besides, in a situation of weak consumer demand, companies might use the money to shore up their finances through devices such as share-buybacks rather than invest them. All these reinforce the view that monetary policy will work best only in conjunction with fiscal policies. Given the strong political opposition, one will have to wait until the elections are over for the U.S. government to announce major fiscal initiatives in areas such as infrastructure and non-conventional energy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Limits-to-monetary-policy/article15788216.ece
25,10,2010,A single solution,"After months of public and internal debate, the National Advisory Council (NAC) — an organisation whose clout and significance derive from the fact that Sonia Gandhi chairs it — has put forth a set of recommendations for the National Food Security Act. The core recommendations are to provide legal entitlements to cereals for 75 per cent of India's population, that is, 90 per cent of the rural population and the poorest 50 per cent of the urban population. The entitled population is to be divided into two groups: priority and general households (the new terms for the discredited “BPL/APL” categories.) This differentiation is left to the central government; the methods of such division have, in the past, been shown to be arbitrary, unjust, and wrong. The priority group is to be entitled to 35 kg of cereals a month at low prices (Rs.3 for a kilo of rice, Rs.2 for wheat, and Re.1 for millet). The general group is to be entitled to 20 kg of cereals a month at no more than 50 per cent of the Minimum Support Price, which is to say around Rs. 5.50 to Rs.6 per kg at current prices. These proposals are new in that they offer a legal entitlement to around 75 per cent of the population (though there is a precedent in Kerala, where statutory rationing was in force for over 30 years from 1966, in that the central government was committed to ensuring adequate grain for a near-universal PDS).
The NAC has missed a historic opportunity to introduce a universal system, as demanded by all progressive sections of the polity, as recommended by the National Commission on Farmers, and as implemented by a couple of State governments. This newspaper has consistently advocated a universal PDS. Why universal? Both theory and experience demonstrate that the only way for India to ensure that no needy person is excluded from the public distribution system (PDS) is by providing universal benefits. In practice, a universal programme is one that covers all, but whose beneficiaries are self-selected. In this respect, there are lessons from Kerala (before targeting was introduced) and Tamil Nadu today. In Kerala before targeting, the PDS was universal but utilisation was progressive; according to one study, while households with monthly income of less than Rs.100 bought 71 per cent of entitlements, those with more than Rs.3,000 per month bought only 6 per cent. In Tamil Nadu today, there is an option for households voluntarily to withdraw completely or restrict their purchases to sugar and kerosene. In both these States, there has been political commitment to a universal and well-functioning PDS. There is a single — and conceptually uncomplicated — solution to the problem of mass food insecurity in India: a universal entitlement to cereals and other basic components of a food basket.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-single-solution/article15792119.ece
25,10,2010,Abolish the death penalty,"Britain's campaign to see capital punishment abolished globally and its pledge to exercise moral leadership on this issue reflects a long standing philosophical commitment to this doctrine. The United Kingdom’s strategy highlighted by the British Foreign Office, through its embassies worldwide on the “World Day Against the Death Penalty” (October 10), draws upon its own record of abolition since 1965. Britain is working towards a a global moratorium on executions by 2015. The key objectives of the policy are the protection of British citizens overseas facing the death sentence, extradition of accused persons to countries without the risk of execution, and exerting influence on third parties to refrain from carrying out sentences in important cases. Accordingly, the strategy is to get the hardline states to reduce the number of offences that attract this penalty, while encouraging incremental steps towards a total abolition. These include refraining from executing juveniles, pregnant women and the insane, besides guaranteeing the right to fair trial, appeal, and seek a pardon or commutation. In addition, pressure will be mounted on the United Nations for getting another resolution passed by the General Assembly on global moratorium.
The results so far speak for themselves. Over the past decade, 22 countries have scrapped this ultimate punishment with the number of abolitionist states now standing at 95 including the entire European continent except Belarus. Retentionist countries are down to 58, but impressive changes have been recorded here too. In China, the Supreme People’s Court now requires this harshest penalty to be issued only in extreme cases, and death by firing squads is soon to be replaced by lethal injection. In the United States, the Supreme Court is to rule on the constitutionality of lethal injection in the context of the 8th Amendment. Some 35 countries have imposed a moratorium on executions. Russia represents an outstanding example; the constitutional court having indefinitely extended in 2009 the freeze on carrying out sentences. As for India, a declaration of a moratorium would be a realistic next step after the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in 1980 that a death sentence can be given only if the alternative of a life sentence is unquestionably foreclosed. Vigorous steps need to be taken to lay out a global consensus on the elimination of the death penalty from the statute books of nations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Abolish-the-death-penalty/article15792118.ece
25,10,2010,Endless fascination,"Humankind has long been fascinated by the moon. With the dawn of the space age, scientists were in a position to try and wrest secrets that our celestial neighbour might hold. Although the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union was primarily about demonstrating their strategic superiority, the samples of lunar rock and soil brought back by American astronauts and subsequently by the Soviet unmanned spacecraft were invaluable. Scientists had conjectured that the moon might hold water. But the lunar samples, when analysed on earth, suggested otherwise. However, two U.S. spacecraft that travelled to the moon in the 1990s found indications that water in the form of ice lay trapped in the icy cold depths of permanently shadowed lunar craters. These findings were contested and it was India's Chandrayaan-1, the country's first space probe launched two years ago, that finally provided a persuasive case for water on the moon. The matter has now been decisively settled by the U.S. Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite. The latter mission sent a spent rocket upper stage crashing into a crater on the moon's South Pole a year ago, while a spacecraft that came right behind made observations of the debris that was thrown up. In papers that have just been published in the journal Science, scientists involved in the mission say that the plume of debris contained as much as five per cent of its weight, possibly more, in the form of water-ice. A number of other molecules and elements were also detected in the dust kicked up by the crash.
Water is a valuable resource that can help sustain any future lunar base. The hope is that water extracted from the moon can be used for human consumption and possibly as a source of rocket fuel. The last humans who walked on the moon returned home almost 40 years ago and many more years could pass before humans go back again. The current U.S. Administration has cancelled much of the Constellation programme, which aimed to send humans again by 2020. China, on the other hand, is embarking on an ambitious programme of lunar exploration. Its second lunar probe, the Chang'e-2, has begun orbiting the moon. This spacecraft will set the stage for a mission to land a robotic rover in 2013. The country also plans to send an automated sample-return mission four years later. China, which has successfully sent six astronauts into space, could attempt a manned moon landing in 2025, according to one of its senior space scientists. India, for its part, intends to launch the Chandrayaan-2 mission in 2013; it will have an orbiter studying the moon from space while a Russian-built lander puts a rover on the ground below. Thus humanity's quest to understand the moon goes on.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Endless-fascination/article15790954.ece
25,10,2010,Merkel divides Germany,"Chancellor Angela Merkel has exacerbated an already fraught debate by saying German multiculturalism has failed and German workers cannot live “happily side by side” with foreign workers. Yet she said in the same speech to the youth wing of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party that Islam is now part of Germany and that immigrants are welcome there. Ms Merkel’s intriguing comments are in keeping with remarks by Horst Seehofer, the Christian Social Union (CSU) premier of Bavaria, that immigrants from Turkey and Arabic countries have more difficulty integrating than other settlers and that Germany must end immigration from other cultures. These statements follow a book by the ex-central banker Thilo Sarrazin, which, among other things, accuses Turkish and Arabic communities in Germany of widespread criminality and of dumbing down the German education system. The arguments have grown so heated that German president Christian Wulff and Turkish president Abdullah Gül have intervened, the former saying that Turkish immigrants belong to Germany and the latter that they must attempt to integrate.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Merkel-divides-Germany/article15790953.ece
26,10,2010,'Sedition' versus free speech,"It is deplorable that three sentences uttered at a seminar relating to the status of Kashmir within India should have evoked such zealous hyper-patriotic anger and resulted in demands for invoking harsh sedition laws. Writer and social activist Arundhati Roy has strong views on the strife-torn and troubled Valley, which many may disagree with, or regard as extremely contentious. But what possible justification can there be — as the Bharatiya Janata Party has outrageously demanded — for slapping a case against her under Section 124 (A) of the Indian Penal Code, for exciting “disaffection” towards or bringing “hatred or contempt” against the government? Do we lock up or threaten to silence our writers and thinkers with an archaic section of the law that carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, merely because they speak their minds? Why is it criminal to suggest that Kashmir's status in India is not settled despite the accession? Aren't so many others in Jammu and Kashmir saying as much? Didn't Chief Minister Omar Abdullah recently remark that the State had only acceded to, and not merged with, the Indian Union? The central government would do well publicly to make a stand and deny reports that it is considering pressing sedition charges against Ms Roy and Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who addressed the same seminar. Courts too must apply their mind and refuse to entertain frivolous and vexatious petitions that make such outrageous allegations.
In his classic defence of free speech, On Liberty, John Stuart Mill laid down what is known as the ‘harm principle.' It postulates that the only justification for silencing a person against his will is to prevent him from causing harm to others. It is to this powerful libertarian mid-19th century principle that we owe the idea that free speech cannot be proscribed merely because we find it disagreeable, and that curbs may be imposed only if such expression constitutes a direct, explicit, and unequivocal incitement to violence. There is no such nexus in Ms Roy's statements on Kashmir, which are shaped around the theme of gross human rights violations and (as she points out in a statement: ""Pity the Nation that has to silence its writers"" ) “fundamentally a call for justice.” It is tragi-comic that there is talk of ‘sedition' at a time when it is regarded as obsolete in many countries. Courts have ruled that laws that aim to punish people for bringing a government into hatred or contempt are frighteningly broad and risk being used to suppress radical political views. In Britain, the last completed trial in a sedition case dates back to 1947. In the United States, Supreme Court rulings have rendered toothless the most recent sedition law, the Smith Act enacted in 1940. The controversy over Ms Roy's remarks is essentially much ado about nothing.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Sedition-versus-free-speech/article13673138.ece
26,10,2010,Mixed signals ahead of Seoul,"In what seems to be a foretaste of things to come, there were more signs of discord than accord at the meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the G20 countries. In the run-up to the Seoul summit, the meeting at the South Korean city of Gyeongju was expected to yield a reasonable formulation for the political leaders of the world's leading economies to build upon. The imbroglio over currency rates has become the most pressing issue of the day but there have been related issues such as reform of the IMF. It was agreed to evolve a broad framework to contain current account deficits and surpluses but a proposal to set specific targets ran into opposition. The proposal, mooted by the U.S. Treasury Secretary, seeks to shift the focus away from exchange rates, which after all are only a manifestation of the much larger problem of global imbalances. Besides, adjusting exchange rates is just one method — and, in the present circumstances, not even the preferred method — of tackling the underlying problem. It will be politically more appealing especially for the two principal protagonists, the U.S. and China, to seek remedies through current accounts rather than through exchange rates. The big advantage is neither side need appear to concede too much. On the flip side, there is the problem of setting caps on deficits and surpluses and, more importantly, working out a mechanism to monitor individual countries. Previous attempts to impose tougher IMF surveillance of current account imbalances achieved very little.
On a more positive note, the meet resulted in what is seen as a landmark reform of the IMF. Developing countries such as China and India are to get a bigger voice reflecting their rise in the global economic hierarchy. European countries will cede two of their eight seats on the IMF board in favour of the emerging powers and over 6 per cent of the IMF voting power will be transferred to the currently under-represented countries. It was also decided to double the IMF's $340 billion quota, considerably augmenting its resources to cope with future financial crises. India along with Russia, China and Brazil will be included in the IMF's top ten shareholders. The IMF and several countries have hailed this agreement as historic, one which will overhaul the Fund's outdated governance structure. The agreement on IMF reform is a shot in the arm for the G20, which, on the eve of the Seoul meet, seems less cohesive than it was at the height of the global economic crisis.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mixed-signals-ahead-of-Seoul/article15793243.ece
28,10,2010,The ‘enemy' property law,"More than 60 years after Partition, that cataclysmic event continues to influence ordinary lives in extraordinary ways. The Enemy Property Act of 1968 is part of the cumulative legacy of 1947 that the government would have done well to settle long before it got entangled in a web of law suits and communally inspired fears. The legislation, which came in the wake of the 1965 India-Pakistan war, relates to properties that were left behind by those who migrated to Pakistan at the time of Independence and after. Labelling these as “enemy property,” the retrogressive Act gave the government control over these properties, numbering over 2,000, mostly in Uttar Pradesh. It barred Indian Muslim citizens who claimed to be the legal and rightful heirs of the original owners from inheriting those properties. A belated attempt is now being made to set right this historical wrong. Recently, after a series of missteps, the government approved amendments to the 1968 Act, to be introduced in the winter session of Parliament, entitling the legal heirs to inherit the properties provided they are Indian citizens and their suits were settled in court before July 2, 2010. However, the Enemy Property (Amendment and Validation) Second Bill 2010, if approved by Parliament, will resolve the issue only partially. While Mohammed Amir Khan, son of the Raja of Mahmudabad, will be the single biggest beneficiary, having legally won his claim to more than 1,000 listed properties in the Supreme Court in 2005 — the ruling forced the hands of the government to come up with the amendments — the cut-off date leaves out those whose suits are pending in the courts. This category includes many rightful claimants.
Also left out are those who did not have the means for lengthy legal battles. Another complication relates to the rights of those in occupation of the properties that will be returned to the rightful claimants under the proposed changes. It is deplorable that the Bharatiya Janata Party describes the proposed amendments as “minority appeasement.” The issue is simple: the property rights of a section of Indian citizens were wrongly taken away and a limited attempt is now being made to restore them. In fact, the government should have boldly taken this opportunity to change the very name of the Act, which not only projects a wrongful image of Indian Muslims, but also implicitly carries the suggestion that all Pakistanis are enemies of India. As the “enemy properties” were left behind by migrants to Pakistan, not during a war but due to the exigencies of Partition, there was never any justification for the name then or now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-lsquoenemy-property-law/article15794296.ece
28,10,2010,More Iraq lies exposed,"The United States and other military logs from Iraq, recently made public by the Wikileaks website, number almost 400,000 and include aircraft cockpit videos. They form a detailed chronicle of systematic abuse, torture, and concealment on the part of the invading forces and their Iraqi counterparts. The documents, covering the period 2004-09, make nonsense of the claims made by politicians and military commanders about the way the invasion and occupation have been conducted. First, the admitted tally of deaths is shockingly off the mark. The U.S. military and British Ministers have said they do not keep figures, but the documents show otherwise. The monitoring group, Iraq Body Count, says the number needs to be increased by about 15,000. The logs record over 109,000 violent deaths in the period they cover, with more than 66,000 civilian victims. In view of the wide range of casualty estimates, these figures need to be seen as conservative. The logs also show beyond doubt that extensive and calculated torture was an integral part of the invaders' strategy. It was carried out by the coalition forces, by the Iraqi forces and police, and by the mercenaries, who emerge as incompetent, out of control, and so vicious that they caused revulsion even among the U.S. military; some of their employing companies have also refused access to investigators.
As for the military, under Fragmentary Order or Frago 242, torture was investigated only when coalition troops were directly involved. This gave Iraqi forces free rein to torture for all manner of reasons, including the sectarian and the personal. The invaders knew how those forces worked; they themselves never stopped torture and random killing, whether by ground or airborne forces; and British forces used sensory deprivation and mental torture as well. The harm done to the victims of the invasion and occupation was incalculable. The media bodies which have edited the logs for publication, such as the Guardian and Der Spiegel International, have taken care not to endanger those still involved, but the official reactions to the leaks are not credible. None of the governments or commanders concerned did anything to end the culture of brutality; official reports repeatedly dismissed the complaints of victims who survived. The governments that planned the invasion claimed, with much help from influential sections of the international media, that they were bringing democracy and freedom to Iraq. The truth, as shown by the invaders' own documents, is that the U.S. and its allies created a reign of terror indistinguishable from that of the tyrant they overthrew.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/More-Iraq-lies-exposed/article15794295.ece
30,10,2010,Readying for regime change,"Kerala's voters are known for bringing about a regime change at every available opportunity. Since 1977, when the Congress held on to power in spite of Emergency atrocities, no ruling combination has managed to retain office in this southern State. With the Left Democratic Front led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) taking a beating in the recent local body polls in every tier across the State, the trend of the ruling front making way for the opposition in an Assembly election is set to continue. Whether at the district, block and gram panchayat levels or at the corporation and municipality levels, the LDF was bested by the Congress-led United Democratic Front in the latest elections. Worryingly for the LDF, even those gram panchayats that have traditionally voted Left opted for change this time. In the urban segment, the most significant setback was the loss of the Kochi Corporation which it had ruled for three decades. The victory in Thiruvananthapuram Corporation was by the smallest margin possible, one seat, but the loss in Thrissur was big.
In Kerala elections, victory and defeat in most cases are decided by relatively small margins. But with only six months to go for the Assembly polls, there is not enough time for Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan to take corrective measures. By itself, the anti-incumbency factor is no explanation for voter disenchantment with a government. Indeed, it is a sentiment that is built up over time because of several shortcomings of those at the helm. What is clear is that the electorate has rated the performance of the Achuthanandan government as not good enough. The factionalism within the Kerala unit of the CPI(M) did not help. At times, even the Cabinet gave the impression of a divided house. After starting his term with a groundswell of support, a Chief Minister with a squeaky clean image found himself mired in in-feuding. His government could not live up to the high expectations of the people of a State whose political culture encourages irreverence and a hyper-critical spirit towards those in office. In basic social indicators, Kerala is ahead of the rest of India by some distance and the LDF government did build on this with welfare measures and development projects. However, implementation was a weak point. Sadly, the Left also paid the price for taking on the Church establishments on the secular principle in education and for alienating some Muslim allies. The odds are stacked against the LDF retaining power. If the Lok Sabha election was a warning, the local body polls sealed the political message. A five-year spell in the opposition should be a chastening experience for the Left.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Readying-for-regime-change/article15796972.ece
30,10,2010,Chavez's practical polycentrism,"The Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's ninth visit to Russia since he took office in 1999 does more than strengthen the links between the two countries. These are already strong. Venezuela can benefit from Russian technical know-how, and over the last decade deals have been signed for cooperation in energy, hydrocarbon extraction and refining; now a deal for a nuclear power station has also been signed. In addition, Russia has provided loans for Mr. Chávez to acquire weapons. Venezuela might become the first country to import Sukhoi fighter aircraft, and plans are under way for military factories. Significantly, the visit widens bilateral cooperation to include substantial social projects. President Chávez is keen to provide better housing, hospitals, and schools for those living in the sprawling slums of Caracas; he seeks Russian help for these via a new bank which is to have an office in China as well.
While the planned practical cooperation is important, it is being combined with a larger geopolitical strategy. One of Mr. Chávez aims is to reduce U.S. pre-eminence in Latin America. Despite President Obama's tone, which is significantly different from that of President Bush, towards that continent, he is establishing facts on the ground; he will also be well aware that the U.S. military and security establishment has its own view of Latin American developments. Mr. Chávez's cooperation with Russia also serves two other purposes. First, the expansion of the Russian presence in Venezuela reminds the U.S. of Moscow's justified disquiet over the siting of U.S. missiles in Poland and a radar station in the Czech Republic as well as the presence of U.S. military personnel during recent civil conflicts in Georgia. Secondly, it enables the Venezuelan leader to advance his conception of a multi-polar or polycentric world based on fair and equitable societies, which in his view will serve world peace far better than the dominant conception of technical-military collaboration. This strategy has the backing of the voters, who have recently re-elected the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) with a solid majority in the National Assembly. President Chávez's vision is shared by the Bolivian President Evo Morales, whose main policies have also put energy revenues at the service of the public good. These strategic moves will face considerable opposition; for example, some foreign buyers have sought to source hydrocarbons from Brazil instead of Bolivia, possibly for ideological reasons. The idea of polycentrism is progressive and it must be hoped that Mr. Chávez's plans for it will bear fruit.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Chavezs-practical-polycentrism/article15796971.ece
1,11,2010,Divorce in a trice,"Can ‘talaq' typed thrice in jest by a Muslim man to his wife during an internet chat constitute the termination of their marriage? Yes, infamously decreed the Darul Uloom Deoband, one of Asia's biggest and most influential seminaries, in a recent response to a written question. It was purportedly from a man in Qatar, who sought a clerical opinion on the implication of his jokey behaviour over Skype towards a wife he claimed he loved. The man's motives for, and indeed seriousness in, asking the question of the Darul Uloom in Uttar Pradesh are unclear. But the answer in the form of a fatwa — that his wife has become ‘haraam' and that he has no right to take her back or remarry her without ‘halalaah,' that is, until she marries someone else and divorces him after observing the mandatory ‘iddat' or waiting period — reflects the regressive tendency among a section of the Muslim clergy to support the practice of triple talaq. This arbitrary form of divorce, which gives Muslim men the right to divorce their wives instantaneously by uttering or writing the word ‘talaq' thrice, has no place in a modern democratic society. Significantly, triple talaq or ‘talaq-e-bidah' has no sanction in the Koran, is not accepted by Shia Muslims, and is proscribed explicitly or neutralised by strict restrictions imposed on its practice in many Muslim countries, including Pakistan, Indonesia, Iraq, Turkey, and Tunisia.
For long, progressive Muslim organisations have argued that triple talaq is un-Islamic and campaigned for its abolition. Unfortunately, a section of the ulema and the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) have continued to regard this indefensible practice, which has caused many thousands of women to suffer, as a male entitlement. Six years ago, there were expectations that the AIMPLB, which was in the process of drawing up a model ‘nikahnama' (marriage contract), would recommend abolishing triple talaq. But the document ended up by tamely suggesting that men should not resort to ‘talaq-e-bidah' unless inevitable. Although the Allahabad High Court controversially held triple talaq was unconstitutional in 1994, the judiciary's general approach, from pre-Independence times, has been influenced by the stance that although the custom is ‘bad in theology,' it is unfortunately ‘good in law.' From time to time, Indian courts do adopt a more equitable and gender-sensitive approach while interpreting and deciding legal issues pertaining to Muslim marriage law. But the law itself needs to be reformed — ignoring, if need be, the recalcitrant and reactionary positions staked out by some sections of the clergy and others who claim to speak for the Muslim community.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Divorce-in-a-trice/article15671261.ece
1,11,2010,"Microfinance, macro challenges","It seems incredible that the fortunes of the microfinance industry, especially of the companies at the top, should have changed so drastically in just a matter of months. Though new to organised finance, microfinance has grown rapidly in recent times, particularly in the southern States, with Andhra Pradesh in the lead. With an estimated Rs.22,500 crore lent to some nearly 2.7 crore active borrowers, it has entered the mainstream. Microfinance institutions (MFI) have been active in remote places where commercial banks do not exist. Their claim of providing “the last mile connectivity” and that too to the poorer sections is not without basis and this is extremely relevant in the context of the policy thrust on financial inclusion. In several ways, the MFIs complement the commercial banking system. Banks lend the MFIs the money. Since these loans fall in the priority category, the banks have an additional incentive to lend them. The MFIs have a very good track record of recoveries, having successfully adapted the traditional bank loan documentation model of joint liability for the group. A default by a single borrower impairs the ability of the group to receive credit.
The average size of individual loans of the MFIs is small and the typical rural borrower is one without any security to offer. Yet these have not stood in the way of the MFIs making a commercial success of their activities and earning huge profits. In fact, it is the high level of profits earned by the MFIs and the general lack of transparency that have shown the business in a bad light. In the past, some of the MFIs have justified the high rate of interest on their loans — in the region of 30 per cent — by citing the high costs of funds available to them and the high default risk they have to reckon with. However, the abnormally large profits of the industry leaders and the high monetary rewards accruing to the promoters and senior executives, among other factors, strengthen the case for lowering the lending rates. The Andhra Pradesh government has, through an ordinance, required all the MFIs to register with the district authorities and avoid coercive recovery practices and multiple lending. The RBI has appointed a committee to look into the governance issues. There are reports that Nabard might be asked to regulate the industry. It is obvious that the MFIs face an extremely challenging environment. They should welcome uniform regulation, more transparency in their operations, particularly interest rates, and governance. They are providing a valuable service, and only by being transparent and sprucing up their governance can they acquire legitimacy in the financial mainstream.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Microfinance-macro-challenges/article15671260.ece
2,11,2010,A strategic corrective,"From a donor-recipient relationship centred on Overseas Development Assistance (ODA), India's trade and economic ties with Japan are set to embark on a new phase of wide-ranging bilateral cooperation. Last week, Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and Naoto Kan concluded negotiations and exchanged documents in Tokyo on a bilateral Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. The India-Japan Strategic and Global Partnership, launched in 2006 as part of India's ‘Look East' policy, prepared the ground for this. CEPA, once it comes into force in the first half of 2011 after ratification by the Japanese Diet, is expected to deepen mutual engagement in trade in goods and services, investment, technology, and cooperation. It will also open up new avenues. From the stage of cautious joint venture collaboration in Maruti Udyog in the 1980s, economic ties with Japanese companies have come a long way. Nevertheless, India's trade with the world's second largest economic and technological powerhouse has remained virtually stagnant over the past two decades. Japan is ranked tenth among India's export destinations and sixth among the country's major investors. Perhaps owing to a system of over-cautious decision-making, Japanese companies seemed to lose out to their South Korean counterparts in major sectors such as electronics and automobiles — areas in which Japan once dominated on a global scale.
CEPA should be seen as part of a strategic corrective aimed at strengthening the capabilities of both Asian giants, especially in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and the consequent slowdown and rise of protectionism in the west. India's success in the auto sector has shown that its manufacturing capabilities are up to world standards, as are the capabilities of its software and IT-enabled services. CEPA can help catalyse the advantages of Japanese technology and India's labour cost advantage to emerge as major partners in a slew of sectors such as auto, healthcare and drugs, apparel, farm products and allied machinery on top of increased trade in goods as a result of reduced tariffs on more than 8,000 products. The real stumbling block is India's lack of quality infrastructure across the country. Perhaps aware of this drawback, Japan has been channelling its ODA to development of infrastructure in a major way. Japanese investments already have a major share in the development of freight corridors, apart from Delhi Metro which is regarded as an unqualified success in urban transportation. Tokyo has wisely shown special interest in developing freight corridors in the southern States and building other infrastructure to exploit the hitherto untapped potential for cooperation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-strategic-corrective/article15672370.ece
2,11,2010,Origins of plant life,"Evidence collected from western Argentina samples shows that land plants (Embryophytes), which played a critical role in changing the global climate and in the evolution of multicellular life, had established themselves on the dry parts of the globe about 8-12 million years earlier than previously thought. A paper in the New Phytologist journal (“Early Middle Ordovician evidence for land plants in Argentina, eastern Gondwana” by C.V. Rubinstein et al) reports that spores representing five genera were found in samples recovered from western Argentina. The spores belong to liverworts (cryptospores), the basal group of land plants that still exist and are 473-471 million years old. Similar evidence from 463-461-million-year-old land plants came from liverwort spores recovered from Saudi Arabia and the Czech Republic. The latest evidence from Argentina indicates that terrestrial plants had already diversified as early as 473-471 million years ago. Thus the most remarkable chapter in the earth's history: the invasion of the land by plants had probably taken place during the Cambrian period, millions of years earlier than what the fossil record currently reveals. The study reaffirms the assumption that land plants had evolved in the eastern parts of the supercontinent Gondwana before the continents split millions of years ago and moved to their present positions.
The possibility of plant terrestrialisation at multiple locations at almost the same geological time appears quite unlikely. But the possibility of long-range dispersal of spores from western Argentina to Saudi Arabia and the Czech Republic in a span of 8-12 million years cannot be completely ruled out. In fact, present day western Argentina and Saudi Arabia and the Czech Republic were located in the same latitude (35° S) 470 million years ago. The spores, in turn, were also equipped for long-range dispersal, both in aerial and aquatic environments. After all, the outer cell wall of liverwort spores is covered by sporpollenin, the most resistant polymer known to man. The coating protects the spores from abrasion, ultraviolet light, desiccation and micro-organism attack. That scientists could extract the spores from samples by dissolving the rocks in acid indicates the spores' ability to withstand chemical action. After all, such protection was necessary to survive in the harsh aerial conditions that prevailed at that time. Early land plants lacked lignified tissues that enable plant fossilisation. This makes clear that spores and pollens hold the key to the search for the earliest origins of plant life rather than plant megafossils which are much harder to recover.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Origins-of-plant-life/article15672371.ece
3,11,2010,Ashok Chavan must go,"It is now clear there is no way Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan can hang on to his chair — without the ruling Congress compounding its ignominy and the mess in which it has landed the politics and governance of one of India's most advanced States. His 23-month tenure has been little more than an unending series of controversies and scams. He took over as Chief Minister after the 26/11 terror attacks saw the Congress remove Vilasrao Deshmukh from the gaddi. Mr. Chavan's time at the helm will be remembered for the paid news scandal, bank scams, shady land deals, and pathetic governance. L'affaire Adarsh Society, which has implicated several Army officers as well, seems to be scandal that broke the camel's back. It is a measure of the Congress's predicament that just as it seems to be in the process of jettisoning Mr. Chavan — the Pranab Mukherjee-A.K. Antony enquiry seems to be a ploy to put off the last rites to a politically less inconvenient short date — a new land deal controversy has engulfed Narayan Rane, the Revenue Minister and a once-potential replacement. A credible successor, that is, someone not tainted by transactions that now epitomise Maharashtra's political economy, is hard to come by. The greatest asset the Congress has had in the State these past few years is the opposition. The party was aided by a split in the Shiv Sena, a demoralised Bharatiya Janata Party, the absence of a credible ‘Third Force,' and at least five fragmented fronts during the last Assembly elections. So the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party combine won major victories at the polls even as its vote share declined.
A divided and inept opposition meant Congress-led governments could muddle through. But Maharashtra's latest embarrassments were the last thing the party ruling at the Centre — struggling to cope with other, national-level scandals — needed. It is not as though Mr. Chavan's predecessors performed any better. In the three years before the economic slowdown of 2008, Maharashtra lost two million jobs — 1,800 a day on average. In the 12 years before he took office, more than 40,000 farmers in the State committed suicide. In the year before Mr. Chavan came to power, food production fell 24 per cent. Close to a third of Maharashtra's population remained below the official poverty line. Mr. Chavan did nothing to improve any of this. Yet it is hard to spot a successor in his party or alliance who can. That is the agonising dilemma the Congress faces. The party has not produced a leader of Statewide standing since Vasantdada Patil. Given its own and the State's entrenched political culture, it seems unlikely to do better any time soon.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Ashok-Chavan-must-go/article15673473.ece
3,11,2010,Continuing focus on inflation,"In a move that was widely anticipated, the Reserve Bank of India, in its second quarter review of the monetary policy, has hiked the repo and the reverse repo rates by 0.25 percentage point. Inflation remains high with both demand and supply factors at play. Inflationary expectations continue to be high. There is no ambiguity in the policy stance that the demand side pressures need to be contained and the inflationary expectations anchored. Though showing signs of moderation, WPI inflation at 8.6 per cent in September was well above the RBI's year-end target of 5.5 per cent. Existing inflationary pressures are likely to accentuate for several reasons. Global commodity prices, ruling high despite a weak recovery in the advanced economies, are poised to go up further due to strong demand from the emerging economies. The expected quantitative easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve will considerably add to the already high levels of global liquidity. In India, both property and equity markets have risen sharply. The RBI considers the growing “financialisation” of commodities as another potent risk to price stability. Persistently high domestic food inflation points to the existence of some structural component that will continue to weigh on the overall inflation. Finally, with the utilisation of domestic manufacturing capacity nearing its peak, demand side pressures might still increase. Although there is a strong case for a further rise in policy rates, the RBI has, so as not to jeopardise growth, ruled out any more action for now.
The RBI's forecast of GDP growth for 2010-11 remains pegged at 8.5 per cent, which is in line with most other official and non-official estimates. One major downside risk arises from the prospects of a slow and prolonged recovery in the advanced economies, many of which are severely indebted. Although India's exports as a percentage of the GDP are not large, a prolonged slump in world trade will impact negatively on manufacturing and services sectors. The ultra-loose monetary policies pursued by the U.S. and Japan have flooded the domestic markets and pose major policy challenges. The widening current account deficit is a matter of concern. Global capital flows which have so far helped bridge the deficit cannot be taken for granted. Along with the interest rate signals, the RBI has sought to discourage certain types of home loans by requiring the banks, for instance, to provide additional capital. For the first time, it has incorporated in its stance a provision to manage liquidity actively. Many categories of borrowers will have to pay more but the depositors, who are getting a negative return, will be compensated only partially.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Continuing-focus-on-inflation/article15673472.ece
4,11,2010,Political climate-change in the U.S.,"Borne on a surge of voter resentment, fear, and distrust of almost everything in Washington and particularly President Barack Obama, the Republican Party has swept to legislative power in the election to the 112th United States Congress, taking command of the House of Representatives and significantly reducing the Democrat majority in the Senate. Incomplete results show that the Grand Old Party now has 239 Representatives, a commanding lead over the Democrats' 185, in a clear expression of voters' anxiety about the twin failures of the Obama administration's economic stimulus package and its promises of change. Furthermore, voters have repeatedly said they are frightened about future tax bills to pay for the federal budget deficit, and about the whole direction they think the country is taking. This lurch to the Right has occurred at several electoral levels, from state legislatures through governorships to the two chambers of the federal Congress. Ominously for the President, substantial proportions of those who voted for him in 2008, such as college graduates, suburban voters, and those not registered as supporting either main party, have gone Republican.
The triumphant party's mood is also more confrontational than it has been for decades. This means the Democrats can take little comfort from their main Senate wins, such as those by the Majority Leader Harry Reid in Nevada and Barbara Boxer in California. The incoming Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, has publicly said his party plans to slow, stop, or kill everything on President Obama's agenda. The healthcare Act, which is one of Mr. Obama's legislative triumphs, is their first target. Their second aim is to extend the Bush administration's tax cuts, which are due to expire on December 31. These likely outcomes are symptomatic of a huge change in the U.S. political climate. The bulk of winning Republicans are experienced politicians, but they will be working in an atmosphere unrecognisably altered by the Tea Party movement, which has focussed and catalysed the manifest sense of frustration and alienation among the electorate. Possibly the only area in which the President will have some latitude for the second half of his term is foreign policy, which the Congress has traditionally left to the executive branch. The electoral debacle is bound to cast its shadow over Mr. Obama's India visit but should not make too much difference to the bilateral agenda. Mr. Obama is by no means a lame duck but, facing a hostile Congress and an electorate that is no longer listening to him, he looks in real danger of ending up as a one-term President. He can yet change that — but only by transforming himself into the kind of bold, upstanding, and far-sighted leader that Franklin Delano Roosevelt showed himself to be.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Political-climate-change-in-the-U.S./article15674461.ece
4,11,2010,Supporting cultural festivals,"Cultural development initiatives supported by the Government of India so far have not substantially promoted contemporary art practices and festivals. The new draft policy announced by the Ministry of Culture promises to change this. It proposes to extend financial support to established large festivals such as the Mumbai Khala Goda art and Chennai music festivals to help develop them into international events. Non-government organisations can get assistance to the tune of Rs.15 lakh in cash and Rs.35 lakh in kind. But, when compared to similar efforts elsewhere, the approach lacks imagination and vision. For instance, the McMaster Report (2008), which looked at how public subsidy could promote excellence and internationalise the arts and festivals in the United Kingdom, recommended that the top 10 organisations be identified through peer review and funded steadfastly for 10 years. What is clear is that token annual grants accompanied by cumbersome procedures will not attract, much less nurture, creativity. Nor will it make any difference to the quality of cultural festivals. A long-term guarantee of sustained funding will go a long way in creating a stable environment to implement ambitious plans.
Worldwide experience shows that artistic excellence emerges and world class festivals flourish only in an ambience of good cultural infrastructure. Multiple investments are required in wide-ranging areas, including audience engagement. Many successful festivals have creatively integrated themselves with city development and dovetailed with the local economy. In India, there is unfortunately no sign of a comprehensive national cultural policy four years after a committee was set up to formulate it. Where annual government spending on cultural development is low, it is all the more important to ensure that what is provided is wisely spent. Given the late start in supporting contemporary cultural practices, official policy must concentrate on supporting artists, widening the audience base, and subsidising performance of the classical, the folk, and the contemporary to optimise public engagement. There must be quick learning from progressive innovations like ‘A Night Less Ordinary', a scheme by the Arts Council of England that encourages young audiences to attend performances by providing thousands of free tickets to those below 26 years of age. A fact-based professional review of existing institutions and ongoing programmes is an imperative alongside new schemes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Supporting-cultural-festivals/article15674459.ece
5,11,2010,"Looking East, properly","Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's three-nation tour of East Asia was much more than a sum of its parts. Since the 1990s, when India was looking to build new alliances in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse, ‘Look East' has been a mantra with successive governments in New Delhi. But India's economic, political, and strategic relationship with the region was slower to develop than with the United States or Europe. The economic setback the Asian Tigers suffered in the closing years of the 20th century slowed it down further. The last few years have seen Delhi hastening to inject more purpose to its engagement with the East Asian countries. That India is now a major economic power has made this equally meaningful for the countries in the region. The India-ASEAN free trade agreement signed in 2009, awaiting implementation, is limited to goods and excludes services and investment but with a combined market of 1.8 billion people, it holds major potential for both sides. Prime Minister Singh's visit was intended to strengthen relations with ASEAN and the ASEAN-driven East Asia Summit and also to firm up bilateral relations in the region. Aside from marking the conclusion of negotiations on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan, the visit clinched a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement with Malaysia, scheduled to be signed into effect in January 2011. New Delhi is confident that similar agreements with Thailand and Indonesia will follow. The announcement of visa-on-arrival facility for nationals of Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and Philippines signals that New Delhi is not snobbishly restricting relations to the more prosperous countries in the region.
Another positive outcome of the visit was the meeting between Prime Minister Singh and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. Considering that some have seen India's energetic diplomacy in East Asia as a gambit to counter China's influence in the region, it was particularly relevant that Premier Wen recalled an earlier statement by the Indian Prime Minister that there is enough space in the world for both countries to realise their development aspirations, and added that there was enough space also for China and India to have cooperation in all areas. The meeting between the two leaders has set the stage for the two countries to work at addressing a trust gap that has developed in recent months. The timing of the East Asia tour, a few days before the arrival of President Barack Obama in India, was coincidental, but it has served to remind the people of India that East and West are equally crucial to the country's external relations. New Delhi can take satisfaction from a week well spent.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Looking-East-properly/article15675685.ece
5,11,2010,Brazil backs Lulismo,"As expected, Dilma Rousseff, a former Marxist revolutionary who survived torture by the military dictatorship in the 1970s, has been elected Brazil's first woman president. Her win by 56 per cent to the Social Democrat Jose Serra's 44 per cent is a landslide, but has been achieved only in a runoff and with energetic campaign support from the outgoing President, the legendary Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The campaign was ugly at times, with Ms Rousseff variously accused of being anti-Christian, of wanting to legalise abortion, and of being a ‘terrorist.' The new President will have an excellent chance to build on Lula's achievements, which include lifting 20 million Brazilians out of extreme poverty and raising another 30 million into the middle class. The economy has performed far better in Lula's two terms than in those of his predecessor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and unemployment is at a record low of 6.2 per cent. Furthermore, the country's poorer regions voted overwhelmingly for Ms Rousseff. What is clear is that the allegations made against her were either baseless or could not be substantiated. In the end, they carried little credibility with the voters. As for the charge of ‘terrorism,' Ms Rousseff's youthful activism expressed her commitment to the establishment of democracy, and she has since had a highly successful career as a provincial and national civil servant, and then as Lula's chief of staff.
The President-elect intends to strengthen links with other emerging countries, including China, India, and Iran. Her country faces big challenges, particularly in improving its ramshackle education and health systems and physical infrastructure. But Ms Rousseff can expect backing from her own Workers' Party (PT), which holds most seats in the bicameral National Congress, and which together with its main ally, the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), has a majority in both chambers. The PMDB may have reservations about the planned expansion of state activity, but the national cause is expected to override its ideological caution in this respect. Ms Rousseff's negotiating skills, about which there have been doubts, will be tested. Coordination with the PMDB will be essential if Brazil is to participate successfully in the new strategies being devised by Latin American states, such as Venezuela and Bolivia. These entail greater independence from the United States, as the Obama administration's policies towards its southern neighbours hardly differ from those of its predecessors. Ms Rousseff's election victory signifies the people's solid support for Lula's policies, or Lulismo.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Brazil-backs-Lulismo/article15675686.ece
8,11,2010,A new target,"The ‘Aichi Target' adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) at its Nagoya conference could not have come at a more appropriate time. The journal Science recently published a study by Michael Hoffmann and his colleagues titled “The Impact of Conservation on the Status of the World's Vertebrates.” This presents depressing data on threatened species. The scientists conclude that four important factors — agricultural expansion, logging, over-exploitation, and invasive species — are pushing an increasing number of vertebrates towards extinction; every year, 52 mammals, birds, and amphibians are moving one category closer to extinction, adding to the existing list. There is little doubt that many invertebrate species and flora are also imperilled by the same pressures. The data are worrying, but they also contain a message of hope. Many species have benefitted from conservation initiatives, the study shows, indicating that enlightened government policy can save biodiversity. The growing body of evidence should convince the 193 members of the CBD to take their goals seriously and draw up sound national biodiversity plans by 2012, the target year for implementation. It will take a lot of political will and funding to achieve the task, but the alternative is to impoverish the natural world and endanger human well being.
Japan has set the pace for conservation by creating a $2 billion fund for the key ‘Aichi Target' of halving the rate of biodiversity loss. But much more funding will be necessary to encourage developing countries to stop the degradation and unsustainable exploitation of forests, wetlands, and coastlines. It must be borne in mind that the CBD has admitted to failing in its original goal, which was to reduce loss of biodiversity significantly by 2010. The lack of progress is not surprising, because not enough funding was provided by rich nations. For instance, the members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development have been donating much more for climate change mitigation projects than for biodiversity conservation. This pattern makes it clear that the two environmental priorities have to be aligned more closely to make progress with the ten-year strategic plan finalised in Nagoya. In the Indian context, biodiversity concerns have been generally relegated to the background during the Environmental Impact Assessment process for land use change. This is particularly the case when the projects are small. Moreover, the EIA is often conducted by agencies that collect no original data on biological diversity to back their reports. India's performance in this area will be under the spotlight when the CBD meets in New Delhi in 2012.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-new-target/article15678408.ece
8,11,2010,At record levels,"The new records set by the stock market indices during the brief, special session on Friday are of more than symbolic significance. It has been part of the stock exchange tradition in Mumbai that brokers and investors would undertake at least limited trades to celebrate what for many of them is the start of the new year. The tradition remains well entrenched even though the character and composition of the capital market have changed dramatically over the years. In this tradition, the Sensex closing at above 21,000 and the Nifty above 6,300 are seen as good signs. The previous records were set nearly three years ago, in January 2008. There were indications from the beginning of last week that the markets would scale new highs. On Thursday, the Sensex gained 427 points, recording one of the largest increases in recent times. Many of the factors contributing to the rise have been there for some time. Foreign institutional investors have apparently stepped up their investments in recent weeks and the aggregate inflows have crossed $27 billion during this year. There are reports that major pension funds and other institutional investors in the United States who are repositories of huge long-term savings are reviewing and re-rating India positively. In any case, returns from the U.S. and the other slow-growing economies of the developed world are meagre even as their appetite for risk in the high-yielding emerging markets has been increasing in the most recent period.
India's economic growth continues to be strong and resilient. A GDP growth rate of 9 per cent in the near term seems within reach. To the list of the positive factors must be added two very recent developments. Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced its intention to undertake quantitative easing, a form of deficit financing, to the tune of nearly $600 billion. That is bound to further accelerate the flow of cheap dollars into the Indian stock markets. The other development is the spectacular debut of Coal India, whose share price recorded a 40 per cent gain on the day of its listing. The public sector company made the largest ever public issue in India and the government garnered over Rs.15,000 crore. Of even greater significance is the high level of retail participation in the public offer compared to other recent issues. However, more such opportunities need to be offered to the retail investors. About a fifth of the holdings in the Indian stock market is owned by the foreign institutional investors. Domestic insurance companies and mutual funds account for 5 per cent and 4 per cent respectively.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/At-record-levels/article15678407.ece
9,11,2010,A significant visit,"If there is one thing President Barack Obama has accomplished during his three-day visit, it was to convince a sceptical elite that the United States under his leadership is as committed to the strategic partnership with India as it was under George W. Bush. At the heart of the Bush doctrine was the recognition of India as a unique power in Asia, one whose economic and strategic potential could be leveraged to help Washington negotiate its way through the uncertainties of the next few decades. With the world financial crisis giving China a new salience and the disastrous war in Afghanistan requiring urgent attention, New Delhi slipped off Washington’s radar screen during the Obama presidency. That at any rate was the perception. However, the poor shape of the American economy, the continuing threat posed by Pakistan-based terrorists, and the return of tension in the U.S.-China relationship appear to have dealt India back into the game. In the run up to the presidential visit, Mr. Obama's advisers did all they could to reassure the Manmohan Singh government that Washington's continuing commitment to the partnership could not be doubted.
The support Mr. Obama announced for a permanent Indian seat on a reformed United Nations Security Council, if and when that happens, holds out the prospect for a reordering of world power even more significant than the Bush promise of resuming nuclear commerce with India. Of course, no time frame has been mentioned, and there is no formal commitment to move the process forward. Yet a door has been opened which skilful Indian diplomacy can use to further the country’s long-term interest. Mr. Obama also offered his Indian hosts satisfaction on the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and pointedly refused to get drawn into any controversy over Kashmir. Some economic issues such as protectionist sentiment over outsourcing were soft-pedalled. On the strategic side there are two broad areas of concern which the visit has highlighted. The U.S. seems excessively preoccupied with developments in East Asia, perhaps because tension between China and some of its neighbours has risen in recent months. China’s continuing rise should not pose any real problem for India and it would be extremely unwise for the country to dovetail its wider goals with the imperatives of American ‘leadership’ in Asia. Secondly, Mr. Obama dropped a broad hint that his endorsement of a permanent seat was conditional on India conducting itself ‘responsibly’ as a non-permanent member of the Security Council over the next two years. New Delhi must guard against pressure of this kind. Vital questions of war and peace concerning the region and the world are likely to come up before the UNSC. Under no circumstances must India allow itself to be swayed by threats and blandishments.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-significant-visit/article15680556.ece
9,11,2010,Developing heritage cities,"Early start and sustained efforts have been critical for the conservation of monuments. Unfortunately, these have been lacking in regard to the historic cities in India such as Ujjain and Kancheepuram, which are now shadows of their past and are fast turning into less desirable places to live in. UNESCO's move to create Indian Heritage Cities Network (IHCN), a programme to recover the heritage value of cities is a commendable initiative. Recently, in an attempt to convince representatives and officials from the various Indian cities, it took them to some French towns where valuable assets have been created by integrating heritage conservation with urban development. So far, city development and investment plans have bypassed them. For instance, the Master Plan for Varanasi (1991-2011), one of the ancient cities with a unique urban design and impressive river-front architecture, has designated only two per cent of the land under use as heritage area. The emphasis is always on the new areas. As a result, the peripheries develop rapidly, leaving the old urban core to struggle for even basic services. A case in point is the walled city of Delhi, Shahjahanabad, now a notified slum with crumbling house stocks.
The IHCN decision to work actively with the local bodies to reinvent old cities as worthy places of living is an effective strategy. However, this partnership should go beyond producing conventional development plans that mainly address aesthetic concerns. The priority should be to improve the housing stock and the urban services without affecting the stakes of the less-privileged inhabitants. In Lima, Peru, the poor occupants of its historic core area were given property titles under a special law so as to ensure their participation in its improvement and encourage them to spend on maintenance. Another challenge would be to fund residents to retrofit their old houses. In Graz (Austria), since the local bodies, with their meagre resources, would find it difficult to support such a programme, a dedicated fund was created and annually replenished through government grants. The restoration costs are fully met from this fund. Over the last 35 years about $6.5 million has been disbursed. Targeted credit with affordable interest rates and allowing for limited commercial use in housing area could be other ways of mobilising funds. Redeveloping old cities without impairing their historic significance may appear challenging but, as experience elsewhere shows, it is eminently feasible.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Developing-heritage-cities/article15680555.ece
9,11,2010,What next in Myanmar?,"The results of Myanmar's elections are yet to be declared but no formal announcement is needed to know who the winner is going to be. The November 7 election excluded the iconic Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), which stood disbanded earlier this year under crooked election laws manufactured by the country's ruling junta. The Nobel laureate had called for a boycott of the elections, probably one reason for the low voter turnout, and elections were not held in parts of the country that are home to its restive ethnic minorities. A quarter of the seats in Parliament are reserved for the military; of the 3,000 candidates contesting the elections, more than two-thirds belonged to parties linked to the military, the Union Solidarity and Development Party, and the National Unity Party. Many of these candidates were in uniform until recently. Pro-democracy opposition parties, including a breakaway faction of the NLD called the National Democratic Force, fielded only a limited number of candidates as they could not afford the high election deposit. Under these circumstances, there was never any doubt about who would call the shots in the new parliament and the 14 regional assemblies for which elections have been held. The State Peace and Development Council — the Orwellian name Myanmar's despotic rulers have given themselves — held the election under a rigged Constitution to present to the world an illusion of transition to democracy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/What-next-in-Myanmar/article15679479.ece
9,11,2010,Tariq Aziz must live,"The death sentence handed down by the Iraqi high criminal court to Tariq Aziz, Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister in Saddam Hussein's regime, is highly suspect on empirical grounds and unjustifiable for reasons of principle. The sentence has been given for Mr. Aziz's alleged persecution of members of the largely Shia Islamic Dawa Party, which is led by Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki. Mr. Aziz is serving a sentence of 15 years for his part in the killing of 42 merchants in 1992, and a further seven years for the forced eviction of Kurds from northern Iraq in the 1980s. The latest trial was initiated after this frail and sick old man was handed over to the Iraqi government following the closure of the country's last United States-run prison. This lends credence to the claim by Mr. Aziz's family that the Dawa Party is motivated by a desire for revenge. To make matters worse, defence lawyer Badee Izzat Aref says he was denied access to his client after the Iraqi government took over the prison. In fact, the defendant's fitness to stand trial is in doubt; he suffered a stroke before the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, and his health has deteriorated since. Both his lawyer and independent analysts suggest that the savage sentence has been timed to divert attention from the WikiLeaks revelations of extensive torture by the occupying forces and the Iraqi security services. Moreover, Mr. Aziz could cause international embarrassment if he made public the details of the arms deals the Saddam regime signed with other countries during the Iran-Iraq war.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Tariq-Aziz-must-live/article15679478.ece
10,11,2010,Tale of two Chavans,"In deciding to make lightweight Prithviraj Chavan the new Chief Minister of Maharashtra and ignoring the claims of many middleweights from an active gene pool, the Congress high command has opted for dependability rather than any independent political strength. The loyalty of the erstwhile Delhi-based Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office, his distance from Maharashtra's factional battles, and his relatively non-controversial image clinched the issue. The incoming Mr. Chavan says he will meet all major leaders of Maharashtra, including those from the Nationalist Congress Party, in the next couple of days. The high command has decreed and it is unlikely the State satraps will show much dissent at this point. With the week's reprieve President Barack Obama's visit gifted him over, the disgraced Ashok Chavan's exit was inevitable. Adarsh, the 31-floor high-rise society in Mumbai, was supposed to provide subsidised housing for war widows and veterans. Instead, its beneficial membership list reads like a shortlist of senior Maharashtra politicians, top bureaucrats, and army brass. Members of this elite society secured flats for around Rs.60 lakh apiece, though each flat is worth more than Rs.5 crore on the market. Some members, prominent public figures amongst them, filed information stating their salaries to be a fraction of the real figures, with a few showing their monthly income to be less than that of an entry-level public sector bank officer.
The damning factor in Mr. Ashok Chavan's case appears to have been the ownership of flats in the Adarsh society by his close kin. But the scam was also the latest in a series embroiling him — cooperative bank scandals, shady land deals, and the ‘paid news' racket for which he became the national brand ambassador. The Adarsh crisis did see the Congress high command act decisively. The real question is whether this action is a one-off or an intervention that raises the probity bar for politicians in Maharashtra. Unfortunately, illicit land deals and other scams are not individual aberrations in this State; they are an integral part of its everyday political culture and economy. There is also the factor of instability in a State that will have its fourth Chief Minister in less than seven years notwithstanding the comfortable majority the Congress-NCP alliance has enjoyed. At the same time, the decisive action in Maharashtra steps up the heat on national level scams simmering in Delhi. Meanwhile, one of India's most advanced States will struggle to overcome old political problems that, unlike Mr. Ashok Chavan, cannot be decreed away from New Delhi. The lightweight, who must be wished well, has a rare chance to prove the cynics wrong.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Tale-of-two-Chavans/article15681684.ece
10,11,2010,Structural change and inequality,"One important indicator of the effectiveness of economic policy is the manner in which it alters the basic socioeconomic structure of a country. Some 20 years after many of the economies of the world changed track — moving away from an active economic role for states towards liberalisation and globalisation — there is evidence that economic growth, on its own, does not reduce poverty or inequalities. This is clear from a report by the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD). A basic attribute of economic growth is the movement of labour force, typically, from the primary sector to the secondary, and then to the tertiary sector. But the trend now is to work for faster growth through the tertiary sector, bypassing the all-important manufacturing sector. For a country that embarks upon economic reforms, it is also imperative to put in place adequate institutional support, by way of social policy, so that the transitory process triggered by a smaller role for the state as employment provider does not affect the well-being of its workforce.
The report, “Combating Poverty and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy and Politics,” makes it clear that many countries are not doing enough to create productive employment during the structural adjustment process. The message is that the current approaches to eliminating poverty are unlikely to deliver results as they emphasise macro-stabilisation. For instance, the insistence on fiscal discipline relegates social concerns to the level of by-products of policymaking. Specifically, in pursuit of fiscal prudence, governments in many developing countries place less emphasis on universalising social protection, and go for targeted measures, which suffer from a serious shortfall — it relates to the state's capacity to ensure full coverage of the target group. Moreover, macro-stabilisation policies mean a shrinking public sector and increasing reliance on market forces. The situation warrants a transitory process that emphasises employment-growth, accompanied by active state-backed social policies. For instance, the manner in which the East Asian economies managed their structural change — with an emphasis on the manufacturing sector, backed by social structures — proved effective in achieving higher growth while narrowing inequalities. The over-arching message from the report, which is important at a time when the global targets for poverty reduction appear elusive, is this: poverty and inequality are too serious issues to be left to the markets.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Structural-change-and-inequality/article15681682.ece
11,11,2010,Iran helps Iraqi governance,"The political vacuum that has left Iraq without a government since the March 2010 elections is close to being filled as a result of two key developments. First, Kurdistania Alliance, which holds 43 seats in Iraq's parliament, has opted to join Nouri al-Maliki's State of Law coalition. Secondly, Iran has constructively persuaded the Iraqi Shia leader, the ‘anti-American' cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who lives in exile in Qom, to back Mr. al-Maliki. The 70 seats of the Sadrist Iraqi National Alliance will give the State of Law a comfortable majority. The al-Maliki group as well as Iyad Allawi's ‘secular-nationalist' Iraqiya List, which won 89 and 91 seats respectively in the polls, were way short of the 163 needed for a majority; longstanding factional and other disputes also impeded government formation. Iran's political diplomacy followed the departure of the last U.S. combat troops in September. Tehran received Mr. al-Maliki for talks and then brokered the Qom meeting. In a far-reaching move, Iran involved Syria as well as the Lebanon-based Hezbollah for enhanced leverage.
The manifest disappointment of Mr. Allawi, who was installed as interim prime minister following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, is being compensated through the Iraqiya getting the speakership of parliament as well as leadership of a committee overseeing national security. But what stands out here is Iran's rising importance in the region. Syria's President Bashar al-Assad and Mr. al-Maliki withdrew ambassadors in the middle of 2009 following the latter's public accusation that Syria was involved in bombing government buildings in Baghdad — but Iran has now brought Mr. Assad on board. Secondly, only Iran could have persuaded Mr. al-Sadr to back Mr. al-Maliki after talks between the two had failed. Thirdly, the Iraqi people are, on this evidence, realistic about the role their neighbour can and will play in their country. That in turn throws the spotlight on the kind of withdrawal the U.S. intends to make. The invaders have built and staffed several huge and effectively permanent military bases in Iraq. The imponderable is how all this will play militarily and politically, with Maliki-Sadrist pre-eminence in governance? It was Washington that provided Tehran with this significant opening by switching support from Mr. Maliki to Mr. Allawi after the election. Without a stable and lasting political dispensation, Iraq will be unable to recover from the terrible destruction wrought by the illegal U.S.-led invasion and occupation. Iran's constructive engagement with Iraq must therefore be welcomed by political India, despite the contrary message President Barack Obama delivered during his recent visit.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Iran-helps-Iraqi-governance/article15682786.ece
11,11,2010,Off-mark on India's UNSC dream,"A statement in President Barack Obama's address to the Lok Sabha that “in the years ahead, I look forward to a reformed United Nations Security Council that includes India as a permanent member” has generated much euphoria in India and an equal amount of anger in Pakistan. India has seen it as an endorsement by the United States of its longstanding efforts to get into the elite club of the world's big powers. In Islamabad, the Cabinet met to “express serious concern and strong disappointment” over what it saw as an act of betrayal by Washington. Both reactions are way off the mark. True, this was the first time a President of the United States expressed such a sentiment. Successive administrations have preferred to talk around the subject. In this sense, Mr. Obama's words represent a symbolic shift in policy. Yet they were nowhere close to an explicit statement of support for India's bid for a permanent seat on the Security Council. Compared to the 2005 statement by Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice that the “United States unambiguously supports a permanent seat for Japan on the United Nations Security Council,” President Obama's formulation sounds like a vague promise. Further, his reference to New Delhi's “increased responsibility” was a clear indication that India would first need to pass American tests of responsible conduct in international affairs.
With or without U.S. support, India has a long way to go in its quest for permanent membership of the Security Council. The U.N. has spent years discussing reforms and the comity of nations is far from reaching an agreement on them. President Obama's omission of a timeline in his assurance to India was telling. There is no consensus on any big-ticket item on the reforms agenda, including the expansion of the Security Council and veto powers for the new permanent members. Islamabad could not be unaware of this. Its denunciation of what it has described as India's “chequered” track record in adhering to U.N principles and resolutions suggests that the anger is directed at the larger symbolism of the Obama statement for India-U.S ties. New Delhi and Islamabad have always viewed with suspicion each other's relations with Washington, and the warmth that was apparent during the Obama visit, combined with the frenzied anti-Pakistan sentiments in the Indian broadcast media during the visit, have not gone down well in Pakistan. Since India's permanent membership of the UNSC looks today like a pie in the sky, it is best to treat the Pakistan Cabinet's statement as an over-the-top rant that does not deserve a serious response.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Off-mark-on-Indias-UNSC-dream/article15682785.ece
12,11,2010,Impeaching Justice Sen,"While the power of impeachment is vested in Parliament, the move to force the removal of Justice Soumitra Sen of the Calcutta High Court was initiated, quite extraordinarily, by the office of the Chief Justice of India. In 2008, Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recommending that impeachment proceedings be initiated under Article 124(4) of the Constitution against Justice Sen on the basis of the findings of an in-house inquiry, which held him guilty of financial misconduct. That unprecedented missive has resulted in the completion of two of three stages governing the impeachment process — a notice seeking such action signed by a specified number of MPs, and a finding of guilt by a three-member committee constituted under the Judges Inquiry Act 1968. The stage is now set for Parliament to consider the impeachment motion, which can be passed only if supported by two-thirds of members present and voting as well as by an absolute majority of the total membership in each House. Deplorably, Justice Sen has decided to cling to office, following the example of P.D. Dinakaran, now Chief Justice of the Sikkim High Court, who refused to resign in the face of a flurry of corruption and land-grab charges.
Such defiance of judicial propriety draws attention to the absence of a quick and effective statutory mechanism to deal with errant judges. The process of impeachment is clearly much too time-consuming. As the only instance when an impeachment motion came up for vote in Parliament showed, it is also fraught with political uncertainty; in 1993, Justice V. Ramaswami was let off the hook when the Congress decided to abstain from voting on the motion. No further time must be wasted in passing the Judges Standards and Accountability Bill, which seeks to simplify the procedure for acting against erring judges. An unusual aspect about the charges against Justice Sen is that they relate to a time when he was an advocate and a case in which he was a court-appointed Receiver in 1984. The three-member inquiry committee held him guilty of misappropriation of the money he received in this capacity as well as misrepresenting facts about it. Mr. Sen paid the money back with interest after a single judge of the Calcutta High Court, who made scathing observations about his “misappropriation,” directed him to do so. However, a Division Bench reversed this and ordered the deletion of these remarks. It is important that Parliament discusses the issue dispassionately, evenhandedly, and in detail before voting on the motion — the dismissal of judges is too serious an issue to be determined by political considerations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/impeaching-justice-sen/article882418.ece
12,11,2010,Challenging times,"The Indian banking sector which demonstrated a high degree of resilience during the global economic crisis is facing the challenges of meeting the financial needs of a fast growing economy. Inevitably, there have been stresses and strains. According to the Reserve Bank of India's annual report on ‘Trends and Progress of Banking in India,' the performance of commercial banks during 2009-10 was subdued. A slowdown in deposit growth caused a deceleration in the disbursement of credit. Consequently, their combined balance sheets expanded at a slower rate. Their net profits have been growing but at a slower rate. All other parameters, such as the return on assets and on equity, corroborate the point that their profitability is under stress. At the aggregate level, non-performing assets (NPAs) have been increasing. Although not alarming, the deterioration in asset quality underlines the need for banks to step up the provisions, especially at a time when the enhanced Basel II capital norms take effect. While Indian banks are comfortably placed for now, they will have to shore up their capital base in the future. On the positive side, banks have been extending their geographical coverage through their branches and ATMs, thereby bringing about financial inclusion across the country.
The RBI has been gradually shifting its policy focus from crisis management to recovery management. In fact, some of its more recent measures aim at preventing the creation of an asset bubble in the residential property markets in big cities. Over the past year, there has been a renewed policy emphasis on customer service, promoting the free flow of credit to small and medium enterprises, and adopting the latest technology. Outside India, and especially in the West, concerns have remained over downside risks, especially those relating to profitability and quality of assets. Major banks that were rescued with public money need to regain their standing and identity by ending their dependence on emergency support measures from the exchequer. As the RBI points out, there are important lessons from the global economic crisis for banking policies. The need for regulation to stay ahead of innovation has been well understood, as evidenced by the central bank's cautious approach to the introduction of new products, such as credit default swaps and certain types of derivatives. Having shielded the financial sector from the worst consequences of the economic crisis, the RBI is preparing the ground for new policy initiatives, including the licensing of new banks.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Challenging-times/article15684232.ece
14,11,2010,Post-dated cheque from Seoul,"Leaders of the world's largest economies meeting at Seoul could not, under the circumstances, have hoped for a better outcome. A meeting of the G20 finance ministers held earlier showed the group to be far less cohesive than it was two years ago when it first met in the immediate aftermath of the global crisis. On that occasion, a high degree of consensus was reached, for instance, in coordinating their stimulus packages. Evidently, with the crisis abating, the G20 countries have fewer incentives to work together. Moreover, there have been certain intractable issues concerning global imbalances, the phenomenon of some countries, such as China and Germany, running up large surpluses, matched by large deficits in the United States and a few other countries. The “currency wars,” a key consequence of the lack of will to tackle external imbalances, have fortunately not escalated but the two principal protagonists with stridently opposite positions, China and the U.S., were not able to bridge their differences. The G20 leaders agreed to avoid a competitive devaluation of their currencies and undertook to seek more balanced growth. However, they put off until next year the contentious task of defining the problems that threaten global recovery.
A U.S. proposal to fix a cap on deficits and surpluses in current accounts did not find favour, even though it would have turned the spotlight away from currency rates and brought in trade imbalances as well. The important message from the summit is that the countries will continue to work together but will not be constrained by any rigid time frame. They will seek to keep imbalances “sustainable” by coming up with “indicative guidelines composed of a range of indicators” to serve as a mechanism to “facilitate timely identification of large imbalances that require preventive and corrective actions to be taken.” However well-intentioned, the wording of the communiqué strongly suggests that the real gains from the summit will flow only , if at all, over the long term. On the positive side, the G20 endorsed the measures to reform the International Monetary Fund, a move that would give China, India, and a few others a greater say in the global body. A much more democratic IMF, it is hoped, will have wider acceptability and will therefore be better equipped to perform its role as a referee. The Seoul Development Consensus reached at the summit takes a pragmatic and pluralistic view of development. The time has come for the G20 to evolve beyond its crisis management role and emerge as the major forum for forging a consensus among developed and emerging economies on several key issues including trade and climate change.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Post-dated-cheque-from-Seoul/article15686997.ece
14,11,2010,"Good detection, serious challenges","While India and the United States spar over how information about David Headley's links to Pakistani militant groups should have been handled, and whether an early tip could have prevented the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, the detection of two parcel bombs in U.S.-bound cargo planes offers vital lessons. The details of al-Qaeda's latest terror plot, which investigators believe originated in Yemen, are still unravelling. But it is clear that intelligence work and cooperation over months among the Saudi, American, and European intelligence agencies was crucial in foiling it. From what is known, Saudi intelligence put out several warnings about the possibility of a terrorist strike by al-Qaeda or its affiliates against the U.S. and also Europe. The heightened awareness led to American authorities intercepting in mid-September a suspicious package that arrived in Chicago from Yemen. It contained no explosives and investigators believe it was a test drive by the plotters. Further warnings came in early and late October. The October 28 tip that bombs might be on cargo flights bound for the U.S. offered invaluable particulars, including the tracking numbers of the parcels. Without this information, the two packets, which contained printers, would have gone undetected. Due to its non-metallic character, PETN, the deadly explosive that was concealed in the ink cartridges of the printers, is unlikely to be discovered by security scanning machines. It goes to show there is no substitute for good old intelligence gathering, and the ability to sift and process such intelligence swiftly.
The bombs themselves were works of sophistication, an indication that al-Qaeda and its franchises are getting better and bolder in devising ways to achieve their mission of global apocalypse. It is disturbing that even after the solid tip-off, the British police did not find the explosive the first time they examined the parcel after grounding it; they discovered it only during a second examination prompted by the discovery of the other parcel bomb in Dubai. A timer was found in one bomb, while the other had a SIM card, and could have been triggered by a phone call. That the parcels managed to get on the planes — the one detected in Dubai took two connecting passenger flights from Yemen — has exposed the inadequacy of the freight-screening procedures at airports and seaports. As the global cargo industry and security officials grapple with the challenge of developing more effective measures, the world has yet again been reminded that bombers have to get lucky just once, as the Irish Republican Army noted in another context. Much more than luck is required to prevent that.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Good-detection-serious-challenges/article15686995.ece
15,11,2010,Heed the call,"There are many questions that demand clear and truthful answers in the 2G spectrum allocation controversy. With one political storm following another, and the opposition parties making Parliament dysfunctional on this issue, A. Raja, the man at the centre of it all, did the right thing in resigning as Union Minister for Communications and Information Technology. While denying any wrongdoing, he has insisted that he was persisting with a well-established policy in handing out 2G spectrum on a first-come first-served basis, instead of taking the auction route. This is no doubt true but serious questions relating to procedural irregularities and revenue losses remain. The size of the amount estimated by the Comptroller and Auditor General to be the loss to the government — Rs.177,000 crore — and the implications of the procedural violations alleged — ignoring the advice of the Prime Minister, the Ministries of Law and Finance, and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India — require that the United Progressive Alliance government allow a thorough probe that will protect no one, however high or powerful, involved in wrongdoing. Companies that won telecom licences and spectrum for Rs.1,651 crore in the first quarter of 2008 managed to attract investment indicating valuations of several times that amount from international telecom companies within a few weeks. Unitech Wireless Ltd., brought in the Norway-based Telenor Group and formed Uninor. Swan Telecom, promoted by the Dynamix Balwas Group, chose United Arab Emirates-based Etisalat as its international partner and formed Etisalat DB Telecom India. Unsurprisingly, these transactions, which took advantage of legal loopholes and bypassed the stipulation of the Department of Telecomunications that operators should not sell promoter equity within the first three years, immediately raised suspicion.
In the face of growing evidence that the first-come, first-served policy was depriving the exchequer of huge revenue, the auction route should have suggested itself to the government. The Manmohan Singh government must heed the call of public opinion and political India and consent to a probe by a Joint Parliamentary Committee into the entire controversy, beginning with the formulation of the National Telecom Policy 1994. JPCs might not be a politically impartial way of getting to the truth, and the JPC constituted in the Bofors case, which was boycotted by the main opposition parties and was packed with members of the Congress and its allies, was nothing but a cover-up device. The situation is quite different now — in the era of coalition governments. The constitution of a JPC must not be allowed to hamper the investigations by the Central Bureau of Investigation, the Central Vigilance Commission, and the Registrar of Companies. Nor should Mr. Raja's resignation be used as a ruse to pretend that with him gone, all is well with national telecom policy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Heed-the-call/article15688062.ece
15,11,2010,Treasure trove,"Drifting at a rate of 20 cm a year for 100 million years after splitting from Gondwana, the Indian subcontinent was separated geographically from the rest of the landmass till it collided with Asia 50 million years ago. Any landmass that is geographically isolated for millions of years tends to produce species that are unique and endemic to that region.However, an online paper published recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (“Biogeographic and evolutionary implications of a diverse paleobiota in amber from the early Eocene of India,” by Jes Rust et al.,) describes a surprising find. Despite isolation for millions of years, the Indian subcontinent had only a limited number of endemic species 50 million years ago. The 150 kg amber deposit found in the Cambay Shale Formation at Vastan village near Surat has excellently preserved specimens of nearly 100 new species of arthopods, including social insects such as ants, bees, and termites. These specimens show evolutionary relatedness to species found in Asia, Europe, Australia, and South America. Such relatedness is possible only if the Indian paleospecies had mixed with their counterparts in other countries.
If a land bridge link between the drifting Indian landmass and Africa and Asia was once proposed to explain the mammal movement, insects preserved in the amber strengthen that argument. A chain of islands or any such land connection must have existed between India and Asia before their collision. The alternative explanation of a much earlier collision can be ruled out; there is overwhelming geological evidence that India collided with Asia 50 million to 55 million years ago. The lignite deposits of Cambay, apart from preserving the amber, provide insight into the paleoenvironment of the region. The amber secreted by dipterocarpaceae — a family of hardwood trees that accounts for nearly 80 per cent of tropical canopy in South-East Asia — and fossil remains of this family provide unequivocal evidence of broad-leaved trees typical of tropical forests. Once believed to have developed 5 million-24 million years ago (Miocene) in South-East Asia, the fossil remains and amber deposits from dipterocarpaceae push back the tropical forest record to 38 million-54 million years ago (Eocene). It should come as no surprise if the Cambay Shale Formation, a fossil museum of Eocene age, overturns other notions and helps set many a record straight.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Treasure-trove/article15688070.ece
16,11,2010,Reality check on Myanmar,"Aung San Suu Kyi is finally free. Around the world, there is relief that Myanmar's repressive military junta has released this courageous woman whose sacrifices in pursuit of her mission to bring democracy to her country have few parallels. She is a true hero of our times, and her freedom has brought with it hopes that the junta is relaxing its hold on Myanmar and that a transition to democracy is round the corner. It is tempting to think this way. The world is in a rush to do business with Myanmar but as long as Ms Suu Kyi was imprisoned, it could not do so with a clean conscience. Now that she is free, countries can engage with Myanmar without feeling guilty about it. But as we celebrate Ms Suu Kyi's freedom, it must be remembered that this is not the first time she has been set free. The last time was in May 2002. In exactly a year, feeling threatened by the crowds she was drawing wherever she went, the junta pushed her back into house arrest. Her release this time, orchestrated to follow a sham election, is meant to give the generals a softer look after their grip-tightening pseudo-democratic exercise. Going by the rapturous response of the masses, the democracy icon remains a powerful political figure in her country. But there is no indication from the junta that it has changed its stripes.
It was significant that soon after her release the Nobel laureate tempered her remarks on the freedom of speech with a call for national reconciliation through talks with the junta, and spoke about achieving democracy in the “right way.” Was she dropping a hint that international sanctions against Myanmar might have to be relaxed or withdrawn when she said: “This is a time for Burma when we need help. We need everybody to help in this venture: western nations, eastern nations, all nations”? It is difficult to see Ms Suu Kyi making a deal with the generals or accepting their version of democracy. The path ahead of her is extremely difficult. How much political space she will be able to carve out in the new situation, what are the limits to the junta's tolerance of such political activity, how the rest of a fragmented opposition will respond to her pre-eminence are all imponderables. The limits of international influence in Myanmar have been exposed all these years in its signal failure to prod the junta into embracing democracy. Still, the outside world must work to ensure that, aside from Ms Suu Kyi remaining free and able to engage in political activity, Myanmar's more than 2,000 political prisoners are released. India must play a role in this process, using its influence with the generals. Not because the President of the United States wants this, but because it is the only right thing to do.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Reality-check-on-Myanmar/article15689185.ece
16,11,2010,Assessing development,"Twenty years is a good enough time to assess how countries of the world, irrespective of the economic or political system they follow, have performed in promoting human development. Successive Human Development Reports (HDR), since 1990, have mainstreamed health and education as critical indicators of human progress and contributed to international policy structures. For instance, the Millennium Development Goals, aimed at using international financial resources to reduce global poverty, can be traced to the HDR-1991 on financing development. Significantly, this year's HDR has made long-term innovations in measuring development. First, it reconfigures its indicators on literacy and income. Replacing ‘gross enrolment' and ‘adult literacy rates' with ‘expected years of schooling' and ‘mean years of schooling' makes for a deeper understanding of this important socioeconomic attribute, particularly as literacy rates, which are rising around the world, could gloss over structural weaknesses. Replacing ‘Gross Domestic Product' with ‘Gross National Income', which includes international income flows, would bring in a fresh perspective on an economy's standing, particularly in the current globalising context of a country's poverty reduction programmes. Secondly, HDR-2010 introduces three indices — the Multidimensional Poverty Index, the Gender Inequality Index and the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index — aimed at gaining a deeper appreciation of a country's development path.
The 2010 Report, The Real Wealth of Nations: Pathways to Human Development, comes as a timely reality check on India's global standing. It shows that, despite recording a phenomenal economic growth recently, India continues to remain in the bottom-50 on human development — it is placed at 119 out of 169. The report points to critical social failures. Its new indicators on education tell the story of how rising literacy rates are no cause for comfort. The ‘mean years of schooling' is only 4.4, compared to the global figure of 7.4; and the ‘expected years of schooling' of 10.3 is short of the global average of 12.3. These are particularly important pointers at a time when India prepares to give its children the right to free and compulsory education. At a theoretical level, it is noteworthy that the report finds a “weak long-term association” between income growth and changes in education and health. This finding, read along with the failure of ‘trickle down' theories to deliver, only re-emphasises the need to rethink economic growth strategies, particularly in the developing world.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Assessing-development/article15689184.ece
17,11,2010,A role for the RIC trilateral,"Even though groups spanning multiple geographic and economic vectors like the East Asia Summit, the Brazil-Russia-India-China forum, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation have begun emerging and consolidating themselves, it would be a mistake to assume any of these could be a substitute for the Russia, India, China trilateral (RIC). What makes the trilateral unique — and important — is the convergence of geography, foreign policy philosophy, and economic ascent within the group. All three countries are world powers with significant interests in the Eurasian and Asia-Pacific strategic spaces. Unlike economic powers like Japan or the countries of the European Union, their foreign policy is independent. Each is committed to the creation of a multi-polar world order based on respect for international law, multilateralism, and collective decision-making. The three also have strong ties binding them, though these are somewhat uneven. India, for example, has close political relations with Russia but little to show by way of bilateral trade or investment. By contrast, India-China trade is booming, but the bilateral political relationship could be better. Another mismatch within the trilateral stems from the way each relates to the United States. Russia and China would like to use the trilateral to send a signal to Washington that they are unhappy with its bloc-like approach to the Asia-Pacific. India, on the other hand, is decidedly wary of alienating the U.S., at this juncture. Finally, there is an imbalance stemming from the fact that only Russia and China are permanent members of U.N. Security Council. What this means is that Moscow and Beijing are content to involve India in discussions on global issues at the RIC level only to the extent necessary to buttress their own arguments with Washington at the UNSC.
As a result of all these factors, a grouping whose strongest binding factor is political and strategic has tended to adopt a hands-off approach to key regional problems like the Iran nuclear issue and Afghanistan. At the recent meeting of RIC foreign ministers at Wuhan, for example, a common position expressing unhappiness with the current U.S.-led approach on these questions was articulated but there was no attempt to carve out a role for the trilateral as a group in pushing for better outcomes. That said, the three still set for themselves an ambitious agenda of practical cooperation. Agriculture, health and medicine, and disaster management are already focus areas. To this, the foreign ministers have added energy and joint work on innovation as priority areas. Business-to-business cooperation is also being emphasised. If links at the corporate level get stronger, it is possible that the trilateral will feel less coy about taking on a political agenda.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-role-for-the-RIC-trilateral/article15690258.ece
17,11,2010,Innovative outreach efforts,"The collapse of a 2000-year-old heritage structure, identified as the gladiator house, is the latest crisis to hit the world heritage site of Pompeii, the historic Roman city that attracts 2.5 million visitors a year. A few structures were lost in the recent past and until 2008, about 150 sqm of frescoes and 3,000 pieces of stone disappeared every year. Despite repeated warnings by experts and even a declaration of emergency two years ago, not much has been done on the conservation front. Unfortunately, informed criticism is giving way to irrational shrill calls for privatisation of the monuments for better protection. Shortage of funds and poorly managed government institutions are universal problems. It would be a fallacy to reduce the options of heritage management to privatisation. Instead of alienating heritage properties or allowing advertisements on historic structures to raise money, as proposed for the Colosseum in Rome, government can turn to successful alternative models such as the National Trust in the United Kingdom, which prioritises heritage as a public good.
A registered charitable institution, the National Trust has successfully served heritage protection for more than 100 years. This body that manages seven world heritage sites and more than 400 historic structures has, despite the recession, increased funding, widened activities, and registered a 22.5 per cent net gain (2009-10). Sustained efforts to enlarge public participation and decentralise management have contributed to its success. Last year alone, the Trust attracted about 595,000 new members, raising the total membership to 3.7 million assuring a revenue of £125 million a year. France too encourages formation of heritage foundations to support conservation and it has set up 26 regional directorates to implement national policies in close coordination with local bodies. From all this, what must be clear to the policymakers in India is that, while private partnerships can be explored, turning monuments into commercial ventures is not the way forward. The Archaeological Survey of India, the premier government institution in charge of monuments, must be thoroughly redefined and strengthened. Simultaneously, institutional and legal frameworks have to be reviewed to create spaces for imaginative autonomous organisations that will attract public participation, liaise better with local bodies, and improve public outreach.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Innovative-outreach-efforts/article15690257.ece
18,11,2010,The home loan trap?,"The ongoing controversy over the so-called “teaser” loans in the home loan segment has many dimensions. The term ‘teaser loan' is derived from the practice, adopted by some leading banks, of charging attractive, customer friendly, fixed interest rates for the first three years and thereafter setting the interest rates on more conventional floating rate basis. The pioneer and market leader in this segment, State Bank of India charges eight per cent for the first year and nine per cent for the next two years. Home loans are typically of a much longer duration and borrowers, tempted by the attractive interest rates during the initial years, are less likely to take into account either the interest rate risks or their repaying capacities during the rest of the loan period. In extreme situations some of the borrowers may well slip into a debt trap and that would not be good for the lending banks either. Recently the RBI, concerned over the excess demand being generated in the residential real estate market, among other things, sought to discourage teaser loans by asking banks to increase the provisioning for all such loans to two per cent from the existing 0.4 per cent. There have been other points of criticism as well. Some have even compared these loans, inappropriately though, to the sub-prime loans in the United States, which triggered the global financial crisis.
It is possible that the controversy over home loan pricing has much to do with the intense competition that has become a characteristic of the substantially deregulated financial sector. For banks, pricing of loans, deposits, and other services is a crucial component of their marketing strategies. The question is whether tactical pricing practices such as charging teaser interest rates are predatory or injurious to the health of the institution and, in an extended sense, to the entire financial sector. Some of the strongest criticism against the SBI's home loan scheme has come from the HDFC, which, along with other banks and institutions, was forced to follow suit. While the SBI and other public sector banks have access to cheap resources and can afford to charge the lower lending rates for the initial years, others are not placed well enough to compete with them in this game. The RBI, which recently introduced the base rate mechanism to make bank lending more transparent, probably needs to intervene only if competition in the home loan segment threatens to get out of hand. Even then, it ought to concern itself more with issues such as asset-liability mismatches that are very relevant in longer-term home loans than with aggressive pricing of a few products.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-home-loan-trap/article15691401.ece
18,11,2010,Israel is as Israel does,"Israel's announcement of plans for 1,300 new dwellings in East Jerusalem and 800 new ones in the West Bank settlement of Ariel puts a decisive end to the 10-month partial cessation of construction. It is also a clear demonstration of Israeli intentions. In fact, the installation of infrastructure never stopped. The Palestinian chief negotiator, Saab Erekat, says Israel chooses settlements, not peace. The effects of the new construction will be far-reaching. The indirect talks painstakingly brokered by the United States in February and March 2010 must be seen as indefinitely suspended, as they rest on the precondition of an end to further Israeli settlement in the occupied territories. Secondly, Israel's persistent stalling of U.S. calls for a freeze shows that Israel can flout with impunity the principle in international law that all construction in occupied territory is illegal; the Israeli annexation of East Jerusalem is not recognised by any other state. The expressions of concern by President Barack Obama, the United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, and the European Union foreign policy representative, Catherine Ashton, are all manifestly futile gestures, which Israel disregards.
In the chorus of international disapproval, which is matched by strident self-justification, it is easy to lose sight of Israeli calculations. For example, the civic authorities almost never grant building permission to long standing Palestinian residents. That makes even modest extensions to Palestinian homes illegal by definition, and the authorities then move hard-line Israeli settlers into the extensions or target the Palestinians' homes for demolition. With breathtaking gall, Ariel's mayor has even petitioned the Tel Aviv District Court for a return of Value Added Tax on the grounds that his township, being across the Green Line from the rest of the West Bank, is not in Israel. If, however, Ariel is ruled to be within Israel, the colonisation spreads further. The Israeli Right also gives Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu a smokescreen. The Foreign Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, has free rein, despite a recent opinion poll showing that 60 per cent of Israeli voters hold him the politician most responsible for an increase in extreme nationalism and near-fascist tendencies. In March, the ultra-orthodox Interior Minister Eli Yishai announced on his own initiative that settlement construction would resume when the so-called freeze expired. Mr. Netanyahu is using Israeli extremists to carry out ethnic cleansing and future generations of Israelis will inherit the terrible legacy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Israel-is-as-Israel-does/article15691400.ece
19,11,2010,"Flawed process, failed outcome","The integrity of the process always determines the quality of the product that comes out of it. If a process is wrong, the product seldom turns out right. It is now a common conclusion that the procedure for the allocation of spectrum in 2007-08 for the second generation (2G) telecom services was flawed, and grossly so. When there were many more aspirants for the licences than there was frequency spectrum, and an auction should have been the obvious method to decide on the winners, the licences were handed out instead in a non-transparent, first-come-first-served basis and at a low price set seven years earlier. These are the charges that the former Union Minister for Telecommunications, A. Raja, faces, and the ones that forced his resignation. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India found that some of the licence winners had not met even the basic requirements when they applied. It comes as little surprise therefore that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is advising the government to cancel the licences of all the six companies for not conforming to the licence conditions. The relevant requirement was simple: within 12 months of getting the licence, mobile phone operators must make their cellular signals, and therefore the service, available in at least 10 per cent of each district headquarters in each telecom circle. Spectrum being scarce, this was necessary to ensure that licencees did not take the spectrum and not provide the requisite telephone service to the community. Remarkably, none of the six licencees has managed to roll out service as stipulated; some indeed have barely started operations. The 2G fiasco is thus strikingly complete.
The Manmohan Singh government has no option but to take serious note of the glaring non-performance by these companies. Perhaps it was inevitable they would fail, because as the CAG discovered, many of these companies did not have any experience in telecommunications. Revoking their licences would therefore be a rational and appropriate response. The case of one or two of the licencees who exerted themselves enough to accumulate a few million subscribers may be tricky, but even that is not beyond resolution. The spectrum that will be wrested back must be quickly put through as transparent an auction as defined the allotment of the third generation spectrum earlier this year. It requires no genius to predict that the government's take from the sale will be substantially larger than the Rs.12,386 crore it got in 2007-08. There will be nothing to fear for customers of the scratched companies; if the government were to facilitate number portability as promised, they can painlessly switch themselves to another service provider.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Flawed-process-failed-outcome/article15697004.ece
19,11,2010,Time up for Yeddyurappa,"At a time the Bharatiya Janata Party is taking the moral high ground on corruption, the land allotment scam in Karnataka involving Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa is turning out to be a severe embarrassment. No matter what party president Nitin Gadkari throws at the Congress and the United Progressive Alliance government on alleged corruption in 2G spectrum allocation, the Commonwealth Games, and the Adarsh Society, the BJP will be unable to gain any political advantage without acting decisively in Karnataka. Mr. Yeddyurappa faces serious allegations of nepotism and irregularities: wrongful de-notification of lands and allotment to family members. Moreover, his defence is weak, a political counter devoid of any legal merit. While acknowledging that his family members were benefitted, he claimed that his predecessors belonging to the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) too had made similar allotments. This line of defence makes a strong pitch for a thorough probe into all such instances of de-notification of land, but hardly absolves him of the charges of wrongdoing. Similarly, while the Chief Minister's announcement that his family members would surrender the lands is welcome, it cannot be used to gloss over the serious procedural irregularities and the legal infirmities in the original de-notification and allotments.
Against this background, the judicial probe ordered into such allotments seems to be a move to pre-empt the Opposition, which has taken the issue to the Lokayukta. The probe, which is to cover the period from 1994, when JD(S) leader Deve Gowda was Chief Minister, should not be used to deflect the allegations of corruption and nepotism. Mr. Yeddyurappa cannot seek to extend his stay in power on the ground that a fact-finding judicial exercise is on and some corrective measures have been taken. For the BJP, the land allotment scam could not have come at a more inopportune moment. Not only does this take the force out of its offensive against the UPA on the scams related to the 2G spectrum, the CWG, and the Adarsh Society, it also raises serious questions about the survival of the party's government in Karnataka. Even before the land scam, Mr. Yeddyurappa was clinging on to a slender majority in the Assembly through blatantly unsavoury means. A change at the helm could again result in a shake-up of the BJP's legislature party, and wreck its only government in the south. But whatever be the compulsions, Mr. Yeddyurappa will have to go in the interests of a clean and transparent administration in Karnataka. Whether the BJP will gain or lose on account of his exit is a matter of minor importance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Time-up-for-Yeddyurappa/article15697048.ece
27,11,2010,JPC is an imperative,"Insecurity, unreasonableness, and stubbornness tend to go hand in hand. Why else should the Congress-led government be dead set against allowing a Joint Parliamentary Committee to try and get to the bottom of the 2G spectrum scandal? With the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India exposing serious irregularities in the allocation of 2G spectrum, resulting in staggering losses to the exchequer, getting to the truth of what happened has become a moral imperative. While the Parliament's Public Accounts Committee will study the CAG report, this is no alternative to an empowered JPC that can call for all relevant records and summon Ministers, including the Prime Minister, for examination during the course of its enquiry. Moreover, it can probe the scandal in historical perspective — against the backdrop of telecom policy as it evolved, with twists and turns and sometimes carrying the stench of corruption, over a decade and a half. The government's negative response suggests a cover-up. As is evident from the observations of the Supreme Court in the spectrum case, the Central Bureau of Investigation is not doing an earnest job of investigating the matter. Nor will an inquiry by the Central Vigilance Commission carry conviction; the Supreme Court has questioned the appointment as Central Vigilance Commissioner of P.J. Thomas, who served as Telecommunications Secretary during the period of the scam and has a charge sheet pending against him. If, as the Congress and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam insist, A. Raja as Communications Minister only followed the 2G spectrum allocation policy set by BJP-led National Democratic Alliance regimes, it is all the more important for a JPC to go back to the formulation of the National Telecom Policy, 1994 and enquire into everything of material relevance from then on.
An empowered and well-staffed JPC has also become a political imperative. The United Progressive Alliance government faces a crisis of credibility; Parliament has been rendered dysfunctional; and the image of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, a leader with a clean personal reputation, has taken a beating. If a JPC can work sincerely and in a businesslike way — on a day-to-day basis, more or less — all significant facts relating to the 2G spectrum allocation affair can be placed before the people of India within the next two months. It bears recall that even the JPC set up to enquire into the Bofors scandal, which had nothing but cover-up on its mind and was boycotted by the Opposition, brought into the public domain a mass of information that proved invaluable to The Hindu's investigation. That the BJP-led government in 2001 did not concede the demand for a JPC into the Tehelka exposé can be no justification in the present situation. The questions involved in the 2G scam are far too serious to be allowed to become part of political tit for tat.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/JPC-is-an-imperative/article15717169.ece
27,11,2010,Counter-productive approach,"The United Nations Security Council's decade-long counter-terror policy has been counter-productive, says the world body's Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The conclusions in the annual report by Martin Scheinin, Professor of Public International Law, European University Institute, should prompt a rethink. Mr. Scheinin makes out a compelling case for a more inclusive approach, as in the 2006 Global Counter-terrorism Strategy and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. In focus in the report are the sanctions regime established by the UNSC as a response to the threat from the al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan and the 9/11 bombings in the United States. Under Resolutions 1267 and 1373, the member states are required to enact laws freezing the assets of individuals and entities that finance terrorist operations, or are associated with extremist bodies in any other manner.The Rapporteur argues that the overall sanctions regime amounts to a comprehensive legislation insofar as its prescriptions are unlimited in time and space. What was originally a reaction to a specific threat to peace from the al-Qaida and the Taliban has expanded and become an open-ended system that transcended territorial boundaries of states.
India's criticism was that the exercise of legislative power by the 15-member Security Council could upset the balance vis-a-vis the General Assembly. Moreover, the application of listing procedures for terrorist individuals and groups as also the denial of the right to appeal have drawn flak from the Council of Europe and the national human rights bodies. To that extent, both the regimes (under Resolutions 1267 and 1373) pose a threat to the protection of rights and the maintenance of international rule of law, says the Rapporteur. The risk that charity aid might be identified as indirectly funding terrorist outfits has served as an impediment to garnering global support for the Millennium Development Goals. Given the absence of a universal definition of terrorism, the broad-based and inclusive UN treaty system might provide a more effective avenue for global cooperation in combating terrorism than the Security Council. In the long run, this may ensure that the UN member states would discharge their multilateral obligations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Counter-productive-approach/article15717168.ece
29,11,2010,Lessons from Guangzhou,"India's record medal haul in the Asian Games, which follows a similar feat in the New Delhi Commonwealth Games in October, has provided the country with a fresh impetus to strive for sporting excellence. While the splendid efforts of some of India's sportspersons in Guangzhou deserve the fullest credit, a nuanced analysis of the overall performance must lead to introspection. The countries and regions that finished a slot above and below India in the medal standings — Kazakhstan with 18 gold medals and Chinese Taipei with 13 — are tiny, both geographically and in population size, compared with India. In the event, there can only be limited satisfaction in finishing sixth after bagging 64 medals, including 14 gold. While considering the record medal tally, it should be remembered that the contingent of 626 competitors was the biggest ever fielded by India, which competed in 37 of the 42 sports in the Games. That the country is yet to match world standards in most sports stares us in the face.
The disappointment in shooting, given the magnified image of a highly successful group of marksmen in the Commonwealth Games, where the standards are very low in certain events, was more than compensated by the pleasant surprises provided by the athletes and the rowers. The strong showing by the boxers, led by Olympic bronze medallist Vijender Singh, stood out while tennis player Somdev Devvarman played way above his ranking for his double gold success. The need to send a contingent numbering almost 900, including officials, should be debated while reviewing India's performance. The Sports Authority of India, which projected a medal haul in the range of 74-108, can have the satisfaction that it did not fall too short in its forecast. Yet a thorough re-appraisal is needed to ascertain the manner in which so many also-rans were cleared at government cost. As expected, China did not only host a memorable event where its third largest city invested $17.90 billion in Games-related infrastructure and everything went like clockwork; it also topped the medals table with a total of 416, including 199 gold and 119 silver. But then China is a world sports superpower. For India, it is time to think of pumping more money into infrastructure across the country rather than beefing up Delhi's existing facilities in a futile exercise to bid for multi-billion dollar, multi-discipline international events sometimes begrimed by scams. Athletic excellence comes at a cost and the immediate goal should be to provide for talented young athletes who are crying out for financial support as well as scientific backup and training. Much can be learnt from how China and South Korea went about overhauling Japan to become Asia's top sporting powers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Lessons-from-Guangzhou/article15719844.ece
29,11,2010,Checking the contagion,"Even as Ireland braces itself to climb out of a deep, debt-burdened crisis, a comparison with Greece that had plunged into a crisis in May becomes inevitable. There are striking similarities between the two Euro zone economies. In terms of size, both account for a small portion of the Euro zone's GDP. Yet as in the case of Greece, the ramifications of the Irish crisis are being felt well beyond Europe. Almost certainly, global institutions such as the IMF will complement the efforts of bigger European nations in rescuing the Irish economy just as they did in Greece. In both, the economic crisis has been accompanied by a deep political one. There was a change of government in Greece and, with the likelihood of the Irish government calling for elections, there is a great deal of uncertainty. The austerity packages involving substantial cuts in social sector spending and higher taxes are part of the bitter medicine that crisis-hit nations have to swallow to qualify for bail-outs. For all these similarities, Ireland, till recently referred to as the ‘Celtic tiger', is different from Greece in many other ways. Fiscal imprudence, in the form of vastly enhanced public spending even after achieving full employment some years ago, pushed up wages and costs to uncompetitive levels. The housing bubble that followed was inflated by some extremely reckless lending by the leading banks, which are now in deep financial trouble.
In fact, the epicentre of the Irish economic crisis is in its financial sector. In circumstances very similar to what obtained in the U.S. during the sub-prime crisis, the Irish government has assumed control of three of the leading domestic banks, and guaranteed the liabilities of the entire financial sector until 2011. This , however, has not stabilised the system. As bank losses from real estate mount, there are fears the government may not be able to infuse the massive capital that will be required to save them. With the government finding it difficult to borrow at competitive rates — bond yields are at very high levels — the possibility of a sovereign debt crisis emerging has become real. That in turn could lead to a run on banks in some of the other European countries with troubled economies. Besides, the banks in the better-off countries such as Germany, France and the U.K. that have large exposures on Ireland are bound to suffer. The Irish crisis has once again shown that in a globalised world it is becoming increasingly difficult to check the contagion from spreading across national boundaries.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Checking-the-contagion/article15719871.ece
30,11,2010,The public has a right to know,"Thanks to WikiLeaks and ‘Radiagate,' a significant treasure trove of classified or privately held information with the potential to affect the lives of millions of people has been brought into the public domain. To be sure, the two sets of documents — diplomatic cables in one instance, audio recordings in another — pertain to vastly different subjects. But both provide a much-needed glimpse into the real world — especially the real and often illegitimate interests that lie hidden behind the diplomatic niceties, political correctness, and corporate PR that dominate international and domestic messaging. The leaks we have seen and those that are yet to come are unlikely to alter any of fundamental balances. Nevertheless, it is also true that as a result of these disclosures, the task of those who use misinformation, manipulation, and deception in the exercise of global, political, and corporate power has become a wee bit harder. That is why legal and even strong-arm tactics — the cyber equivalent of which is hacking and denial of service attacks — have been employed to stop this information from being made public. In the case of WikiLeaks — a not-for-profit media organisation that says its goal is “to bring important news and information to the public” — its founder, Julian Assange, has found himself at the receiving end of police investigations and other more subtle forms of harassment. In the case of Radiagate, an industrialist who is not pleased with what he and his lobbyist are heard saying in secretly recorded telephone conversations has asked the Supreme Court to order a CBI investigation into how the material leaked and to pass a restraint order on further publication of the recorded conversations that would affect his right to privacy.
As far as WikiLeaks itself is concerned, Mr. Assange has shown himself to be a more than skilful player in the game of dissemination. In his latest effort, five respected media outlets in five separate countries were selected to bring the vast archive of diplomatic cables and memos before the international public in a phased and systematic manner. Thanks to this approach, what might have been a messy data dump has become an archivist's dream. Readers around the world who click on links on the WikiLeaks website or the websites of The Guardian, The New York Times, El Pais, Der Spiegel, or Le Monde can read for themselves cables that were meant to be shielded from public view for anywhere from 10 to 30 years. If newspapers are the first draft of history, the cables are the manuscripts and marginal notations that go into the making of that first draft. What we are seeing then, in a small way admittedly, is the democratisation of information as well as the production of information. The world, and our knowledge of it, would be impoverished if WikiLeaks and other channels of communication between whistleblowers and the rest of us were to be shut down or terminated.
The diplomatic cables provide a fascinating glimpse into the world that floats below the surface of headlines. Every day, diplomats from around the world send in to their headquarters candid assessments of what is going on in their host country. The lazier envoys do little more than reproduce gossip while the more gifted send reports full of verve and wit. Daniel A. Russell's confidential cable, ‘A Caucasus Wedding,' sent from the U.S. embassy in Moscow in July 2006, is a splendid example of long-form reporting worthy of The New Yorker, whose publication is likely to guarantee its author a decent post-retirement literary career. Even the gossipy ones provide insight and amusement, like the reference in a cable from Rome describing the unusually deep friendship between Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as a ‘bromance.'
On a more serious note, it is essential that analysts and policymakers pay close attention to the political content of the leaked cables. The candour used in these dispatches may offend some and titillate others but they reveal a nation at sea in a world that is no longer willing to march to its tune. We learn, for example, that America frets over not just what Beijing or Moscow thinks or does on a crucial question like Iran. Ankara and Berlin are also seen as potentially dissonant hothouses. American helplessness is writ large in the cables we have seen from Kabul and Islamabad. We know, for example, that Washington was worried that radioactive material in nuclear power stations in Pakistan could fall into the hands of terrorists but that Pakistani authorities refused to give the United States access to a research reactor for fear that local media coverage of the removal of highly enriched uranium would fuel public suspicions about an American takeover of Pakistani nuclear weapons. The revelation that many Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, are concerned about Iran's nuclear programme is not really new but their strident advocacy in private meetings with American diplomats of military force is worrying. So also is the news that the U.S. is seeking to spy on senior United Nations officials. Apart from a Hillary Clinton cable referring to India, Japan, Germany, and Brazil as “self-appointed front-runners” for a permanent seat in an expanded U.N. Security Council and a cable from Ankara confirming that Turkey kept India out of a regional meeting on Afghanistan in deference to Pakistani sensitivities, there is little in the disclosures so far to discomfit New Delhi. But when the 3,000-odd dispatches sent by the U.S. Embassy in India are published over the next 48 hours, it is possible that some or many feathers will end up ruffled. Elements of the strategic partnership — especially those pertaining to defence and the wider set of American goals involved — remain cloaked in secrecy. Stay tuned to this space.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-public-has-a-right-to-know/article15720986.ece
1,12,2010,Environmentalists vs nuclear power,"The drive to enhance nuclear power in India is a result of many factors, including the burgeoning demand for energy, diminishing fossil fuel reserves, and the need for a cost-effective alternative to generate electricity on a large scale. Non-conventional energy sources must be tapped to the fullest extent but there is no viable alternative to nuclear power if we are going to bridge the enormous energy deficit, projected to touch 150,000 megawatts by 2030. Environmentalists as a group tend to range themselves against nuclear power; and paradoxically, this ideologically determined stance works against their own declared objectives. Existing alternatives for large-scale power generation such as hydroelectric projects often bring massive deforestation and displacement of people; and emissions from coal-fired plants are a major contributor to harmful greenhouse gases. The Union Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) has done well to resist pressures from various environmental groups to scupper the 6x1650 MW nuclear power project in Jaitapur in Maharashtra. The environmental clearance granted to the project, the first concrete outcome of the decision of the Nuclear Suppliers' Group to lift restrictions on civil nuclear cooperation, has come after a serious hearing of apprehensions over its environmental impact. Clearance has also been accompanied by as many as 35 conditions and safeguards of a general as well as specific nature.
There are legitimate environmental concerns over nuclear power generation. It is supremely important to ensure safety by strict adherence to international protocols on the design, construction, and operation of plants. Then there is the issue of final disposal of radioactive waste, which waits to be resolved through advances in technology that seek to transmute such waste into non-radioactive elements. The MoEF has correctly assessed that the nuclear power plant is only one environmental issue relating to the ecologically sensitive region around Jaitapur, where many development projects are being planned. It has underlined the importance of conducting assessment studies on the cumulative environmental impact and on the carrying capacity of regions — an approach that recognises that while environmental clearance is granted for specific projects, any panoptic ecological strategy must be based on a broad study of the region. In laying down strict safeguards while clearing the Jaitapur plant, Union Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh has wisely taken the middle ground, which, in his words, “attempts to reconcile the objectives of economic growth, fuel-mix diversification, global diplomacy, and environmental protection.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Environmentalists-vs-nuclear-power/article15575549.ece
1,12,2010,China and North Korea,"Intense international attention is being given to WikiLeaked remarks, by the South Korean Vice Foreign Minister to the U.S. Ambassador in Seoul, that China's support for the DPRK is declining. Apparently Beijing does not wish to antagonise the U.S. and other trading partners by supporting a nuclear-armed state that it no longer sees as a buffer between it and its ideological enemies, and furthermore does not relish the idea of receiving North Korean refugees if the DPRK implodes. The Minister even added that China would not oppose Korean reunification. The comments are all the more relevant in view of the recent exchange of North-South shellfire in the Yellow Sea. The revelations bring into question the received wisdom that China protects North Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, against a hostile U.S.-backed South Korea. China itself has called for an urgent meeting of the six countries that used to participate in the now-stalled talks on denuclearising the Korean peninsula.
The reactions to the Chinese call, however, show very different forces at work. Japan's Foreign Minister has rejected it, saying that North Korea has “run amok.” This matches the anti-Northern attitude taken by South Korea since President Lee Myung-bak took office in February 2008. Seoul, for its part, says talks cannot resume until Pyongyang admits that it sank the Southern corvette Cheonan in March. Secondly, Mr. Lee stopped aid to the North as soon as he became President, ending the ‘Sunshine Policy' initiated by President Kim Dae-jung and continued by President Roh Moo-hyun. Thirdly, the marine border in the Yellow Sea, the Northern Limit Line, was unilaterally drawn by the United Nations in 1953. Running north of five islands near the Northern coast, it gives the South bases for spying on the North. It also enables South Korea and Japan to fish in the area, threatening the DPRK's fishing-based export income. A fresh provocation is the U.S. despatch of its aircraft carrier George Washington for U.S.-South Korean war-games in the Yellow Sea. As happens often at such times, influential sections of the international media are headlining the shellfire and the leaked cables while downplaying the fact that Seoul's forces opened fire, apparently towards the sea, and ignore the fact that South Korean Ministers do not make policy for China. The picture that emerges is of an orchestrated attempt by Washington and its allies to sever the Sino-North Korean link — an outcome that sounds very much like wishful thinking in light of the overall evidence.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/China-and-North-Korea/article15575547.ece
2,12,2010,Pakistan WikiLeaks no comfort to India,"The WikiLeaked U.S. diplomatic cables about Pakistan confirm much that was suspected about the relationship between the two countries — worse than troubled, built on mutual suspicion and fear of the capabilities of one to do harm to the other. As long as it was only journalists writing about it, both still had the luxury of denial, which they duly used when reports first began to surface about American fears that Pakistani nuclear weapons or material might fall into the hands of Islamist militants. Officials in Washington publicly certified that the nuclear weapons of its most important ally in the Afghan war were safe in the hands of the country's military; Islamabad lashed out against what it characterised as “scurrilous” and “motivated” journalism. But the wealth of detail in the cables lays it all bare. The communications expose the depth of U.S., Russian, and European fears about extremists laying their hands on Pakistan's nuclear weapons. Not just that. They tell about the tensions over Pakistan's “diversion” of U.S. Coalition Support Funds for operations in the tribal areas. They reveal how Pakistani leaders see the U.S. as a key player in internal politics and at the same time expose American helplessness in dealing with a country where the Army calls the shots and runs four militant networks, one expressly for use against India. The Americans could only express frustration when the Pakistani military establishment decided to punish Washington for its civilian financial assistance to the government through the Kerry-Lugar legislation. U.S. officials were denied visas; the embassy in Islamabad had to wait for permits for import of armoured vehicles, and suffer the humiliation of staffers' cars being frequently stopped and checked at security points.
Beyond the discomfiture for both sides, it is unsettling to know that the war on terror is led by two countries whose relationship is based on animosity rather than trust. For India, particularly for those who seek peace with Pakistan, it raises some troubling questions. In one cable, Anne Patterson, the U.S. Ambassador in Islamabad until recently, makes the observation that money cannot change the Pakistan military's view of India as the main external threat, nor stop its sponsorship of the Lashkar-e-Toiba and three Taliban groups in Afghanistan. In her view, resolving the Kashmir issue and reassessing the Indian role in Afghanistan will be more helpful. The most obvious worry for New Delhi is the knowledge that the U.S. has no leverage with Islamabad to safeguard India's security concerns vis-à-vis Pakistan-based terrorist groups. Resolving the Kashmir issue should be a priority for political India irrespective of Pakistan. What is most troubling is that as long as Pakistan remains in the grip of its military, amity between the two neighbours is likely to remain elusive.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Pakistan-WikiLeaks-no-comfort-to-India/article15576705.ece
2,12,2010,Raising the bar,"A high level committee headed by former Reserve Bank Governor Bimal Jalan, which looked into governance and ownership issues relating to market infrastructure institutions (MIIs), has come out with prudent recommendations that should reassure investors. The market infrastructure in India has three components — stock exchanges, clearing corporations and depositories. Of these, stock exchanges have undergone a huge transformation in the reform era because of the large increase in the number of investors and share volumes, which in turn required a considerable infusion of both technology and capital. One important change has been the conversion of stock exchanges from mutual entities and associations of brokers into demutualised corporates with shareholders. A distinctive feature of the new set-up is the total separation of trading, management, and ownership rights. The number of stock exchanges has shrunk: there are only two main ones, the BSE and the NSE, both having trading terminals across India. With the possibility of new exchanges coming up, there is a need to prescribe new rules of ownership and governance.
The Committee suggests the raising of entry level barriers for the new exchanges. Only financial institutions and banks with a net worth of Rs.1,000 crore could become anchor investors, owning up to 24 per cent of the capital in the first instance to be reduced to 15 per cent over 10 years. Interestingly, both on- and off-balance sheet items of an entity are to be considered while calculating the limits of shareholding. That should reduce the scope for financial engineering. There will be a cap on the profits that the MFI shareholders can enjoy and on the remuneration of top executives of the exchange. Trading and clearing members will be ineligible to serve on the boards and the number of public interest directors should be at least equal to those representing the shareholders. No stock exchange will be allowed to list, a recommendation that should put an end to a long-standing controversy over conflict of interest. Stock exchanges and other MIIs will have to fulfil the disclosures and corporate governance requirements of the listing agreement applicable to public companies. Clearly, the Jalan Committee has taken note of the fact that stock exchanges will continue to have regulatory functions. The bar has to be kept high to admit only genuine players.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Raising-the-bar/article15576704.ece
3,12,2010,Justice cannot be relative,"By paraphrasing Marcellus' famous line in Shakespeare's Hamlet, the Supreme Court has shown its extraordinary annoyance about the state of affairs in the Allahabad High Court. The Division Bench, comprising Justices Markandey Katju and Gyan Sudha Mishra, made two inter-connected points to support the contention that “something is rotten in the Allahabad High Court.” One was the number of complaints about the lack of integrity in a section of the judges, something the Bench said the Chief Justice of the High Court must take action on. The other was that some judges have their friends and relatives practising as lawyers in the court — a state of affairs that, it noted, has resulted in such people becoming “multi-millionaires,” with “huge bank balances, luxurious cars [and] huge houses.” The reference here is to a pernicious and entrenched phenomenon, which the Law Commission, in its 230th report, referred to as “uncle judges.” Uncle judges are the inevitable result of the practice of appointing district judges and those who have practised as lawyers in a High Court as a judge of the same High Court. As the Law Commission observed, “impartiality and justice is the loser” when “judges either settle their scores with advocates who have practised with them or have a soft corner for them.”
Astonishingly, the phenomenon of uncle judges persists despite the Bar Council of India Rules, 1975, which state that advocates should not plead before a court if related to the judge. Moreover, the Supreme Court's charter of values, adopted in 1997, prohibit judges from permitting close relatives to appear before them. The Judicial Standards and Accountability Bill, which is pending in Parliament, will make it illegal to be an uncle judge. Section 3 of the proposed legislation specifically bars a judge from permitting “any member of his immediate family (including spouse, son, daughter, son-in-law or daughter-in-law or any other close relative) who is a member of the bar to appear before him or be associated in any manner with any case to be dealt by the judge.” An important reason behind the mass transfer of 30-odd High Court judges this September and October carried out in the “public interest” by the Supreme Court collegium was that many had kith and kin practising in the same court. But while transfers can check nepotism, they are hardly an effective way of checking other forms of judicial misconduct — most often, they only shift the problem from one court to another. What is needed is a quick and effective mechanism for dealing with judicial misbehaviour, something that the proposed legislation promises. This is why no time must be lost in passing it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Justice-cannot-be-relative/article15577891.ece
3,12,2010,Acquiring memorabilia,"A year after some Mahatma Gandhi memorabilia were auctioned for large sums of money and the dust of controversy surrounding this settled, the Government of India has, in a draft policy, outlined its position on the future acquisition of personal objects of iconic national leaders. It has proposed to stay away from any auction of memorabilia, thus refusing to aid in any way their commercial exploitation. This change of stance makes good sense. Personal objects associated with the towering figures of the Indian freedom struggle do have emotional and symbolic value. But the question is: should the state get involved in buying all of them? Institutions such as the Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya Samiti, which runs the National Gandhi Museum, are committed to preserving the memory of leaders by acquiring and exhibiting their personal objects. Instead of getting directly involved in obtaining memorabilia, the state can limit its role to extending financial support to such institutions. What is of concern is that the draft policy, after advocating a hands-off approach, appears to dilute its stand by proposing a series of ad hoc measures that will enable the government to actively define the landscape of memorabilia.
The proposal is to direct institutions such as Gandhi Smriti and Darshan Samiti, the autonomous body chaired by the Prime Minister whose mission is to propagate Gandhian thoughts and prepare an inventory of important personal objects of iconic Indian leaders. After amending the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act (1972), the government will designate select objects from this list as art treasures. This, it hopes, will bring in the fear of “severe legal consequence” and deter auctioning of memorabilia, including those legitimately possessed by the owners. Tinkering with an outdated Act, enacted for a completely different purpose, to include memorabilia of every kind cannot be regarded as conceptually sound. What is required is a thorough overhauling of the Act and a tightly reasoned, operational definition of national treasure that can be applied objectively. In this context, a critical study of the Waverley Criteria, adopted by the United Kingdom to identify nationally important cultural objects, should help. The entire process must be guided by a clear-sighted and comprehensible policy that establishes the priorities of the government with respect to cultural objects. Simultaneously, museum infrastructure, which is mostly in a poor state, must be revamped and contemporised, learning from the inspiring experiences of countries like the U.K.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Acquiring-memorabilia/article15577890.ece
4,12,2010,A crisis of his own making,"A crisis of his own making was the last thing on Kiran Kumar Reddy's mind when he took oath as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. While preparing for some political trouble on the Telangana issue, and in the midst of handling the after-shocks of the breakaway of the Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy faction of the Congress, Kiran Kumar found himself facing a serious revolt within his own Cabinet. Several senior Ministers, unhappy with the portfolios allocated to them, threatened to resign, alleging “glaring imbalances” in the distribution of important Ministries. For Kiran Kumar, giving in to such pressure tactics would have meant starting from a position of weakness. But rejecting the demands out of hand would have triggered a full-scale political crisis. Eventually, the young Chief Minister won a breather on the strength of nothing more than promises. In this, he got more than adequate help from the Congress high command, which understood the need to strengthen his hands for the political challenges ahead. The B.N. Srikrishna Committee has promised to submit its report on the future of Telangana by year-end, and Andhra Pradesh needs to prepare itself for a spell of uncertainty and even turbulence. If the rebels within the Cabinet hold their peace for a couple of months as agreed, the government can concentrate on getting its priorities right. Issues relating to the dominance of any one caste or section — Reddys, in this case — in the Cabinet are not intractable, and some deft handling should see them out of the way.
That none of the rebel Ministers joined hands with Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy was a huge relief for Kiran Kumar and the Congress. Thus far, Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy's son, who is single-minded in his belief that he has an entitlement to the Chief Minister's office, has not been able to win big support from the organisational structures of the party. Although Jaganmohan drew impressive crowds during his ‘Odarpu yatra', he could not win the backing of the members of the Legislative Assembly. It was certainly naïve on his part to assume that the YSR support base, built over a period of time on a host of issues, would automatically become a launch pad for his own political ambitions. Jaganmohan's hope now is that disgruntled elements in the Congress will, sooner or later, make common cause with him. That cannot of course be ruled out. However, in a fluid situation, if the new Chief Minister manages to get his act together, resolve the portfolio allocation issues fairly and smoothly, and face the Telangana challenge maturely, he can move on to the ambitious agenda of people-oriented and transparent governance he has promised. At this moment, this looks like a very big ask.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-crisis-of-his-own-making/article15579209.ece
4,12,2010,On a higher trajectory,"A better-than-expected GDP growth of 8.9 per cent during the second quarter (July-September) of the current fiscal year seems to confirm that the Indian economy is now placed firmly on a higher growth path. With the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) simultaneously hiking its estimate for the first quarter also to 8.9 per cent, the overall figure for the first six months is significantly higher than the 7.5 per cent recorded over the same period last year. Both official and non-official forecasters of growth are set to revise upwards their estimates for the whole year. The government and the RBI have both projected 8.5 per cent in 2010-11. While industry and services have grown by 9 per cent and 9.6 per cent respectively, the surprise has been agriculture which grew by 4.4 per cent, thanks to satisfactory monsoons and a good kharif crop. The farm sector had registered less than one per cent growth during the corresponding period last year and had kept down the overall growth over the previous two years. Its revival, therefore, should bring hope to policymakers that the recent acceleration in growth can be sustained.
However, the showing of the manufacturing sector, a star performer in the industries segment, is cause for some concern. While it has grown by 9.81 per cent between July and September compared with 8.36 per cent over the same period last year, it is sharply lower than the nearly 13 per cent it clocked in the first quarter. Some see in this sequential fall signs of declining investments, which will be reflected in the data for the third quarter. In this, they are guided by parameters such as a decline in factory output and a much slower increase in credit off-take from the banking system. It is also likely that the steady increase in the short-term interest rates by the RBI is making an impact. However, even though inflation concerns continue to be dominant, further interest rate hikes in the near future have been ruled out. On the demand side, there is some buoyancy. The services sector — especially its sub-segments of trade, hotels, transport and communications — leads the way but there is strength across the board. Even the segment ‘community services, social and personal services', which is seen as a proxy for public spending, has held its own, although it is lower than last year, when it benefited from the stimulus package. Further evidence of the economy moving into a higher trajectory is seen in the sharp rebound in the output of six core industries for which data have been released.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/On-a-higher-trajectory/article15579210.ece
5,12,2010,Digital McCarthyism,"It has been one long battle for WikiLeaks merely to exist on the Internet since it started publishing the U.S. diplomatic cables. The cat-and-mouse game that it has had to play to retain an accessible address in cyberspace is the result of a virulent attack launched by right-wing lawmakers in America and their supporters, and commercial entities such as Amazon, which caved in to the pressure. But more fundamentally, the WikiLeaks saga represents the acid test for free speech. With each tranche of documents published online, the world is witnessing the total loss of dominance of secretive governments over information. The backlash has come swiftly, with bellicose American Senators engaging in plain intimidation to get commercial entities to stop offering services to WikiLeaks on the ground that it is distributing material it does not own. Some politicians have made a jingoistic pitch and called for the execution of the source of the leaks. This is nothing but Digital McCarthyism. Were it not for the threat it poses to the free Internet, it would even appear amusing. Earlier this year, President Barack Obama was ‘troubled' by the cyber attacks on Google, which were said to originate in China, and wanted those responsible to face the consequences. The more freely information flows, the stronger society becomes, he had said during an earlier visit to China. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was also strongly critical of Internet restrictions in China. Now the boot is on the other foot. Concern for free speech is nowhere in evidence as extra-legal methods are deployed to deny Americans their First Amendment rights.
The campaign against WikiLeaks is a clear move to censor political material on the Internet and, potentially, on other media. The first moves made by lawmakers such as Senator Joe Lieberman, who chairs the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, have no legal foundation and yet have succeeded with Amazon and PayPal. What has followed is shockingly repressive and obscurantist. The Library of Congress blocked access to WikiLeaks across its computer systems, including reading rooms, and Columbia University students aspiring for diplomatic careers have been advised not to comment on, or link to, the whistleblower website's revelations. It is doubly tragic that such concerted attacks are securing support from countries with a progressive legacy such as France. The intolerant response to WikiLeaks is a potential threat to all media and must be fought. Senator Lieberman and other lawmakers have introduced legislation that proposes to make the publication of an intelligence source a federal crime. Already, U.S. law allows the shutting down of some Internet domains managed in that country on grounds of infringement of copyright. The threat to the publication of inconvenient material, even with responsible redactions, is all too real.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Digital-McCarthyism/article15582961.ece
5,12,2010,Green infrastructure,"India must make a strong case at the ongoing U.N. Climate Change Conference in Cancun for substantial international funding for carbon mitigation. There is justified disappointment that the developed countries have not delivered on the promise of a $30 billion fast start fund made last year in Copenhagen and the commitments made so far are small. The tardy pace of action on mitigation makes it all the more necessary for emerging economies, which are under pressure to reduce their emissions, to push for a stronger plan for funding and technology transfer. India is pursuing the goal of a reduction of at least 20 per cent in carbon emission intensity by 2020 (over 2005 levels). It has the opportunity not merely to reduce carbon intensity, but to improve the quality of life for citizens through green infrastructure. Given the scale of what is needed, it should make energy-efficient choices today, not put off such decisions. This is essential to avoid lock-in effects that raise long-term emissions.
The experience of the developed countries demonstrates that lock-in effects are felt particularly in two major areas, power generation and design of urban development. In this context, data from just three countries with high per capita incomes but different emission rates make it evident that development need not involve high carbon pollution. While per capita carbon dioxide emissions for 2006 stood at 19.5 tonnes in the United States, they were 9.1 tonnes in the United Kingdom and 6.4 tonnes in France. This has resulted primarily from the kind of urban form chosen in the early part of the 20th century, of sprawl versus compact cities. The models for road-building and transport options have obviously come with different carbon consequences. These are lessons that should impel India to view urban development, housing infrastructure and transport as crucial determinants of future emissions. Clean energy is another key goal, but success here will depend on the availability of improved technologies that will reduce emissions from coal-based power plants, and enable capture and storage of carbon. These objectives must become core components of the National Action Plan on Climate Change, adding to the emphasis on efficiency and investment in renewable options. Cleaning up coal emissions and improving power plant efficiency will depend on access to newer technologies. The opportunity to pursue the agenda for collaboration, funding and research at Cancun needs to be seized.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Green-infrastructure/article15581934.ece
6,12,2010,Renewed hope for START,"President Obama and Senator John Kerry, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have done well to give new life to the U.S. congressional ratification process for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) with Russia — by negotiating intensively with a number of Republican Senators. That group had concerns about the modernisation of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and the Russian deployment of short-range tactical nuclear weapons near NATO missile positions in central Europe, but many of them have now confirmed that they can consider supporting START when it is put to the Senate for consideration later this month. Ratification, which will need 67 of the 100 Senate votes, therefore seems more likely than it was a few weeks ago; at that time, the Senate Republican whip, John Kyl of Arizona, said he would oppose it, thereby intensifying his party's resistance to the treaty. Mr. Kerry, writing for the Boston Globe, has pointed out that the treaty will introduce a tight monitoring and verification system while the current agreement, which dates from 2002, has no such procedure; that there will be no impediment to any future U.S. missile defence strategy; and that without agreement on strategic arms reduction it will be almost impossible to start negotiations on the reduction of tactical nuclear weapons.
The attitude of several other Republican Senators, however, reveals obscurantism at its worst. Their opposition runs counter to the backing START has received from a string of former secretaries of state, defence secretaries, and senior military commanders. Secondly, it is NATO's own plan to station missiles in Poland that has aggravated tensions across Russia's western borders and has brought about the threat of a Russian deployment of tactical nuclear-capable missiles. As for ratification, Senator Jim DeMint says he is prepared to block it with a filibuster or other procedural devices, and Mr. Kyl has said his possible support for START would be conditional on the extension of the Bush administration's temporary tax reductions. Nevertheless, if the ratification bill fails, the consequences will reach far beyond any divisions among the Senate Republicans or between them and the rest of their party. The global tensions caused by huge nuclear arsenals will be exacerbated; the improvements in Moscow-Washington relations, which Mr. Obama has pursued, will be endangered; and the already diminished international standing of the U.S. will be damaged further. There can be few better illustrations than this of the dangers posed to the world by the partisan obstructionism of a handful of reactionary Republican politicians.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Renewed-hope-for-START/article15583080.ece
6,12,2010,Effective prophylaxis,"A study involving nearly 2,500 HIV-negative men and transgender women having sex with men showed that a once-daily regimen of a combination pill containing two antiretroviral drugs (tenofovir and emtricitabine) can act as a good pre-exposure prophylaxis and prevent HIV infection. The two drugs are already being used for treating HIV/AIDS. The study was done in six countries — Brazil, South Africa, Thailand, the United States, Ecuador, and Peru. The study published online recently in The New England Journal of Medicine (“Preexposure chemoprophylaxis for HIV prevention in men who have sex with men,” by Robert M. Grant, et al.,) showed that the overall efficacy of the drug was 47 per cent. The protection level was 73 per cent when the drug compliance was 90 per cent or more. This demonstrated that a drug taken as pre-exposure prophylaxis can partly protect gay men from HIV infection. This is not the first time that antiretroviral drugs used as prophylaxis have been found to protect people against infection by the virus. In fact, their efficacy in preventing vertical transmission from HIV-infected pregnant woman to child has been proved beyond doubt, and the drugs are routinely being used today. A trial conducted in Botswana showed that providing infants with prophylactic antiretrovirals greatly reduced the chances of their contracting the infection through breastfeeding — nearly 40 per cent of HIV-infected children get the disease this way. The use of tenofovir as a microbicide was recently shown to provide 54 per cent protection where women used it more than 80 per cent of the time.
But unlike in these cases, the daily use of antiretroviral drugs as a prophylaxis by men who have sex with men should never be considered as a silver bullet even though the protection level can be as high as 73 per cent. A major concern is the real possibility of developing drug resistance from daily consumption of the drugs, especially by those who are already infected with HIV, as the trial revealed. Although reversible on discontinuation of medication, renal problems developed by a small fraction of volunteers turn the spotlight on the toxic effects associated with daily exposure to the drug for prolonged periods. These challenges can be partly overcome if intermittent use of antiretroviral drugs by gay men proves to be equally effective. A couple of clinical trials are currently under way to test this hypothesis. But irrespective of their outcome, proven methods such as abstinence, confining oneself to one partner, and using condoms during every sexual encounter should remain the cornerstone of HIV prevention.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Effective-prophylaxis/article15583079.ece
7,12,2010,"No doubting, Thomas should go","It is a matter of regret that P.J. Thomas has chosen not to do the decent thing given the murky circumstances — put in his papers. The Chief Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) may have got a breather with the Supreme Court posting to January 27, 2011 further hearing of a petition seeking his removal. But in previous hearings, the court asked deeply embarrassing questions about the appropriateness of his functioning as CVC, something that can be strongly contested on three separate grounds. First, there is the manner of his appointment. While he was selected by a panel comprising the Prime Minister, Home Minister, and Leader of the Opposition — as mandated by the Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003 — he was appointed by a majority, overruling the dissent recorded by Sushma Swaraj. Thus the very rationale for including the Leader of the Opposition in the selection process, which is evidently to arrive at a consensus in a non-partisan manner, was given short shrift. Secondly, what possible justification can there be to have a CVC, the country's highest administrative authority to inquire into corruption, with a charge sheet pending against him? True, the charge sheet in the palmolein import scandal goes back to 2000 and the lack of progress in the case has, perhaps unfairly, left his reputation in a limbo. But a failure in the criminal justice system, deplorable though it is, does not validate having someone accused in a criminal case functioning as the country's top anti-corruption watchdog. It also fails to satisfy the Supreme Court's requirement, in the landmark Vineet Narain case, that the CVC must be a person of “impeccable integrity.”
It would be unjust to make any presumption of Mr. Thomas' guilt. But his suitability for office stands demolished for a third reason — the ongoing CBI investigation into the 2G scam. While the licences for spectrum were issued before he took charge as Telecom Secretary, there are legitimate concerns about his failure strictly to enforce licence conditions, not to mention his strong defence of the allocation procedure. It is not enough for Mr. Thomas to have recused himself from the investigation into the award of the spectrum licences. As CVC, he exercises superintendence over the functioning of the CBI insofar as it relates to investigations of offences committed under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Given this, any CBI investigation into the 2G spectrum allocation will be in danger of seeming biased. The CVC's post is much too sensitive and important to be undermined by an appointment that should never have been made and an indefensible unwillingness to demit office.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/No-doubting-Thomas-should-go/article15517901.ece
7,12,2010,Jobs for the millions,"The recent findings by the Labour Bureau's Employment and Unemployment Survey (2009-10) provide timely pointers to the manner in which liberalising India's workforce is coping with the changing times. The survey gives a snapshot of the country's employment and demographic situation. The estimated unemployment rate — in the region of 9.4 per cent (barring the five north-eastern States and the islands of Lakshadweep and Andaman and Nicobar, where the survey was not done) — is a reminder that creating jobs for the millions will continue to be a fundamental challenge for policymakers. Although the global economic downturn offers itself as a ready explanation, the malaise runs deeper: the inability to come up with an effective rural employment strategy. Despite industrialisation, rural India remains the main employment provider. That the situation has not changed drastically in the two decades of reforms is evident from the survey results. First, it brings out the magnitude of unemployment; secondly, it turns the spotlight on the low availability of social security benefits for the Indian workforce.
Disaggregated data make it evident that rural India should remain the focus of policymakers. It is home to 72.26 per cent of the country's 238 million households, and 10.1 per cent of its labour force is unemployed, compared with 7.3 per cent in urban areas. The double-digit rural unemployment rate points to both an excess of labour that needs to be moved from agriculture and allied activities to manufacturing and services, and the declining role of the primary sector as an employment provider. In rural areas, agriculture continues to be the dominant employer (57 per cent), followed by construction (7.2 per cent), manufacturing (6.7 per cent), and community services (6.3 per cent). Although there is a case for strengthening well-conceived schemes guaranteeing minimum employment, they could at best be bridge solutions. Upgrading the skills of the rural workforce to enable it to match the requirements of the manufacturing and services sectors would provide more lasting results. Equally important is the survey's observation that the spread of social security cover is woefully inadequate — only a paltry 163 persons per 1,000 benefit from the various social security measures. This low coverage should remind policymakers that a lot more needs to be done for a workable social security system to be in place. Despite the recent initiatives, the challenges on the employment generation and the social security fronts remain largely unaddressed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Jobs-for-the-millions/article15584260.ece
8,12,2010,The French affair,"The agreement on building nuclear power reactors was always going to be the centrepiece of President Nicholas Sarkozy's visit to India. France was quick off the mark to conclude a civilian nuclear agreement with India in 2008; and the framework agreement signed between the French nuclear firm Areva and the Nuclear Power Corporation of India to build two of the six planned reactors in Maharashtra was an outcome of this. Some issues relating to the proposed $9.3 billion deal need to be ironed out; these relate to Indian safety and cost concerns over Areva's advanced but yet-to-be-proven EPR reactors as well as French discomfort with the civilian nuclear liability legislation recently adopted by the Indian Parliament. While nuclear commerce will be an important new component of the bilateral relationship, Mr. Sarkozy's visit gave both countries an opportunity to come closer on a broad range of bilateral and global issues. The full-throated reaffirmation of French support for India's permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council has been warmly received. The resolve to enhance bilateral cooperation in the G20 to make it an effective tool for overhauling the international monetary system and for stabilising commodity prices, and to work together in international forums on issues such as Afghanistan, terrorism, and climate change are indicators of deepening political ties. At least in principle, all this should help India achieve a better balance in external relations, which are at present seriously distorted by strategic over-dependence on the United States and a lack of clear commitment to a multi-polar world order.
On the economic front too, there were positive developments. France has traditionally tended to see India as a market for its arms manufacturers. A big item on President Sarkozy's agenda was to pitch Dassault's $10-billion bid to sell the Indian Air Force 126 Rafale fighter aircraft, and push a long-pending agreement to upgrade the IAF's existing Mirage fleet. But clearly, both countries recognise that it is in their mutual interest to broad-base economic relations. The two countries signed an agreement to increase investment on both sides, and resolved to take their trade to €12 billion by 2012. President Sarkozy was the third of the P-5 leaders to visit India this year — Russia and China are to follow later this month. While his visit lacked the hype that surrounded President Barack Obama's visit, it delivered much of substance. And Carla Bruni-Sarkozy's charisma and commendable work as ambassador for the Global Fund, which is engaged in the fight against HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, has won much appreciation among Indians.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-French-affair/article15585295.ece
8,12,2010,Unnecessary stand-off,"The stand-off between the government and the airlines has ended with the latter agreeing to roll back the hike in their fares for certain categories of travel. At the core of the controversy has been the high fares charged by all the airlines for travel on the same day or the next day. Airlines follow a dynamic, calibrated pricing model, offering low fares for travel booked well in advance and charging higher rates for tickets bought closer to the date of travel. It is quite understandable that fares for immediate travel should be high. But the magnitude of the increase the airlines effected in the “spot” fares on popular routes caused considerable consternation among travellers, which the government could not fail to notice. It is inexplicable, for instance, that one-way fare between Delhi and Mumbai could be as high as Rs.40,000, more than twice the return-airfare to international destinations such as Singapore and Bangkok. The airlines' argument that the fares are determined by the market forces of demand and supply and that, in any case, the fares were seasonal and applicable to a limited number of seats on a few select routes is hardly convincing. This single episode, seen by some consumer groups as a sign of growing cartelisation, clearly draws attention to lack of transparency in the functioning of airline operators in some key areas such as pricing of tickets.
The government's directive that all the relevant aspects of the fare structure should be placed by the airlines on their websites will certainly bring some transparency. But the operators must also convince the public that they are playing fair. Time was when a few airlines took on the Indian railways by matching the latter's higher class fares. A few also offered promotional fares that started as low as one rupee. Those practices did popularise air travel but could not obviously be sustained. In fact, declining profitability became a serious issue for many of the private airlines forcing them, unsuccessfully as it turned out, to seek bailouts from the government. There is indeed some substance in the argument that they are severely constrained by the high taxes on aviation turbine fuel and infrastructure deficiencies. But those are issues that admit of no quick or easy solutions. In any case, there are reports that two of the three full-service carriers and many of the low-cost carriers are returning to profitability. Unfortunately, Air India continues to be in dire straits and has not been able to moderate the spikes in airfares through effective competition.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Unnecessary-stand-off/article15586462.ece
9,12,2010,Shooting the messenger,"The high-profile arrest of besieged WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange could, in normal times, have been explained away as a bona fide step taken in furtherance of the due process of law. But these are extraordinary times, and the talented Editor-in-Chief of the whistle-blower website is the target of right wing and lunatic fringe politicians in America, some of whom want him assassinated. The charges against Mr. Assange will convince only the credulous. The accusations, by two women, of unlawful coercion, molestation, and rape in Sweden are highly suspect because of their timing and the way they have been pursued. All accounts of the sexual encounters suggest they were consensual and perhaps even planned. The charges were dropped after initial enquiry, but mysteriously revived. Across the Atlantic, of course, the campaign against WikiLeaks has been constructed around not concerns over women's rights but the website's sensational disclosures of highly embarrassing diplomatic cables. Repressive measures against WikiLeaks — such as booting it from Amazon's cloud computing servers, cutting off Paypal, Visa and Mastercard payment gateways, denying it an Internet domain name, and freezing an account held by the website in a Swiss bank — have been achieved through private, extra-judicial manoeuvres. This is what makes the arrest appear vindictive.
The vicious campaign to silence WikiLeaks through distributed denial of service attacks and threats of prosecution for espionage in the United States have produced the opposite effect, by provoking supporters of the website to mount a counter-offensive against the companies involved. The net outcome is a cyberwar where militant responses to continued repression are guaranteed. Western governments, especially those involved in calamitous wars abroad, could then succumb to temptation and institute authoritarian controls on Internet access. Now that the WikiLeaks Founder is in detention, Washington should not be allowed to come up with tendentious arguments to get him extradited to be prosecuted for espionage. As Noam Chomsky and several other prominent American citizens have pointed out to Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard, the rhetoric in the U.S. is increasingly violent and there are grave concerns about Mr. Assange's safety. At a broader level, the WikiLeaks challenge presents a clear choice to leaders and governments of western countries: to crack down on free speech in the name of official secrecy and national security or to make government more transparent and accountable. After all, tolerating what pleases you, or at least does not displease you strongly, is no big deal. How l'affaire Assange gets resolved will be the acid test for free speech in countries that claim to be liberal democracies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Shooting-the-messenger/article15600627.ece
9,12,2010,Political chicanery in Ivory Coast,"The risks of another civil war in Côte d'Ivoire have increased sharply, as the incumbent president, Laurent Gbagbo, refused to step down after losing the election to Alassane Ouattara — whose emphatic 54 to 46 per cent win has been confirmed by the United Nations. Mr. Gbagbo has persuaded the national constitutional council, headed by a crony, to annul the result of the Ivory Coast's first election in a decade. Mr. Ouattara and Mr. Gbagbo have been sworn in at separate events. The risks are exacerbated by memories of the previous conflict, which raged from 2002 to 2007 and intensified the country's North-South polarisation. In the Nigerian capital, Abuja, a seven-state emergency meeting of the regional economic grouping, the 15-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), has suspended Ivory Coast and called on Mr. Gbagbo to accept the election result; Ivory Coast was not represented at the meeting. The African Union, for its part, has nominated former South African President Thabo Mbeki as its mediator.
The U.N. Operation in Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI) has 9,000 troops but is limited mainly to monitoring and assistance, though it can confiscate arms and other matériel brought into the country in violation of a U.N. resolution. President Nicolas Sarkozy has asked Mr. Gbagbo to stand aside, but there is no word on whether France will call on the 600 or so French businesses in Ivory Coast to leave. The European Union is inclined towards preliminary actions that anticipate targeted sanctions. President Barack Obama has written to Mr. Gbagbo hinting at selective sanctions and advising him to accept the election result or face increasing international isolation. As for mediation, Mr. Mbeki's previous attempt in 2006 ended in failure. With a curfew imposed, all borders now closed, and foreign FM radio stations shut down, the country is virtually at a standstill. Rumours will fuel tensions, and as broadcasters like the BBC and Radio France Internationale have cut back on short-wave global transmissions, Ivorians may be cut off from external sources of news. Overseas trade and commodity markets will be affected, as Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer. But the greatest danger now is that almost any domestic incident could spark civil war, which may spill over into neighbouring countries — some of which have had their own recent internal conflicts. The world will be watching how this tale of political chicanery and authoritarianism unfolds and how it gets resolved.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Political-chicanery-in-Ivory-Coast/article15586494.ece
10,12,2010,For a thorough probe,"The probe ordered by the United Progressive Alliance government into whether the processes and procedures followed from 2001 by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) in the grant of licences and the allocation of spectrum were ‘right, fair and reasonable' is overdue. The one-member committee of retired Supreme Court judge Shivraj Patil will have an opportunity to examine the twists and turns of high-stake telecom policy at the behest of telecom companies, the total lack of transparency, and the redrawing of rules to benefit select corporate entities. There can now be little doubt that the telecom scandal — which was enabled by the hijacking of telecom policy by special interests — began soon after the advent of mobile telephony and the formulation of the National Telecom Policy, 1994. During the first few years, marked by high tariffs and low subscriber bases, the telecom companies operating in different telecom circles struggled with high project costs and low revenues. Under pressure from these companies, the Government of India came up with the New Telecom Policy, 1999, which was a strategic shift from the licence fee regime to a revenue-sharing model. Although the new policy led to a quantum jump in telecom operations, and brought increased revenues to both the operators and the national exchequer, the murky circumstances in which the policy change was made by the National Democratic Alliance government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party gave rise to serious misgivings in the public mind.
By fixing the period beginning 2001 for the probe, Union Minister for Communications and Information Technology Kapil Sibal is seeking to bring under the purview of the one-man committee DoT's grant of the fourth telecom licence for a price of Rs.1,651 crore. Mr. Sibal's predecessor, A. Raja, had used this as a precedent for the allocation of 2G spectrum at the same price on a first-come-first-served basis in 2008. Just as the flip-flop in the policy of the NDA government is suspect (a point made sharply by >Ratan Tata in his open reply to Rajeev Chandrasekhar's open letter to him: for the texts, see > www.thehindu.com), so also is the UPA government's continuation of an old policy under changed circumstances. Whether, post-2001, some or several political players made fortunes by changing policy or by sticking to the old policy against sound professional advice and common sense is a matter for the Central Bureau of Investigation to investigate and prosecute. However, the apprehension is that the telecom mega-scandal, whose roots go deep in our political system, could escape agencies that have limited remits or are politically manipulable. It is in this context that a comprehensive enquiry by a high-powered Joint Parliamentary Committee — where the opposition has free rein and where adversariality becomes a potent way of truth-discovery — becomes an inescapable democratic necessity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/For-a-thorough-probe/article15606939.ece
10,12,2010,Israel's mock helplessness,"President Barack Obama's attempts to mentor Israeli-Palestinian talks are in chaos following his administration's failure to persuade Israel to freeze construction of settlements for another 90 days. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu reached an agreement, with the former offering billions of dollars and diplomatic support. However, Mr. Netanyahu subsequently said that his Cabinet would not accept a freeze without further U.S. commitments, which he said should include 20 F-35 warplanes and a written pledge to veto United Nations resolutions calling for the recognition of a Palestinian state. It is not clear if the additional Israeli requirements relate to a moratorium — the original 10-month one covered only the West Bank and not East Jerusalem — or to a final peace deal but the U.S. did not meet the demands. In consequence, the talks that began with three meetings between Mr. Netanyahu and the Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas in September are indefinitely stalled. The Palestinians are refusing to engage in further direct talks unless construction is halted; and Mr. Abbas is threatening to dissolve the Authority if an agreement for Palestinian statehood cannot be reached.
Mr. Netanyahu will not be troubled by the stalemate or by criticism that he cannot control his Cabinet. That his Foreign Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, wants Israeli Arabs — about 20 per cent of Israel's population — compulsorily transferred to any future Palestinian state makes it easy for him to claim that his hands are tied. Mr. Netanyahu now says he cannot risk dismantling illegal settlements and facing a revolt by hardline soldiers. The results are already clear, with publicly funded rabbis endorsing a colleague's ruling that Jewish Israelis must not rent or sell property to Arabs. It is unlikely that Tel Aviv will take any action against such racist incitement. It is also increasingly obvious, as Noam Chomsky points out, that the so-called peace talks are not between the Palestinians and Israel with U.S. moderation, but instead have the Palestinians on one side facing Israel and its “grovelling” supporter, the U.S., on the other. Inevitably, Israel is encountering more explicit international opposition. Brazil and Argentina have recognised a de facto Palestinian state based on the 1967 pre-war borders, and Uruguay is to follow suit next year. Legitimate Palestinian claims to statehood cannot be resisted for much longer.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Israels-mock-helplessness/article15587929.ece
13,12,2010,The EU-India summit,"The relationship between India and the European Union does not have the same hyper-resonance as New Delhi's other bilateral relations. Yet, as the annual EU-India summit testifies, both sides are engaged on issues of vital importance. The 11th summit, for which Prime Minister Manmohan Singh flew to Brussels last week, was significant for several reasons. Both sides hope to conclude a free trade agreement by the spring of 2011. EU is among India's biggest trading partners. Last year, the two-way trade in goods and services was worth €69 billion. The 27-nation EU is also a big investor in India. The Broad Based Trade and Investment Agreement, in the works since 2007, aims to dismantle tariffs on most products traded by the two sides. Expectations are that it could push bilateral trade to as much as €100 billion. But the negotiations had stumbled on EU insistence over including a clause on sustainable development that would hold trade and investors to strict human rights, particularly labour rights, and environmental standards. India had resisted this. It is unclear if the joint declaration's reference to “significant progress” in the negotiations means the two sides have resolved the issue. The EU had indicated it would not let this condition stand in the way of the agreement, but it is in India's own interests to follow best practices while ensuring adequate protection to the interests of domestic trade and industry and the workforce. Both sides are also trying to negotiate two other major irritants — a dispute over intellectual property rights relating to Indian-made generic drugs, and the resistance of EU member-states to free movement of Indian professionals. The accommodation of Indian concerns on both is crucial to a satisfactory trade agreement.
This was the first EU-India summit to be held after the Lisbon Treaty came into force a year ago. Among other measures, the Treaty aims to raise EU influence in global affairs. Accordingly, the group has been eager to look beyond trade in its relations with India, and give it more political and strategic content. Cooperation in combating terrorism, the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, non-proliferation, disarmament, climate change, the role of G20 in global economic governance, and the proposed EU-India agreement on cooperation in the development of peaceful nuclear energy were all discussed at the summit. In recent years, the EU has signalled the willingness to play down what India sees as an overly activist attitude on the Kashmir issue — at this summit, it was not even mentioned. As it seeks to broaden ties with India, much will depend on how the EU tackles the challenge of reconciling the positions of its numerous member-states on important issues to present a coherent foreign policy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-EU-India-summit/article15591874.ece
13,12,2010,Sustaining people on the move,"Ubiquitous economic actions are often not studied enough. One such instance is the everyday process of people moving across international boundaries — either as students, workers, refugees or asylum-seekers. The World Migration Report, which estimates that the number of international migrants will swell from 214 million in 2010 to about 405 million by 2050, makes important and inter-related points. Despite a current slowdown owing to the global economic crisis, the international movement of people will continue. Consequently, there needs to be a focus on building capacities across states to support sustainable migration. One of the undercurrents directing the future of international migration is the expected slower growth in labour force in developed economies (where its strength is projected to remain at about 600 million until 2050), compared with the less developed countries (where it is expected to increase from 2.4 billion in 2005 to 3.6 billion in 2040). It is thus clear that the attention of policymakers should be aimed at putting in place structures providing for sustainable international migration.
Creating such systems requires the generation of key and accurate data, particularly relating to migration and labour market. Also useful would be properly defined national migration policies and priorities. For example, assessments of a country's work requirements, the expected areas of shortages, and the manner of sourcing them through international migrants can be made available. This, in turn, would help in the mainstreaming of migration into domestic and international policies. This is presently lacking in many countries. However, one welcome change is in the mindset of countries that complained of “brain drain” —they now see migrants as a source of economic value. Remittances by migrants, at $414 billion in 2009, are also set to increase, offering governments an opportunity to dovetail domestic development and, possibly, poverty reduction plans to such inflows. The report's observation that remittances have surpassed official developmental assistance in most of the non-rich world, barring sub-Saharan Africa, points to a positive outcome of migration for developing countries. There are attempts internationally to identify meaningful ways of channelling remittances towards development. India, which got $49,256 million by way of remittances in 2009 — the highest for any country — has a great opportunity to make the best of its enduring strength: an internationally productive labour force.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Sustaining-people-on-the-move/article15591873.ece
13,12,2010,A new beginning,"The United Nations Climate Conference at Cancun has done well to strengthen the multilateral process and restore much-needed momentum to negotiations on one of the biggest challenges faced by all countries. The preceding summit at Copenhagen dealt a severe blow to consensus-building by allowing rich countries to dominate the proceedings but Mexico has commendably steered the discussions at Cancun, providing an opportunity to the developing world to articulate its concerns. No major breakthrough was expected but the outcome of the conference is forward-looking. Two important decisions set the stage for measures to be taken beyond 2012, when the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ends. Under the Cancun Agreements, the targets set by industrialised countries for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions are recognised as part of the multilateral process. They must now draw up low-carbon development plans and strategies and also report their inventories annually. In the case of developing countries, actions for emissions reduction will be recognised officially; a registry will record and match their mitigation actions to finance and technology support from rich countries; and they will report their progress every two years. These form a good preamble for target-setting for all member-countries under an agreed framework at Durban next year.
India's Environment and Forests Minister Jairam Ramesh has suggested at the Cancun conference, apparently taking the long view, that some form of binding cuts on carbon emissions would have to be accepted by all countries in legal form. It would be wrong to read too much into this statement, since India has not acceded to any agreement. Both India and China have responsibly recognised their absolute carbon emissions and pledged voluntarily to transit to a green development path. India wants to cut its intensity of emissions relative to GDP. There is a grand national solar power generation plan for 2022 and a goal to double the share of nuclear power in a decade. That is positive — but much more has to be done in policy terms to raise efficiency and reduce emissions in, say, building and transport. China backs up climate goals with active support for low carbon technology development. Beijing recognises quite rightly that carbon cannot be cheap and that the bar for efficiency must rise constantly. For perspective, it needs to be borne in mind that by one measure, the United States is responsible for 27 per cent of historical emissions and China for 9.5 per cent. This underscores the point that the U.S. must lead the developed world in technology transfer and funding through the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. Only then will big players such as Japan and Russia, which have misgivings about a future role for the Kyoto Protocol, remain in the fold.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-new-beginning/article15590790.ece
13,12,2010,Scandals and stock markets,"The question whether the stock market is an adequate barometer for gauging the direction and pace of growth and the strength of an economy is far from settled. Economic fundamentals such as the rate of GDP growth, inflation, and export performance are no doubt closely watched by the markets but they are, at best, just one set of factors that drive stock prices. In a globalised environment, markets around the world take cues from one another. It would be difficult to correlate market behaviour with specific economic or political developments, however significant they might be. Yet, as seen in India, stock markets do appear sensitive to scandals and react even within a relatively short-time frame. The Sensex, which rose above 21,000 in early November and has had a roller-coaster ride since then, is now hovering around 19,500. Its latest show of volatility is largely attributed to the profusion of scandals. The ongoing investigations into the telecom scandal, the alleged bribery involving certain public financial institutions, and a recent market ban on some company promoters for insider-trading have all depressed sentiment and contributed to a fall in market capitalisation.
An evidence of the depressed sentiment was seen in the 454-point drop in the Sensex on December 9, its steepest one-day fall in six months. Analysts see in the recent, lacklustre performance of some older telecom stocks the effects of the controversial policy changes in allocating spectrum. Real estate companies have fallen from grace in the wake of allegations that they received loans by corrupt means. Given the opacity in the real estate business such allegations gain credibility. The scam is seen to be encompassing not only the real estate companies but also the banking system, which might be stuck with large non-performing assets. However, none of the gloomy prospects need necessarily materialise. All lenders to the real estate companies have vouched for the safety of their loans. Telecom companies, whose stock prices have fallen, might actually benefit from a revamped telecom policy that is fair and transparent. Stock exchanges will immensely benefit once up-to-date surveillance and monitoring systems are put in place and the manipulative practices curbed. The negative impact of scams on stock prices will be tempered if the markets take into account the benefits that will follow from an overall clean up of the regulatory system.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Scandals-and-stock-markets/article15590788.ece
14,12,2010,Offence as defence,"Congress President Sonia Gandhi has used a college debater's trick to attack the Opposition's demand for a proper investigation into the 2G telecom spectrum scandal. She has set up an Aunt Sally by equating their call with the act of denigrating the sanctity of the institution of Prime Minister in particular. The irony is that it is the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government that is weakening the institutional foundations of good governance in the country. First, the principle of Cabinet accountability was given the heave-ho by allowing a telecom Minister to run a freelance spectrum allocation policy despite the objections of several Ministries and of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh himself. Secondly, as the Supreme Court of India has noted, the supposedly independent Central Bureau of Investigation has allowed its investigative responsibilities to be compromised by political considerations — as its actions, and in particular the much-delayed searches in this case, show. Thirdly, the UPA government appointed as Central Vigilance Commissioner a man who is not only facing charges of individual wrongdoing but who also helped run the Ministry whose actions are being investigated by the CBI, which the CVC is meant to supervise. Fourthly, it has allowed senior Ministers and party spokespersons to cast aspersions on the quality of the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit account of 2G spectrum allocation.
Most damning of all, the Congress stands guilty of being a party to the paralysis that gripped Parliament in the last session as a result of the standoff with the Opposition over the formation of a Joint Parliamentary Committee. To be sure, one can question the Bharatiya Janata Party's track record in making telecom policy or its tactics in Parliament but the government has a responsibility to do all it takes to ensure the smooth functioning of the legislative branch. The Hindu has argued that the dimension and magnitude of the 2G scandal is so enormous that a parliamentary debate or a review of the CAG report by the Public Accounts Committee will not suffice. The PAC can do its work and Parliament can also conduct an open debate. But these cannot be a substitute for a comprehensive enquiry by an empowered JPC. While the CBI is investigating the criminality alleged and Justice Shivraj Patil is looking into the internal functioning of the Telecom Ministry, there is no agency other than the JPC that can investigate the wider murk of unethical behaviour involving politicians, corporate houses, lobbyists, and journalists from which the 2G scam eventually emerged. Instead of attacking the opposition, Ms Gandhi and Dr. Singh should reach out and clear the air so that the Budget session next year is not wasted in similar fashion.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Offence-as-defence/article15593036.ece
14,12,2010,Saina's magic year,"Saina Nehwal has caught the imagination of the masses, classes, and the media of cricket-crazy India. Her phenomenal rise to superstardom over the past year is a result of meticulous planning, methodical training, and great spirit. Her gold-winning match in the Commonwealth Games capped India's finest show in the multi-discipline event. The brilliant fightback in the final, cheered on by an unprecedented audience, not only enhanced her stock; it raised the profile of badminton across the country. On that day, the nation discovered a young, inspiring performer in a sport so familiar to its growing middle-class. The title helped overcome the disappointment of her unexpected quarterfinal-defeat in the Asian Games last month. The golden week in Hong Kong helped Saina settle a few scores: she avenged the loss in the Asian Games to Hong Kong's Yip Pui Yin and went on to get the measure of Wang Shixian, the Chinese woman who won the Asiad gold, and also handed out the Indian star her worst defeat of the year in the World championship quarterfinals in Paris in August 2010. Strangely, on her way to taking five major titles, including three in the prestigious Super Series this year, Saina was not required to beat a single higher-ranked player.
The year 2010, which witnessed Saina's rise to the second spot in world rankings before slipping a few rungs, has established her as a serious contender for the country's first-ever Olympic or World championship medal in badminton. Although the 20-year-old needs to improve her head-to-head record against the leading Chinese player, her growing self-belief indicates that she is ready to realise her ambition of being the world's best. Saina is now showing on court the world-beating qualities that Prakash Padukone revealed in the 1981 World Cup final against Han Jian. She and her coach, Gopi Chand, know only too well that in the coming year, they will have to contend with a better-prepared Chinese brigade. But Saina has a way of dealing with challenges. For example, what she lacks in on-court movements, she makes up with finely honed skills at the net. She has improved her stamina and speed but is modest enough to acknowledge that a lot of work needs to be done. Overcoming the odds comes naturally to Saina; she recently revealed that her grandmother was disappointed at her birth because she desired a grandson. Today the Hissar-born, Hyderabad-based young woman is inspiring thousands of girls across the country to chase their dreams.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Sainas-magic-year/article15595318.ece
15,12,2010,Farce in court,"Four years after Binayak Sen was arrested for his alleged links with the Maoists, the prosecution is struggling to present a case against the celebrated doctor and human rights activist. This was all too evident in its farcical attempt to link him to the Inter-Services Intelligence through an email correspondence between his wife and a person by the name of “Fernandes” in “ISI.” The trial proceedings are under way in the Raipur sessions court in Chhattisgarh. Either out of sheer ignorance or in a deliberate attempt to mislead the court, the chief prosecutor declared “we do not know who this Fernandes is, but ISI, as we all know, means Pakistan.” As Dr. Sen later explained, the ISI in this case stands for Indian Social Institute, and the email was addressed to Walter Fernandes, a former head of the New Delhi-based institute and a friend of his wife. But the prosecution appears to have been so taken up with the discovery that it even contended that the email, in which mention is made of “a chimpanzee in the White House,” was written in code, and possibly meant “terrorists are annoyed with the U.S.” All this would be laughable had this not been a trial that is viewed as an important test for Indian democracy. Dr. Sen, whose work as a medical practitioner among the poorest communities and as a defender of their rights is held up as exemplary public service, is being tried under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the Chhattisgarh Special Public Security Act. He is accused of conspiring to overthrow the state with two others accused in the case, Maoist leader Narayan Sanyal and a Kolkata businessman, Piyush Guha. The trial began in 2008 and, under the Supreme Court's orders, must be completed by January 2011. Dr. Sen was released on bail in May 2009, two years after his arrest and following a long public campaign; the other two are in jail.
While no attempt can be made to pre-empt the court, the proceedings in the case are eerily reminiscent of another notorious case in which the accused, Iftikhar Gilani, a well-known journalist, was held without bail from June 2002 to January 2003. What was cited as the main evidence against him was that he had in his possession a research paper available on the website of a Pakistani think tank. How material originating in another country could be categorised as an “official secret” of the Indian state was never explained. Mr. Gilani was released when the Ministry of Home Affairs had no option left but to withdraw the case — “for administrative reasons and in the public interest” — as it became obvious there was no evidence against him. Clearly, and to its own detriment, the Indian state has yet to learn the lessons from that case.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Farce-in-court/article15594188.ece
15,12,2010,Added sheen,"Very recently, gold prices touched a new high of $1430.95 a troy ounce in the international markets. Since 2001, they have risen by as much as 450 per cent. This phenomenal rise is reshaping demand and supply in several fundamental ways. In the process, age-old perceptions and habits concerning the yellow metal are set to change across the world. While the surge in gold prices has been a universal phenomenon, the contributory factors differed as between the developed countries and certain developing ones, notably India. In the West, the rising prices have drawn speculative investors to bullion, driving its price even higher. Simultaneously, the demand from the jewellery industry has fallen. The main reason is that the high price of gold has dampened consumer demand, especially at a time when economic recovery after the crisis is weak. Although it need not necessarily be a secular, irreversible trend, the jewellery industry in the West is seeking to cut its gold consumption by substituting it, wherever possible, with silver and non-precious metals. For the first time in 30 years, investment overtook jewellery in 2009 as the biggest source of demand for the yellow metal. Extreme volatility in the financial markets, economic uncertainty, and fears that national currencies will lose their value have all driven investors to go for gold bars and coins, gold-backed bank deposits as well as exchange-traded funds. This demand surge spurred the creation of new gold-based financial instruments.
However, in India and some other Asian countries, jewellery-making, the traditional backbone of the gold market, has remained strong. According to the World Gold Council, the overall demand rose 79 per cent to 650 tonnes during the period January-September 2010, compared with the same period in 2009. Demand from jewellery-makers has been particularly strong. The investment demand for gold is also on the ascendant. Even as banks sell gold in the form of bars and coins, investments in paper gold too are becoming popular. Gold-backed exchange-traded funds have been posting robust returns. Most fund-managers have been recommending investment in paper gold, alongside investments in equities and debt. It seems a matter of time before paper gold, including gold futures, gained greater popularity and became more accessible to ordinary investors. For a long time in India, gold — especially as jewellery — has been viewed as a hedge against inflation. Banks and other financial institutions, who have always been sanctioning loans against pledges of gold, need to do much more to integrate gold investments with the mainstream financial markets.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Added-sheen/article15594192.ece
16,12,2010,Steady course,"Quite predictably, in its mid-quarter monetary policy review, the Reserve Bank of India has not made any significant monetary changes. The repo and the reverse repo rates as well as the CRR remain unchanged. Based on current growth and inflation trends, the RBI had, on November 2, in its second quarterly review, effectively ruled out policy action in the near future. There has been no significant change in its assessment of growth prospects for this year. In fact, considering that the economy has clocked an 8.9 per cent growth during the first six months, the central bank has been somewhat conservative in retaining its forecast at 8.5 per cent. Almost certainly, the growth projections will be marked up in the third-quarter review due towards the end of January 2011. As for inflation, despite some recent signs of moderation, there are reasons to be cautious. After remaining in double-digits for five successive months, WPI inflation declined to 8.8 per cent in August and to 7.5 per cent in November. Consumer price (CPI) inflation for industrial workers and rural/agricultural labourers has dropped to single-digit since August, after remaining in double-digits for over a year.
However, inflationary pressures persist, thanks to the domestic demand and higher global commodity prices, especially of petroleum. Besides, the pace of decline in food inflation has been slower than expected due largely to structural factors. For instance, while the consumption of milk, eggs, meat, and other protein-related items has increased, their prices have moderated less than those of cereals and pulses. The RBI's projection of 5.5 per cent inflation by March 2011 might, therefore, be overly optimistic. It is in monitoring domestic liquidity that the latest review has made some moves. The statutory liquidity ratio has been brought down by one percentage point to 24 per cent and, together with an aggressive programme of open market purchases of government securities, this will inject liquidity to an extent of Rs.48,000 crore. The release of sizable primary liquidity to match the needs of an expanding economy is justified but it is not clear how these measures will impact on interest rates. Given the sluggish growth in their deposits, banks will have to pay more. Besides, the RBI might very soon have to signal higher interest rates to anchor inflationary expectations, which are on the rise in the wake of higher prices of transportation fuels. The global economic news continues to be mixed. Emerging economies are forging ahead, while Europe's progress is somewhat hampered by the emergence of sovereign debt problems.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Steady-course/article15595388.ece
16,12,2010,EU lets Kosovans down,"The Kosovan election result is yet to be finally declared but the process, initiated when the ruling coalition collapsed in November 2010, has revived political and ethnic tensions. With the turnout high in the first general election since Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) from Serbia in 2008, the result was always going to be close. Incumbent Prime Minister Hashim Thaçi has claimed victory for his Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) over its former coalition partner, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), led by Isa Mustafa. But Albin Kurti's Self-Determination party polled 17 per cent and could hold the balance of power. The main politicians are all from the Albanian community, which constitutes 88 per cent of the population, and can see the substantial participation of ethnic Serb voters in Albanian-surrounded enclaves as proof of the voters' interest in economic rather than ethno-political issues. Kosovo is one of Europe's poorest countries, with an annual per capita income of $2,750 and unemployment currently estimated at 48 per cent, and the economy dominated much of the campaign.
Unfortunately, the wider picture is more disturbing. Serbs form seven per cent of the country's 1.8-million population; in the north, where most of Kosovo's 120,000 Serbs live and which borders Serbia, polling stations were boycotted in response to a call from President Boris Tadiæ in Belgrade. There were also minor skirmishes, and booths closed three hours early, ostensibly for security reasons. The International Court of Justice ruling of July 2010, that the Kosovan UDI was not unlawful, is unlikely to deter Serbia from seeking to annex northern Kosovo. Alternatives such as the decentralisation of Kosovo will almost certainly be rejected by Belgrade. In addition, Mr. Tadic wants European Union membership for Serbia and knows that the Union would not admit Kosovo if the latter were divided like Cyprus. Furthermore, allegations of fraud in Mr. Thaçi's strongholds will intensify tensions even among ethnic Kosovans; the Self-Determination party, citing corruption among the current leaders, has advocated unification with the country's southern neighbour, Albania. In sum, this election settles virtually nothing. The key problem is the absence of leadership from the EU. In cables released by WikiLeaks, American officials condemn the EU's “vacillation” and note a perception in the region that the EU has given up on further expansion. It is Kosovans who will pay the price for this demonstration of its weakness.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/EU-lets-Kosovans-down/article15595387.ece
17,12,2010,Going beyond trade,"The dramatic surge in bilateral trade is the biggest story on the India-China front in the past decade. But persistent imbalances are threatening to erode the consensus on the Indian side that the two countries can simply buy their way to a better relationship. What makes the visit this week of Wen Jiabao especially significant is the message the Chinese Premier sent out that he understood India's concerns on the question of market access and would try to find ways of resolving them. Other positives on the economic side to flow from Mr. Wen's visit were the announcements on a Strategic Economic Dialogue, the creation of a CEOs' forum, and the agreement between banking regulators, which will hopefully allow better synergy between the commercial operations and the financial requirements of Indian and Chinese companies doing business across the border. If China is able to unlock its markets for Indian goods and services, especially in the pharma and IT sectors, the new trade target of $100 billion can easily be achieved before 2015. If not, trade will continue to grow but the ballooning deficit will be like an albatross around the neck of the India-China partnership.
On the political front, the Chinese side failed to ‘unstaple' the issue of distinctive visas it grants to Indian citizens from Jammu and Kashmir who wish to travel to China. India has been complaining about this Chinese policy — which it regards as an affront to Indian sovereignty and territorial integrity — for more than a year, to no avail. “Our policy on Kashmir has not changed” is the only thing the Chinese side would say. This time, however, Premier Wen went a small step further and acknowledged this was an issue that needed resolution through “consultations.” Since China unilaterally adopted the stapled-visa policy, the ball is in its court. In consequence, the Indian side held back from the joint statement this time the standard formulations on Tibet and ‘One China.' It is not as if India's policy towards the territorial integrity of China has changed. But the point has been made, more or less in public, that respect for core national concerns must be mutual. This prickly issue apart, the Wen visit produced several new positives on the strategic front, most notably the decision to meet more often at the summit level and an agreement to work together against piracy in the Gulf of Aden. India and China should lose no time in implementing this aspect of the joint statement, and use it as a stepping stone for a full-fledged dialogue on the broader issue of maritime security and freedom of navigation. It is vital that the momentum achieved in the relationship between the two neighbours, the world's most talked-about rising powers, is sustained.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Going-beyond-trade/article15596866.ece
17,12,2010,Making cities safer for women,"Delhi, where a rape is reported every 29 minutes (UNIFEM 2010), has the dubious reputation of being one of the world's unsafest cities for women. The surprise is that precious little has been done to salvage its image. Increased policing may help mitigate the situation but it will not by itself make the city any safer in a sustained way. The limited success of initiatives by the Delhi Police such as ‘Parivartan', implemented following the three widely publicised incidents including the rape of a Swiss diplomat in 2003, speaks to this. Many of the offences in Delhi are committed with impunity in the most public of places. A survey recently conducted by two U.N. agencies along with Jagori, a non-governmental organisation, found that that women feel more vulnerable while travelling in a bus, waiting at the bus stop, and walking on the streets and in market places. They do not find the police very helpful and are reluctant to complain about harassment. The message is loud and clear. Unless the gender issue is comprehensively addressed in city planning and governance and development becomes more equitable, Indian cities will remain less than safe for women over the long term.
Indian cities can learn a lot from cities like Seoul, which has responded imaginatively to such challenges and enjoys the distinction of being one of the most women-friendly cities in the world. Besides using less intrusive surveillance technologies to improve safety, the South Korean capital has implemented a slew of progressive measures. These include programmes to certify and assess women-friendly workplaces ; an elaborate women's safety audit of public areas such as parks and streets to map the unsafe ones; gender governance strategies; and specific brand programmes such as infant plazas and safe parking locations for women. The city authorities closely monitor the effectiveness of the projects by annually charting the Gender Sensitive Indicators; and based on the changes in the gender-equality level, new schemes for areas that need improvement are proposed. These innovations , which infused a radically new perspective in urban polices, have paid rich dividends. Indian policymakers can make a start by implementing simple but critical measures such as locating bus stops in mixed land-use areas that draw crowds late into the night and keeping the roads well lit. In cities such as Delhi, a few voluntary organisations have conducted safety audits and baseline surveys, and clear directions have emerged from them. These recommendations must be integrated into city development plans without delay.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Making-cities-safer-for-women/article15596865.ece
19,12,2010,Berlusconi's win is Italy's loss,"The Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, who began his current term two years ago with a majority of 100, has had to face a second confidence vote test in less than three months. He managed to scrape through: while the Senate margin was comfortable, he survived by the skin of his teeth, three votes, in the 630-member Chamber of Deputies. The proceedings in the lower house were extremely rancorous; members almost came to blows. After the vote, there were violent street clashes between protesters and police. Earlier, the Speaker of the lower house, Gianfranco Fini, a former political ally and now a deadly foe, accused the Prime Minister and his right-wing People of Freedom (PdL) party of buying MPs; another MP mentioned inducements of € 500,000. Some of the street fighting was severe. More than 100 people were injured and substantial damage caused to public and private property. There were also demonstrations across the country; in Palermo, students blocked the central station and the airport, and in Milan demonstrators broke into the stock exchange building.
That Mr. Berlusconi has hit the lowest point of his political career is in little doubt. The country's condition, however, is far more serious than the current political discourse appears to acknowledge. To start with, the suppression of problems is only to be expected when the Prime Minister himself owns most of the private TV channels as well as several newspapers. That makes for a wide gulf between mainstream coverage and the lived experience of ordinary Italians, who are unique among Europeans in being, on average, poorer than they were a decade ago. Secondly, photographic evidence seems to support opposition politicians' allegations that police and other security officers infiltrated the demonstrations and provoked some of the violence. This revives images of the 1970s, when the security forces did similar things to sway public opinion towards repressive legislation. Thirdly, Mr. Berlusconi's many failures are starting to catch up with him. His own wealth has not cured political corruption; he has tried to pass legislation giving himself immunity from criminal prosecution over shady business dealings; his attempts to restructure the economy have failed; and even a people known for their tolerance of celebrity sex scandals are losing patience with the politician-tycoon's escapades. The major problem for Italy is the absence of any other political vision. The sooner the centre-left parties can put the 1990s corruption scandals behind them and offer a decisive manifesto, the better it will be for all Italy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Berlusconis-win-is-Italys-loss/article15599646.ece
19,12,2010,For better wage policies,"A direct outcome of the global economic crisis has been a decline in the rate of growth of wages across the world, barring Asia and Latin America. A study by the International Labour Organisation, Global Wage Report 2010-11: Wage policies in times of crisis, highlights this reality and points to the need for countries to put in place proper social and labour market policies to protect an increasingly vulnerable workforce. The study, based on wage data from 115 countries and territories, covering 94 per cent of the world's 1.4 billion wage-earners, shows a decline in growth rate in monthly wages — from 2.8 per cent in the pre-crisis 2007 to 1.6 per cent in 2009. This coupled with the increases in unemployment since 2007 (from 117.8 million to 206.7 million in 2009) has important economic and social implications. Given the importance of wages in sustaining consumption, and in turn aggregate demand for goods and services, it is necessary that measures are in place to ensure that the growth rates in wages do not go on a further downward spiral. Prolonged wage decreases will result in extending the recessionary trend and delay the onset of recovery. The ILO's finding that the prevalence of low-paid work is correlated with low levels of education, among other variables, is a timely reminder for policy makers that social policies are vital for creating a better paid workforce.
Given the important link between wage rates and the overall performance of an economy, the ILO report's suggestions for better collective bargaining, higher compliance with minimum wage norms, and income-support measures merit serious consideration, particularly in economies where such support structures are poor. The observation that the connection between wages and productivity was “more apparent in countries where collective bargaining covers more than 30 per cent of employees,” and that such countries have “significantly less wage inequality” further strengthens the need for effective collective bargaining mechanisms in countries that are witnessing the paradoxical situation of high economic growth rates, low wages, and a growing informal workforce. The other important policy measure suggested by the report, namely the use of realistic and enforceable minimum wages, which are particularly weak in developing countries, would be a meaningful intervention in addressing the rising inequalities that accompany economic crisis. The larger message from the second global wage report is that the present crisis can be converted into an opportunity to provide a better deal for the world's workforce.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/For-better-wage-policies/article15599647.ece
21,12,2010,The many facets of greatness,"Sachin Tendulkar said it best when asked what his 50th Test century meant to him. He struggled at first to articulate himself but eventually conveyed the sense that it was just another number — a satisfying number no doubt, but just another. As he has said time and again, records matter little to him; what has driven him to play for 21 years is an unaffected love for the game, which hasn't dimmed since he knew it first as a little boy. Yet it's through his numbers that we can better value his genius. It's these records — his ODI double-hundred earlier this year, for instance — that help nuance the understanding of greatness. So while a 50th hundred is no more significant than a 51st or a 49th, the roundness of the number presents the opportunity to stand back and appreciate what the achievement involves. Longevity is the litmus test of greatness — over a long career, even more so in the case of Tendulkar's which has spanned cricket eras, no facet remains untested. Consider that he started against Imran Khan, Wasim Akram, and Waqar Younis — three of the greatest fast-bowlers of all time — and made his 50th hundred against Dale Steyn, who will soon have a similar standing, and the scale of the feat becomes apparent.
“Grow old along with me! The best is yet to be,” wrote the poet Robert Browning and no cricketer has animated these lines, making them resonate with the timbre of truth, as capably as Tendulkar. The great man, who turned 37 in April, has long passed the age a batsman's ability is expected to deteriorate. But by having his most fertile year, scoring more than 1,500 Test runs, Tendulkar has forced a revision of how both the great batsman and the old batsman is viewed. The great athlete often doesn't concern himself or herself with such things — winning matters more than the broadening of perception — but it remains a vital function of greatness. Tendulkar's 50th hundred contained in miniature his batting renaissance after the lows of 2006: he batted without ego, playing a cautious man's game, particularly against Paul Harris' left-arm spin, but against pace, he fell back on the instinctive, attacking style that he charmed the world with as a teenager. The runs also came in a second-innings crisis, something Tendulkar was — not always justly — criticised for not doing enough of, but has more than addressed in the last two years. We are in the midst of something very special — long may he continue, for cricket's sake.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-many-facets-of-greatness/article15600766.ece
21,12,2010,Wanted: Zero tolerance,"A major consequence of fast-paced motorisation and expansion of roads and highways in India is the mounting rate of fatalities and injuries from traffic accidents. More than 110,000 people are killed on the roads each year, with the death toll rising by eight per cent annually; the estimate for serious injuries is 1.6 million. India's roads are now rated the worst in the world. Viewed against this background, the road safety initiative launched by the central government and the World Bank to cover 3,000 km of high-risk national and State highways in Assam, Gujarat, and Karnataka is an incremental step to improve the situation. Under the plan, affordable improvements based on the latest technologies will be put in place to reduce crashes and fatalities. The project will draw upon the experience of the International Road Assessment Programme supported by the World Bank in several countries. The investments can improve the safety record of some roads. What is important, however, is for the government to demonstrate the political will to move beyond limited schemes in a few States. The continuing carnage demands a policy of zero tolerance to crashes covering the entire network of 65,000-plus km of national highways and the quarter million km of urban roads. Almost three years ago, the Sundar Committee recommended a national road safety policy but precious little has been done by way of implementation.
There is no justification for delayed action on road safety when the national economic loss on account of death and disability from accidents is officially reckoned to be of the order of Rs.75,000 crore a year. Research on the challenge facing India points to specific areas that need urgent action. Pedestrians, bicyclists, and non-motorised vehicle users constitute 60 per cent of those killed on urban roads; and motorcyclists and small car users make up 25 per cent. Unsurprisingly, there is a disproportionate involvement of trucks and buses in fatal crashes, highlighting a key problem. These data point to the need for segregation of vulnerable road users and appropriate traffic calming measures to reduce risk. Equally, scientific design of roads and vehicles can reduce conflicting interactions among road users and mitigate the consequences of accidents. There should be a sincere attempt to analyse such data emerging from studies conducted by injury prevention researchers in the country. The Sundar Committee has rightly pointed out that the State transport departments, which now play the relatively minor role of licensing and vehicle registration, should be made legally responsible for coordination of multi-sectoral safety. The time to act is now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Wanted-Zero-tolerance/article15600767.ece
22,12,2010,If there's nothing to hide...,"Magnanimous though it may seem to Congress partisans, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's offer to appear before the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament to answer questions relating to the allocation of 2G spectrum the question of why his government is so keen to avoid the setting up of a Joint Parliamentary Committee. Dr. Singh said that, like Caesar's wife, the Prime Minister should be above suspicion and hence his willingness to be questioned by a committee whose chairman is the formidable Bharatiya Janata Party stalwart, Murli Manohar Joshi. Sticking with Roman references, however, many will say that having crossed the inquisitorial Rubicon, the Prime Minister ought to have no reservations about appearing before a JPC either. This newspaper has argued before that the scale and dimensions of the spectrum scam give rise to questions that are well beyond the remit of a PAC whose job, normally, is confined to examining audit reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and that a comprehensive enquiry by a JPC was a political imperative. There has been some talk in government circles of expanding the mandate of the PAC in the 2G spectrum matter but the onus really is on the Prime Minister and his advisers to sit down with the Opposition to ensure an agreement that will allow the spectrum scam to be probed and the Budget session of Parliament to take place unhindered.
Apart from spectrum, the themes of corruption and communalism figured prominently in the 83rd plenary session of the Congress that concluded in Burari near the Capital on Monday. Party president Sonia Gandhi spoke of a five-point agenda to root out corruption. Missing from these five points, however, was an undertaking to push out of Cabinet any Minister against whom a court made an adverse finding. Today, Union Heavy Industries minister Vilasarao Deshmukh continues in government despite the Supreme Court fining Maharashtra Rs. 10 lakh in a case in which he, as Chief Minister, had abused his authority by getting the police to go easy on a moneylender. Similarly, Union Steel Minister Virbhadra Singh is functioning undisturbed despite a Himachal court charge-sheeting him in a corruption case. And then there are other Ministers against whom no direct evidence of wrongdoing has surfaced yet but under whose watch money is undoubtedly being made. “The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power,” Shakespeare tells us in Julius Caesar. What we see in government today is no remorse or introspection despite the steady accumulation of evidence of corruption on a staggering scale.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/If-theres-nothing-to-hide.../article15601964.ece
22,12,2010,Recovery despite disharmony,"The world economy, according to most forecasters, is expected to grow in 2010 by nearly five per cent. This surprisingly good performance, however, hides the fact that the recovery continues to be uneven among the three broad categories — the United States, the Euro zone, and the developing countries. Equally significantly, the recovery is taking place despite a marked lack of coordination among the major economic powers in solving their common problems. Dire predictions of a year ago have not materialised to the extent feared. Financial sector concerns shared by many countries have dissipated in recent months, although, as the world's leading central banks never fail to warn, the possibility of another global financial crisis cannot be ruled out. In the U.S., regulatory rules for the financial sector had to be toned down. Going by several indicators — including the relatively buoyant stock markets, greater investor confidence, and the pick-up in cross-border flows — the world economy is a more confident place today, with the deep pessimism of just a year ago receding. To be sure, deep-seated problems remain. High up in the list is rebalancing of the global economy, which remains elusive despite being an important part of the agenda at all the G20 summits. The highly publicised currency wars — the most visible manifestation of the global imbalance — are now seen in a muted fashion.
It is clear that, in the context of the global recovery, countries have fewer incentives to negotiate and reach an agreement on the outstanding problems. Besides, the uneven recovery has prompted many countries to address domestic concerns first. Protectionism has resurfaced in the U.S. and some other developed countries. There is very little chance of concluding the Doha round any time soon. Beset with persistently high unemployment rates and low demand, the U.S. has fashioned an ultra-loose monetary policy that is akin to a stimulus for its economy. But it is flooding the emerging markets with cheap dollars. The tax cuts agreement reached two weeks ago by President Obama with the Republicans will also act as a stimulus. In contrast, Europe as a whole has embarked on a programme of austerity. Some of the European countries like Greece, Portugal, and Spain are facing economic stress, while a few led by Germany are posting robust growth. A weak recovery in the developed world might have an adverse impact on exports from the developing countries. The divergence in economic policies, however justified by short-term domestic concerns, militates against global harmony. One hopes the divergence in performance does not lead to trade and currency conflicts that may derail the economic recovery.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Recovery-despite-disharmony/article15601963.ece
23,12,2010,A very special partnership,"From the Nehru-Bulganin-Khrushchev exchange visits of 1955-1956 down to the present, New Delhi and Moscow have kept up a special partnership that has lasted more than half a century and is perhaps unique in the annals of world diplomacy. Barring the barren years of the Yeltsin period soon after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, India has had a greater and more sustained comfort level in political dealings with Russia than with any other world power. For the Russian side too, India has been a dependable partner whose value has been both political and economic. In commercial terms, the recent visits to India of U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao may have yielded a bigger and more immediate harvest. But the 30 agreements signed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Dmitry Medvedev, will, if fully implemented, pave the way for full-spectrum progress across a range of key sectors from nuclear energy and hydrocarbons to R&D, pharmaceuticals, and information technology. The latest visit also produced a welcome first easing in visa restrictions for business and transit travellers.
In the civil nuclear field, Russia has been the fastest off the block ever since the Nuclear Suppliers Group voted to exempt India from its export restrictions. Contractual negotiations are currently under way for the third and fourth reactors at Koodankulam but have been held up by lack of clarity on costs, financing and, to a lesser extent, liability. The Russian side is on record saying the stringent nature of the Indian liability law is not a major obstacle. But they are likely to remain in a ‘wait and watch' mode to see whether India makes any concessions on this front to the United States before themselves signing on the dotted line. Though the contractual talks between the commercial entities of both sides are technical and not political, their smooth conclusion will send an important signal to both France and the U.S., who maintain that the Indian liability law is a major deterrent for their own vendors. Beyond this issue, the India-Russia statement has given a further push to the joint development of a fifth-generation fighter aircraft. While this means the Indian Air Force will eventually acquire a technologically advanced aircraft as good as any being developed in the U.S. or Europe, care must be taken to keep development and manufacturing costs down and ensure sufficient diffusion of knowhow so that India's own capabilities in aircraft design and manufacturing are enhanced through this process.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-very-special-partnership/article15603110.ece
23,12,2010,Beleaguered Haiti,"The first round of voting in the Haitian presidential election, which took place in an already troubled context, poses serious questions for Haiti and for Latin America as a whole. Haiti is struggling to rebuild itself after the devastating earthquake in January, which killed a quarter of a million people and injured 300,000 more. Secondly, there is widespread unrest over the fact that Nepalese troops serving with the UN Stabilisation Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) have been identified as the source of a virulent strain of cholera. This was spread by the contaminated Artibonite river, which runs past one of their camps. The country's first outbreak for over a century has killed about 2,000 people so far, but the official figure does not include those who have died in remote areas. As for the election itself, the international monitors have criticised the poor organisation, intimidation, and fraud. Haitian citizens complained that votes were cast in the name of people who were dead and of incomplete and inaccurate electoral registers. Even the leading candidate, the ruling Unity party's Jude Célestin was not on the roll; the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) cast a proxy vote for him. Post-election violence that led city-dwellers to flee to rural camps, where the risk of cholera was very high, has caused at least one death.
The candidates' own reactions do not help. The second and third-placed candidates, Mirlande Manigat, the wife of a former president, and Michel Martelly, a former kompa jazz musician, soon disagreed with each other and then both rejected the idea of a recount promised by the CEP. Ms Manigat withdrew her charge of fraud, and Mr. Martelly declared himself the real winner. In any case a recount alone is unlikely to restore confidence, and none of the candidates has said whether or not they will accept the recount results. The main regional grouping, the Organization of American States (OAS), has been slow to react and the involvement of its expert panel in the recount has only lengthened that process. An honourable Latin American exception is Cuba, whence no less a person than Fidel Castro immediately issued a statement calling for calm and mentioning that Cuba sent 300 doctors and nurses as soon as cholera broke out. The tardiness on the part of the OAS stands in sharp contrast to the conduct of the African Union (A.U.) and the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), which have moved quickly over electoral problems in Côte d'Ivoire; the A.U. has appointed its own mediator as well. Latin American states can enhance their global standing, which their resistance to neoliberalism has strengthened, by helping their needier neighbours.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Beleaguered-Haiti/article15603111.ece
24,12,2010,Dealing with communalisms,"If last week the Bharatiya Janata Party, and sections of the media, reflexively overreacted to Rahul Gandhi's informal observations on the growth and consequences of Hindtuva extremism, the Congress at its 83rd plenary session at Burari in northwest Delhi swung to the other extreme — wielding the sledgehammer against the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh for its “terror” connections. According to an August 2009 cable sent by U.S. Ambassador Timothy Roemer (outed by WikiLeaks: >http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/219238), Mr. Gandhi, in a casual conversation at a luncheon hosted by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, made this interesting comparison between Islamist and Hindutva radical groups. Asked about “Lashkar-e-Taiba's activities in the region and the immediate threat to India,” the Congress MP reportedly said “although there was evidence of some support for the group among certain elements in India's indigenous Muslim community, the bigger threat may be the growth of radicalised Hindu groups, which create religious tensions and political confrontations with the Muslim community.” Taken in their entirety, the comments are unexceptionable. In fact, the Congress general secretary appears to be articulating a nuanced position, worrying more about the divisive potential of Hindutva radicalisation than about the phenomenon itself. Nowhere does the phrase “Hindu terror” find mention in the Roemer cable (as Mr. Gandhi pointed out the day after his insights were WikiLeaked). His party also did well to clarify, in the first instance, that “Rahul Gandhi's view is that terrorism and communalism of all types is a threat to India. We need to remain vigilant against acts of terrorism of all kinds…no matter who commits them.”
Unfortunately, good sense did not prevail thereafter, with the Congress eager to be more loyal than the heir apparent. Its political resolution adopted at Burari promised a full-on probe into the RSS's alleged terror links and there were some over-the-top statements in this connection. The Congress's role in fomenting some horrible communal violence — Meerut, Maliana, and the 1984 anti-Sikh pogrom — notwithstanding, the party stands differentiated from the BJP and the militant Sangh outfits by its historic pluralism and its overall track record. In recent decades, the party has oscillated between a form of ‘defensive secularism,' at times bordering on soft Hindtuva, and an ‘instant secularism' crafted more as a reaction to the BJP's taunts than as a result of its own convictions. The violence and terror unleashed by some groups claiming to be Hindutva warriors is real, and even the RSS has been constrained to acknowledge this. But to exaggerate and over-project this aspect on a national scale is to divert attention from the live and present danger that divisive and disintegrative Hindutva ‘radicalism' and extremism, alongside Islamist militancy and terrorism, represent in a multi-religious country of over a billion people. In other words, it is to fall into a communal trap. In their own way, the fifth generation Nehru-Gandhi and his social democrat mother, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, seem to have understood this. It is about time their party did.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Dealing-with-communalisms/article15605635.ece
24,12,2010,Inexplicable delay,"The Centre's foot-dragging on enacting a new law to give effect to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is inexplicable, considering especially that India was among the earliest to ratify it in 2007. First, the administration toyed with the idea of amending the existing 1995 Act, while the stakeholders pointed out that the Convention marked a big change in fundamentals and that compliance with it warranted a new legislation. For instance, the definition of ‘disability' stands enlarged to cover all long-term physical, mental, intellectual, and sensory impairments that hinder equal and effective participation in society. This requires extending legal protection to categories not covered by the existing law and specifying in the statute all the fundamental rights and freedoms the disabled are entitled to under the Convention.
Then, in April this year, a committee was constituted to draft a new legislation and it was asked to give the report in four months. It soon ran into trouble over the question of giving due representation to all the stakeholders in keeping with the motto “nothing about us without us.” Now, the panel has sought time until March to produce the draft bill. The net result of all this is that an Indian law based on the UN Convention may not be in place even in 2011, four years after ratification. As a consequence, the government would be unable to submit the mandatory periodic implementation report to the Convention monitoring committee. A World Bank estimate puts the population of the disabled in India in the region of 40-80 million and among the most disadvantaged in education, employment, and social inclusiveness. The number is bound to increase, given the rising trend in traffic accidents and age-related impairments. The government will have to act with a greater sense of urgency to put the new legal framework in place because it is a basic requisite for the disabled to improve their productive capacities and claim full citizenship.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Inexplicable-delay/article15605634.ece
25,12,2010,A shocking verdict,"The life sentence handed down to Binayak Sen by a Chhattisgarh trial court on Friday is so over the top and outrageous that it calls into question the fundamentals of the Indian justice system. The trial judge shocked the conscience of the nation by finding the eminent doctor and rights activist guilty of sedition and conspiring to wage war against the state under Sections 120(B) and 124(A) of the Indian Penal Code, Sections 8(1), (2), (3), and (5) of the draconian Chhattisgarh Special Public Security Act, and Section 39 (2) of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (as amended in 2004). The fact that the Chhattisgarh police's case against Dr. Sen consisted of pretty thin material was taken into the realm of the absurd by the public prosecutor tying himself in knots in an attempt to burnish the doctor's alleged sins. So it was that an innocuous email message sent by his wife, Ilina, to the director of the Indian Social Institute — a Delhi-based institution which happens to share an acronym with Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence directorate — got converted into “suspicious communication” with the dreaded “ISI.” Another email referring to an occupant of the White House as a “chimpanzee” was introduced by the prosecutor as evidence of the kind of “code language” terrorists resort to. But tragically, it is the Chhattisgarh police that have had the last laugh in this round.
The broad charge against Dr. Sen of helping the banned Community Party of India (Maoist) wage war against the state was constructed by the police around the scaffolding of his supposed relationship with Narayan Sanyal, an alleged leader of the Maoists who was incarcerated in Raipur jail following his arrest in 2006. In his capacity as a medical doctor and head of the People's Union for Civil Liberties, Dr. Sen often met Mr. Sanyal in jail but each of these meetings, as the jail authorities subsequently testified, was closely supervised and afforded no opportunity for the conveying of messages to the Maoist leadership. So the police hit upon the strategy of linking him to the recovery from Kolkata-based businessman Piyush Guha of a letter allegedly written by Mr. Sanyal. During the trial, the defence counsel pointed to numerous holes in the police case, including the introduction of an unsigned, typewritten letter supposedly sent by the Maoists to Dr. Sen, despite the fact that the letter found no mention in the attested list of documents recovered from his residence the same day. It goes without saying that Dr. Sen has the right to appeal the conviction and the savage sentence. The higher judiciary, which did not exactly cover itself in glory by denying him bail for nearly two years, must ensure the expeditious hearing of his appeal and grant him immediate bail till the end of the appeal process.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-shocking-verdict/article15606999.ece
25,12,2010,The political price of onions,"The spectre of rising onion prices is haunting Indian politics again. As prices trebled over a period of three weeks, touching Rs.90 a kg in some parts of the country, the liliaceous plant, whose bulb is the mainstay of many Indian staple recipes, became a topic of debate and discussion not only for ordinary consumers, but for economists and policymakers as well. India is the world's second largest producer of onions after China. But in the face of galloping prices, the central government enforced a ban on exports and allowed imports from Pakistan. Onions have enriched traders, brought incensed women and men on to the streets, and brought down governments. People of all classes consume the vegetable in considerable quantity, and any rise in price tends to be politically sensitive. In north India especially, curries and dishes are incomplete without it. The defeat of the Bharatiya Janata Party in the 1998 Delhi Assembly election was attributed, to a large extent, to its government's failure to curb the rise in the price of onion. Already tagged as pro-trade, it was slow to react at that time. Twelve years later, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance seems more aware of the political risks in letting the situation spin out of control. The Centre, through State governments, supported the supply and sale of onions via cooperatives at controlled rates, and the situation appears to have eased a little.
While the short-term measures have brought some relief, the real challenge for the central government is to tackle long-term food inflation. Prices of essential commodities have generally been on the rise, thanks to a combination of factors, including repeated hikes in fuel prices and flood damage to crops. In the week ended December 11, the Wholesale Price Index-based food inflation went up to 12.13 per cent, an increase of 2.67 percentage points over the previous week. The full impact of the high onion prices is likely to show only in the figures for the week ended December 25. Onions have hogged the headlines as a vegetable without substitute in Indian cuisines but consumers have been hit just as hard by the steady rise in the prices of all food items. In this scenario, the government needs to come up with something more than quick-fix solutions. Instead of letting foodgrains rot in godowns, it must expand and strengthen the public distribution system as a way of providing food security for the poorer sections. Otherwise, there will be a political price to pay — sooner than later.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-political-price-of-onions/article15607000.ece
26,12,2010,Closure to an unfortunate episode,"The Australian government's apology and payout to Mohamed Haneef for wrongly detaining and charging him for involvement in the June 2007 Glasgow bombing provides satisfactory closure to an unfortunate episode. The Indian doctor was held on July 2 that year for a period of 25 days, the initial 12 days without charges. The court found that the prosecution's case was built on faulty evidence, based, among other things, on a SIM card he had left behind in the United Kingdom with a distant relative who was one of the five accused in the failed Glasgow attack. The Australian Federal Police was also found to have presented evidence selectively to the court, and the cabinet minister in charge of immigration revoked Dr. Haneef's visa to enable his continued detention even after he was granted bail. In Australia, the case came as an eye-opener on the many fault lines in its counter-terrorism efforts, especially the racial profiling of Muslims, and the lengths that law-enforcers can travel to tailor the evidence. It led to a public outcry and the setting up of a full-fledged inquiry commission that made several recommendations for reform. Australia's apology and the monetary settlement was in return for Dr. Haneef agreeing to drop a civil claim for compensation against the federal government and the Immigration Minister. The text of the apology is an unambiguous admission of wrongdoing, and the payout to Dr. Haneef — under the terms of the agreement neither side can disclose the amount but media speculation places it at $1 million — is apparently reflective of contrition.
The Australian decision is unprecedented and its impact could be felt across the world. Since 9/11, hundreds of people have been held as terror suspects across the globe. Many of these have turned out to be wrongful detentions. The British government recently announced, without admitting culpability, that it would pay compensation to 16 Britons detained by the U.S. forces at Guantanamo in order to ward off damaging law suits accusing it of being complicit in their transfer to the notorious off-shore U.S. prison and in their torture while in detention. In India too, there have been cases of people detained as terror suspects and later acquitted by the courts, as in the Mecca Masjid blast case. In another instance, the government quietly withdrew the charges. But never has it been pressed to offer an apology, let alone financial compensation. While the Australian government's settlement with Dr. Haneef goes a long way in repairing Australia's negative image in India following recent incidents of racial violence, it also underlines the fact that India's own handling of such cases is far below the ideal.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Closure-to-an-unfortunate-episode/article15609641.ece
26,12,2010,China’s calibrated balancing act,"The back-to-back visits by Premier Wen Jiabao to India and Pakistan have underlined Beijing’s careful balancing act between two sets of bilateral relationships, both important to it for different reasons. The complex India-China engagement is powered by the rising economies of the two countries and the mutual desire to manage their global ambitions without conflict; its strong strategic ties with Pakistan have been built on a convergence of regional goals. China has been more than conscious that while it engages with India, nothing about this should make Islamabad nervous. It is thus no surprise that after Premier Wen’s New Delhi visit, during which both sides made deliberate efforts to arrest a perceptible slide in their political relationship while setting new targets for the booming trade relationship, his three-day stay in Islamabad yielded enough reassurances to Pakistan that its “all-weather friendship” with China was intact. Certainly, the ties with China are the best Pakistan enjoys with any big power. Islamabad receives financial and diplomatic support from Beijing that has no strings attached, at least publicly. Nor is it at the receiving end of public admonishments on harbouring terrorist networks. Beijing unconditionally sells military hardware to Pakistan, and is the only nuclear power prepared to assist its nuclear programme. In turn, Islamabad is reverential in the way it conducts itself with China, swallowing a crushing imbalance in trade relations and quick to respond to quiet pressure from Beijing to crack down on Pakistan-based militant networks that stir trouble in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region.
Entirely in keeping with all this, China and Pakistan signed several agreements in diverse fields ranging from banking and trade to space technology and agriculture. Beijing announced a $410 million post-floods aid package, in addition to the $200 million it gave earlier. While in Islamabad, Premier Wen praised the Pakistan government for its efforts to combat terrorism. He balanced this by a studious silence on the Kashmir issue, a decision that will be welcomed in India, especially in the light of recent tensions over the stapled Chinese visas to visitors from Jammu & Kashmir. Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani may have been fishing for a Chinese role in ‘facilitating dialogue’ with India on Kashmir but it is apparent that Beijing is keen to reiterate its neutrality on the issue. All in all, if there was one overarching message from Premier Wen’s swing through South Asia, it was that China would not be drawn into a zero-sum game between India and Pakistan.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Chinarsquos-calibrated-balancing-act/article15609640.ece
27,12,2010,"Gujjar agitation, once again","The ongoing agitation by the Gujjar community in Rajasthan is a reminder of the dangers of playing competitive caste politics. The immediate provocation for the agitation, which has erupted time and again on the reservation issue over the past five years, was the State government's decision to recruit people for 100,000 posts — jobs to which the Gujjars, who have been demanding a five per cent reservation, want the quota extended. Although both the ruling Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party declare their commitment to giving them a five per cent quota in government jobs and educational institutions, the problem lies in giving effect to this. At one level there is the legal impediment, something the Rajasthan High Court called attention to recently when it stayed the operation of a 2008 Act that provided reservations for various caste groups, including the Gujjars. The level of reservation under this please-all Act, which earmarked quotas for poor upper castes as well, increased to 68 per cent, considerably above the 50 per cent limit set by the Supreme Court in the Mandal case. At another level there are serious practical problems about extending a special quota for Gujjars. It was the Rajasthan unit of the BJP that promised to include Gujjars, a pastoral community, in the Scheduled Tribes list in the run-up to the 2003 election, which it won. But the violent opposition this evoked from the numerically stronger Meena community saw the State government back down.
While the violence and disruption that has attended Gujjar agitations for reservation must be roundly condemned, it must be recognised that the resentment of the community is largely a result of cynical vote-seeking politics. The anger and political consolidation within the community assumed worrying dimensions only after the Vajpayee government decided to reclassify Jats as an ‘Other Backward Class'. Having promised the Gujjars ST status in 2003, BJP Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje was forced to expend considerable time and energy in trying to appease the community with all manner of sops. Eventually, she bought time by declaring a new quota regime that classified Gujjars as a “separate backward community,” a proposal that found expression in the legally unsustainable 2008 Act that now stands suspended by the Rajasthan High Court. In a bid to woo communities, political parties often forget that the reservation pie is limited and that any attempt to provide quotas for one community will have adverse implications for others. This is exactly what has happened in Rajasthan. And the cost has been an intermittent cycle of agitation, social unrest, and violence.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Gujjar-agitation-once-again/article15610695.ece
27,12,2010,Revolutionary test for TB,"A new test developed for diagnosing active tuberculosis is set to revolutionise treatment of a disease that kills 1.8 million people round the world every year. It recently won approval from the World Health Organisation for a worldwide rollout over the next few years. The approval comes within three months of publication in the New England Journal of Medicine (“Rapid molecular detection of tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance,” by Catharina C. Boehme et al.,) of the results of a trial conducted on 1,700 patients in five countries, including India. The new test has several advantages over the currently used smear microscopy and conventional nucleic acid-amplification method. While the sensitivity of smear microscopy is about 50 per cent, this (Xpert MTB/RIF) has 72 per cent sensitivity with one test, and 90 per cent with three tests in the case of smear-negative patients. The sensitivity goes up to 98 per cent in the case of smear-positive and culture-positive patients. Xpert has 99 per cent specificity. Further, the test's ability to provide reliable results within two hours, compared with 4-6 weeks in the case of culture, will help begin treatment earlier and reduce the chances of an individual infecting others. The greatest beneficiaries will be those co-infected with HIV and TB. The long wait for the results before starting TB treatment is one of the main reasons for the death of many co-infected individuals.
Unlike smear microscopy, Xpert can identify rifampicin drug resistance. It correctly identified 98 per cent of bacteria that were resistant to rifampicin. In India and many other countries where multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) is not high, much of the testing that goes on now is mainly for diagnosing active TB and not for drug resistance. But Xpert is all set to change this: rifampicin resistance is an excellent marker of MDR-TB. Most patients who are resistant to rifampicin are also resistant to isoniazid drug. Patients who are resistant to rifampicin will need culture to find out which drugs work for them. Following this protocol before starting the treatment will go a long way in preventing MDR-TB from becoming widespread. There is one major problem, however: the diagnostic test is prohibitively expensive. India being one of the high-burden countries, the public sector and certain NGOs will be eligible for a special pricing agreement. Uninterrupted power supply and temperature control, which are essential, will turn out to be major challenges in rural areas. India must find ways to embrace this technology swiftly after necessary field testing — considering that TB kills two Indians every three minutes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Revolutionary-test-for-TB/article15610694.ece
28,12,2010,Moving on after the GSLV failure,"It is not a good time for the Indian Space Research Organisation. Two successive failures, just months apart, of the Geo-Synchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) raise serious questions about this rocket. Only once before has the space agency faced such a situation. That was in the late 1980s when the first two launches of the Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV) were unsuccessful. A thorough analysis of the rocket after its second failure in July 1988 revealed a basic design flaw. Understanding the ASLV problem contributed to the success of its successor, the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). Shaking off the failure of its first launch in 1993, the PSLV has turned into a rugged workhorse that can launch multiple satellites and undertake a variety of missions. The GSLV uses the giant solid-propellant first stage of the PSLV as well as the latter's second stage equipped with a Vikas engine that runs on liquid propellants. In the GSLV, the top two stages of the PSLV have been replaced with a cryogenic stage and the latter's six solid-propellant strap-ons with four Vikas-engine-based ones. These changes allow the GSLV to carry much heavier payloads into orbit. However, it has thus far turned out to be trouble-prone. In its seven flights, it has notched up three failures and one partial success; by contrast, the PSLV, over 17 launches, has had just one failure and one partial success.
The GSLV launch in April this year was unsuccessful because of problems with the indigenous cryogenic stage, which was being flown for the very first time. According to ISRO officials, Saturday's failure occurred because commands from the rocket's onboard computers were not reaching systems in the first stage that control its orientation. Like the PSLV, the GSLV has two sets of wires that relay electrical commands from its onboard computers so that even if one set does not work for some reason, the other set is available as a backup. On Saturday, connectors on both sets of wires are thought to have snapped. That simply should not have happened and raises questions about what led to such an occurrence. Was it because the vehicle was subjected to unforeseen levels of stress, perhaps as a result of extreme vibrations? If so, what caused such stress in this flight? The failure analysis will doubtless address these and other issues. The space agency has just one more Russian-built cryogenic stage left of the seven that it bought. It is therefore vital that problems with the GSLV, including its indigenous cryogenic stage, are sorted out expeditiously. ISRO chairman K. Radhakrishnan has promised a thorough review of the GSLV programme. That is most certainly needed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Moving-on-after-the-GSLV-failure/article15611899.ece
28,12,2010,Conflicting interests,"That the Reserve Bank of India's discussion paper on licensing of new private banks has invited widely divergent comments is not surprising. The document, which stopped short of laying down guidelines, only indicated possible approaches and spelt out the pros and cons of each of them, after reviewing the domestic and international experience. The six key issues that have elicited good response are: minimum capital requirement; promoters' contribution; cap on promoters' shareholding; foreign shareholding; role for industrial houses and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs); and business models for the new banks. The feedback and suggestions have varied, depending on the interests they represented. For instance, industry associations and trade have favoured a higher initial capital of Rs.1,000 crore, which could be raised further over a period. Only with a large capital can the new banks invest in technology, goes their argument. The NBFCs and the microfinance institutions, on the other hand, want a lower level of capital so that more banks can be licensed in a short period.
More than every other issue, it is the possible role of industrial houses in promoting new banks that has elicited sharply contrasting responses. Banks have opposed the idea, citing, among others reasons, the less-than stellar record of big business in managing banks, a point that prompted nationalisation in 1969. In many countries, combining banking and commerce has not been a happy experience. The ownership structure of large industrial groups may open up opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. Large conglomerates will exacerbate the concentration of economic power and political influence. Some others have suggested granting licences to industrial groups but with safeguards, ranging from tight regulation to barring the promoters from having business relationship with the entities promoted by them. The feedback on the role of NBFCs shows less of discordance. One section would require the NBFCs to wind down activities that overlap with those of banks. This would eliminate the scope of regulatory arbitrage that might accrue to the lightly regulated NBFCs. Finally, many respondents who favour the entry of new banks would like them to be given general banking licences and not restricted to specific geographical area or function such as financial inclusion. Ten months after the Finance Minister mooted the idea, the subject of licensing new banks seems to be as divisive as ever, and it might take some time for specific proposals to crystallise.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Conflicting-interests/article15611900.ece
29,12,2010,Obama wins at Start,"President Obama has achieved a significant success in gaining the United States Senate's ratification by 71 votes to 26 of a new strategic arms reduction treaty (Start) with Russia. The document, which Mr. Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed in Prague in April, requires each side to reduce its nuclear arsenal from the current limit of 2,200 to 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads by 2017. Launch vehicles of all kinds are restricted to 700 for each side and all launch systems are not to exceed 800 each. The agreement also introduces an inspection and verification process; there has been none since the 1991 Start expired in December 2009. Within a few days of the Senate vote, the Russian lower house, the Duma, approved the treaty at first reading, by 350 to 58. One global benefit of the ratification is that it improves relations between Moscow and Washington, which were strained by several actions of the Bush administration. Another gain is that the world's two nuclear superpowers have set an example to the rest of the world, and could well move on to reductions in tactical nuclear weapons.
New Start is a major domestic triumph for Mr. Obama in a lame-duck Congressional session that followed heavy Democrat defeats in the November mid-term elections. Mr. Obama and Vice-President Joe Biden have coordinated a strong team of senior Democrat Senators, not least the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair John Kerry. They have worked under severe pressure of time to convince a number of recalcitrant Republicans that their concerns about the treaty had been addressed, particularly over restrictions they feared on any future strategic plans and over funding to modernise the existing U.S. nuclear arsenal. Faced with the detailed explanation and a willingness to compromise, the startled Republicans had no option but to concur — or be known as those who left the two military giants without a nuclear arms reduction treaty. Many of them, such as the Senate Minority whip John Kyl, who voted against the treaty, had been manifestly disingenuous, participating in a lengthy series of discussions and then announcing that it was too late in the Congressional term to debate New Start fully. They have been exposed for their unthinking, reactionary antipathy to anything that has to do with Mr. Obama. President Obama, for his part, will now be better prepared to handle more Republican hostility and obstructionism in the next Senate, which will start its term with a much smaller Democrat majority than the present one. He emerges from this episode greatly strengthened as a shrewd, tough political negotiator — and as an international statesman.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Obama-wins-at-Start/article15612981.ece
29,12,2010,Like onions for cotton,"It is a situation made for good neighbourliness. Pakistan is Asia's fourth largest producer of cotton, but the floods earlier this year caused a significant set back to its cotton output. Cotton production areas along the Indus were severely affected by the flood waters. It is estimated that production of this raw material, which Pakistan both exports and uses for its domestic yarn and textile industry, is likely to record a 14 per cent drop this year. India, on the other hand, expects a bumper cotton crop owing to wider coverage. But heavy and untimely rains in India have affected the onion crop, pushing up prices of the basic vegetable beyond the reach of many pockets. In ideal circumstances, Pakistan and India could have ably helped each other alleviate these shortages. Their proximity and shared borders are tailor-made for this. A couple of consignments of Pakistani onions did land at the Attari border-crossing at the height of the onion crisis in India, helping to bring down the prices. Pakistan is a regular buyer of Indian cotton. It is encouraging that some kind of trade continues between the two countries despite the freeze in ties since the Mumbai terror attacks of November 2008. But the current situation of shortages offers a rare chance for improving relations. That the people on both sides are quick to recognise this was evident in the recent appeal by a representative of the Pakistan textile industry to the Indian government to permit more cotton to be exported across the border than had been fixed. Sadly, neither government seems prepared to move ahead.
A year that held some promise for India-Pakistan relations with several high-level engagements — the meetings between the Prime Ministers at the SAARC summit in Thimpu, between the foreign secretaries and the home ministers before that, and the foreign ministers in July — has ended without any progress. The UPA government's unending troubles over a series of corruption scandals since September may have made it averse to risk-taking behaviour, and talks with Pakistan are unfortunately perceived as falling in that category. There is a possibility that despite the less than cordial ending of the meeting between External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna and his Pakistan counterpart Shah Mahmod Qureshi in Islamabad, they will meet again in New Delhi to pick up from where they left off. It is a measure of the continuing uncertainty in the relations that no dates are yet set for this meeting. Meanwhile, the two governments will do themselves no harm by making use of other opportunities to work on their relations, even if these take the form of onions or cotton.
The following correction was made in this Editorial on December 31, 2010 - There is a reference to meetings between foreign ministers in June. This has been changed to July.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Like-onions-for-cotton/article12717796.ece
30,12,2010,Cricket's power shift,"England's comprehensive victory by an innings and 157 runs in the fourth Test at Melbourne is a significant result. It was way back in 1986-87 that England last held on to the Ashes Down Under. Andrew Strauss and his brave men have followed a bracing triumph at home in 2009 with a 2-1 lead in the ongoing series, with one Test to go. At best Australia can level the series, not win back the 128-year-old urn. The former world champion may be in the middle of a slump but England deserves credit for its all-round excellence and the disciplined manner in which it handled stressful situations. Opener Alastair Cook's unbeaten 235 consuming 428 balls at Brisbane encapsulated his side's resolve, commitment, and stamina. The solid left-hander has made 577 runs in four Tests at 115.40. Jonathan Trott rose in stature with 445 runs at 111.25; he has a calm mind, a wealth of strokes, and a positive attitude. The gifted Kevin Pietersen came up with an influential 227 in the second Test at Adelaide and feisty Ian Bell put a price on his wicket. It is, however, the bowlers who win Tests and James Anderson (17 wickets in four Tests at 29.29) led the pack with his two-way swing and precision. England's bench strength in the pace bowling department came to the fore. When Stuart Broad was injured, the 2.03 metre (6' 8”) tall Chris Tremlett (13 wickets at 19.00) stepped in to hustle the Aussies with his lift from back-of-a-length. The lively Tim Bresnan's heart and movement added another dimension to the attack in the decisive fourth Test. In Graeme Swann (13 wickets at 37.30), England possesses a quality off-spinner who can turn matches.
Australia's batting has been exposed as brittle at the top. Michael Hussey (525 runs at 75.00) matched Cook head to head and Shane Watson and Brad Haddin scored freely but the host failed to kick on as a unit. The great Ricky Ponting's lack of form (113 runs at 16.14) hurt the side but the skipper cannot be blamed for the lack of consistency in his team's bowling. The pacemen, lacking discipline, performed in fits and starts while the threat from spin was virtually non-existent. Ponting's long argument with umpire Aleem Dar after Pietersen survived a caught-behind referral at the MCG reflected the stress the Aussie captain was under. Australia dominated the Ashes with eight successive series triumphs (1989-2003). Now the side misses the resilience of Steve Waugh, the genius of Shane Warne and Adam Gilchrist, the mean line and bounce of Glenn McGrath, and the dominant presence of Matthew Hayden. Rebuilding is going to be a huge challenge. Rising England, by contrast, can now look forward to challenging India and South Africa for top honours in Test cricket.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Crickets-power-shift/article15502157.ece
30,12,2010,Guantánamo's medical victims,"The reputation of the United States will be seriously damaged by its use of the anti-malarial drug mefloquine, marketed as Lariam, on all detainees at Guantánamo Bay. According to several studies, most notably those published in the British Medical Journal in 2001 and 2003, the drug causes severe neuropsychological side-effects, including depression, hallucinations, and homicidal and suicidal thoughts. These are of a greater intensity than those caused by other anti-malarials. Lariam's manufacturers, Roche, recorded suicidal side-effects in the 1990s, and even the U.S. military's procedures for treating its own personnel prefer the use of other drugs. Medical staff at Guantánamo assumed, however, that all detainees were at risk of malaria; they also claimed that 40 per cent of the Afghan population was infected, when the World Health Organisation's figure for 2002 was 13 per cent. They did not even test the detainees for malaria in advance, and administered doses of 1250 mg, which were five times the normal prophylactic dose. Nor was there any prior investigation for contraindicating conditions, which include pre-existing post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety.
The issues go beyond the comment by a U.S. army public health physician that the use of mefloquine at Guantánamo was an “egregious malpractice.” First, the Bush administration's disregard of the scientific evidence was consistent with its contempt for all evidence that did not support its policies. Over Lariam, it ignored its own documents stating there was no risk that malaria would be reintroduced to Cuba by carriers at Guantánamo; the good health island has been malaria-free for half a century. Washington also imposed a veil of secrecy. Military doctors who raised doubts about mefloquine were ordered to remain silent, and President Bush gave the Secretary of Health and Human Services unprecedented authority to classify information. Researchers at the Seton Hall School of Law have concluded that by the government's own analysis, the use of mefloquine at Guantánamo may have breached U.S. federal law and the U.N. Convention Against Torture. Mr. Bush decreed furthermore that the Convention did not apply to detainees in the ‘War on Terror.' His Deputy Secretary of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz, ordered that the requirement for informed consent could be waived when “medical products” were being developed for the armed forces. The combination of secrecy and mendacity strengthens the likelihood that at Guantánamo the U.S. military engaged in medical experimentation on captives. The modern history of that practice is sheer evil.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Guant%C3%A1namos-medical-victims/article12719149.ece
31,12,2010,When kids do real science,"Can an experiment conceived, carried out, and reported in kids-speak with pencil-coloured figures and hand-written tables by school children aged 8 to 10 years get published in a highly rated international journal following a peer-reviewing process? Twenty-seven schoolchildren from the Blackawton Primary School in Devon, U.K., have proved this is possible — if a simple but novel scientific question raised is answered in a scientific way. Their paper was published in the Royal Society's Biology Letters journal (“Blackawton bees,” by P.S. Blackawton et al: >http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/site/misc/BlackawtonBees.xhtml). The objective was to test if bumblebees, once trained, could remember the visual pattern based on colour and choose the correct holes representing sugar water. The bees were first trained using a grid containing 16 holes in a 4x4 array, with the inner four holes containing sugar water and set to blue and the outer 12 holes containing salt water and set to yellow, and vice versa. They were then tested using the same and also a new pattern of colours, and retested using a new colour. The finding was that bumble-bees can use a “combination of colour and spatial relationships in deciding which colour of flower to forage from.” Considering that our understanding of how bees perceive coloured patterns and scenes is inadequate, this inspiring outcome has shown that schoolchildren guided by gifted teachers can think and carry out experiments like any hard-wired scientist. An accompanying commentary (“Blackawton bees: commentary on Blackawton, P.S. et al.” by Laurence T. Maloney and Natalie Hempel de Ibarra) notes that the experiments were “modest in scope but cleverly and correctly designed.”
For these kids, doing science changed their perception of the subject. Science also became “cool and fun.” This refreshing approach turns the spotlight on the best methods of teaching science. The rote learning system adopted by most schools in India, even classroom study combined with some laboratory work with pre-defined outcomes, does very little to stimulate curiosity and interest in science. Is that one of the reasons why out-of-the-box thinking that produces path-breaking science rarely comes out of Indian laboratories? The children at Blackawton had their gifted teacher, and R. Beau Lotto, a neuroscientist and co-author from University College, London, to guide them. Scientists from India's space and atomic energy departments and in some other places where serious science is done can take a leaf out of Blackawton's book and lead the way in engaging with school pupils and getting them to do real science.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/When-kids-do-real-science/article12717905.ece
31,12,2010,Shoring up public healthcare,"The world's growing riches seem to make little difference to over 100 million people globally as they slide into poverty every year because of healthcare costs. One of the unsolved conundrums in many countries is the inability to provide for universal healthcare coverage, despite economic growth and development. While the financial consequences of illness are severe for many in poorer countries that do not have appropriate systems in place, those in richer nations are by no means immune from this malady. Researchers at Harvard have made the point that illness or medical bills were behind 62 per cent of personal bankruptcies in the United States in 2007. In India, high spending on health is a major reason for people sliding into poverty. Inadequate state delivery systems mean India's private expenditure on health accounts for 72 per cent of the total health expenditure. Moreover, with poor re-financing options, a staggering 89.5 per cent of this private health expenditure is met out of pocket, from the immediately available funds of individuals. Coming up with viable financing methods, therefore, is an urgent requirement for many countries, including India. The World Health Organisation makes a timely intervention by calling for reforms in the way nations finance healthcare in its World Health Report — Health systems financing: the path to universal coverage.
Any policy that aims at reducing personal financial burden related to healthcare should focus on bringing down the direct payments by the individual. This means a change in who pays for healthcare, now borne overwhelmingly by individuals in countries that have weak government-paid healthcare systems. The question of ‘who-else-should-pay' gives itself two choices globally: integration of provision and payment, which calls for a lead role by governments; and an institutionally separate agency, say, an insurer or a government body that pays for healthcare on behalf of individuals. In India, there has been an increase in the share of private insurance to meet private health expenditure, up from 1.1 per cent in 1995 to 2.2 per cent in 2008. But this is no substitute for the state's role in providing basic, affordable healthcare. The report's suggested domestic options for innovative financing — for instance, diaspora bonds, and a minimal tax on foreign exchange transactions in currency markets (0.005 per cent in the case of India) — are timely as they could help governments fund better state-provided healthcare. Revenues raised from such measures should be used for putting in place strong and affordable delivery systems, particularly in the two important areas of primary and preventive healthcare.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Shoring-up-public-healthcare/article12717904.ece
2,1,2011,The cost of appeasement,"With increased power comes increased responsibility, U.S. president Barack Obama told Parliament in November after endorsing a permanent seat at the U.N. Security Council for India. What he meant, of course, was that he expected India to use its position at the global level to bat for American causes and never undermine them. So was the Manmohan Singh government trying to demonstrate its “responsibility” when it banned Indian companies from using the Asian Clearing Union to process payments for Iranian oil imports? On paper, the decision was taken by the Reserve Bank of India and, again, on paper, the RBI is supposed to be independent of the government. The net effect, however, is that India has finally acted on a long-pending demand of the U.S. Treasury Department to shut down the ACU route. The ACU was set up in 1974 by Iran, India, and other South Asian countries. Its purpose is to facilitate intra-regional trade by allowing import bills to be settled through mutual book-keeping arrangements at the nine central banks that are part of the Union. With the U.S. and a number of European countries using extraterritorial financial sanctions as a lever to get the rest of the world to stop trading with the Islamic Republic, it has been getting increasingly difficult for companies from India and elsewhere to open dollar or euro-denominated letters of credit to pay for transactions involving Iran. Two years ago, the Iranians suggested the use of the ACU and the mechanism was working well.
Washington objected to the ACU for two reasons. First, individual transactions were effectively shielded from its scrutiny and second, because it allowed the Iranians to do an end run around the financial restrictions the U.S. and its allies are imposing as part of their effort to put the squeeze on Tehran over the nuclear issue. India, which imports nearly $12 billion worth of crude from Iran annually, has much to lose if Iranian supplies are effectively blocked from reaching world markets through extraterritorial sanctions. Which is why it is surprising that it tamely went along with the U.S. pressure on the use of the ACU. No doubt an alternative payment mechanism for Iranian crude will be found but having tasted blood, the U.S. will keep pushing India to cut its energy ties with Tehran. Already, the meek attitude of the Manmohan Singh government in the face of American pressure has seen Indian companies opting out of lucrative investment opportunities in Iran. There is also a wider political and strategic cost involved, especially in Afghanistan where India has to think about how to safeguard its long-term interests in the face of continuing Pakistani hostility. It is time the government realised India cannot safeguard its interests in the region by appeasing Washington on Iran.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-cost-of-appeasement/article15503926.ece
2,1,2011,Fuelled by public sector issues,"The primary market witnessed a bumper crop of new public issues, comprising both initial public offers (IPOs) and follow-on public offers (FPOs) in 2010. The total mobilisation at Rs.69,132 crore was the highest ever in the history of the primary market. According to Prime Database, one of India's oldest and most reliable purveyors of capital market data, the mobilisation in 2010 was three-and-a half times the 2009 figure of Rs.19,567 crore and 53 per cent more than the Rs.45,142 crore mobilised in 1997, the previous record-breaking year. Impressive as the buoyancy in the primary market has been, it is worth noting that the surge in the number and quantum of new public issues came after a lacklustre performance in 2008 and 2009. Secondly, it was possible almost entirely because of a sharp acceleration in the public sector disinvestment programme. Government-owned institutions mobilised Rs.49,007 crore — more than 70 per cent of the year's total — through three IPOs and six follow-on public offers (FPOs). In contrast, in 2009, there were only two IPOs from the public sector companies. The implication is that the United Progressive Alliance government has had a greater success in cobbling together a coherent disinvestment programme that was able to overcome much of the opposition. However, there have been some discordant notes. Some employees of Coal India heeding their trade union call did not take up their entitlements and lost out on the gains from the undertaking's maiden offer, by far the biggest IPO from India. .
Obviously, the higher valuations in the secondary market during 2010 have boosted the primary market sentiment. Of the 72 share offers in the year, 64 were IPOs and eight FPOs. The number of FPOs has been declining over the years probably because they involve a further reduction in the government's stake in public sector enterprises. Besides, most of the successful public offers in recent times have been by cash-rich government companies that are under fewer compulsions to tap the capital market at frequent intervals. Another interesting feature is the preponderance of large-sized public issues. There were as many as 13 issues of over Rs.1,000 crore and only nine issues of less than Rs.50 crore. The large average size of the public offer reinforces the point that the new issues market has not been able to accommodate small and medium enterprises. Hence the quest for a separate, dedicated exchange for them will continue.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Fuelled-by-public-sector-issues/article15503925.ece
4,1,2011,Making peace in Assam,"There is little doubt that the release of Arabinda Rajkhowa, the leader of the United Liberation Front of Asom, is a move by the Centre to prepare the ground for talks with a group that has been responsible for much of the ruthless violence in the State in pursuit of its secessionist demand. Provided both sides act with responsibility, it could be the best chance yet for peace in Assam. The importance of the moment cannot be overstated considering it was several years in the making, principally through the steady weakening of ULFA at the hands of a range of actors. If the 2003 crackdown by Bhutan on the safe havens that militants from the north-east had found on its territory was the first big blow to the group, the decision of Bangladesh in 2009 to arrest and hand over to India Mr. Rajkhowa, who goes by the designation of “chairman” of ULFA, was another massive setback. And so were the arrests of other top leaders of the group. Also crucial was the waning popular support for the group on account of its violent and extortionist ways. A turning point in this was its 2004 Independence Day attack on a school in which many children were killed. While the demand for fixing accountability for all the lives lost is an issue that will have to be tackled at some point, the immediate yearning for peace has seen Assam's civil society in the forefront of efforts to bring both sides to the negotiating table. It is now for ULFA and the government not to squander this opportunity. Mr. Rajkhowa's statements after his December 31 release on bail — that he is prepared for unconditional talks with the government — indicate a softening of the group's precondition that peace negotiations must include discussions on the issue of Assam's independence.
The ULFA leader has made clear, however, that decisions regarding talks with the government will need to be endorsed by the group's ‘general council'. For this reason, he has asked for the release of the leaders who still remain in jail, in particular Anup Chetia, who is being held in Bangladesh. It is to be hoped that talks, whenever they take place, will marignalise the self-styled “commander-in-chief” Paresh Barua who is still on the run along with a section of cadres, or tempt him into the process. Meanwhile, with the State Assembly elections due in April, the Tarun Gogoi government must resist the temptation of turning the peace project into a Congress election campaign vehicle. Already, some shades of political opinion in the State have questioned the timing of Mr. Rajkhowa's release.

4,1,2011,The outsourcing of war,"José Luis Gómez del Prado, Chairman of the United Nations Working Group on the Use of Mercenaries, has provided a damning indictment of private military and security companies (PMSCs), the use of which has expanded hugely over the past two decades. In the early 1990s, the DynCorp company was contracted by the United States to air-spray Colombian cocaine plantations, train the national army, and dismantle drug rings. By the middle of 2010, however, the U.S. Department of Defense had nearly 210,000 mercenaries in Iraq and Afghanistan, or about 20 per cent more personnel than the regular military. The worldwide U.S. total is about 240,000, with two-thirds of them coming from host countries and third countries. The main companies are American and British; many of their board members have come through the revolving door between high military ranks and the private war business. The industry, minuscule before 2001, now has a value of about $200 billion a year.
Some PMSCs are so notorious that they have changed their names (Blackwater, for instance, now calls itself Xe). In Iraq, they have intensified political instability and public hatred of the occupying forces. Blackwater/Xe may also have been involved in using white phosphorus as a chemical weapon in Fallujah. In Colombia, Washington gave DynCorp immunity from prosecution over long-term diseases, including cancers, caused by its spraying. In Croatia, MPRI company staff cannot be tried for ethnic cleansing (with which many Croatian officers have been charged). In Iraq, the mercenaries have immunity from criminal prosecution. Victims have to make civil claims at their own expense in U.S. or British courts — as do PMSCs' own staff, many of whom are victims of poor training and equipment, and brutal employment practices. As for the work, PMSCs have carried out rendition flights, tortured captives, and engaged in open combat, frequently causing terrible civilian casualties. Washington has circumvented a U.N. arms embargo by contracting MPRI to equip and train the Croatian army. In effect, many PMSCs are agents of foreign policy. The 1989 U.N. International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries, which covers individuals and not companies, is not adequate to deal with the current situation. It is extremely disturbing that PMSCs are taking over the military functions of the state, in apparent freedom from domestic or international accountability. The sooner they are brought within the ambit of international criminal law, the better.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-outsourcing-of-war/article15508726.ece
4,1,2011,Sudan on the brink,"Sudan, Africa's largest country, the world's tenth largest and one of its poorest, faces partition in a referendum scheduled for January 9. The country is already effectively divided. Seventy per cent of the 43-million population are Sunnis and largely occupy the north; in the south, most are animists and about five per cent belong to various Christian sects. The two regions have maintained an uneasy truce since a 2005 agreement ended a savage 22-year civil war in which an estimated two million were killed and four million displaced. The six-year conflict in Darfur still causes echoes: President Omar al-Bashir is the only serving head of state indicted for genocide. Furthermore, fearing post-referendum violence, about 75,000 of the 1.5 million southerners who fled the civil war have returned south by road and in barge-convoys along the White Nile. Increasingly confrontational statements have come from the national capital Khartoum and the southern regional capital Juba. The U.N.-backed Satellite Sentinel Project, which is intended to reduce the risk of genocide by providing independent surveillance and rapid reportage, says both sides are massing troops on the north-south border.
There are other reasons why the referendum could be a tragedy in the making. The al-Bashir government insists on a 60 per cent turnout, an excessive requirement in an enormous country with a wretched transport infrastructure and an inefficient administration. Even the electoral register is a bone of contention; in the oil-rich border province of Abyei, Khartoum wants the nomadic Misseriya tribe registered, though they spend only the dry season there. Juba wants the resident population registered. Abyei is also to have a separate and simultaneous referendum on whether to retain its special administrative status in the north or join southern Sudan. Secondly, neighbouring states have an interest in the outcome of the national referendum. Kenya, Ethiopia, and Uganda will want deals with Juba over Nile water. Other foreign powers have their own stake, particularly in southern oil reserves and farmland. WikiLeaks cables confirm U.S. acceptance of Kenyan participation in supplying Ukrainian tanks to southern forces. Almost farcically, that matter came to light when Somali pirates hijacked a ship carrying the tanks to Kenya; the cables also show that the U.S. tried to deny all knowledge of the shipment. As so often, Sudan's tragedies are exacerbated by the colonial legacy — Sudan itself is a 19th-century British creation — and continuing great-power interference. After all that they have suffered, the people of Sudan deserve better from their own leaders and the rest of the world.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Sudan-on-the-brink/article15505073.ece
4,1,2011,Policy imperatives for growth,"As the developed economies grapple with the worst economic downturn since the 1930s, two reports by the United Nations place the difficulties in perspective and offer valuable suggestions for both developed and developing nations to see them through the crisis in the near- to medium-term. Developed nations are yet to come to terms with the crisis in any meaningful way. Moreover, emerging economies and those from the developing world — particularly China and India — which acted as a bulwark against the spread of the economic contagion are likely to continue to play the role. But there are some caveats. The World Economic Situation and Prospect 2011, in its global outlook, points out that, although the weaknesses of the developed world were offset by the growth in the emerging economies, two main challenges remain. These include the dangers posed by premature fiscal consolidation in the developing world and the valid concerns over the ability of the emerging world to sustain its performance, particularly given its dependence on developed markets. For the developed economies, which could risk sliding into a possible double-dip if they continue with their present monetary and fiscal policies, the answer lies in coordinated fiscal stimuli in the short-run, rather than early fiscal consolidation.
For the developing world, the U.N.'s Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific makes it evident that maintaining the region's recent growth trajectory calls for prudent policy-making, factoring in its dependence on markets in the developed world. Its year-end update of the Economic and Social Survey 2010 sounds a note of caution that there could be a slowdown in the growth of both developed and developing economies. The region's export-dependent economies particularly are likely to be affected in 2011. That said, the observation that the Asia Pacific region would see “the most dynamic growth” in the world, despite the likely dip, gives national policymakers space to come up with well-structured policies that address a pressing social concern: poverty. Of direct relevance to the region's economic and social needs are suggestions to intensify regional economic activity and close infrastructure gaps. Stubborn poverty remains the biggest challenge for the Asia-Pacific, which is home to about 947 million people living under $1.25 a day. It is necessary for developing countries to put in place inclusive development policies, supported by fiscal measures, to ensure that more people are pulled out of poverty. This, in turn, would step up aggregate demand and help the region come through the testing economic times.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Policy-imperatives-for-growth/article15505072.ece
6,1,2011,Bofors has risen again,"Bofors is 20th century India's defining political corruption scandal. In magnitude, the $50 million payoff — an aggregate of illegitimate and supposedly prohibited ‘commissions,' calculated on a percentage basis, paid into secret Swiss bank accounts during 1986-87 for winning a howitzer contract with India — by the Swedish arms manufacturing company pales in comparison with the corruption scandals of today. Over a quarter of a century, Bofors has had its ups and downs, its ebb and flow, in the public mind. But its unravelling greatly raised public consciousness, enabling politically minded Indians to gain a sharper perspective on how various institutions perform in relation to corruption. With the executive branch resorting to flagrant cover-up and obstruction of justice, Parliament, the Central Bureau of Investigation, and the judiciary failed to do the right thing by the people of India. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India, a dependable but underestimated custodian of the public interest, blew the whistle on some suspicious financial aspects of the defence deal. But it was the press, and specifically The Hindu, that unearthed and documented the actual corruption involved in the decision to award the howitzer contract to Bofors, the bribes disguised as ‘commissions,' and the secret agreements and communication that enabled the payoffs into Swiss bank accounts. Had proper action been taken in time, under the law of the land, against those who received the payoffs and those in positions of power who set up and facilitated the scam, India might have been spared the spate of corruption scandals that torments it a quarter century later.
Unlike other corruption scandals, Bofors has refused to go away as a national issue — because the deep-seated political, moral, and systemic issues it raised won't go away. The CBI may, in deference to its political masters, be pushing for closure of the criminal case against Italian wheeler-dealer Ottavio Quattrocchi, whose only connection with howitzers was his proximity to those who could make crucial decisions on their acquisition. The CBI's rationalisation, among other things, is that the alleged offence is 23 years old; the co-accused are either dead or have proceedings against them quashed; the Delhi High Court has knocked out the corruption underpinning of the case; and in any case the attempts to secure the Italian businessman's presence in India have failed. It is typical of Bofors that at a time its funeral rites are being readied, it has risen from the bier thanks to a totally unexpected intervention. This time the intervener is the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal.
The 98-page Order (the text is at www.thehindu.com) of ITAT's Delhi Bench ‘B' in an appeals case featuring Hersh W. Chadha, son and legal heir of Bofors agent W.N. Chadha, arrives at damning conclusions based on a lucid review of the facts of the larger case. The key finding in the Order (page 92): “There is enough material on record to hold that the payments were indeed made by Bofors to Svenska, AE Services and Moresco through the above foreign bank accounts, in connection with the defence deal with the Government of India … Therefore the assessee is liable to pay income tax as determined by the AO [Assessment Officer] in this behalf.” The Bofors-Chadha contention that the payments were ‘winding up costs' and not illegitimate ‘commissions' is shown up to be totally false, nothing but a cover up story. In fact, challenging or attempting to block proper disclosure of relevant details by the Swiss government to the Indian judicial system can result in an adverse inference being drawn against the assessees. In the process of fact verification, the ITAT Bench examines the material and circumstances that stand against Mr. Quattrocchi and A.E. Services Limited, the front set up weeks before the contract was signed to receive three per cent of the howitzer contract value for no legitimate services rendered. The Bench also finds fault with the IT Department for failing to take action against A.E. Services Limited and against Mr. Quattrocchi. It affirms that since the defence contract was executed in India, all the entities that received the payments “are amenable to [the] jurisdiction of [the] Indian Income Tax Department.” It holds that Bofors should have deducted withholding tax from payments made to Win Chadha, to A.E. Services Limited, and to Mr. Quattrochchi, and that failure to hold Bofors to account is “a serious issue.” Inaction in such matters goes against the rule of law and can foster the notion that “India is a soft state and one can meddle with its tax laws with impunity.”
Finally, the ITAT Order presents interesting insights into what constitutes admissible evidence in such cases. Criminal law relies on the Indian Evidence Act and the Rules of Evidence. Income tax liability, on the other hand, is “ascertained on the basis of the material available on record, the surrounding circumstances, human conduct and preponderance of probabilities.” Thus on Bofors, the documents and other material available from the Swedish National Audit Bureau's report, the Joint Parliamentary Committee, the CBI's charge sheet, and The Hindu (in the form of photo copies of the documents and other material published) can be taken on board, with due safeguards, in the assessment of tax liability. There is a compelling parallel between this approach and the ways of sound investigative journalism. Just as income tax professionals have drawn resourcefully from the press, investigative journalists can learn usefully from the method and fact verification disciplines employed in this case by the income tax assessment officer and the ITAT Bench. For the powerful in India, as the law scholar Upendra Baxi once noted, there may be immunity from prosecution at the bar of law but there is no immunity from prosecution at the bar of public opinion.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Bofors-has-risen-again/article15508721.ece
7,1,2011,A sagacious prescription,"By acknowledging the merits of the longstanding grievances of the people of the Telangana region and recommending robust “constitutional/statutory measures” – centred on a Telangana Regional Council – for the “socio-economic development and political empowerment” of the region within a united Andhra Pradesh as “the best way forward,” the Committee for Consultations on the Situation in Andhra Pradesh headed by retired Supreme Court judge B.N. Srikrishna has brought uncommon wisdom and progressive empathy to the task of finding a just and equitable solution to a problem that has seemed intractable. The statutory and empowered Regional Council would be provided with “adequate transfer of funds, functions and functionaries” and would also act as “a legislative consultative mechanism” for the subjects it would deal with. Furthermore, a technical body in the form of a Water Management Board and an Irrigation Project Development Corporation in expanded form are proposed for the management of water and irrigation resources. After weighing five other options, the Committee is of the opinion that this is the “most workable option in the given circumstances and in the best interest of the social and economic welfare of the people of all the three regions.” The recommendation takes into even-handed account the grievances and aspirations of the people of Telangana, Coastal Andhra, and Rayalaseema – which is objectively identified as the most backward region of the State. Now it is for the Central and State governments to come up with credible guarantees of “firm political and administrative management,” which the Committee considers absolutely necessary to carry conviction with the people of the State that this solution is in “the best interest of all.” The Hindu wholeheartedly endorses the Srikrishna Committee's sagacious approach and prescription, which comes out of a lot of hard work and open-minded consultation with all sections of the people of the State.
The core issues, the Committee rightly emphasises, are socio-economic development and good governance. The united Andhra Pradesh option, premised on far-going and meaningful regional autonomy for Telangana, is recommended for “continuing the development momentum” of all three regions and “keeping in mind the national perspective.” Crucially, it would end the uncertainty over the future of Hyderabad. The “second best option” – bifurcation of the State into Telangana and Seemandhra with their existing boundaries and with Hyderabad as the capital of the former and a new capital for Seemandhra – is clearly a distant second. The Committee's view is that this option should be exercised only if it becomes unavoidable and all three regions come to an amicable agreement on it – a tall order indeed. With Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram calling for an informed and mature debate with an open mind on the Srikrishna Committee Report, it is incumbent on all political parties in Andhra Pradesh, and especially the Telangana Rashtra Samithi, to respond soberly, fairly, and democratically. South India's largest State has a real opportunity to get it right this time.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-sagacious-prescription/article15510220.ece
7,1,2011,Generally positive,"The Reserve Bank of India's second Financial Stability Report is generally positive. Maintaining and monitoring financial stability has always been a key objective of monetary policy. However, it was only from the middle of 2009 that the government and the RBI sought to institutionalise the process, making financial stability “an integral driver of the policy framework.” Accordingly, the RBI set up a Financial Stability Unit in August 2009 and started presenting periodical reports since March 2010. The first report found the banking system to be broadly healthy and well-capitalised, but noted that global economic shocks, inflation, the slow pace of fiscal consolidation and the unsettlingly large capital inflows posed significant risks to financial stability. According to the second FSR, many of the positive features are intact. Growth has rebounded strongly and the financial conditions are stable. Despite intermittent volatility in the foreign exchange and equity markets, the financial sector has been risk-free. New risk assessment measures introduced by the RBI — such as the Financial Stress Indicator and the Banking Stability Index — corroborate the central bank's generally positive assessment.
At the same time, the report also points to some significantly higher risks. Among them are: the widening current account deficit; volatile capital inflows; deterioration in some key external sector ratios; and the persistently high inflation. The asset quality of banks and their asset-liability mismatch need to be constantly monitored. Recent developments in the microfinance institutional structure cause serious concern. Given the increasing correlation between global economic growth and that in emerging markets, the possibility of certain exogenous risks materialising is strong. The finance channel has assumed greater importance in transmitting the pace and severity of the impact of disturbances abroad. The proposed capital rules pose some regulatory challenges. Implementing international norms calibrated to local conditions will require concerted efforts. However, given its inherent soundness, the banking system is unlikely to be stretched unduly.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Generally-positive/article15508799.ece
8,1,2011,Wake up Pakistan,"The assassination of Salmaan Taseer by his police bodyguard — which recalls in some way the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984 — is a grim reminder of the extent to which Pakistan has descended into the depths of religious extremism. The Governor of Pakistan's Punjab province, Mr. Taseer was an abrasive and sharp-elbowed politician of the ruling Pakistan People's Party. Commendably, he was one of the rare leaders in this party of diffident moderates who was unafraid to confront religious extremism. One of his first acts after taking office in May 2008 was to declare that Basant, a spring festival in Punjab opposed by religious clerics and banned by a court order, would be revived. Recently, he angered Pakistan's Islamic political parties with a spirited campaign against the controversial blasphemy law. His visit to a jail to meet Aasia Bibi, a Christian woman convicted under the law and sentenced to death, and his assurance to her that he would help her obtain a presidential pardon, triggered a nation-wide protest against him by the religious parties. Some clerics declared he was an apostate. Mr. Taseer's assassin declared, after being taken into custody following the killing, that he was proud to have killed a “blasphemer.” It remains unclear if the man was acting alone or at the behest of others. Certainly, it is no secret that the Pakistan security forces, the law enforcing agencies and other key government institutions are infiltrated by sympathisers of militant groups and those with extremist views. But the realisation that even a special commando unit assigned to protect Pakistan's leaders is not immune from such elements is frightening.
The incident is bound to reduce the limited space for Pakistan's liberal-moderates and their modest efforts to stem the tide of extremism sweeping across the country. The mealy-mouthed condemnations of the killing even by PPP politicians and the surge of popular support for the assassin show which way the wind is blowing. Pakistani voters may not choose Islamist political parties to lead them. But over the decades, large enough numbers in all sections of society have become sufficiently radicalised to ensure that anyone who attempts reform, even of recent horrors such as the murderous blasphemy law and the anti-women Hudood laws — both the legacy of the military dictator Zia-ul-Haq — does so at great personal and political risk. The radicalisation is the undeniable result of a deliberate policy by the Pakistan state to nurture militancy in order to meet regional strategic objectives. Mr. Taseer's killing is another setback for President Asif Ali Zardari and the PPP government, already in trouble after being reduced to a minority regime following the withdrawal of support by a key coalition partner. It can only be hoped that the tragic incident serves as an alarm call to Pakistan's decision-makers, the Pakistan Army included, that they need to act with extraordinary urgency, courage, and honesty to clamp down on fanaticism, extremism, and terrorism of all kinds before the country sinks any deeper.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Wake-up-Pakistan/article15510345.ece
8,1,2011,Test cricket at its compelling best,"It was fitting that the three-Test series between India and South Africa finished level, for there was little to separate the world's two best cricket teams. The 1-1 result enhanced India's meticulously earned reputation as a skilled, determined touring side. But despite its success in other parts of the world since the turn of the millennium, South Africa remained beyond it: India had lost each of its four Test series in South Africa. It was a record that needed remedying, for a No.1 side can't afford to be seen as second-best. India was in danger of being perceived as just that after being outclassed in the first Test. But M.S. Dhoni's team then accomplished the two things that have been most striking about its ascent to the top: it rebounded, not so much addressing the concerns of defeat as transcending them, and it outplayed a host team that had mistakenly arranged for conditions that suited the quicker bowlers. The win in Durban captured in miniature the metamorphosis of the Indian team from one which played warily in such conditions to one that seized the big moment.
India may well have secured its first series win in South Africa had it not encountered the great Jacques Kallis at the peak of his powers. Thirty-five-year-old Kallis wrenched the series from India with a singularly masterful performance in the third Test. In the first innings he countered alarming movement and stitched the lower-order together. In the second, with India sensing victory, he lifted his side, batting without nerves on a surface that took turn. In each innings he overcame severe physical pain. If Dale Steyn, who bowled brilliantly, had the luck and the support he deserved, Kallis' efforts would have earned a series win. For India, its council of elders once again excelled. Sachin Tendulkar continued his phenomenal run-making, V.V.S. Laxman was the match-winner in Durban, and Zaheer Khan inspired the best out of a talented but inconsistent seam attack. Also heartening was the form displayed by Gautam Gambhir. The only discordant note in a compelling series rich with drama was the inclination of both teams to switch to defensive cricket too easily. This tendency hurt India on the fourth day of the deciding Test. If India is to become a dominant No.1 side, it's an area that needs work.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Test-cricket-at-its-compelling-best/article15510344.ece
9,1,2011,Get science priorities right,"Sessions of the Indian Science Congress have provided forums for the nation's executive to announce new policy initiatives in science and technology. The recently concluded 98th session at the SRM University in Chennai, with its focal theme of ‘Quality Education and Excellence in Scientific Research in Indian Universities,' was no exception. When it comes to a skilled workforce India, as Minister for S&T Kapil Sibal noted in his keynote address, faces a huge supply-demand gap. A major reason is young people moving away from science at the tertiary level. The mushrooming of private and foreign players in an unregulated environment to impart education, much of it of poor quality, puts pressure on the government to step in and provide quality higher S&T education that is affordable. This calls for measures to widen the human resource base and increase the average proficiency levels at the universities. While it is nobody's case that we do not need more universities, the chief thrust should be towards strengthening the existing ones, both Central and State, in terms of infrastructure, finance, and autonomy so that the research and teaching environment gets invigorated to produce quality output. Modest external support for research in universities has already shown positive results: in the last three years, while India's research publications have grown annually at 12 per cent, university output has grown at 30 per cent. Unfortunately, the policy pronouncements of the Prime Minister as well as the S&T Minister seemed to miss the point by addressing the peaks in scientific research rather than improving the average.
Innovation is the new buzzword among Indian policymakers and scientocrats. Innovation cannot be bought or implanted. It will happen on its own once you have provided the right environment for research and education in institutions of higher learning. Name-plating organisations cannot produce innovation. Mr. Sibal announced that the government was working on the concept of creating ‘Navratna' universities along the lines of Ivy League institutions. He also spoke of plans to set up 14 ‘Innovation' universities that would “set benchmarks in academics and … compete with the best in the world in the context of problems of hunger, water, poverty, and diseases through cutting-edge science and technology.” Rising India can certainly ivy-coat university buildings but that will not guarantee academic excellence and creativity. The Navratna public sector enterprises won that label in consequence of their hard work, solid achievement, and sustained growth; they were not labelled beforehand. Another dubious official project is the Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research to be established in association with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. This is basically conceived as a shortcut to produce hundreds of PhDs and post-doctoral fellows to meet the CSIR's needs. The real challenge is to initiate measures that will produce science and technology excellence in the university system. Diverting the CSIR from its mission of technology development into human resource development is likely to be to the detriment of universities.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Get-science-priorities-right/article15513352.ece
9,1,2011,Upbeat but with caveats,"The International Monetary Fund's most recent assessment of the Indian economy is broadly in line with those of the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India. The economy is expected to grow at a robust rate of 8.75 per cent this year and moderate to around 8 per cent during 2011-12. Since mid-2009, the pace of recovery, which is led by domestic demand, has been strong. Monetary and fiscal policies have been accommodative and the real interest rates have remained low. But, despite some attempts at fiscal consolidation, the fiscal deficit is high. There are other near-time challenges, high inflation being the most significant one. A few days after the release of the IMF report, food inflation shot up to 18.22 per cent. There is very little slack in the economy and this has spurred inflation in manufactured goods. The high food prices are due to supply side factors as well as a structural shift in the consumption patterns. As the RBI pointed out, the consumption of milk, eggs, meat, and other protein-rich items has increased and their prices have moderated less than those of cereals and pulses. It is highly unlikely that the year-end inflation targets will be achieved.
The IMF expects India's growth prospects to remain strong over the medium term. Rapid growth is expected to be supported by high investment and productivity gains. Most of the downside risks relate to the global economy. Surging capital inflows could spur further investment, but could also complicate macroeconomic management. Sustaining rapid growth over the medium term will depend, among others, on efforts to facilitate infrastructure investment — such as deepening the corporate bond market and lowering the cost of doing business. It is equally important to improve social indicators, even while carrying out fiscal consolidation. Few will disagree with the IMF's view that improving social outcomes and strengthening infrastructure are the two key pillars of a strategy to achieve rapid and inclusive growth in India. India's banking system is resilient and well capitalised. However, there is a need to constantly monitor asset quality especially when prudential norms for infrastructure are eased.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Upbeat-but-with-caveats/article15513353.ece
11,1,2011,BJP's return to form,"It is politically significant that the Bharatiya Janata Party has managed to put itself on the path to recovery within a year of being all but written off. With miseries coming in a pack through 2009, the principal Opposition party battled existential questions at this time last year. Consider what it was up against: two general election defeats in a row, the lowest Lok Sabha tally in two decades, personality clashes compounded by ideological confusion, and a succession war only partly stemmed by the arrival of the underestimated Nitin Gadkari. But all this might have been an eternity ago, judging by the signature aggression on display at the recent national executive meet in Guwahati — which concluded with the party announcing corruption as its main poll plank. It is not a coincidence that the BJP has recovered its sense of purpose at a time when the Congress, beset by scam and scandal, is fighting with its back to the wall. Indeed, it is plain enough that the ruling party has offered the issue on a platter to its main rival.
For the BJP, the opportunity presented itself when the Manmohan Singh government, already in all manner of trouble over corruption in the Commonwealth Games, akratically refused to heed the united Opposition's demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee enquiry into the 2G spectrum irregularities. The BJP astutely assumed leadership of the pro-JPC agitation in Parliament, taking care to ensure that the target of Opposition attack was none other than the ‘untainted' Manmohan Singh. Since then the First Family has come directly under fire — thanks to Bofors returning in the form of a damning order of the Income-Tax Appellate Tribunal. What more can the Congress' principal adversary ask for? On the face of it, it is an ironic reversal of fortunes between the two main parties in the political system. Yet the BJP has a long way to go before it can truly challenge the Congress, not least because of its own track record of stonewalling corruption charges in Karnataka. In contrast to Union Telecom Minister A. Raja, who was asked to resign pending investigation into the 2G scam, Chief Minister B.S Yeddyurappa has dug in his heels in the face of irrefutable evidence of wrongdoing. To the mortification of BJP votaries, there is growing evidence on the involvement of extremist Hindutva elements in some terrorist bombings. Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that the BJP's former allies are not exactly queuing up to return to the National Democratic Alliance — this despite the party's impressive showing in the Bihar Assembly election, where it outscored Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United). The BJP hopes that a popular mood swing of the kind that Bofors brought about in the late-1980s against the government of Rajiv Gandhi can be achieved against the coalition regime of Dr. Manmohan Singh by a focussed campaign on the 2G spectrum scam and other corruption scandals. We must wait and see if history will be repeated.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/BJPs-return-to-form/article15514560.ece
11,1,2011,At record levels,"For Indian consumers reeling under high food prices, it might be small comfort that the rest of the world too is sharing the problem in varying degrees. In Algeria and a few other North African countries, riots have occurred over high food prices, although other factors such as the high levels of unemployment also contributed to the unrest. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), food prices hit a record high in December 2010, surpassing the levels touched in 2007-08, when food riots occurred in countries as far apart as Haiti and Bangladesh. The FAO's food price index, which tracks the wholesale prices of commodities such as wheat, rice, corn, oil seeds, dairy products, and meat rose to 214.7 per cent in December. The previous peak was 213.5, reached in June 2008. The FAO has said that the increase does not constitute a crisis, but admitted that the situation was “alarming”. The near-term outlook for food prices too is gloomy.
The rise in the food price index is attributed to an increase in the prices of sugar, oil seeds and meat. Sugar prices recently reached a 30-year high. While some comfort can be derived from the fact that the prices of rice have remained relatively stable, wheat prices are set to rise on the back of poor harvests in some major producing regions. As in India, high food prices are driving inflation beyond the comfort levels of central banks in many other countries. Also, macroeconomic management has become more complex as the price rise has been particularly sharp in the case of commodities such as vegetables, milk, and meat, which are increasingly preferred by consumers over cereals. Even as it seems certain that the global food imports by countries facing shortages will hit a record high in 2011, the policymakers in many countries are forced to adopt short-term measures such as banning exports of critical food items. At another level, the high agricultural prices are a further disincentive to conclude the Doha round of trade talks. Large agricultural exporters such as Brazil and Argentina that stand to gain enormously appear much less interested. Yet a globally coordinated strategy is necessary not only for furthering multilateral trade but also in areas such as checking the unbridled financialisation of commodities markets and encouraging speculation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/At-record-levels/article15514561.ece
12,1,2011,Hyping up science,"Science when hyped loses credibility. Two separate incidents in a span of three weeks show how scientists who hype up and sensationalise their work end up diluting the significance of their discovery. In a paper published online in the Science journal in the first week of December (“A bacterium that can grow by using arsenic instead of phosphorus” by Felisa Wolfe-Simon, et al), authors from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and other institutions report that a particular bacterium isolated from California's Mono Lake was capable of substituting arsenic for a small percentage of phosphorus and still sustain its growth. This is a most surprising finding considering that arsenic is a toxic element and is not one of the six elements — carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, and phosphorus — that make up most of the organic molecules in living matter. Days before publication of the paper, the worldwide web went wild with speculation about extra-terrestrial life. The reason: a media advisory sent out by NASA on a press briefing “to discuss an astrobiology finding that will impact the search for extra-terrestrial life.” In consequence, most media reports following the publication of the paper dwelt on the issue of extra-terrestrial life. It turned out that the paper did not discuss the possibility of life outside Earth; nor did the accompanying news item published in the journal propose anything of the kind.
The second instance of hyping up science relates to a press release from Tel Aviv University. According to this, the earliest evidence of existence of modern humans has been found in Israel, predating evidence found in Africa by about 200,000 years. The conclusion contradicts the prevailing view of human evolution and migration out of Africa. What followed was sensationalist media coverage of an otherwise stodgy work of purely academic interest. The paper, which reports the morphological analysis of human teeth recovered from Israel's Qesem Cave, was recently published online in The American Journal of Physical Anthropology (“Middle Pleistocene dental remains from Qesem Cave [Israel]” by Israel Hershkovitz et al). The paper says the teeth cannot be conclusively identified as belonging to modern humans ( Homo sapiens) or to Neanderthals or to other human species. While the journalists can be faulted for oversimplifying and hyping up the findings of science, the deliberate misleading of the media and the public by some scientists and their institutions must be condemned. Such acts by a few take a heavy toll on the credibility of science.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Hyping-up-science/article15516835.ece
12,1,2011,"Our cotton, their onions","India's reported willingness to relax its ceiling on cotton exports to accommodate the Pakistani demand for the commodity if Pakistan will permit the overland export of onions is a welcome development. The floods in Pakistan affected some portion of its cotton crop, and the country is now short of the commodity for its domestic textile and yarn industry, the mainstay of its fragile economy; heavy and unseasonal rains have caused an onion shortage in India, pushing its price up and out of reach of the ordinary pocket. Onions are in good supply in Pakistan; India's cotton harvest is better than in previous years. It takes nothing more than common sense to see that the two countries can alleviate each other's shortages. The Indian government's decision to restrict the export of cotton to 5.5 million bales in 2010-11 was taken keeping in view the demand of the domestic textile and yarn industry and the estimated production this year. There was no country-specific quota. But amid rising world prices and high demand, Indian traders evidently found it more advantageous to prioritise shipments to China and Indonesia, and the orders for one million bales from Pakistan went unheeded. Also, traders were given an extremely short calendar to register orders. A small upward revision by the Cotton Advisory Board in the projected cotton harvest has evidently enabled the Indian Commerce Ministry to consider raising the export ceiling as a reciprocal measure to Pakistan agreeing to exporting onions to India through the Wagah border.
The Pakistani government has frozen the trade on this route to keep domestic prices in check. It has allowed onions to be exported only by sea, but this long and expensive alternative defeats the purpose for which India wants Pakistani onions. Islamabad must consider New Delhi's proposal with an open mind. An agreement on this may not translate into a paradigm shift in India-Pakistan relations, but in these times of embittered relations, even a small step towards good neighbourliness can go some way in altering the mood of mutual hostility. It now appears that both the countries are tentatively preparing for another round of engagement in March, most likely between the Foreign Secretaries on the sidelines of the SAARC standing committee meeting at Thimpu. The Foreign Ministers may hold talks later in New Delhi, although the date for the meeting has not been decided yet. Cotton and onions are unlikely drivers of India-Pakistan diplomacy, but they could help smoothen the stage for the forthcoming rounds of talks.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Our-cotton-their-onions/article15516834.ece
12,1,2011,Head in the sand,"In a stunning political misadventure, Union Minister for Communications and Information Technology Kapil Sibal has come out as Apologist-in-Chief for the multi-billion dollar scandal of 2G-spectrum allocation in 2008 to favoured parties, including fronts. He chose to fly in the face of facts as well as good governance values in a brazen attack on the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General. At a time when the Central Bureau of Investigation is pursuing the criminal case under the watch of the Supreme Court, and a one-man committee is looking into the procedures and policies in operation in the Department of Telecommunications from 2001, Mr. Sibal has proclaimed there was no loss to the government from the spectrum allocation on a ‘first-come, first-served basis.' The CAG calculated four sets of figures of presumptive loss to the exchequer: Rs.57,666 crore on the basis of sale of equity by the new licensee Swan; Rs.69,626 crore on the basis of sale of equity by Unitech; Rs.67,364 crore on the basis of the rate offered by S Tel; and Rs.176,645 crore on the basis of the 3G auction. True, the 2G allocation was in 2008 while the auction of 3G, which is far more efficient than 2G, was in 2010. Even so, how does Mr. Sibal explain the grant of 2G licences in 2008 at the price fixed in 2001 when the intervening years had witnessed a quantum jump in subscriber base? As the CAG report pointed out, many of the new licensees of 2008, with no experience in the telecom sector, were able to attract substantial amounts of Foreign Direct Investment on the strength of getting licences and access to spectrum. Indeed the CAG report, anticipating many of the lawyerly objections raised by Mr. Sibal, argued that the value of the 2G spectrum given in 2008 could only be “presumptive” because the various determinants such as scarcity value, competition, the number of operators, and the growth of the sector would, “depending upon the market situation… throw up the price that it commands at a given point of time.”
If Mr. Sibal's aggressive defence proves anything, it is that the United Progressive Alliance government has a lot to hide. As the 2007-2008 correspondence on the contentious issues between Union Communications Minister A. Raja and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh (published in The Hindu on December 23, 2010) reveals, Dr. Singh was fully in the picture contemporaneously. The Prime Minister, whose personal integrity is beyond question, failed to act to stop what he was suspicious about — the lack of transparency in allocation and the under-pricing of the entry fee for 2G spectrum, “which is currently benchmarked on old spectrum auction figures.” Mr. Sibal's other defence is pointing to the revenue loss calculations from telecom policy decisions taken by the National Democratic Alliance government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party. This only strengthens the case for a comprehensive enquiry by a high-powered Joint Parliamentary Committee into spectrum allocation right from 2001. Nothing less will do.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Head-in-the-sand/article15515785.ece
12,1,2011,Innovative agreement,"The recent cultural agreement between Italy and China, apart from its bilateral importance, has far reaching significance for the cultural policymakers and heritage enthusiasts worldwide. This first of its kind agreement allows China to have museum space in Rome and Italy likewise in Beijing. The arrangement is for five years but it is renewable and can translate into long-term possession. China has got about 600 square metres of space at the National Museum of Venezia Palace and a unique exhibition comparing the two empires — Roman, and Qui and Han dynasties — is currently open for viewing. This is a radical departure from the usual agreements which make provision for travelling exhibitions or loaning select cultural objects for a fixed period of time. When secure space without hurdles is provided, it is bound to encourage source countries to bring in more precious artefacts and offer a memorable experience in the host countries. Over the long term, free circulation of museum objects has the potential to reduce trafficking in antiquities, the third most pervasive criminal activity in the world.
This innovative approach is also a superior alternative to the commercially oriented franchise model promoted by internationally well known museums such as Guggenheim and the Louvre. When the United Arab Emirates wanted to exhibit some of the prestigious international collections of the Louvre and benefit from the brand value, it signed an agreement with France to set up a branch of the Louvre Museum in Abhu Dhabi. In addition to the cost of construction and management, the UAE had to pay a fee of US$ 500 million to use the name of the Louvre. The Mayor of Rio-de-Janeiro also made similar attempts to build a Guggenheim museum, but it failed to take off in the face of opposition to the huge costs and legal tangles. Indian policymakers struggling to improve the substandard exhibiting environment can creatively adopt the public-spirited Italy-China model. Countries with advanced museum experience can be invited to build their own space and showcase their precious heritage without having either to sacrifice social objectives or compromise the integrity of the institutions. As important, this approach will enable museum officials and designers to benefit from the most advanced international expertise.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Innovative-agreement/article15515741.ece
13,1,2011,Tunisia's political crisis,"Tunisia's President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali is facing the toughest test of his 23-year reign, with severe public unrest over rising food prices and unemployment as focal points. Protests have been intensifying since December 17, when police confiscated fruits and vegetables sold without a permit by a young graduate who had no other means of earning a living. The young man's consequent self-immolation caused his death, provoking disturbances in which public buildings as well as offices of the ruling party, the Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD), were attacked. Violent clashes between the police and groups, mainly of students who face high levels of graduate unemployment, have spread across the country from the western town of Sidi Bouzaid, where the self-immolation occurred. All schools and universities are closed, and news clampdowns have only fuelled rumours. As the government controls the press, including privately owned newspapers and broadcasters, reliable details of casualties from police shooting are impossible to obtain. But trade unions and opposition leaders speak of a rising toll, upwards of 20 deaths.
The protests signify much else besides the Tunisian public's anger over prices and jobs. First, they frontally challenge the World Economic Forum claim that Tunisia's growth rate of 4.5 per cent makes it the most competitive economy in Africa. Secondly, the advances in women's rights, including an end to polygamy and the introduction of universal compulsory free education, are largely inheritances from Mr. Ben Ali's predecessor, Habib Bourguiba. Thirdly, Tunisia has been shown up to be one of the most authoritarian states in the world. But the European Union as well as the former colonial power, France, have responded to the latest developments in low key, presumably because Mr. Ben Ali is an important partner for their policy of blocking immigration from North Africa. The main issues, however, are specifically Tunisian. While neighbouring Algeria responded to protests by cutting taxes on sugar and cooking oil, Mr. Ben Ali called the protesters “hooded hooligans” and “hostile elements on foreign payrolls, who have sold their souls to extremism and terrorism.” Since then he has shown at least some recognition of the nature of the crisis; he has sacked his Interior Minister and formed a committee to investigate corruption. That, however, could be too little too late. The strongman is caught up in a deep political crisis; if he cannot produce quick and decisive improvement on all fronts, the Tunisian people might well take their state back into their own hands.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Tunisias-political-crisis/article15518104.ece
13,1,2011,A government at last?,"The decision of the Nepali Congress to withdraw Ram Chandra Poudel from the country's prime ministerial election is the first positive development in Nepal's long political deadlock. It is to be hoped that this will pave the way out of an impasse that has otherwise shown little sign of resolution. The withdrawal brings to an end a farcical seven-month long process that saw 16 futile rounds by the Constituent Assembly to elect a Prime Minister. The NC decision was triggered by the realisation that its candidate, the only one left in the race, faced certain defeat. Unlike the earlier rounds in which the United Marxists-Leninists abstained, this time the party took the decision to vote against Mr. Poudel. Along with the opposing votes of the Maoists, whose leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” withdrew after the seventh round, the 17th round would have resulted in 350 votes in a 601-member Assembly against Mr. Poudel. Rather than initiate a fresh election process, the three main parties — the Maoists, UML, and NC — must agree on a consensus national government. Each of the three parties may still hope to form a majority government. But this would be short-sighted and counter-productive. It has to be remembered that the main task of any government now is to enable the Constituent Assembly to frame a new Constitution. The two-thirds majority needed for adoption will be difficult to secure if even one of the three major political parties is marginalised through narrow adversarial politics.
Republican Nepal, which began with so much promise, has lost precious time. The new Constitution was to have been framed by May 2010. The Maoists, the single largest party, clearly have the best claim on the prime ministership but a chain of shabby events saw the exit of the Prachanda government. The consequential political wrangling meant the deadline for the draft Constitution could not be met. The deadline was extended to May 2011, but even this is likely to be missed. An added complication is that the final term of the United Nations Mission in Nepal is set to end on January 15. The mission was mandated with the monitoring of weapons and the rehabilitation of personnel of the Royal Nepal Army and the Maoist People's Liberation Army. Its imminent departure has been a further cause for political squabbling over how the task should now be handled. As the main political players plan their next moves, New Delhi must live down its reputation of playing favourites in Nepal's internal politics. It must limit its role to encouraging the key players to come to an agreement on power-sharing so that the country can advance along a path of democracy and equitable development.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-government-at-last/article15518131.ece
15,1,2011,Moving forward with caution,"Even as several issues of field testing of genetically modified mosquitoes to fight malaria and dengue are being debated, Oxitec, a British company founded and part-owned by the University of Oxford, carried out the world's first open field trial last year. The trials to test the efficacy of genetically modified Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that cause dengue were conducted without much publicity in the Grand Cayman Island in the Caribbean Sea. A bigger trial was conducted this year in 16 hectares in the town of East End. Oxitec had worked with the Mosquito Research and Control Unit of the Cayman Islands for the trial. The results presented recently at a meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in Atlanta show that the technology holds great promise. The release of altered and naturally occurring males in a 10:1 ratio resulted in 80 per cent reduction in adult dengue-causing mosquitoes in the study area. The technology is based on the premise that any offspring from the mating of genetically altered male A. aegypti mosquitoes with female mosquitoes would be killed in the larval or pupal stage. As male mosquitoes do not bite humans, the release of GM males will not increase the risk of dengue. Reducing the insect population using sterile male insects is not a new practice and many agricultural pests are controlled by this approach.
Yet there are some concerns about the release of GM mosquitoes. Field testing that was scheduled to start in December in Malaysia in the inland districts of Bentong in the State of Pahang, and Alor Gajah and Melaka in the State of Malacca has been postponed following questions raised by environmental groups. Among them is the possibility of female transgenic mosquitoes also being released when the sex-selection procedure based on pupal size is not strictly and consistently adhered to. According to Malaysia's Genetic Modifications Advisory Committee, laboratory tests showed that three per cent of offspring produced by mating of transgenic male mosquitoes with normal females actually survived into adulthood. This warrants more laboratory studies before undertaking further field trials as the chances of larvae growing into adult mosquitoes are greater in the field as tetracycline, a widely used antibiotic, is common in the environment. Though the mosquitoes would be recaptured and the area fogged once the trials are completed, further evaluation through caged field studies would be needed before open field trials are taken up, given particularly that the areas involved are densely populated.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Moving-forward-with-caution/article15519714.ece
15,1,2011,Ground rules for intervention,"At the start of the new year, a number of developments suggest that monetary authorities around the world will have to grapple with the problem of cross-border flows on a priority basis. The International Monetary Fund, in a recent report, has listed it as one of the two key challenges for emerging economies during this year. Many of them, including India, continue to receive large capital inflows that are potentially destabilising. Perhaps, the most deleterious consequence of capital inflows has been the strengthening of domestic currency leading to a loss in export competitiveness. That, in turn, has led to a rash of currency wars — the phenomenon of several countries intervening in the currency markets simultaneously in order to ensure that their currencies will not be the only ones to rise. Such actions, though self-perpetuating and mutually injurious, have continued into 2011. Brazil, one of the countries most affected and whose finance minister was the first to speak of ‘currency wars' last year, has taken additional steps to check the rise of the real. Even Chile, which has a record of free market economic policy, followed suit by unveiling its own campaign of intervention. While it is clear that government action to stem the destabilising flows has become the rule, attention has begun to shift towards having some kind of ground rules for such intervention that can be monitored by an institution such as the IMF. A study released by the IMF last week underlined the need for such rules.
However, global coordination, besides being extremely complex, is impractical in the current context of disharmony among the major economic powers. Still, even the very advocacy of such ground rules recognises the considerable distance mainstream opinion on capital inflows has travelled over the past two decades. Both the World Bank and the IMF are now supporting the short-term measures of individual countries in curbing inflows. In the 1990s, the fascination for free market solutions led the U.S. Treasury and the IMF to promote capital account liberalisation. The effort floundered because of opposition from some emerging market countries and the East Asian currency crises that clearly demonstrated the dangers of the speculative capital reversing suddenly. Besides, as Jagdish Bhagwati has pointed out, it is wrong to equate free trade with liberalisation of the capital account. India has followed a measured approach to full convertibility of the rupee but so far desisted from imposing short-term controls on volatile capital. The need to bridge the widening current account deficit seems to be the reason. But then over-dependence on such flows is a matter of serious concern and a threat to macroeconomic stability.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Ground-rules-for-intervention/article15519715.ece
16,1,2011,Issues of pilgrim safety,"Among India’s major pilgrimage spots, the hill-shrine of Sabarimala has a unique ethos that welcomes people from all religions. This year the number is one of the highest for the Makaravilakku season: upwards of one crore people. In recent years, especially in the wake of a stampede that claimed 53 lives in 1999, the Kerala government has taken several measures to improve crowd management around the shrine and along the access routes. However, these have been largely nullified by the phenomenal increase in numbers. Pilgrims continue to face extreme hardship all along the way. This season witnessed traffic hold-ups stretching up to 45 km (at one point) along the main route, inducing many pilgrims to take largely unsupervised paths that run through the Periyar Tiger Reserve. Uppupara or Pulmedu in Idukki district, where more than a hundred people tragically lost their lives on January 14, is along one of these alternative paths. An estimated 250,000 people were on the grassy slopes to watch the Makarajyothi — but there was no lighting and no regulation of movement. As a mass of people started their return journey in the dark, it became a free-for-all — and a wayward vehicle set off a deadly stampede. Many questions about the causes and circumstances of the tragedy remain.
The practical suggestions made by a succession of committees for a safe and satisfying Sabarimala pilgrimage need to be implemented, factoring in the rapid growth in numbers. The real challenge in Sabarimala is to retain the ecologically fragile environment — the forest setting at its verdant and serene best — while expanding infrastructure and creating sustainable basic facilities for optimal pilgrim turnaround, and to regulate and streamline the flow. Given that the temple area is confined and extremely difficult to access, there needs to be a comprehensive assessment of carrying capacities at a given point. On the basis of such data, access should be restricted through viable means: one suggestion, for example, was a system of e-registration of pilgrims. The Vaishno Devi temple in Jammu has an effective system of issuing ‘yatra slips’ to limit the number of pilgrims on any given day. More transit camps are needed to regulate the flow of pilgrims. One suggestion to mitigate the hardship came from the Kerala High Court: spread the pilgrim season through the year. The proposals in the Master Plan for Sabarimala that seek to lay equal emphasis on infrastructure development and the conservation of the region must also be acted upon quickly.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Issues-of-pilgrim-safety/article15522175.ece
16,1,2011,The changing face of La Nina,"‘The Little Girl’ — La Nina — has had an outsized impact across globe since manifesting itself in mid-2010. La Nina and its equally rumbustious sibling, El Nino, come about when the waters of the eastern and central Pacific Ocean along the equator become unusually cold or warm. These changes in the Pacific produce swings in atmospheric pressure, winds, temperature, and rainfall that have a global impact. These coupled with changes in the ocean and atmosphere are collectively called the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). For India, an El Nino is often a cause for concern because of its adverse impact on the south-west monsoon; this happened in 2009. A La Nina, on the other hand, is often beneficial for the monsoon, especially in the latter half. The La Nina that appeared in the Pacific in 2010 probably helped last year’s south-west monsoon end on a favourable note. But then, it also contributed to the deluge in Australia, which resulted in one of that country’s worst natural disasters with large parts of the north-east under water. It wreaked similar havoc in south-eastern Brazil and played a part in the heavy rains and consequent flooding that have affected Sri Lanka.
It is becoming increasingly clear that global warming is contributing to the impact that ENSO has. The Indian Ocean is warming rapidly. There are already indications that this warming along with the growing temperature of the western Pacific is influencing the effect of a La Nina. A paper, ominously titled ‘The Perfect Ocean for Drought,’ which was published in the journal Science in 2003, linked the prolonged droughts from 1998 to 2002 that afflicted the United States, southern Europe, and south-west Asia to the warmth of these ocean waters during a protracted La Nina. Such heightened ocean temperatures may well have played a crucial part in weather-related events in recent months. While the La Nina that developed in mid-2010 lent a helping hand to the south-west monsoon, the warmth of the tropical Indian Ocean may have prevented a more equitable distribution of rainfall — eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, and much of West Bengal received far too little of it. The warming of the Indian Ocean and western Pacific probably provided the extra moisture and energy for the exceptionally heavy rains that Australia and Sri Lanka experienced. It could be one reason why in India the north-east monsoon, which is usually retarded by a La Nina, has this time seen a surfeit of rain. The writing on the wall is clear enough: global warming will worsen the swings of climate variability brought about by factors like ENSO, making extreme weather events such as droughts and floods more frequent. The world needs to pay heed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-changing-face-of-La-Nina/article15520999.ece
17,1,2011,From inadequate to appalling,"It was bad enough that the National Advisory Council in its recommendation of October 2010 proposed a food security Bill that diluted the principle of a universal right to food. It is appalling now that the C. Rangarajan Committee seeks to truncate that proposal, and legally establish a narrowly targeted public distribution system on the grounds of feasibility. Their argument is a false argument for more reasons than one. First, as a matter of fact, current cereal production in India is enough to meet the needs of the entire population. It has been shown repeatedly, including in reports of the National Commission on Farmers, that there is tremendous potential for increases in production. It is a failure of our institutions and policy, be it in the field of agricultural extension or procurement and storage policy, that we have not ensured higher production and better distribution. So the second flaw in the argument is that it denies a right to food because of a failure of institutions, much like denying the right of every child to education on the grounds that there are not already enough school buildings. In a country that holds the world record for malnutrition — both in absolute terms and in terms of the proportion of malnourished persons — there can be few more pressing objectives than ensuring cheap and regular supply of basic foods to all households. As advocated earlier by this newspaper, a commitment to a universal public distribution system can be an effective means to end hunger and malnutrition.
The specific proposal of the Rangarajan Committee is to provide legal entitlements of 35 kg. of cereals (rice and wheat) to 46 per cent of the rural population and 28 per cent of the urban population, based on estimates of poverty by the Tendulkar Committee. The Committee also suggests linking prices of cereals to the rate of inflation, based on the Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labourers. In a period of record inflation, instead of ensuring that real prices of basic staples remain low and stable, the Rangarajan Committee launches a further attack on food security by proposing to raise prices of cereals in the public distribution system in line with inflation. This will not only have a direct negative impact on the budget of households receiving PDS rations but also send the wrong signal to market prices. It is shocking that the Committee has further weakened proposals for ensuring food security for the mass of Indians at a time of spiralling food prices in India and the world. Public opinion and Parliament must see to it that a food security Bill mandating a universal public distribution system is enacted without further delay.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/From-inadequate-to-appalling/article15522243.ece
17,1,2011,Turkey's policy turn,"The expansion of Turkish economic activity in Iraq is only one element of Ankara's shrewd regional strategy. This could well provide a stabilising influence notwithstanding problematic historical and political legacies, which include the repression of Turkey's Kurdish community as well as an earlier cosy relationship with Israel. Trade between Turkey and Iraq doubled from $3 billion in 2008 to $6 billion in 2010. Around 700 Turkish companies now operate in northern Iraq and newspaper reports suggest that Turkey plans to extend such involvement much further south, with high-profile attractions such as luxury apartments and oil exploration to supplement existing oil interests in the north. Iraqi Kurdistan is an early beneficiary of this intensified activity, and the Iraqi Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani even visited Turkey in June 2010. That would have been inconceivable even a few years ago. What is more, a Kurdish-language TV channel has been launched in Turkey for the 20 per cent Kurdish minority. Ankara has even started searches for the bodies of sympathisers of the Kurdish separatist PKK party who were killed by Turkish forces over a period of two decades or more. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan deserves much credit for taking these healing steps despite reservations held within the influential military set-up.
In embarking on a new policy path, Turkey is not just seeking to ensure that Iraq's political space will no longer be monopolised by Iran. It may actually cooperate with Iran in the process. By making serious contact with the Iraqi Shia leader Muqtada al-Sadr, Ankara also expects to send a clear message to Israel. Turkish-Israeli relations soured quickly over Israel's brutal Operation Cast Lead in December 2008. Ankara withdrew its ambassador from Israel when eight Turkish citizens aboard the Gaza peace flotilla were killed by Israeli troops in 2010. There is an equally strong message for the United States and the European Union. The U.S. State Department, which calls Turkey NATO's “vital eastern anchor,” is disappointed that in the U.N. Security Council Turkey voted against a fresh package of sanctions against Iran. The western powers are partly responsible for Turkey's new approach. In 2002, Mr. Erdogan was deeply offended when German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and France's President Jacques Chirac told him that Turkey would have to wait longer than expected for negotiations to begin over entry into the EU. If Turkey's Iraq strategy has caused concern in the western world, the rest of the world, and specifically non-aligned India, should welcome a forward-looking and peace-building involvement in the region.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Turkeys-policy-turn/article15522242.ece
18,1,2011,Meeting the health challenge,"India has a staggering burden of chronic disease arising from a variety of causes, but there is encouraging evidence to show that it can reduce both death and disability through effective low-cost measures. The key to successful intervention lies in learning from good pilot programmes and making them integral to health-care protocols in both public and private sector institutions. A new series of articles published by The Lancet on universalising health coverage in India highlights the challenge that lies ahead. In the next two decades, chronic diseases resulting from cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, respiratory conditions, mental illness, and cancer are expected to cast a long shadow over national ambitions for economic growth in terms of healthy life-years lost. The section of the population that is likely to suffer the most will be those over 45. They may find the threat of infectious and parasitic diseases reducing with better standards of living but the threat of chronic diseases will increase. This is because the incidence of hypertension, poor control of blood glucose, tobacco use, and abuse of alcohol is expected to rise. The imperative therefore is to scale up the pilot programmes that have shown good results at prevention.
Last year the central government approved two key measures — the testing of adults for chronic diseases, and an awareness campaign on healthy behaviour — as part of an integrated national programme for prevention and control of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. A lot more needs to be done structurally to align policies with disease reduction goals. Regulation of unhealthy foods to reduce high calorie and salt content can mitigate the risk of diabetes and hypertension but this agenda is not making speed. Also, the unhealthy effects of energy-dense foods are compounded by negative changes in the urban environment. This experience shows that an assessment of the health effects of macroeconomic policies must be made mandatory. Achieving a drastic reduction in tobacco use must be made a national priority in the fight against cancer. The State health ministers, who met recently in Hyderabad, have done well to recognise the need to curb both smoking and smokeless forms of tobacco. But even with modified lifestyles, a medicalised approach to prevention will be needed. There are examples in this area to show that population-level testing for impaired blood glucose and hypertension, followed by a protocol of lifestyle modification and low-cost drug therapy, can stop disease progression. Given such clear evidence, the campaign against chronic disease must move into high gear.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Meeting-the-health-challenge/article15523513.ece
18,1,2011,Fighting persistent poverty,"A global report card on poverty eradication prepared by the U.N. Secretary-General shows glaring disparities in performance both across and within regions. Economic growth is one evident reason for the progress in East Asia, particularly China, in reducing extreme poverty and raising living standards, in contrast to sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, which continue to remain laggards. Yet, large sections of the world's population risk being left out. For instance, of the 900 million who are predicted to be in extreme poverty in 2015, India is expected to be home to more than 300 million, and sub-Saharan Africa would have more than a third of its population in poverty. Not to be forgotten, in the midst of the encouraging global data that point to a world largely on track to meet the Millennium Declaration's target of halving the proportion of people living on less than a dollar-a-day between 1990 and 2015, is that there is a large section that remains vulnerable. Applying the World Bank's $2-a-day poverty line, for instance, would lead to a dramatic rise in the figures of the poor in developing countries.
While income poverty is a crucial measure, eradicating poverty effectively requires methods that factor in multiple deprivations. Inadequate access to health care services and education are two important factors that work against the poor. The move by the United Nations Development Programme to introduce a multidimensional poverty index is a welcome intervention, as it seeks to fix the paradox of poverty despite rising incomes. That the incidence of multidimensional poverty is higher than that of income poverty in 60 per cent of the countries covered highlights the need for governments to put in place supportive systems. Of the three policy challenges identified in the report prepared as a document for the 49th session of the Commission for Social Development in early February — economic growth and development, social protection and social policy, and structural transformation — priority should be given to social protection policies, particularly in countries like India that are on a positive economic growth trajectory. Studies by International Labour Organisation in 12 Asian and sub-Saharan countries show that the initial gross annual cost of a basic social protection package would be between 2.2 per cent and 5.7 per cent of GDP, which should be a manageable level of spending. Creating and implementing a basic universal social protection floor will mark a new phase in the world's fight against persistent poverty.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Fighting-persistent-poverty/article15524625.ece
19,1,2011,Telangana echo in Darjeeling hills,"It is well understood that the Telangana agitation is an inspiration for similar movements in other parts of India. The 26-day bandh called by the Gorkha Janamukti Morcha (GJM) in the Darjeeling district is an ongoing case in point. The announced aim is to force the central government to ‘clarify' its position on the demand for a Gorkhaland State in the wake of the Srikrishna Committee's report on the future of Telangana. It bears reiteration that the Committee's real recommendation is for a united Andhra Pradesh with meaningful autonomy, secured by constitutional measures, to the Telengana region. The GJM leadership is under increased pressure from its rank and file to clarify where it stands on the Gorkhaland demand. It demonstrated some moderation in the talks it has had with the central and West Bengal governments — to explore a regional autonomy solution for Darjeeling very much like what the Srikrishna Committee has favoured for Telangana. The three sides have agreed, in principle, to replace the virtually defunct Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) — which was born in 1988 out of the violent movement for ‘Gorkhaland' spearheaded by Subhash Ghisingh — with an alternative regional set-up with greater financial and administrative powers. After the last round of talks in December 2010, a major stumbling block was removed, with the Morcha leadership announcing it was agreeable to allow the conduct of local body elections in Darjeeling hills. One contentious issue relates to the unit of regional autonomy. The Morcha wants Gorkha-dominated areas in the Terai and Dooars regions in north Bengal to be included. Other groups in those regions and the State government are firmly opposed to it. The central government is reported to have agreed to a process of verifying the population claims after the establishment of the empowered regional set-up.
That the expected green signal has not yet come from the central Cabinet Committee on Security could be a source of anxiety for the GJM leadership. Simultaneously and unwisely, it is projecting the Srikrishna Committee's characterisation of Statehood for Telangana as the ‘second-best option' as though it were an unqualified recommendation and did not come with the condition that all three regions of Andhra Pradesh must agree to it! Not long ago, the party accused Mr. Ghisingh's Gorkha National Liberation Front of burying the Gorkhaland demand under the Hill Council. Fearful of being accused of a second ‘sell-out,' the GJM leadership is making out that an empowered regional authority will only be an interim arrangement en route to full statehood. As it goes around shutting down Darjeeling, it must remember that raising separatist expectations is a dangerous game that is more than likely to have unintended consequences.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Telangana-echo-in-Darjeeling-hills/article15526006.ece
19,1,2011,Minimising risks to recovery,"That the developing economies led by China and India are in the forefront of the global economic recovery is well known. During 2010, while the emerging economies clocked 7 per cent, developed countries grew by 2.8 per cent. The World Bank in its latest publication, Global Economic Prospects expects the divergence in the growth rates to continue well into the future. This glaring disparity has already had some important consequences for the global economy. For instance, the dollar's status as the world's main reserve currency is under threat, although — as the problems some of the Euro zone countries are facing show — there is a big question mark over the viability of the monetary union and hence of the euro itself. The IMF is being reorganised, with the leading emerging economies set to acquire greater clout. The G20 has replaced the G8 as the world's leading economic grouping.
The divergence in growth rates is easy to understand. The developing countries will obviously grow faster than the rich ones. They can post greater productivity gains as they start from a low base. Eventually, their growth rates would converge on the rates of the West. According to the World Bank, what is surprising is that the developed countries trail the developing ones by such a wide margin. Their decline during the downturn was so sharp that the rebound should have been much stronger. Two important developments explain why that has not happened. One, both individuals and governments in the developed world are reeling under an extraordinarily high level of indebtedness. Consumers are spending less and governments are forced to go for austerity and other belt-tightening measures that are hardly conducive to growth. Secondly, the financial sector of the developed world remains impaired and credit flows have not increased to the desired extent. In contrast, the World Bank report points out that much of the growth in the developing world is supported by strong domestic demand. Indeed, during 2010, domestic demand in the emerging economies accounted for almost half the global growth. If sustained, this trend will help reduce global imbalances. However, the other growth driver for the developing countries, the large capital inflows, has been a mixed blessing. Such flows are the result of ultra-loose monetary policies in the West and they could just as easily change direction. Both the developed and developing countries should work together to minimise volatility and the risks to recovery.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Minimising-risks-to-recovery/article15524707.ece
20,1,2011,Pointless exercise,"If Harold Macmillan's Night of the Long Knives — where one-third of his Ministers got the chop — is the exemplar of ruthlessness in Cabinet reshuffles, Manmohan Singh's ministerial makeover is a case study in timidity and pointlessness. The circular swapping of portfolios seemed like an exercise in musical chairs with one crucial difference: in the actual game, it is customary for at least one person to be dropped. Congress party managers would have the country believe that the shunting of senior Ministers from the Petroleum and Natural Gas, Road Transport, Steel, Sports, Heavy Industries, Water Resources, and other portfolios was intended to send a message that underperformance would not be tolerated. But with not even one Minister dropped, the conclusion to be drawn is that mediocrity and lack of commitment are not fatal attributes for aspirants to high office. Acknowledging the disappointing nature of his exercise, the Prime Minister told reporters after the swearing in that this reshuffle had only been a “minor” one and that another change would be effected after the Budget. But such a promise is easier made than fulfilled. Considering that more than two dozen new portfolios were assigned, the present reshuffle can hardly be called minor. And if several Ministers were moved because of their poor performance, common sense suggests they are unlikely to be evicted from their new charge without giving them at least six to eight months to redeem themselves.
Between the Commonwealth Games fiasco and the 2G spectrum and Adarsh scams, the credibility of the ruling coalition is at an all-time low. Far from improving things, the reshuffle is likely to further diminish public confidence in the ability of the United Progressive Alliance to provide clean and efficient governance. With the induction of younger Ministers inexplicably postponed, the shuffling of a suspect pack of cards can at best make for a poor political gamble. The only bright side is that crucial resource-related Ministries like P&NG and Water Resources have finally been handed over to men who will have a better measure of their strategic value for the country than their previous incumbents did. One should also be grateful that the Prime Minister did not give in to the pressure to shift Jairam Ramesh — whose exertions in the Environment ministry have helped burnish the image of the government — to some other portfolio. Going beyond individuals, it is not clear whether the reshuffle will lead to Dr. Singh being more assertive on issues where Cabinet divisions have prevented crucial decisions from being taken. The fate of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act is one such issue but there are others. The government's attitude towards food security and the employment guarantee scheme suggests a leadership out of tune with the economic reality that confronts millions of Indians.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Pointless-exercise/article15526102.ece
20,1,2011,Goldsmith breaks ranks,"The Chilcot Inquiry into the 2003 invasion of Iraq may be proceeding slowly. But it has already revealed contradiction after contradiction as well as the sheer desperation of the then British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to invade that country. The former Attorney-General, Lord Goldsmith's written testimony to Chilcot shows how Mr. Blair ignored all evidence and argument against the invasion, including analyses by his own Cabinet colleague and senior-most legal adviser. He excluded the Attorney-General from discussions on the draft of the key United Nations Security Council Resolution, and he sent officials to lean on him. When, after being readmitted to the coterie, Lord Goldsmith held that a further U.N. resolution would be needed to ensure the legality of the attack, Mr. Blair's written response was: “I just don't understand that.” Eventually, knowing he was expected to protect the British armed forces from war-crimes charges following an illegal invasion, the Attorney-General changed his position and stated that the attack would be within international law. Predictably, one of Mr. Blair's current aides claims that he thereby justified the invasion.
That claim, however, is both disingenuous and evasive. Lord Goldsmith avoided the legality question at the last minute; he revised his position on the basis of the Prime Minister's opinion — and nothing else — that Iraq had materially breached the relevant U.N. resolution. It is not just that his testimony will increase the pressure on Mr. Blair, whose next appearance before the Inquiry is scheduled for January 21. What is clear is that the major failures over Iraq are those of the entire British political process. The three bodies that could have stopped Mr. Blair and possibly the invasion itself, namely the Cabinet, Parliament, and the Labour Party, failed to do so. They failed even to question the Prime Minister thoroughly on the matter. The Chilcot Inquiry may or may not, eventually, restate the already-known truth about the illegality and outrageousness of the invasion. We can only hope that it finds and says enough to render Mr. Blair indictable, if not before the International Criminal Court, then before the bar of humanity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Goldsmith-breaks-ranks/article15526101.ece
21,1,2011,"Legally correct, politically coloured","Although legally correct, the sanction for the prosecution of Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa given by Governor H.R. Bhardwaj will inevitably take on a political colour. The two have been on a confrontationist course for the past few months with the Governor repeatedly pointing to allegations of corruption against the Chief Minister and some of his Cabinet colleagues, and the Chief Minister, in turn, accusing the Governor of betraying his bias and political affiliation to the Congress. The charges of corruption and nepotism against Mr. Yeddyurappa are serious, and none can fault the Governor for sanctioning prosecution. However, in the months leading up to this development, the Governor came through as a political agent of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance Government at the Centre. It is one thing to turn the Raj Bhavan into a retreat for elderly or inconvenient politicians. It is quite another for the government at the Centre to use it as a political stage for undermining State governments run by rival parties. Mr. Bhardwaj has often looked more the part of an opposition leader than a constitutional head, with his politically-loaded barbs against the Yeddyurappa government. In the latest instance, he likened the ruling BJP making complaints against him to a “thief scolding the police.” In the context of his earlier statements against the State government, asking Mr. Yeddyurappa to take action against two of his Ministers and publicly talking about their alleged profiteering from illegal mining operations, the “thief” remark certainly raised serious doubts about his motives.
All this is not to suggest that Mr. Yeddyurappa is in the clear. He faces serious allegations of nepotism and corruption, and the proper way out for him would have been to step down and clear his name. Although the Governor is expected to act on the aid and advice of the Cabinet, on the issue of sanctioning prosecution of the Chief Minister he will have to take an independent decision based on the facts before him. Mr. Bhardwaj did just that. The Karnataka Cabinet's resolution urging Mr. Bhardwaj not to sanction prosecution of Mr. Yeddyurappa has no leg to stand on. The Governor was certainly not bound by this resolution, and Mr. Yeddyurappa now has no choice but to face the legal consequences of his actions, which include wrongful de-notification and allotment of lands to family members. Institutional propriety is crucial and Governor Bhardwaj is guilty of crudely overreaching his constitutional role. But Chief Minister Yeddyurappa would do well to not take cover behind this impropriety. The legal process is the best and only way to redeem his reputation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Legally-correct-politically-coloured/article15529113.ece
21,1,2011,Objective and bold moves,"Controversies surrounding the two real estate projects, the Adarsh Society building in Mumbai and the Lavasa city near Pune, bring to the fore the huge costs of poor enforcement of town planning rules and inept administration of urban development. In the case of Adarsh housing, a 31-storeyed apartment building raised in the Backbay reclamation area and meant for Kargil heroes, the Maharashtra government not only turned a blind eye to the inclusion of the patently unqualified in the beneficiary list; it also permitted the construction after short-circuiting the approval process and overlooking the mandatory environment clearance. The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), enquiring into the complaints about the project, concluded on the basis of irrefutable facts that the building was an “egregious violation” of the Coastal Regulation Zone notification and justly refused to condone the fait accompli. By ordering demolition and not taking over the building for a public purpose or regularising the deviations by imposing a penalty, the Ministry has sent out a clear message that only severe action can deter future unauthorised constructions.
Lavasa city is a vast ensemble of buildings. Located amidst seven hills, this project, with a 60-km lake front, will accommodate 300,000 permanent residents when completed. In response to the complaints filed by NGOs about alleged irregularities in the project, the MoEF went through due process and concluded that the project was “in violation of” Environment Impact Assessment notifications, and that the construction activity was “unauthorised” as well as “environmentally damaging.” In this case, it has not ordered demolition of the unauthorised construction; it has proposed a penalty. How does one explain the different standards adopted? The large investments made (about Rs.3,000 crore), and the employment opportunities generated, by Lavasa have probably weighed in its favour. The Bombay High Court, which is hearing the objections raised by the promoters, will have the next say on the MoEF's order. Independent of the merits of the legal challenges, the Ministry's firm stance and prompt follow-up on complaints are a significant improvement on the pattern witnessed prior to Jairam Ramesh's stewardship of the MoEF. That large-scale building projects, under construction for years, elude the scrutiny of the vigilance agencies challenges credulity. It is only by making the planning institutions more transparent that misuse of discretionary powers and convenient interpretations of rules for private gain can be checked.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Objective-and-bold-moves/article15527691.ece
24,1,2011,Wake-up call for Sibal,"Defending the indefensible may be part of the lawyer's trade but this doesn't extend to a flagrant distortion of easily verifiable facts. Union Communications Minister Kapil Sibal, who shocked everyone with his claim of zero-loss to the exchequer in 2G spectrum allocation, was rapped on the knuckles by the Supreme Court — which asked him to “behave with some sense of responsibility.” Mr. Sibal, in an egregious overflow of enthusiasm to defend his predecessor, A. Raja, and the United Progressive Alliance government, sought to debunk the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the spectrum controversy. Just as the Central Bureau of Investigation seemed to be getting serious about its investigation into the 2G spectrum allocation scandal, and a one-man committee was starting to look into the procedures and policies of the Department of Telecommunications in granting 2G licences since 2001, Mr. Sibal presented himself as an omniscient authority on the subject and prejudged the case. The Supreme Court registered its concern over the impact the Minister's statement might have on the CBI's investigation. Mr. Sibal, a distinguished lawyer, will hopefully realise the full import of the Supreme Court's observations against him. The court's larger concern of course is to ensure independent investigation, without fear or favour, by the premier criminal investigation agency.
With the highest court in the land now monitoring the investigation into the 2G spectrum scandal, the CBI should have the nerve to get on with the investigation without allowing any intervention or improper inputs from its political masters. But this is easier said than done. Clearly, there is no systemic protection for India's investigating agencies. In several criminal cases that have the potential to hurt those in power at the centre, the CBI has handled the investigation in a way that achieves the end-result of aborted or failed prosecution. The Bofors case, which is synonymous with political corruption, is a notorious case of investigators acting in the service of their political bosses. If the UPA government has any intention of getting to the truth in the telecom scam, Mr. Sibal should publicly retract his irresponsible, over-the-top comments made at a sensitive juncture. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh owes it to the nation to dissociate his government from his Minister's act of egregious folly, and to provide credible assurances that there will be no further political obstruction of efforts to get to the truth. If he fails to do this, the perception is bound to grow that yet another cover-up of big league corruption is afoot.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Wake-up-call-for-Sibal/article15531758.ece
24,1,2011,Reforming microfinance,"The T.H. Malegam committee on microfinance institutions has made valuable suggestions that are contextually significant. Barely four months ago, the MFI sector seemed to be riding a crest. Though comparatively new to organised finance, it was growing rapidly, particularly in the southern States, with Andhra Pradesh in the lead. With an estimated Rs.22,500 crore lent to nearly 2.7 crore borrowers, it seemed to have become a mainstream financial activity. Yet in a matter of months, the fortunes of the industry changed drastically. In Andhra Pradesh especially, there were complaints of usurious lending, coercive recovery procedures, and exploitation of the poor. It did not help the whole body of MFIs that a few of them suffered a serious image problem. Having converted themselves into “for profit” organisations, these institutions adopted a corporate model, declared huge dividends, and paid handsome salaries to their promoters and employees. The State government, through an ordinance, required all the MFIs to register with the district authorities and avoid coercive and multiple lending practices.
In one of its key recommendations, the Committee calls for the creation of a separate category of non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) covering the microfinance sector, to be designated NBFC-MFI. The MFIs, which will be accorded “priority lending status,” should provide financial services predominantly to low income borrowers, making available small loans for short-terms and on an unsecured basis, mainly for income generating activities. The repayment schedules will be more frequent than those offered by banks. Obviously, regulation of what has been largely an unregulated financial activity will succeed only if it is accompanied by clear guidelines that are easy to comply with. It is here that some critics find fault with the Committee report. For instance, the recommendation for a cap on interest rates for individual loans at 24 per cent, they say, is impractical and fails to take account of the ground realities of the business. Besides, a large part of the MFI loans have been for consumption purposes and therefore to ask these institutions to henceforth lend primarily for productive purposes might be unrealistic. The suggestion for imputing greater transparency in the regime of lending charges is unexceptionable. Overall, there is no doubt that a vast majority of the MFIs would acquire greater credibility and benefit from the new regulations, very much like the deposit-taking NBFCs, which came under the purview of the RBI more than a decade ago.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Reforming-microfinance/article15530744.ece
25,1,2011,Behind the carnage in Moscow,"The horrendous bombing carnage at Russia's biggest airport on Monday took a toll of 35 lives and wounded about 180. A suicide bomber detonated a bag with about seven kg of explosives packed with nuts and bolts in the overcrowded arrival hall of Domodedovo airport outside Moscow. It was an afternoon rush hour when airliners touch down every couple of minutes. So far, nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack, but investigators believe it was staged by militants operating from Russia's troubled Northern Caucasus. Many terrorist acts in the past were staged by Chechen rebels who waged a separatist war against Russia in the 1990s. However, in recent years, the virus of terrorism has spread to other predominantly Muslim territories in Russia's south and mutated to patently jihadist insurgency, which has joined hands with al-Qaeda to create an ‘Islamic caliphate' across the Caucasus. The spread of radical Islamism also feeds on economic dislocation and unemployment, which is close to 50 per cent in the region. Last year, the Northern Caucasus saw a fourfold increase in terror attacks in which hundreds of people died, according to the Russian Prosecutor General's office. The Domodedovo bombing was the second terror strike in Moscow in less than a year. In March 2010, two young women from Dagestan married to jihadists set off bombs in the Moscow Metro, killing 40 people. Last year, the Kremlin adopted a multi-billion-dollar plan to create jobs and uplift the region's economy. But it will obviously take time for the development efforts to yield results.
Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev ordered a review of security procedures on transport and vowed to find and punish those behind the explosion. After 9/11, security was tightened for airlines and airports around the world but the Domodedovo tragedy underlined Russia's vulnerability to attacks on key infrastructure used by millions of people every year. It will be remembered that it was at the Domodedovo airport that Chechen suicide bombers boarded two Russian passenger planes in 2004 and blew them up in mid-air, killing 90 people. While the level of security on the air side of Russian airports has since been hardened, on the land side it has remained lax. The terrorist who blew up Domodedovo entered the terminal unhindered as there was no screening of the public arriving at the airport. Monday's atrocity should serve as a wake-up call for Russia to curb terrorism in the Northern Caucasus as it prepares to host the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2018 World Football Cup. Other countries hit by terrorism, including India, must extend all possible cooperation and assistance to Russia in this uphill battle.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Behind-the-carnage-in-Moscow/article15533068.ece
25,1,2011,Not by monetary policy alone,"In raising the repo and reverse repo rates by just 0.25 per cent, the Reserve Bank of India has come up with a somewhat subdued response to inflation, which it says remains the dominant concern. However the policy review asserts that there will be no let up in the monetary policy's primary objective of targeting inflation. The tone of the review is clear and direct as far as inflation is concerned. Certain other factors such as the slow progress in fiscal consolidation at home and high commodity prices abroad are underpinning inflation. Monetary measures by themselves will have very little impact on these. Besides, the imperatives of maintaining an atmosphere congenial to growth can never be ignored. The hike in policy rates should therefore be moderate enough not to disturb growth. Recently, there has been a serious shortage of liquidity and the RBI is continuing to pitch in with additional liquidity for a few more months. It has marked up its projection of WPI inflation for March 2011 to 7.0 per cent, while retaining its forecast of GDP growth for the current year at 8.5 per cent with an upward bias.
The growth and inflation projections are subject to several risks. Food inflation has been persistent over the past two years, is fairly widespread across many food items, and shows no signs of moderation even in a year of normal monsoons. There are indications that high food inflation is impacting general inflation, besides keeping inflationary expectations at elevated levels. Non-food manufacturing inflation has been persistent and sticky. Domestic producers are operating at near-full capacity and the scope for importing commodities to supplement local supplies has become restricted in the context of a moderate global recovery. Two other major concerns are the widening current account deficit (CAD) and the tardy progress in fiscal consolidation. CAD for 2010-11 is expected to be at an unsustainable 3.5 per cent of the GDP. Moreover, if as expected, global commodity prices continue to rise, CAD will widen further and inflation will increase. As much as the size of the CAD, the means of funding it also pose real concerns. Here the RBI repeats its familiar warning on the dependence on portfolio flows which are inherently unstable. Although the government has had the benefit of disinvestment proceeds and 3G spectrum sales, fiscal consolidation on the basis of one-off receipts is not sustainable. Monetary policy works most efficiently in dealing with inflation when the fiscal situation is under control. An excessive burden on monetary policy alone may be counterproductive.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Not-by-monetary-policy-alone/article15533066.ece
25,1,2011,Music as evolution,"With the death of legendary vocalist Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, the world has lost not only a path-breaking Hindustani musician but the very embodiment of the guru-sishya tradition, around which the Indian arts blossomed. Contrary to common perception, this tradition is not one of inflexible continuity but of continuous evolution and constant search. Joshi, a stalwart of the Kirana gharana, exemplified this urge for musical exploration, a journey that led him in many directions, both classical and popular. His voice had a rare appeal for both lay listeners and connoisseurs, and he was as highly regarded among votaries of Hindustani music as of Carnatic. His penchant for experimentation and assimilation resulted in a broadening of tradition. He once said in an interview that he enjoyed all kinds of music. That he went to Varanasi to learn singing from the and brought this genre into the classical mainstream is proof that he was free from musical prejudice. It was thanks largely to his pioneering ways that singing and rendition are now widely accepted on the concert platform.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Music-as-evolution/article15531810.ece
25,1,2011,MMR vaccine & science fraud,"A 1998 paper linking a measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine with a ‘new syndrome’ of autism and bowel disease was retracted by The Lancet in February 2010. The retraction came after the U.K. General Medical Council’s Fitness to Practise Panel conducted a 217-day hearing and found Andrew J. Wakefield, the lead author of the paper, guilty of dishonesty in relation to “the study’s admissions criteria, its funding by the Legal Aid Board, and his statements about it afterwards.” Deep-going investigation by Brian Deer, a journalist based in London, and published online recently as a series ( ) in the (BMJ), has revealed that the researcher from the Royal Free Hospital and School of Medicine, London, whose licence to practise has been revoked by the GMC, indulged in acts that went far beyond dishonesty as specified by the GMC. For instance, the critical data of all the 12 children included in the study had been “misrepresented or altered,” especially the symptoms and the timeline when the symptoms first showed up. Dr. Wakefield’s conflict of interest included a patent for a diagnostic test to “detect a new syndrome — autistic enterocolitis.” The doctor also stood to gain financially from the proposed development of the test kit and a ‘safer’ vaccine.

27,1,2011,Trouble-making in Kashmir,"Making trouble, not peace and unity, was the real purpose of the Bharatiya Janata Party's Ekta Yatra to hoist the national flag at Lal Chowk in Srinagar on Republic Day. The people and the government of the troubled State of Jammu and Kashmir certainly did not need this disintegrative march by leaders of the country's principal opposition party, who seemed intent on heightening tensions and provoking violence rather than on healing wounds and restoring normality. In the face of a potentially explosive situation, the law-enforcing authorities in Jammu and Kashmir had no choice but to stop the yatra at Lakhanpur and arrest the leaders. Clearly, the BJP wanted to use the Kashmir Valley as another stage for furthering its communal agenda; the political dividends were to come from elsewhere in the country. For all its talk of making corruption and governance the key issues in its poll campaign, the Hindutva party does not seem to tire of working for a Hindu-Muslim polarisation of the vote in its favour. Kashmir, like the Babri Masjid, is seen to be a tool for political mobilisation of Hindus across the country. Kashmir is a complex issue that admits of no straight or quick solutions. The very least a responsible political party can do is to avoid disrupting the uneasy calm that prevails in the Valley after months of street protests last year.
As it neared Jammu and Kashmir, the yatra, which set off on January 12 from Kolkata, looked more like an expedition to conquer enemy territory than a march for national unity. The political target was not separatism in Kashmir but the secular foundations of India. Sushma Swaraj, one of the expeditionary leaders, outlined how the BJP intended politically to use the stopping of the yatra: while those who burnt the national flag were being given security, she said, those who held up the tricolour were being arrested. Such oft-repeated confrontational tactics offer limited purchase. An opposition party would be expected to concentrate on issues that resonate with the people. Interestingly, the BJP's own allies have seen through the latest misadventure. Bihar Chief Minister and Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar, who runs a coalition government with the BJP, saw no meaning in the yatra in view of the situation in the Valley. Surely, if the BJP turns a deaf ear to friends and foes alike, it will find itself isolated on key issues. Its interests would be served by learning to look ahead instead of repeating old discredited tricks. Any further attempt to make political capital of the travails of the people of Jammu and Kashmir would be worse than a crime — it would be a historic blunder.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Trouble-making-in-Kashmir/article15536849.ece
27,1,2011,"Fishermen, again","Relations between India and Sri Lanka have never been better. Yet the recent killings of two Tamil Nadu fishermen, allegedly by the Sri Lankan Navy, have cast a negative light on bilateral ties. While the Sri Lankan Navy has denied responsibility for the deaths, there is anger in Tamil Nadu, and New Delhi has lodged a strong protest with Colombo. Unacceptably, miscreants have attempted to take diplomacy into their own hands by attacking a Sri Lankan Buddhist priest in Chennai. It is the responsibility of the Tamil Nadu government to ensure such incidents do not occur. The latest turn is surprising considering that in October 2008 the two sides reached an elaborate understanding to put in place “practical arrangements to deal with bona fide Indian and Sri Lankan fishermen crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line.” For the first time, both sides acknowledged and accepted that fishermen crossed the international boundary, and had to be dealt with in non-lethal ways. The steps included designation by Sri Lanka of sensitive areas along its coastline that Indian fishing vessels could not venture into even if they crossed the IMBL. The governments also agreed there would be no firing on trespassing vessels, which would have a valid registration or permit; the fishermen were to carry government-issued identity cards. These measures led to a remarkable drop in the number of arrests of Indian fishermen by the Sri Lankan authorities, from nearly 1,500 in 2008 to just 34 in 2010. There were no incidents of killings in 2009 or 2010. The January 12 incident in which a fisherman was allegedly shot by the Sri Lankan Navy was the first of its kind since the 2008 arrangements.
Significantly, President Mahinda Rajapaksa has hinted at a rethink on the two-year-old understanding, remarking to the press that the end of the war against the LTTE and the peaceful situation in northern Sri Lanka necessitated a revision in the existing arrangements. Clearly, there is an apprehension in Sri Lanka that Indian fishermen are now taking advantage of these arrangements to cross the IMBL regularly and in greater numbers, threatening the livelihood of fishermen on the other side. While these concerns are real, it is extraordinarily difficult physically to prevent fishermen from crossing the international maritime boundary. Fishing communities in Tamil Nadu need to be sensitised to the imperative of respecting the sanctity of the IMBL but the penalty for trespass cannot be death. India and Sri Lanka, which have excellent political and economic relations, are surely capable of resolving the livelihood-centred problems that have surfaced among their fishermen in the post-LTTE era.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Fishermen-again/article15534171.ece

That is a clearly articulated vision and it can attract many young engineers to the search engine giant in its quest for new strategies for development. Financially, the company has been achieving robust revenues and profits. In the quarter ended December 31, it made a net profit of $2.54 billion, up from $1.97 billion for the same quarter a year ago. Its revenues stood at $8.44 billion, representing a 17 per cent year-on-year increase. The company has a market value of $200 billion. With such a financial base to work on, Mr. Page will take charge of day-to-day operations and lead product development and technology strategy, while Mr. Schmidt, as Executive Chairman, will focus on business partnerships, government outreach, and technology thought leadership.
The ‘triumvirate' leadership model, comprising Mr. Page, co-founder Sergey Brin, and Mr. Schmidt, has helped Google produce several innovative web-based services and develop online advertising. By agreeing to clarify their roles, the top management has paved the way for clearer responsibilities and greater accountability, as Mr. Schmidt says on the company blog. A creative combination of its technology and business visions will be vital to its future, as the mobile web grows in importance. A good beginning has been made with the launch of the highly successful Android operating system for mobile devices. By offering an open collaborative model for development, it has attracted many mobile handset makers and its market share is increasing. Moreover, Google has come up with a version of the Android operating system optimised for use in tablet computers. Taken together, tablets and ‘smart' mobile phones are key to an expanded online search market. An informed forecast puts tablet sales for 2011 over 44 million units. To place this in context, tablet sales stood at 4.8 million units in the third quarter of 2010, with Apple's iPad accounting for nearly 90 per cent of the shipments. This trend is a clear indicator of the potential for growth in search-linked advertising, which is Google's forte. ‘Smart' television is another area of upcoming competition, where the web is a searchable channel on the bigger screen. With the attributes of an agile start-up, Google can kick-start a fresh round of innovation in all these areas.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Change-at-Google/article15536815.ece
28,1,2011,More Guantánamo problems,"President Barack Obama's administration has signalled a reversal of the plan, announced early in its term, to close the infamous detention and torture centre at Guantánamo Bay. Instead, revised military commissions will be created; those still in detention number 174 and it is likely that the new bodies will try about 30 of them. This is not the only new move. The executive is preparing parole boards, which will decide if each detainee still poses a threat or if any of them can be transferred to another country. The federal government will provide detainees with legal representation and give them greater access to the evidence than the Bush boards did. Abandoning the plan to close Guantánamo, however, will damage Mr. Obama politically — not least because his hand was forced by a Democrat-majority Congress that, on the closing day, voted to ban the transfer of any of the detainees to the United States. The administration may well feel it has no option but to have military tribunals to tackle the issue.
The new tribunals reveal some of the ugliest tendencies in contemporary American politics. Like their predecessors, they will have lower legal standards than federal courts, for example by accepting information obtained under torture. (Civilian judges may well have dismissed cases because of the prior illegal rendition and torture of the detainees.) Secondly, a government task force has advised keeping 48 detainees indefinitely as enemy combatants; they may never be charged or tried. Thirdly, some of the cases raise problems over the very status of the putative defendants. One such is Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, who was tortured and may yet be tried for a part in the attack on the warship USS Cole in Yemen in 2000; but that attack preceded both 9/11 and Congress's approval of the use of force against suspected terrorists. The Obama administration's contention that a state of war existed after 1996 is close to retroactive legislation. In addition, it is doubtful that a civilian jury can go through a case fairly, particularly after the furore caused by Attorney-General Eric Holder's decision to try some of the 9/11 conspirators at a venue near where the World Trade Center used to stand. Although the Supreme Court might quash convictions reached in the commissions, American public opinion is now so hostile to the detainees that both the President and the Congress are being intimidated into overriding fundamental juridical principles. The major problems they will face are that the continued existence of the Guantánamo prison fuels terrorist recruitment and that it subverts the rule of law on which democracy is founded.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/More-Guant%C3%A1namo-problems/article15535431.ece
29,1,2011,Waiting for Thomas to go,"Amid all the controversies surrounding the appointment of P.J. Thomas as the Central Vigilance Commissioner, one thing is clear: he did not qualify — and was clearly not fit — for the job. By insisting before the Supreme Court that the ‘full facts' relating to Mr. Thomas were not placed before the high-power committee to finalise the appointment of the CVC, Attorney-General G.E. Vahanvati might have tried to draw a veil over the roles of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram, members of the committee along with the Leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj, in a shockingly bad selection process, which he claimed “will not vitiate” Mr. Thomas's appointment. At the time of the selection, a charge sheet was pending against Mr. Thomas; and the Kerala government had granted initial sanction for his prosecution in the palmolein import case. Is it believable that the Prime Minister and the Home Minister were ignorant of these damning facts while making the decision to appoint Mr. Thomas as CVC — the country's highest institutional authority to probe charges of corruption? Or did the Prime Minister choose to overlook these facts? Mr. Vahanvati's weak defence is that the relevant papers and file were not placed before the committee by the Department of Personnel. Ms Swaraj strongly disputes this plea of ignorance, asserts that both the Prime Minister and the Home Minister were aware of the details of the charges against Mr. Thomas, that she specifically called attention to them, and even entered a note of dissent. She will refute the government's factual claims in an affidavit before the Supreme Court.
The latest development leaves Mr. Thomas without a fig leaf of protection. Evidently, his appointment, overriding the objections of the Leader of the Opposition and ignoring facts that were in the public realm, was for politically expedient reasons that would not see the light of day. That the CVC chose not to step down despite several adverse observations made by the Supreme Court is shameful enough. That the government has shielded him up to this point and officially claimed that his appointment was ‘not vitiated' despite the highly coloured circumstances of the selection is shocking. For Mr. Thomas to continue in his post a day longer will be to flout all norms of institutional propriety and clean governance. The Congress might try to cut its losses by pressuring him to resign. But if he exploits the complicated procedure for the removal of the CVC under the provisions of the Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003 to cling on to office, the Prime Minister and the already beleaguered United Progressive Alliance regime will have a greater political price to pay.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Waiting-for-Thomas-to-go/article15538351.ece
29,1,2011,Social costs of jobless recovery,"The world's economy may be recovering from what was the worst economic downturn since the 1930s, but all is not well on the employment front. The most critical factor that ensures a sustained recovery is the creation of jobs, and in this area clear evidence emerges from the Global Employment Trends 2011, published by the International Labour Organisation, that despite improvements in key macroeconomic indicators such as the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP), unemployment remains stubbornly high. For instance, the annual GDP growth rate, which was 5.3 per cent in 2007, fell to 2.8 per cent in 2008, and dropped further to (—)0.6 per cent in 2009. As recent figures put out by the International Monetary Fund reveal, the world economy rebounded to 5 per cent growth in 2010 and is likely to grow by 4.5 per cent in 2011. This, however, has done little to bring down unemployment rates. From the pre-crisis figure of 5.6 per cent (2007), the rate rose to 5.7 per cent in 2008 and to 6.3 per cent in 2009, marginally moderated to 6.2 per cent in 2010 and is predicted to register 6.1 per cent in 2011. In absolute terms, 177.3 million people were jobless in 2007 and the number swelled to 205.2 million in 2009.
That the labour market continues to be slack does not augur well for sustained economic recovery, given particularly the ILO's observation that this was also caused by the lag between productivity gains and real wage growth. Considering the linkage between wages, consumption, and aggregate demand and its importance in keeping an economy on growth trajectory, the world can ill-afford risking jobless recovery. The situation calls for judicious continuation of fiscal stimuli, rather than fiscal consolidation in the developed economies. For the developing world, which has lower unemployment rates, the ILO strikes a note of caution on vulnerable employment. For South Asia, which has the largest number of vulnerable workers (in 2009, the figure stood at 508.7 million out of the 1.5 billion in the world), the current phase of better economic performance is also the appropriate time for states to put in place effective social protection measures for such workers. One of the positives of state-led programmes such as India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme is their potential to serve as building blocks for a comprehensive social protection framework. A basic social protection floor, including monetary support for the unemployed and the low-paid, will be a critical state intervention to create fairer and better-functioning labour markets.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Social-costs-of-jobless-recovery/article15536978.ece
31,1,2011,Egypt shakes West Asia,"Defying a curfew and violent repression, the people of Egypt are refusing to back down until President Hosni Mubarak — the dictator who has ruled for 30 years — goes. They regard the concession he has made, the dismissal of his own Cabinet, as a contemptible joke. Hundreds of thousands have occupied central areas of Cairo and other major cities, and their ranks have swelled even as the tear gas has spread and the beatings have intensified. The ruling National Democratic Party's building has been burnt down; the state TV building and the Foreign Ministry have been attacked. Over 1,000 people were arrested in the first three days and a similar number have been injured in Cairo alone, with figures not yet known for Alexandria and other cities. Newspapers report over 100 deaths so far, but the protests show no diminution despite the closure of access to the Internet and mobile phone networks. The mass rage has many causes, from long-term structural unemployment through rising and apparently uncontrollable food prices to rampant corruption and the brutality of the notorious security agencies. Yet unlike the 1977 bread riots, which forced Anwar Sadat to restore a grain and fuel subsidy, the present and still largely leaderless protests are directed against the entire political structure in a country of great importance to the region and the rest of the world. Egypt's population of 80 million is far and away the biggest in North Africa and West Asia, and the country is the guardian of the Suez Canal.
Tunisia's brave people, who recently ended Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's 23-year rule, may well have inspired Egyptians. Another factor has been the influential role played by Al Jazeera — the standout voice of aggressive, independent journalism in the Arab world — in channelling popular discontent through the region. After an absurd attempt to blame the Ikhwanul Muslimeen or Muslim Brotherhood, the Mubarak regime turned to violence, with the police and semi-official thug militias using tear gas and rubber-coated steel bullets against protesters. Tanks have also been deployed. Cables released by WikiLeaks show that the United States has had no illusions about the régime. Washington and its allies now stand thoroughly exposed for using aid of over $2 billion a year and silence over internal repression to turn Cairo into a crucial agent of their regional policy, particularly in suppressing demands for justice for the Palestinians. The Egyptian people's uprising is showing the world that this highly prized western ally is utterly devoid of legitimacy. That message will echo through every other dictatorship in the region. We are almost certainly witnessing a transformative moment in the modern history of West Asia.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Egypt-shakes-West-Asia/article15539851.ece
31,1,2011,Brazen criminality,"The grisly murder of Malegaon Additional District Collector Yeshwant Sonawane in Manmad, Maharashtra as he confronted a gang pilfering fuel from tanker trucks has sparked widespread outrage. More than 1.5 million State government employees struck work for a day, among many other protests. The atrocity draws attention once again to the scale of the great fuel robbery going on in this country. By one reckoning, 40 per cent of kerosene is stolen during transportation from depots to retail outlets. Estimates of the value of this organised racket, which also sees quite a bit of the kerosene used to adulterate diesel, exceed Rs.10,000 crore a year nationally. The fraud seems to be growing in direct correlation to the rise in fuel prices. However, official responses have mostly been weak-kneed, even after the murder of Indian Oil Corporation employee S. Manjunath in 2005. There is no satisfactory explanation for why the Petroleum Ministry gutted, instead of revamping, its own 2006 ‘marker' scheme aimed at curbing adulteration.
The scale of organised criminal gangs in this sector in Maharashtra is much larger than earlier understood — as the seizures and arrests in raids at more than 200 places reveal. Maharashtra's mafias in sand and milk are, by the very nature of those commodities, very much in the public eye. Organised crime in the petroleum trade is less easily seen. That could change with this horrible murder, as should official attitudes and responses to such racketeering. Hopefully, Maharashtra's law and order situation will also get the badly needed scrutiny. Several RTI activists and whistleblowers have been attacked and some of them murdered over the past three years. The State has also seen several atrocities against Dalits (of which Khairlanjee was just one that got any attention). A senior Member of Parliament from Marathwada stands charged with murder. In the present case of fuel diversion and adulteration, the opposition has alleged there is high political backing for the racket across the State. Generally speaking, if there is big money to be made in Maharashtra, there is a mafia that steps forward to make it. The crackdown that is on now and the arrest of all ten suspects in the murder of Mr. Sonawane are positive signs. The hope is that Union Petroleum Minister Jaipal Reddy's resolve to curb the adulteration menace will not prove short-lived. A great deal of work waits to be done on the ground, and a start can be made by acting on the Supreme Court's 2001 suggestion of an additional agency to carry out independent checks and actions in the fuel sector. Else Mr. Sonawane and others like him would have lost their lives in vain.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Brazen-criminality/article15539850.ece
1,2,2011,Move quickly on Adarsh,"Impelled into action by the Bombay High Court, which recently expressed its displeasure over the tardy probe into the Adarsh Housing Society scam case, the Central Bureau of Investigation has registered a criminal case against 13 persons and conducted searches in the premises of five of them. While the First Information Report (FIR) only sets the investigative ball in motion, the importance of fast-tracking this case — on which the CBI has been conducting a leisurely preliminary inquiry based on the Defence Ministry's complaint in November 2010 — cannot be underestimated. The scandal, which revolves around how apartments in a Mumbai cooperative housing society earmarked for families of Kargil heroes were diverted to relatives of influential Maharashtra politicians and senior armed forces officials, has jolted the nation's collective conscience. It has exposed a rapacious nexus between politicians, bureaucrats, and armed services personnel. It is a tale of sleazy collusion and a brazen disregard for laws, rules, and procedures. The FIR names bureaucrats, retired and serving armed forces officers, and politicians, one of them being former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan, who as the State Revenue Minister dealt with the Adarsh land files between 2001 and 2003.
The Adarsh Housing Society scandal is being tackled in other ways as well. The Army has ordered a court of inquiry to determine the involvement of serving and retired officers, some of whom were allotted flats that should have gone to the Kargil war widows. The Ministry of Environment and Forests has adopted a bold and uncompromising position in ordering the demolition of the entire building on the ground that no clearance was obtained under the Coastal Regulation Zone notification of 1991. It is vitally important to ensure that all the guilty in this shocking criminal conspiracy to grab real estate by flouting rules and manipulating records are punished. While some of those named in the FIR played a key role in promoting the cooperative housing society, the CBI must investigate — efficiently, independently, and without giving in to pressure — the full dimension of the racket, which could not have been pulled off without the active cooperation or tacit approval of other powerful politicians belonging to the ruling alliance. Anything less will be letting down a nation that is deeply ashamed of the Adarsh scandal. It will also be an unpardonable betrayal of the soldiers who gave their lives in fighting the Kargil war as well as their families who were robbed of the benefits of the housing cooperative society that was set up to compensate, in some small measure, their personal loss.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Move-quickly-on-Adarsh/article15122760.ece
1,2,2011,Benefits of local incorporation,"The discussion paper on the presence of foreign banks in India circulated by the Reserve Bank of India draws heavily on the experiences of the global financial sector during the crisis period. A road map for foreign banks drawn up in 2005 had recommended a two-track approach aimed at, on the one hand, increasing the stability and pace of consolidation of both private and public banks in India and, on the other, enhancing foreign bank presence in a synchronised manner. An action plan to be executed in two phases was stalled in the wake of the global financial crisis. There have been valuable lessons from the crisis — among them, the desirability of “subsidiarisation” of significant cross-border presence, which brings with it the advantages of greater regulatory control and comfort to the host jurisdiction. The crisis was exacerbated by complex structures and the implicit belief that certain financial institutions are either too big or too connected to be allowed to fail. The risks can be minimised, although not entirely eliminated, by asking foreign banks to incorporate subsidiaries locally rather than operate as branches. Unlike branches, subsidiaries will have their own capital and boards of directors and be subject to domestic legislation such as the Companies Act.
While opting for the subsidiary model, the discussion paper does not downplay the advantages of foreign banks functioning as branches. These include greater operational flexibility and an enhanced lending capability based on the ability to leverage the capital of their head offices. However, the much-vaunted strengths of major international banks were of no avail during the crisis and, in India especially, their branches seemed to be in a far better shape than the bank as a whole. In the post-crisis period, a majority of regulators are stipulating local incorporation requirements to protect retail depositors and to limit the impact of operations of systemically important banks. A clear demarcation of assets and liabilities between branches of subsidiaries and the head offices is possible. It also becomes easier to define laws of jurisdiction and, in general, enhance the capabilities of the domestic regulators. One important lesson from the crisis is that a foreign bank's support to either its branches or subsidiaries need not be automatic. Given the perceived reluctance of foreign banks to incorporate subsidiaries, certain incentives can be offered without relaxing the entry level requirements suggested in the discussion paper. The issue of reciprocity will also come up, with Indian banks operating branches in many jurisdictions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Benefits-of-local-incorporation/article15122759.ece
2,2,2011,Another sham in Myanmar,"Myanmar's recently elected parliament has convened at Naypyidaw, but it would be unwise to expect first-hand accounts of the session in the media. In the “discipline-flourishing democracy” of the junta, journalists were not allowed to cover the opening day's proceedings. There can be no visitors to this parliament, and anyone other than a legislator caught entering the building faces a one-year prison term and fine. The shadow of the junta is everywhere. The new bicameral parliament has 664 members, of which nearly 500 belong to the Union Solidarity and Development Party, a proxy for the military regime that goes by the name of State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). Separately, 25 per cent of the seats in both houses go to serving military officers. Together, the junta controls, more or less, 82 per cent of the parliamentary seats. The opposition, represented by the National Democratic Force, a splinter group of Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, has a mere 16 seats. (The NLD boycotted the elections.) Parties representing Myanmar's ethnic nationalities form another small clutch of opposition voices. But the military's brute majority ensures that the reins are firmly in its hands. Any opposition proposal seeking reforms in governance, in the Constitution, or in the political system, is certain to meet a swift end. In any case, the rules governing proceedings give opposition members little room to freely ask questions, or introduce legislation. The elections, held in November 2010, were a sham exercise in democracy; the convening of the parliament is an extension of this trickery.
The legislators are to elect a President who will head the new government that will replace the SPDC. It is certain that he will be a trusted representative of the junta. Will Senior General Than Shwe put up his own name or is it going to be another general slightly lower in the hierarchy? The military will also be well represented in the cabinet. There should be no doubt now that Ms Suu Kyi took the right step in boycotting the election. Her participation in the junta's “road map to democracy” could have only given it legitimacy. On her release from long years of house arrest, an event timed by the junta to immediately follow the election, the Nobel Laureate spoke about dialogue with the military towards national reconciliation and putting in place a genuine democracy in Myanmar. The regime has not responded to the offer. Ms Suu Kyi's shining achievement has been to demonstrate through thick and thin that she remains immensely popular with the people of her country — and therefore cannot be written out of Myanmar's political equation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Another-sham-in-Myanmar/article15123942.ece
2,2,2011,Reviving wetlands,"The notification of the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2010 has provided a legal framework for protecting an ecosystem that has come under serious threat from unregulated development activity. Wetlands provide a range of ecosystem services, not the least of which is water security to vast regions housing millions of people. If cities depend on them as reservoirs and flood control systems, rural communities derive basic sustenance from these marvels of nature. It is welcome, therefore, that the rules prohibit some of the more destructive activities that have wiped out a large number of wetlands in several States. Inland and coastal wetlands have been lost over the years due to reclamation, conversion to industrial use, dumping of solid waste, discharge of untreated sewage from cities and towns and effluents from industries, and encroachment for construction. The Ministry of Environment and Forests has acted commendably to stop this tragic course. But the conservation effort can succeed only if the Central Wetlands Regulatory Authority created under the new rules has sufficient independence to work with the State governments and local authorities to identify and protect water bodies. Also, it is important to allay, through vigorous action, the apprehension among research scientists that the Authority may not have the freedom to pursue its mandate considering that the Secretary in the same Ministry heads it.
A good beginning has been made by extending the rules to, among others, 25 wetland sites listed under the Ramsar Convention. Some of them are also covered by other environmental protection laws pertaining to forests and wildlife. In addition to the biodiversity-rich Ramsar sites, there are several less-known wetlands in India that have been documented by the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History. All of these are demonstrably important to local communities and potentially qualify for protected status. The real test for the new rules lies in the ability of the Authority to monitor the actions of the nodal department in the States, which will be responsible for enforcement. These departmental personnel must ensure the health of wetlands that fall outside the jurisdiction of the Forest department. There is a growing community of environmentalists who are keenly documenting the state of water bodies. All that the Authority has to do is to enlist these community conservationists as its voluntary field workers to maintain the vigil. State governments and local bodies, which are now on deadline to end the disposal of waste and effluents into wetlands, must move with alacrity to enforce the rules.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Reviving-wetlands/article13885743.ece
3,2,2011,Significance of Raja's arrest,"The arrest of former Telecommunications Minister A. Raja by the Central Bureau of Investigation is a significant milestone in the ongoing criminal investigation into the trillion-rupee 2G spectrum allocation scam. After several rounds of questioning, and searches at his residences and at business firms where he was suspected to have investment interests, the CBI seems closer to filing charges and beginning prosecution. But coming as it did three years after the scandalous transactions, the arrest raises the question what and who prevented India's premier criminal investigation agency from doing what it is required to do under the law of the land. Although the CBI searched the offices of the Department of Telecommunications in October 2009 after the Central Vigilance Commission asked it to probe irregularities in the grant of telecom licences, no headway was made in the so-called preliminary enquiry until the Supreme Court began monitoring the case. For more than a year, the CBI was content to let sleeping dogs lie, keeping up a pretence of investigation. That the agency was taking its cue from ruling politicians was clear, what with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh speaking up for Mr. Raja at every available opportunity. As is evident from the 2007-2008 correspondence between him and Mr. Raja (see ‘Resources' at >www.thehindu.com), Dr. Singh was fully in the picture when the then Telecommunications Minister decided not to go for auction of a highly valued scarce resource and do all that happened under cover of the ‘first-come, first-served' policy. In fact, the record shows that the Prime Minister first raised doubts about this course but went along with the decision-making.
As opposition leaders have argued, the issues go well beyond Mr. Raja. In the first place, a proper investigation must identify the many beneficiaries in independent India's biggest corruption scandal and bring them to justice. Secondly, with the latest development in the case, the opposition's demand for a joint parliamentary committee to look into wider aspects of the scam — including the Prime Minister's accountability for the actions of a Cabinet colleague that he knew about and did little to stop — has gathered force. The arrest, which signifies the CBI's progress, however slow in its investigation, has come as a huge embarrassment to the current Telecommunications Minister, Kapil Sibal — who only recently went out of his way to defend the indefensible, asserting among other things that there was no loss to the government exchequer from the 2G spectrum allocation. Is the arrest of Mr. Raja an indication that the CBI has at last broken free from political tutelage in the 2G spectrum case? The answer to this question might be available in the next stage in the investigation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Significance-of-Rajas-arrest/article12878935.ece
3,2,2011,Out of Africa,"Archaeological evidence in the form of stone tools discovered from Jebel Faya, a site close to Sharjah in United Arab Emirates and about 50 km from the Persian Gulf, suggests that modern humans migrated out of Africa 100,000 to 125,000 years ago. The tools include small hand axes and two-sided blades. The conclusions of a paper published online in Science (“The Southern Route ‘Out of Africa': Evidence for an Early Expansion of Modern Humans into Arabia” by Simon J. Armitage et al., January 28, 2011) are contrary to the generally accepted view on two counts — the time and the route. It turns out that the migration of modern humans out of Africa took place about 55,000 years earlier than used to be believed. Secondly, they took a southern route to reach Arabia from east Africa, not a northern route to reach the Mediterranean region. The hostile desert conditions of Arabia, the Red Sea, and the Straits of Hormuz were previously regarded as the three natural barriers that prevented migration into this region. But the interglacial period that started about 130,000 years ago would probably have transformed Arabia from an arid region into a more hospitable, wetter region with savannah grass, lakes, and rivers. Crossing the narrower and shallower Red Sea would have been possible at the start of the interglacial period; water locked up in ice sheets during the preceding glacial period was yet to melt and raise the local sea level.
Evidence of human inhabitation about 50,000 years ago has been discovered in Australia. Artefacts and bones of anatomically modern humans dating back between 30,000 and 40,000 years have been discovered at sites along the Don River, about 400 km south of Moscow. Modern humans reaching such faraway places can be explained only if an earlier wave of modern humans migrating out of Africa had taken place more than 60,000 years ago. Stone tools become a reliable source for studying the inhabitation of modern humans for a period that goes back more than 100,000 years; the preservation of human fossils from that time is quite unlikely. The sophisticated stone tools recovered from Jebel Faya bear a strong resemblance to the tools used by people in east Africa. Although the possibility of other hominins traversing Arabia and occupying the site of discovery during the interglacial period cannot be completely ruled out, it becomes more than a coincidence that they and modern humans in east Africa used nearly identical tools. There is a need to find similar tools from more sites at or near Jebel Faya to confirm an earlier exodus of our species.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Out-of-Africa/article15125016.ece
4,2,2011,Mubarak in his true colours,"A second day of deadly clashes in Cairo's Tahrir Square has been more than enough to show President Hosni Mubarak's 30-year-old regime in its true colours. Refusing to step down until the next election in September 2011 and keeping silent on the demand that he rule his son Gamal out as a candidate for the succession, Mr. Mubarak has presided over fighting in which thousands of unarmed and peaceful protesters have had to defend themselves against brutal attacks by his purported supporters. Eyewitnesses identified among the attackers members of the government's semi-official thug militias and the notoriously vicious police, now in plain clothes. The role of the army, which was initially praised on all sides for its statement that it would not fire on protesters, is suspect after it let the hoodlums through the lines formed by soldiers around the edges of Tahrir Square. The violent turn has caused at least five deaths in addition to the 300 that the United Nations estimates have already occurred across the country; and more than 1,500 people are believed to have been injured since the mass protests started nine days ago.
It is clear that Mr. Mubarak will not change the way his government has always responded to dissent, namely, by unleashing repression. His earlier vague talk of political and economic reform, and his more specific moves — such as the hastily appointed Vice-President Omar Suleiman's promise to implement appeal-court decisions on contested election results, and the replacement of the notorious Interior Minister by a retired general — were no more than a smokescreen. The regime's initial moves served to buy time from its strongest backers, the United States and other western countries, and to delay their recognition that the Egyptian state has lost all legitimacy. Unsurprisingly, Washington's first reaction was to support its longstanding ally in the region by stressing order and stability. But a new situation has arisen, with the Obama administration changing tack to condemn the violence against the protesters by Mr. Mubarak's henchmen and to demand that he speed up his exit — and the dictatorial regime hitting out at what it has characterised as foreign interference aimed at “inciting the internal situation in Egypt.” Reports that the U.S. is now trying to establish links with the Muslim Brotherhood suggest that successive administrations have given little thought to what a post-Mubarak Egypt would look like. Now that the street has risen in do-or-die revolt against a hated regime that has unashamedly served the U.S. and Israeli interests in the region for three decades, Washington finds itself facing great uncertainty and forebodings of what might happen in the wider region beyond Egypt.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mubarak-in-his-true-colours/article15127573.ece
4,2,2011,All-round failure,"It was only to be expected that the long-awaited report of the Federal Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) on the financial crisis of 2008 from an American perspective would apportion blame among virtually all the participants in the financial markets. Captains of finance as well as the several regulators failed abysmally to identify the build-up of risk, leave alone taking corrective action. The Federal Reserve “neglected its mission” by not piercing the housing bubble. Goldman Sachs has been faulted for understating the benefits that it derived from the government bail-out of the giant insurer, AIG. Among individuals, the former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan received the largest share of criticism for having presided over a culture of deregulation that implicitly believed the markets would correct themselves. The FCIC identified “widespread failures in financial regulation, a “dramatic failure of corporate governance and risk management”, and “excessive borrowing” as some of the principal causes. Also, the government was ill-prepared “and inconsistent in letting Lehman Brothers fall, while orchestrating the rescue of Bear Sterns earlier and bailing out AIG later. None of these need surprise anyone even remotely familiar with the sensational developments in the U.S. financial system in 2008.
Being the first official report on the subject, it serves as a useful and authentic narration of developments during a truly extraordinary period in recent economic history. However, its value to policymakers stands diminished on account of a few factors. One of its main findings, that the market turmoil of 2008 was “avoidable”, appears simplistic and inconsistent with its apportionment of blame across a number of agencies and financial products such as the complex over-the-counter derivatives. It would have also helped had the report taken a global view of the crisis. After all, the contagion spread quickly to many other advanced countries, some of which had tighter regulations than the U.S. Perhaps an even bigger failing of the FCIC report is its inability to evolve a consensus. That in itself is not surprising, given that the views on the key economic and social programmes of the U.S. administration aimed at tackling the crisis are split on political lines. Some Republicans on the Commission have blamed global imbalance as one of the factors responsible for the crisis. Yet another view is that the government's efforts at broadening home ownership led to a proliferation of sub-prime loans in the housing sector, triggering the crisis.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/All-round-failure/article15126226.ece
5,2,2011,Breakthrough in Nepal,"The election of Jhalanath Khanal as Prime Minister of a majority Left coalition government in Nepal offers the young republic the best chance it has had in 20 months to finish the task of writing a new Constitution and completing its peace process. It is also a virtual slap in the face of those within the Indian establishment who spent the better part of a year working behind the scenes to keep the United Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) out of power even at the cost of political stability. Nepal's promising political journey, which began five years ago with the signing of the historic 12-point understanding between the Maoists and the other parties, went through twists and turns before and after the 2008 Constituent Assembly elections — and lost its way in the aftermath of the resignation of Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal or ‘Prachanda' as Prime Minister in May 2009. Madhav Kumar Nepal of the Unified Marxists-Leninists became Prime Minister with the support of the Nepali Congress and a number of smaller parties but the coalition's adversarial stance towards the Maoists made the new dispensation dysfunctional from the start.
Mr. Nepal's resignation last year should have paved the way for a national consensus government led by the Maoists, the largest party by far in the Constituent Assembly. However, the personal political ambitions of various leaders within the UML, the NC, and the Madhesi factions, the Interim Constitution's rigid rules of business, and the unhelpful attitude of New Delhi combined to produce a repeatedly enacted farce. This involved the CA being asked to vote over and over again for the NC's Ramchandra Poudel, who was never able to muster support from more than half of the required 300 legislators. On Thursday, Prachanda withdrew his name and announced that the Maoists were joining hands with the UML of Mr. Khanal and the new coalition won easily. Top priority must now be given to crafting the new Constitution, which effectively means resolving key issues, notably the new state's federal structure and political system. Of equal importance is the peace process. With the departure of the United Nations from Nepal, the fate of the Maoist cantonments is now entirely in the hands of a special all-party committee headed by the Prime Minister. The fact that the Prime Minister is a leader the Maoists have backed opens a door for the speedy resolution of the integration question. It is in the interests of democracy that Maoist combatants be either integrated into a democratised Nepal army and into the security forces or demobilised and suitably rehabilitated. The NC and some UML leaders opposed integration. The expectation is that Prime Minister Khanal will have a more rational and helpful approach to this vital question.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Breakthrough-in-Nepal/article15127597.ece
5,2,2011,A new protocol,"The Internet is running out of addresses in the numerical format. The last blocks of addresses under the IPv4 or Internet Protocol version 4 system have now been allocated to different regional registries around the world. The IPv4 system provides for a massive 4.3 billion numerical combinations but strong growth in communications in many countries has depleted the stock. A numerical address on the Internet is required in order to be ‘found' (as in the case of real property). The alphabetical web addresses of familiar sites such as Google or Facebook have a numerical sequence behind them, which is read by computers. The IPv4 combinations that remain, which number only in the millions, will be exhausted soon, badly affecting Internet expansion. As the Internet Engineering Task Force, the standards organisation for protocols, points out, the answer to this has been available for years. What governments, service providers, hardware manufacturers, and other stakeholders have to do is upgrade. The next version of the protocol, IPv6, has the capability of providing trillions of addresses, which can comfortably meet rising demand created by an explosion of connected devices such as smartphones. Already, more than two trillion addresses have been made available to network providers by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.
India, which has been alert to the issue of exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, is pursuing a National IPv6 Deployment Road Map, with a 2012 deadline for central and State government departments and public sector units to become compatible. Some of the Internet service providers have also been working to incorporate the new protocol in anticipation of a dry-out of IPv4 addresses. A strong partnership between the government and other stakeholders will ensure that there are no islands of incompatible networks. There will be no ‘switching off' of existing operations: they will remain live while the new protocol will cater to growth needs. Moreover, the economic importance of the Internet has encouraged major commercial entities to work for IPv6 compatibility. An example of good national-level leadership is the China Next Generation Internet project, which has been promoting the new protocol since 2003. It has helped create the largest IPv6 network so far, used by a million students. Several other national strategies, notably those of the United States, Germany, Japan, Australia, and Brazil, are noteworthy. A test-run of the networks prepared so far will be done on June 8, 2011, designated World IPv6 Day. This will help identify issues that need to be addressed quickly.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-new-protocol/article15127596.ece
7,2,2011,‘Development' vs Environment,"Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's observation that enforcement of environmental regulatory standards should not lead to a throwback to the days of the licence-permit raj strikes a jarring note in an era of enlightened, science-based conservation. By projecting regulation as a threat to economic development, he has brought needless pressure to bear on the nascent efforts of Minister Jairam Ramesh to bring accountability and transparency to the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF). In his address to the Delhi Sustainable Development Summit, the Prime Minister lamented the weakening of the ancient symbiotic relationship between society and the environment on account of development and population growth; he prescribed the unexceptionable cure of sustainable development and called for inter-generational equity. But his advocacy is short on conviction because it comes laced with the scare scenario of bottleneck controls. It is certainly unhelpful to Mr. Ramesh, who has been working hard to strike the right balance between GDP growth and conservation, reduce carbon emissions without sacrificing growth — and vitally, to steer the MoEF away from the path of rubber-stamped environmental clearances. Such is the pressure on the Ministry, including from other Ministries, that it has had to show cause why it is implementing fundamental laws such as the Forest (Conservation) Act.
The MoEF now has the difficult task of introducing greater scientific rigour in environment impact assessment of projects. The Minister has gone about his job seeking expert counsel, holding public hearings, and publishing committee reports. This refreshing approach also serves a public education function and Mr. Ramesh must persist with it. His priority should be to make the Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006 effective; a weak EIA regime can do much harm. The Ministry's committee on the Posco project in Orissa, for instance, recorded “serious lapses and illegalities” in EIA and the majority of members recommended revocation of clearance granted in 2007 for a minor port and steel plant. That the Ministry had to subsequently ignore the report and conditionally clear the project is a measure of the pressure it faces. The present onslaught on environmental regulations, most of which are poorly enforced by State governments, is a far cry from the time of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi who pioneered them in a different era. She memorably described unplanned development as violence against the landscape. In recent times, the Forest Rights Act has joined the list of progressive laws protecting the rights of people, and forests. Political India needs to learn the virtues of good environmental governance, which limits exploitation of natural resources to sustainable levels.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/development-vs-environment/article1162467.ece
7,2,2011,Growing market uncertainty,"Even for stock markets used to a high degree of volatility, the sharp fall in the benchmark indices, the Sensex and the Nifty on February 4, was exceptional. The Sensex lost 441 points, or 2.39 per cent, to close at just above 18,000, a five-month low. The 50-share Nifty fell below the psychologically significant level of 5,400. Sharp falls in the share indices are not uncommon. During the current financial year, the Sensex registered a decline of 2.38 per cent or more on at least five days. What makes Friday's slump striking is that it reinforces a belief that Indian exchanges are not just correcting themselves to trade at sustainable levels over the near term but are undergoing a major directional change. According to this view, despite a 10 per cent drop since January, the markets have not yet found the floor. Further declines are possible. The reasons for such pessimism are not far to seek. The recent declines are attributed to concerns over the macroeconomy, especially the apparently intractable inflation. The RBI, which recently hiked interest rates and marked up its inflation target for March 31, 2011 might be forced to tighten money supply further. Both the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister have cited inflation as the ‘number one' concern. However, the GDP growth is likely to maintain its momentum.
Recent trends in the emerging markets are ominous, the Indian stock exchanges being among the worst performers. Going by the developments in all the major emerging markets over last week, it appears that the investors have lost much of their enthusiasm for these markets, especially those in Asia. Just in a week, investors have taken $7 billion out of global emerging market funds, with China, India, and Indonesia witnessing the biggest outflows. As for India, the foreign institutional investors have sold Rs.9,339 crore of stocks so far this year. There are important messages for policymakers and investors. The exodus of investors is a rude reminder to policymakers of the danger in depending too much on short-term inflows to bridge the current account deficit. For the investors, the next few weeks will determine whether the markets will consolidate around the current levels or plummet to the rock-bottom levels they touched in January 2008.. All of a sudden, just weeks before the Union budget, increasing uncertainty seems to have gripped the stock markets.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Growing-market-uncertainty/article15130761.ece
8,2,2011,Creeping intolerance,"Indonesia's reputation as a model of democratic religious pluralism and tolerance for the Muslim world is well deserved. The country has the world's largest population of Muslims — who constitute 86 per cent of its 240 million people. Efforts over the decades to create a national identity drawn from its diverse religious and ethnic heritage have largely paid off. The Indonesian Constitution enshrines the state's belief in “the one and only God” but also guarantees freedom of worship according to a person's religion. There is none of the confusion that has beset Pakistan since its founding day about the role and place of Islam in the state. Unfortunately, some recent developments in Indonesia seem to parallel those in Pakistan. In an incident ominously reminiscent of the attacks on Ahmadiyah mosques in Lahore in May 2010, activists of the extremist Islamic Defenders Front (FDI) gathered outside an Ahmadiyah mosque in Makkasar in South Sulawesi in late January, threatening to storm it. The police evacuated the congregation to safety but the mob was able to inflict some damage on the mosque. Since 2005, when the Indonesian Council of Ulemas declared Ahmadiyah as “deviant” from Islam, the community has repeatedly come under intimidation. The sect was founded in Qadian, near Gurdaspur in Punjab, in the late 19th century. Its adherents consider themselves Muslim but do not accept the finality of Prophet Mohammed. In India, they are Muslim by personal law. The attacks against Ahmadis in Indonesia increased after a 2008 government decree prohibited the sect from “spreading its beliefs” and worshipping in public. Last year, Religious Affairs Minister Suryadharma Ali called for a ban on Ahmadis.
Despite his forward-looking vision for Indonesia, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has shown disappointing timidity in the matter. As in Pakistan, support for religious political parties is not high but radical Muslim groups wield a disproportionate amount of street influence — and in this way succeed in shaping the responses of politicians and government officials. After all, in Pakistan it was Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a ‘progressive' leader, who brought in a constitutional amendment to declare the Ahmadis non-Muslim to appease religious lobbies. It is to be hoped that Indonesia, which has moved ahead politically and economically with much speed after getting rid of Suharto, will tackle the intolerance with the same determination it has shown in dealing with the Islamist terror group Jemaah Islmiyah.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Creeping-intolerance/article15377401.ece
8,2,2011,A tactical gain for Congress,"Forced separations are painful; voluntary mergers tend to be congenial. In a mutually beneficial arrangement, the Praja Rajyam Party of actor-turned politician Chiranjeevi is to merge with the Congress in Andhra Pradesh. For the Congress, which suffered a debilitating split with the breakaway of the Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy faction, this development serves its political interests possibly beyond the short term. The PRP brings along 16 Members of the Legislative Assembly, not counting the two members who are seen as Jagan loyalists. This makes up for the shortfall induced by Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy, who claims the support of at least 24 Congress MLAs. For now, Chief Minister Kiran Kumar Reddy should be able to ward off any threat to his government. Over the last two years, Andhra Pradesh was witness to a series of political crises triggered by various factors. First, the tragic death of Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy in a helicopter crash in September 2009; next, violent agitations for and against a separate State of Telangana; then the adventurous yatras of Mr Jaganmohan Reddy, which were intended to pressure the Congress into making him Chief Minister. The PRP-Congress merger should result in some measure of political stability in the troubled State, which has seen three Chief Ministers in less than two years. The ruling party — which has been without a strong leader after the death of YSR and unable to contain the fallout from his son's rebellion — could certainly do with the charisma of Mr. Chiranjeevi, who commands a sizeable following in Coastal Andhra and has a strong base within his Kapu community.
For the superstar who founded his party in 2008 with the promise of delivering an alternative to both the Congress and the Telugu Desam Party, the merger proposal was born of political compulsions. His party could win only 18 seats in the Assembly; it did not seem capable of challenging the dominance of the Congress or the TDP in the conceivable future. Joining forces with the ruling party could help Mr. Chiranjeevi fast-track his political ambitions, even if it means submitting to the hierarchies and the decision-making structures of the Congress. Although the merger decision was announced as “unconditional,” Mr. Chiranjeevi took the plunge after several rounds of discussions with senior Congress leaders — and a final meeting with Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Whether this will bring immediate rewards like ministerial berths for his MLAs and a Rajya Sabha seat for himself or whether the terms imply a larger role for himself after the next Assembly election will be known soon enough. What is clear is that the latest development is a significant tactical gain for the Congress in South India's largest State.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-tactical-gain-for-Congress/article15131842.ece
9,2,2011,Keep talking,"The talks between the Foreign Secretaries of India and Pakistan at Thimphu on the resumption of bilateral dialogue appear to have gone off well. Since February 2010, attempts by the two sides to restart the bilateral engagement that India broke off over the November 2008 Mumbai attacks have not made much headway. Despite initial promise, the July 2010 meeting between External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna and Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in Islamabad ended up in another impasse. The main disagreement was over Pakistan's insistence that the resumed dialogue between the two sides must schedule talks about the Kashmir issue, which India linked to Pakistan making tangible progress in punishing the perpetrators of the November 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. The two sides also differed over the format of the dialogue. Pakistan favoured continuing the “composite dialogue” while India preferred a new format. It is not clear if Sunday's meeting succeeded in breaking the stalemate. What is significant is that the two senior officials reiterated the importance of dialogue in order to settle “all outstanding issues” between the two countries. It is encouraging that Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao and her Pakistan counterpart, Salman Bashir, took care not to publicly air all the problematic issues that must have come up in their discussion. Often when things start going wrong in India-Pakistan relations, the two sides use the media to wage proxy wars. That the 90-minute meeting was followed by a common press release is a good sign. It is to be hoped that the officials can soon work their way to holding a meeting of the Foreign Ministers, and to an announcement of the formal resumption of the dialogue process.
Despite what cynics on both sides say, engagement is the only way forward for India and Pakistan. Talking may not lead to an immediate resolution of all the problems between the two countries but, as recently underlined by former Pakistan Foreign Minister Khurshid Ahmed Kasuri, the India-Pakistan dialogue of 2004-2007 brought about a significant narrowing down of differences on major issues such as Kashmir, Siachen, and Sir Creek. On the other hand, the absence of dialogue leaves a damaging vacuum that hate-mongers on both sides rush to fill, and will eventually lead to a hardening of positions. New Delhi's demand that Pakistan act against terror groups plotting attacks on Indian soil can be addressed only through talks. While India is correct in demanding that Pakistan act expeditiously to bring to book the perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attacks, it could set an example by ensuring swift investigation and punishment for those involved in the 2007 bombing of the Samjhauta train in which 60 Pakistani nationals were killed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Keep-talking/article15134072.ece
9,2,2011,Growing optimism,"The International Monetary Fund's latest update on world economic outlook reflects the optimism generally shared by global institutions on growth prospects. As the recovery gathers pace, the reports of the IMF and the World Bank have tended to strike a progressively cheerful note. There are caveats, to be sure. The industrial nations as well as the emerging economies continue to face significant, if very different, downside risks. Also, there has been no marked improvement in the uneven growth pattern noticed across regions. The emerging economies outstripped the developed ones by 4.2 percentage points in 2010, and this the IMF describes as the continuation of a “two speed” growth process. More recently, Global Economic Prospects, the World Bank's flagship publication, said this sharp disparity will continue well into the future, a prospect that will have far-reaching consequences for the global economy. For instance, the pecking order in the economic hierarchy of nations will get altered.
The IMF, in its latest report, projects a 4.5 per cent rise in global output in 2011 — the figure is 0.25 percentage point above its October forecast. The mark-up is attributed to the stronger-than-expected economic activity during the latter half of 2010. The United States' monetary and fiscal policies aimed at stimulating consumption have already made an impact. The modest recovery in consumption noticed in Japan is also due, at least partly, to the stimulus measures. Overall, there is growing evidence that private consumption, which dropped sharply during the crisis, is beginning to get a firmer foothold in the advanced economies. The financial milieu at the global level improved in the second half of 2010. Equity markets are looking up and the bank finance is available more easily even for the medium and small enterprises. However, some significant areas remain vulnerable. For instance, the real estate markets and household incomes have been weak in several advanced economies. In the U.S., unemployment continues to be at disturbingly high levels. There have been ominous signs of financial turbulence reviving in the periphery of the euro zone. However, the financial sector of the advanced countries has shown greater maturity in dealing with the unexpected stress. As for the emerging economies, major risks relate to the escalation of inflationary pressures, as in India. The commodity prices, especially of petroleum, are expected to remain elevated. Monetary authorities need to be alert and ahead of the curve in countering inflation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Growing-optimism/article15133096.ece
10,2,2011,Behind the S-band spectrum scandal,"Every well-informed schoolchild knows this is rising India's Age of Uninterrupted Scams. No government before the present United Progressive Alliance regime has had to deal with such a dizzying succession of exposés of corruption scandals — 2G spectrum, the Commonwealth Games, Adarsh Housing, money laundering, and the rest that have come tumbling out. The latest in the series is the Indian Space Research Organisation's deal — hatched in secret and sought to be covered up over a period of six years — to launch two customer-specific satellites and give away 70 MHz of high-value S-band for unfettered commercial exploitation at a scandalously low price of just over Rs 1000 crore to a private company, Devas Multimedia Private Limited. The transaction and its implications were first exposed by Business Line, the business daily of The Hindu group, in a >detailed report published on May 31, 2010.
Despite Telecommunications Minister Kapil Sibal's defence of the indefensible, enough is known about the 2G spectrum allocation scam to place it at the top of the list of independent India's corruption scandals. But what is the essence of the S-band spectrum deal concluded in January 2005 between ISRO's commercial arm, Antrix Corporation, and Devas Multimedia which, it turns out, was born of an incestuous relationship with India's space programme? The agreement (the full text is available under Resources at www.thehindu.com) relates to two customer-specific satellites, GSat-6 and GSat 6-A, which ISRO is contractually committed to design, build, and launch in order to make available to Devas the S-band spectrum for commercialising a range of multimedia, broadband services across India. What is special about the S-band, which is defined as radio waves with frequencies that range from 2 GHz to 4 GHz? According to “The 2.6 GHz Spectrum Band: Unique Opportunity to Realize Global Mobile Broadband,” a 2009 report prepared for the GSM Association: “As mobile voice and data traffic increases, wireless operators around the world will require additional spectrum. However, as a finite public commodity, few bands remain available for new allocation to mobile wireless services and even fewer exist for global harmonisation of wireless spectrum assets. The 2.6 GHz band is one exception. The 2.6 GHz band (2500-2690 MHz), sometimes also referred as the 2.5 GHz band, was allocated by the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC) in 2000 for terrestrial mobile communications services. The band provides an opportunity to meet rapidly rising demand for capacity to deliver mobile broadband services on a widespread, common basis across the world.”
Armed with secret knowledge of what ISRO could do for it by launching customer-specific satellites to make available at a throwaway price a large chunk of S-band spectrum, Devas Multimedia — a venture founded in 2004 at the initiative of former officials of the Indian space programme and involving foreign investors — thought it had struck gold. In July 2008, it even sold a 17 per cent stake to Deutsche Telecom AG for $ 75 million (around Rs. 318 crore at the time) and over the next year was clearly looking forward to a time of unrivalled growth in valuation. According to a preliminary estimate by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, whose search for the relevant documents within the Department of Space has been actively obstructed, the presumptive loss of revenue to the government in the event of the Antrix-Devas deal going through now would exceed two lakh crore rupees (approximately $44.4 billion).
ISRO and the Department of Space have scored many successes and enjoyed a good, clean reputation over the decades. Fortunately, in late 2009 some outraged insiders blew the whistle on the secret deal — so secret that ISRO's chief, K. Radhakrishnan, had to admit at a press conference on February 8, 2011 that for reasons that were being “reviewed” internally, ISRO failed “explicitly” to inform the Union Cabinet that GSat-6 and GSat-6A were customer-specific satellites that would be “predominantly used for a novel and commercial application developed by Devas Multimedia in association with global experts.” Towards the end of 2009, thanks to the whistle-blowers and perhaps not unrelated to the stink raised by the 2G spectrum allocation scandal, a view began to form at the top levels of ISRO that the Antrix-Devas deal must be annulled. The Space Commission also wanted the deal to be annulled and the Prime Minister was informed on an indeterminate date.
But nothing much happened until Business Line published its report in May 2010, which the CAG followed up conscientiously despite the bureaucratic hurdles placed in its path. Among the concerns registered by the CAG in its process of enquiry were the following: S-band spectrum was being given away without inviting competitive bids; organisational control systems were not followed; the Prime Minister's Office, the Cabinet, and the Space Commission were not properly informed about the contract details; public resources were being diverted to building two customer-specific satellites; and the contract terms deviated from the terms of previous contracts entered into by ISRO and Antrix. To cut the story short, the publication of the results of the special Business Line investigation, backed up by documents and other reliable evidence, in The Hindu and Business Line has brought the CAG's commendable efforts to light — and placed the nature, scale, and modalities of the S-band spectrum scandal on the public agenda. True to form, those at the receiving end have questioned the accuracy of the media reports or suggested they are overblown. It is a matter of satisfaction that the deal now seems to be heading for annulment — but no thanks to due diligence and oversight by a central government whose procrastination, lack of transparency, obfuscation, and indeed delinquency in this affair have shocked the nation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Behind-the-S-band-spectrum-scandal/article13614709.ece
11,2,2011,Rise of the Muslim Brotherhood,"It is apparent that the Muslim Brotherhood is positioning itself for a role in a post-Mubarak Egypt. The al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen has emerged as the largest and most organised political opposition in the country. The group initially stayed away from the uprising, perhaps unsure of how, as an Islamist movement, it should respond to the spontaneous and non-religious character of the protests. But when it became clear that the snowballing protests had loosened President Hosni Mubarak's grip on Egypt, the Ikhwan made it known that it could not be ignored in the transition to a new set-up. Using its organisational strengths, the Ikhwan mobilised large numbers of its supporters for the protests. And despite being banned from political activity, it accepted with alacrity an invitation from Vice-President Omar Suleiman for discussions on how the political transition should take place. The objective of the Brotherhood is to create a state governed by the Sharia but in recent days it has hastened to project a more pragmatic image of itself to domestic and international audiences. This has been through reassurances that it was working towards a democracy in Egypt.
Indeed, some of the fears surrounding the Ikhwan were clearly exaggerated by Mr. Mubarak to his main benefactor, the United States, in order to perpetuate his regime. Even so, concerns remain about what the rise of the “brothers” could mean for Egypt itself, for the volatile West Asian region, and for the rest of the world. Formed in 1928 as an Islamist nationalist movement to fight the colonial regime, it spawned several offshoots and has become influential in countries across the region. A key question to emerge from the unfolding uprising in Egypt is what it holds for the Palestine-Israel conflict, particularly as the Palestinian Hamas is a wing of the Brotherhood. The group has officially renounced violence and is critical of al-Qaeda. For Egyptians who count themselves as secular and moderate, the Ikhwan's views on religious minorities and women, and its other illiberal beliefs are a source of major concern. But it is still an open question if it can emerge as the most powerful political force in a democratic Egypt. In the Mubarak regime, it enjoyed support among Egypt's middle classes as it was the only opposition. It fared well even in the country's notoriously fraudulent 2005 elections, winning as many as 80 parliamentary seats out of a total of 454. A brutal crackdown on the Ikhwan by a rattled regime ensured it did not win any seats in the 2010 elections. Even though in recent days it might have lost points for its initial reluctance to join the protests, and then for engaging with the regime on transition talks, a fair election would see it doing well. For now, though, it would have to compete with other political forces.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Rise-of-the-Muslim-Brotherhood/article15293213.ece
11,2,2011,ICC's exemplary first step,"Amidst growing cynicism about the integrity of the game, the International Cricket Council (ICC) deserves credit for dealing appropriately with the canker of spot-fixing. The game's governing body couldn't afford to be passive, especially in the lead-up to the World Cup, which will be played in the sub-continent. In provisionally banning Pakistan's Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif, and Mohammad Amir before instituting an independent tribunal to try them, the ICC acted promptly, decisively, and transparently. The nature of the bans — 10 years (five suspended) for Butt, seven (two suspended) for Asif, and five for Amir — was just. The punishment was proportionate — a distinction being made between match-fixing and spot-fixing — and also exemplary. In the past, the administrators have been guilty of laxity. While the crackdown after the match-fixing scandal that threatened to destroy cricket a little more than a decade ago helped contain the problem, the lack of demonstrable corrective action contributed to the rise of spot-fixing. This judgment, if followed up consistently, should act as a deterrent. The 18-year-old Amir, whose case has certain mitigating circumstances, might return to fulfil the dazzling promise he has shown after he has served his time. But Butt, 26, and Asif, 28, have little to look forward to.
The verdict hasn't ended the matter however. Tribunal chairman Michael Beloff's remarks that his panel has recommended “certain changes to the [ICC] Code with a view to providing flexibility in relation to minimum sentences in exceptional circumstances” appear to have encouraged thoughts of an appeal. Butt, Asif, and Amir have also been separately charged by the Crown Prosecution Service — they will have to return to England to face charges of conspiracy to obtain and accept corrupt payments and also conspiracy to cheat. It hasn't escaped notice that Asif and Amir were exposed bowling no-balls at pre-determined moments not by the ICC's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit but by News of the World, a British red top which chanced upon the story. Merely refining its systems of security won't do for the ICC; it will have to liaise better with government agencies in this regard. While the world cricket body has shown encouraging signs in its handling of the affair thus far, its commitment to eradicating corruption will be severely tested in the times to come. Its resolve and acumen will determine the future of the great game.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ICCs-exemplary-first-step/article15371424.ece
12,2,2011,Seeing the light in Assam,"One of the most violent separatist movements in the country has been persuaded to call it a day, and the credit for this has to be shared widely. A preliminary round of discussions has been held between the United Liberation Front of Asom and the central government after the militant group agreed to unconditional talks. Previously, ULFA held firm to the condition that talks must include its demand of sovereignty for Assam. Over the last year, it has evolved politically to realise that this pre-condition was unrealistic. Its own military and political position had been rendered precarious by a combination of factors. Not only did it suffer reverses in operations by Indian security forces, Bangladesh and Bhutan made it clear that ULFA leaders and cadres could no longer seek safe haven on their soil. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has to be thanked for handing over a clutch of ULFA leaders hiding in her country. For their part, the people of Assam made known that they were put off by the group's violent methods that led to the death of hundreds of civilians. All this was instrumental in helping ULFA see the futility of its war against India. A statement issued by the group following the first round of talks in New Delhi suggests it has given up the idea of secession. ULFA now believes it is possible to find ways for the “protection and enrichment of the sovereignty of the people of Assam” within the Indian Constitution. The leaders of the group have also apologised for killing civilians, describing as “mistakes” the 1997 murder of social activist Sanjay Ghose and the 2004 bomb blast in which several children lost their lives.
The central government must be commended for the firm but open-minded way in which it has dealt with the Assam militancy in recent times. The agenda for the talks, which should take place in the next few months, is yet to be settled. Clearly, the two sides will talk about rehabilitation of ULFA cadres, as also lifting the ban on the group. After giving up its demand for independence, ULFA needs some time to reformulate its political goals and enter the democratic mainstream. The people of Assam have long-held grievances — the State's economic underdevelopment, the presence of large numbers of illegal immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh, and the feeling of being done out of a just share of revenue from tea and oil. Indeed, had the Centre paid timely attention to these issues, ULFA might never have come up. They will need to be addressed for a permanent peace in the State. The continued hold-out by ULFA's military wing leader Paresh Barua, who is still on the run and has pledged his opposition to the talks, poses a challenge. It is to be hoped that the force of public opinion in favour of talks will compel him to change his mind.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Seeing-the-light-in-Assam/article15379155.ece
12,2,2011,Southern Sudan's success,"Salva Kiir, President-designate of the new state which has hitherto been southern Sudan, can take pride in the success of the referendum on secession from Africa's largest country. The provisional results, announced recently, show the expected landslide for separation, with a pro-secession vote of nearly 99 per cent. The week-long process was remarkably peaceful, and only 33 out of the 2,600 southern polling stations had their results quarantined, mainly for minor infractions relating to the electoral rolls. The fact that about two million southerners living in the Muslim-majority north refrained from voting for fear of rigged counting in their areas does not invalidate the result, and in any case those voters would almost certainly have been in favour of secession. About 120,000 of them have already anticipated the partition and moved back across the border, and more are likely to follow. Muslims in the largely Christian and animist south, for their part, are moving northwards. So far, fortunately, the migrations have been free of violence.
Mr. Kiir and his fellow-citizens will face formidable problems. Their country, which is due to come into being in July 2011, has 80 per cent of undivided Sudan's oil, but the pipelines run across the north to Port Sudan. The south will want more than its current half-share of the revenues but Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir is likely to insist that the new regime in Juba share the €28-billion national foreign debt. Secondly, the 5.6 million southerners have almost no infrastructure; there is only one hospital, and the sole bridge across the region's 1200-km stretch of the Nile is in the capital. The south's functioning industries produce nothing but drinking water and beer. As for politics, the President-designate has persuaded local warlords to cooperate. But questions persist about the role of the Sudan People's Liberation Army in the new state; there will soon be tens of thousands of ex-soldiers looking for work. Furthermore, the status of Abyei, the oil-rich border region, is still undecided, as the local referendum on whether or not to join the south was derailed by deadly clashes. The new country already enjoys de facto recognition; Egypt's state airline now flies to Juba, and water-sharing negotiations with Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda can be expected to start soon. That should also remind Khartoum that it will need good relations with its neighbour. This partition gives southern Sudan a new lease of life.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Southern-Sudans-success/article15411651.ece
14,2,2011,The Egyptian giant stirs,"President Hosni Mubarak's decision to resign his office constitutes a momentous event in modern Egyptian history. After 18 days of nationwide mass protest, this dictator of 30 years' standing finally acted on the truth he had seemed incapable of seeing: his entire regime had lost all possible public assent, not to mention what little legitimacy it still possessed after years of rigged elections, rampant corruption, and savage torture. Mr. Mubarak's resignation was greeted with jubilation. In Cairo's Tahrir Square, Muslims and Coptic Christians prayed together, civilians embraced soldiers, and even some of the hated police found protesters willing to make friends with them. The outgoing government has handed over to the Supreme Military Council of the Armed Forces, headed by the Defence Minister, Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi. The military have made several explicit promises: they guarantee “free and transparent” elections; they will end the 30-year-long state of emergency; they will ensure a peaceful transfer of power leading to a “free democratic society”; and they will not be a substitute for the “legitimate will of the people.”
The fact remains that Egypt has moved from dictatorship to martial law; many senior military officers were also part of the now-deposed power elite, with long records of corruption and suspect business links. Secondly, the United States may well have played a part in the replacement of Mr. Mubarak with a military government and not an elected one. The statements from Washington and other western capitals calling for stability amounted to support for a brutal regime, and the caution of their latest reactions stands in sharp contrast to their crowing triumphalism over the collapse of the Soviet bloc two decades ago. Thirdly, Israel, having backed the ousted President, has done no more than express the platitudinous hope that “peaceful” Israeli-Egyptian relations would continue. What cannot be denied, however, is that 80 million Egyptians have spoken. Their right to democracy cannot be annulled; nor can their demand for it be resisted. It is Egypt's neighbours who know that best. In Algeria, protesters are defying bans on rallies. In Yemen, the people have won the President's assurance that there will be no father-son handover. In Jordan, the King has appointed a new government with orders to introduce major reforms. Half a century ago and seven thousand kilometres south of Cairo, a leader of another time said the wind of change was blowing through Africa. Today, that wind is blowing through West Asia. Its consequences in the region, long known for foreign-supported and despotic rulers, cannot be predicted, but they will be of immense importance to the whole world.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-Egyptian-giant-stirs/article15444144.ece
14,2,2011,The case for faster justice,"Yes, the wheels of justice grind slowly, but should they move at such an excruciatingly sluggish pace? The sense of satisfaction that the law does catch up with the high and mighty, exemplified by the Supreme Court of India's conviction of former Kerala minister R. Balakrishna Pillai for graft in the Idamalayar dam corruption case, is severely tempered by the fact that justice was done two decades after the initiation of prosecution. While sentencing Mr. Pillai to one year of rigorous imprisonment, the Supreme Court itself drew attention to this indefensible delay by directing the special courts to dispose all corruption cases against public servants expeditiously. The two-member Bench held that High Courts, having a supervisory role over trial courts, are expected to monitor the progress of these cases and may “even call for a quarterly report from the court concerned for speedy disposal.”
The Supreme Court's observations closely follow Law Minister Veerappa Moily's promise to put in place, within the next three months, a system under which corruption cases are fast-tracked so that “no [such] case should exceed three years.” How this is going to be achieved is unclear considering that the law's built-in delays have been an intractable problem. However, it is commendable that the government has earmarked a sum of Rs.20,000 crore for developing judicial infrastructure, which needs overhauling particularly at the level of the lower courts. Most of the estimated three-crore-plus cases pending are in the lower courts, which under the E-courts project, need to be urgently computerised. Since more than two-thirds of pending cases involve the government, it is important that it quickly change from being a compulsive litigant to a responsible one. The National Litigation Policy unveiled last year, which aims at bringing about such a transformation in government attitude, must be implemented with a sense of mission. Any serious attempt to tackle a judicial backlog of such proportions will require coordinated action on multiple fronts. These include raising the judge-population ratio, which compares very poorly with that of other countries, to at least 50 per million as recommended by the Supreme Court in 2002. There is also a case for streamlining the time-consuming elements in the Civil and Criminal Procedure Codes and improving the functioning of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Speed and efficiency are vital not only to the credibility of any justice delivery system but also to the very well-being of any democratic society.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-case-for-faster-justice/article15443157.ece
15,2,2011,On a strong wicket still,"On the face of it, the advance estimate of GDP growth for 2010-11, released by the CSO recently, should provide some satisfaction. The economy is expected to end the year with a growth of 8.6 per cent, which is closer to the upper end of the Finance Minister's forecast of 8.4-8.75 per cent but above the Reserve Bank of India's estimate of 8.5 per cent. Among individual sectors, agriculture, along with forestry and fishing, is expected to rebound sharply, growing by 5.40 per cent from just 0.40 per cent a year ago. Manufacturing is set to expand at 8.8 per cent, the same as last fiscal, while services will post a 9.6 per cent growth, which is in line with the sector's recent trends. The farm sector has clearly benefited from normal monsoons but its performance is magnified by the low base of last year. However, agricultural recovery, if sustained, will have a beneficial impact on rural employment and domestic consumption. Manufacturing growth continues to be impressive but the estimated 8.8 per cent growth implies a moderation in the remaining months of the year, compared with the 13 per cent and 9.8 per cent growth during the first two quarters. The optimism on the manufacturing front remains, despite the low industrial output recorded in December 2010.
Indeed, the economy as a whole would have grown at a slower rate during the second half of the year, having clocked 8.9 per cent in the first half. The fact that last year's growth rate was revised upwards to a base of 8 per cent, in the quick estimates, from 7.4 per cent might have dragged down the current year's estimate. More substantial evidence of a slowdown is seen in the lower estimate of gross fixed capital formation of 29.3 per cent during 2010-11, as against 30.8 per cent last year. There is a slight moderation in the government's final consumption expenditure suggesting that the impact of stimulus measures is wearing off. Just weeks before the Union budget, the economic data pose major dilemmas for policymakers. The fall in investment is attributed to the interest rate hikes. However, the RBI is unlikely to abandon its current stance that points to a further hardening of interest rates. As for stimulus, the government's line of thinking seems to be to lower transaction costs, while there is uncertainty over the continuation of many of the sops to exporters. Fiscal consolidation remains critical and although one-time receipts from disinvestment and the 3G auctions have helped, it is clear that the high economic growth of recent years needs to be sustained if the fiscal situation is not to deteriorate.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/On-a-strong-wicket-still/article15444262.ece
15,2,2011,Improving art collections,"A case relating to paintings allegedly missing from the Ravi Varma collection housed in the Kerala Department of Museums and Zoos has raised concerns about the safekeeping of precious heritage. It spotlights the glaring inadequacies in the existing legislation meant to ensure the acquisition of the best art objects for government museums and the shortcomings in the methods to mange them. The Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, enacted nearly four decades ago at the initiative of the central government, is intended to discourage fraudulent dealings in antiquities and paintings that are more than 100 years old. It enables the state to declare select paintings as national treasures and acquire them. While the public spirit behind the legislation must be appreciated, its failure sufficiently to differentiate paintings from antiquities and its prescription of similar methods to manage them have hampered better circulation of art objects and improvement of the collection mechanism. The protection of antiquities typically calls for extreme vigilance in situ, at specific archaeological sites. Paintings, on the other hand, are portable objects. It would be impractical to endlessly include entire collections of contemporary masters as national treasures and subject them to the same procedures as antiquities.
The acquisition and administration of art collections require a wholly different approach. A mandatory register, as envisaged by the Act, with minimum details may be sufficient to manage antiquities, but that is not the case with paintings. Art requires comprehensive cataloguing. Improving the collections, as Nicholas Goodison's report on securing the best for the museums in the United Kingdom notes, does not mean that all important paintings should be compulsorily acquired. What is required is “well-judged acquisition.” In a country where museums are struggling to keep their head above water, it is imperative that decisions to improve art collections are based on a thoughtful plan. Art administrators, with the aid of a proper system of cataloguing, should identify representative corpuses of various artists in their collections and mark the ‘surplus.' They should invest their scarce resources on important paintings they do not have; and if need be, ‘surplus' art works could be used to mobilise more resources. Existing legal frameworks must be reviewed to facilitate this and enable art collections to circulate better. Such progressive measures could also lead to potential partnerships between private and public museums and the sharing of scarce resources.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Improving-art-collections/article15444258.ece
16,2,2011,Beyond the politics of defection,"At an immediate level, the Karnataka High Court's decision to uphold the disqualification of five independents may have enhanced the stability of the Yeddyurappa government. But the real significance of the judgment, which goes well beyond its short-lived political impact, lies in its broad interpretation of what constitutes defection. This has major implications for the process of government formation. The broad thrust of the judgment — which relates to the five MLAs who supported the BJP government and were given ministerial posts — is that legislators lose their independent character and become liable for disqualification when they become part of the Council of Ministers. Rejecting a strict interpretation of the word ‘joins' in paragraph 2 (2) of the Tenth Schedule, which states that an independent legislator “shall be disqualified for being a member of the House if he joins any political party after…election”, the Court held it was irrelevant whether the five MLAs had formally joined the party. Holding that the act of joining must be gleaned from their conduct, it maintained that the five had invited disqualification by becoming part of the Council of Ministers, attending BJP legislature party meetings, and receiving whips from its Chief Whip.
What about coalition governments, whose very formation and survival depend on legislators, both independent and allied, joining the Council of Ministers? Here, the Court makes an intricate and not entirely convincing distinction between the heterogeneity of coalitions and governments formed by a single party. It goes on to imply, though not unequivocally, that independents who join coalition ministries may not attract the provisions of the anti-defection law. This qualification apart, the Court's judgment reflects the spirit behind the Tenth Schedule — which was to put a firm end to political defections and “sustain the purity of the electoral process right from the date of commencement…till the completion of the term of the House.” This is reflected in the Court upholding five complaints filed by voters against each of the MLAs as maintainable. Its firm rejection of the contention that voters have no locus standi to file complaints seeking disqualification under the Tenth Schedule is in keeping with its overall approach, based firmly on the supremacy of the electoral mandate. “The election promises and pledges held out to the electorate at the time of the election have to be maintained. Any deviation of the same would amount to betrayal of the electorate…” In an electoral climate where fractured mandates are the norm and simple majorities are sometimes cobbled together by luring independents with ministerial sops, the impact of the judgment and the fate of the appeal against it in the Supreme Court deserve to be closely watched.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Beyond-the-politics-of-defection/article15448152.ece
16,2,2011,India's numbers,"The world's second largest national headcount operation, the Census of India, is significant for several reasons. The largest peace-time administrative activity of the Indian state is also the third since economic liberalisation was initiated. Three decades is enough time for a nation to assess the economic impact and implications of a change in macroeconomic policies, and hence Census 2011 should provide statistical insights into what the move away from state-led development has meant for the people. In a rapidly growing India pulled back by glaring inequalities, data gathered by the censuses — particularly the village and town registers that give primary data on important indicators such as access to education, healthcare, communication, and financial services — will be invaluable for re-orienting public policy. This will also help align policies with the global approach to poverty reduction. In a specific instance, 262 districts and cities have been identified as “Gender Critical” — based on the 2001 Census data related to sex ratio, female literacy rate, and female work participation — and special training has been given to enumerators to collect accurate information on gender issues.
The 2011 Census has also done well to add questions that are in tune with a rapidly evolving economy. The inclusion of questions on whether a household possesses computers, laptops, and mobile phones will help determine India's standing in a fast-digitising global economy and provide a picture of the digital divide. The information gathered on modes of transport from commuters and the distance travelled to work — to be collected in the current phase of Population Enumeration — has the potential to be a valuable building block for an efficient public transport network. Economic activity has always engaged the attention of census-takers. Its contemporary salience is evident from the distinction being made in the Census between ‘marginal workers' who have worked for zero-to-three months and those who have worked for three-to-six months; this information will help policymakers assess the impact of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. The larger economic purpose of Census 2011, however, should be to provide a reality check on where India stands on key indicators of development and also in relation to the government's professed committment to the creation of an inclusive society.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Indias-numbers/article15445380.ece
17,2,2011,Unpersuasive interaction,"Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's 70-minute interaction with editors of television channels, which was telecast live, is an event of some political significance. It has come at a time when the United Progressive Alliance government is besieged by corruption scandals and issues arising from governance and ethical deficits, policy muddles, and coalition woes. Reaching out to a large national audience by having a free and open interaction with informed journalists is a politically smart idea. But this assumes that the leader has a strong message to communicate and can do it persuasively. Wednesday's event was worthwhile in that we got to know a little more about what has been going on in Dr. Singh's mind than we did before this ‘conversation.' Unfortunately, the terms and format of the interaction imposed severe limitations on the depth of questioning by not allowing any real focus on the key issues raised by the television journalists. But that was not the real problem with the Prime Minister's performance on live television. He had no strong and clear message to communicate on any of the critical issues troubling the people of India — corruption, inflation, livelihood and other economic issues — and therefore failed to persuade.
Dr. Singh did well to announce unequivocally the government's “sovereign policy decision,” even if taken rather late in the day, to go for annulment of the indefensible Antrix-Devas S-band deal. But on the issue at the top of political India's mind — the 2G spectrum allocation scam, where the kingpin, a former Cabinet colleague, is in the custody of the Central Bureau of Investigation and will soon be charge-sheeted, and various others, including those in high places, are presumably being investigated for their misdeeds — he was anything but convincing. Facing questions on how and why he as Prime Minister, who was in communication with Telecom Minister A. Raja in 2007-2008, allowed the so-called First Come, First Served policy of 2G spectrum allocation to go through, he essentially washed his hands of the affair, which resulted in a revenue loss of tens of thousands of crores of rupees. Dr. Singh's defence is four-legged: (a) Mr. Raja, the Telecom Ministry, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, the Telecom Commission, and eventually even the Finance Ministry were of “the same view,” namely that “auctions ...[were] not the way forward as far as 2G spectrum ... [was] concerned”; (b) “at that moment, there was no reason to feel that anything wrong had been done”; (c) was the presumptive loss a real ‘loss'? and (d) in any case, coalition compulsions made his party accept its ally's choice of Cabinet Ministers and presumably their ways. This amounts to evading the key issue of prime ministerial accountability for high-stake Cabinet decisions in a parliamentary form of government.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Unpersuasive-interaction/article15448158.ece
17,2,2011,Recovering Egypt's stolen antiquities,"Egyptians who are looking to the future following their magnificent victory over a dictatorial and venal regime face many challenges. Among them is that of finding reliable ways to recover their past. When protesters were on the streets fighting the Mubarak regime, and before the military could throw a protective cordon, thieves broke into Cairo's Egyptian Museum, which holds the most extensive collection of pharaonic antiquities in the world. After initial denial, the newly created Ministry of Antiquities confirmed that 18 priceless objects including the gilded wood-statue of Tutankhamun with a harpoon — which is more than 3000 years old and was discovered by Howard Carter in 1922 — are untraceable. In addition, about 70 important artefacts were damaged. Considering that the museum is located at Tahrir Square and there was a tumultuous crowd nearby, the loss could have been worse. There is enough expertise available to restore the damaged artefacts but the loss of antiquities is deeply worrying. They must be recovered swiftly before they are irretrievably lost to the illicit antiquity market.
Egypt has stringent laws that prescribe heavy fines and rigorous imprisonment up to seven years for stealing and smuggling out antiquities. However, this has not deterred smugglers such as Tokeley-Parry, the antiquities restorer turned thief who disguised the stolen head of Amenhotep III, valued at US $1.1 million, as a cheap replica and slipped it through Egyptian Customs. The prospects of recovering the lost Egyptian antiquities depend entirely on international cooperation that needs to go beyond technical implementation of rules. Museums, antique dealers, and auction houses must demonstrate a firm resolve to stay clear of these stolen antiquities. They must not take up any activity that even indirectly supports their circulation. Institutions that try to defend the indefensible by taking the self-serving ideological stance that museums anywhere must be allowed to acquire and protect “undocumented antiquities,” which are the heritage of humankind and not of any one country, must be shamed and proceeded against legally. Egpyt's antiquities are assets of universal and timeless importance. Recovering and returning them to where they belong is, first, the responsibility of Egypt's transitional regime and, secondly, of governments and law enforcement agencies everywhere.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Recovering-Egypts-stolen-antiquities/article15447024.ece
18,2,2011,The rise of China,"It is official. Measured in terms of nominal GDP converted to dollars at official exchange rates, China has, in 2010, overtaken Japan as the world's second largest economy. Figures from Japan released this week showed that Japan's nominal gross domestic product was worth $5,474 billion in 2010 compared with China's $5,879 billion. This is indeed a significant milestone. For many years before that China had been ahead of Japan only when GDP was measured in purchasing power parity terms. PPP is an indicator that takes into account relative prices and therefore the command over goods that a dollar of income provides. Since with lower wages and prices, a dollar in China when converted to RMB delivers more purchasing power, Chinese GDP measured in PPP dollars is significantly higher than at official exchange rates. Hence, becoming the world's second largest economy at official exchange rates does mark an important transition. There are only two features that seem to discount this achievement. The first is that while having overtaken Japan, China is far behind the U.S., with less than two-fifths of its GDP in nominal terms. The second is that with a population of more than 1.3 billion, compared with Japan's 128 million and the United States' 307 million, China's per capita nominal GDP in 2009 was less than a tenth that in both Japan and the U.S.
Yet China's rise does seem to evoke fear. One reason is its export success, with exports of goods and services estimated at close to two-fifths of GDP before the 2008 crisis broke. But that figure has come down since and is likely to remain low as China seeks to redirect growth and rely more on home demand. Yet the fear of the socialist giant is unlikely to subside. This is because its low per capita income and large population makes its rise more ominous in the eyes of its global rivals. Being low on the per capita league table allows China to aspire to high growth rates for decades to come. When growth occurs at that level of per capita income, the demands it generates tend to be more intensive in manufactures, energy, and mineral resources. Add to this the fact that the size of the population that will benefit from that potential growth is immense and the pressure this puts on the world's resources, besides its environment, is likely to be huge. The threat this poses to countries that rose to dominance in a context of cheap and ample resources and raw materials should be obvious. Rising India has nothing to fear from its big neighbour assuming that bilateral relations will continue to be handled soundly on both sides. For one thing, China is one of India's top trading partners and bilateral trade, which amounted to $61.7 billion in 2010, is well on course to meet the target of $100 billion by 2015.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-rise-of-China/article15448271.ece
18,2,2011,A strange affair,"The stand-off between the United States and Pakistan over the arrest of an American national for killing two Pakistanis in Lahore underlines the perils of the peculiar “strategic partnership” between the two countries. The man, identified by Pakistani authorities as Raymond Davis, shot the two men when they drew up on a motorcycle alongside his vehicle at a traffic signal on a busy road. The U.S. has demanded that Mr. Davis, who was arrested on the spot, be handed over to its officials as he is an employee of its embassy in Pakistan and has diplomatic immunity. The Pakistan government seems unsure of what to do next. It is caught, on the one side, by the anti-American anger on the streets, now focussed on the demand that Mr. Davis be tried and punished — in Pakistan — for the killings; and, on the other, by the Pakistan state's own client-like relationship with the U.S. Washington has reacted with unusual annoyance this time, putting on hold all bilateral engagements. Extraordinarily, President Barack Obama has also waded in with the demand that Pakistan should hand him back. The incident has had a political fall-out too, with former Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi claiming that he was dropped for a principled refusal to bow to U.S. pressure. The government has left it to the courts to decide on the immunity question.
Much of the public fury in Pakistan against the U.S. is over covert American operations from its territory and the perceived craven attitude of the government in not standing up for the country's sovereignty. The Davis incident goes to the heart of this anger, with questions over his true identity and the nature of his assignment. It is known that he once served in the military. The Pakistan government gave him a visa on a U.S. diplomatic passport; he is listed as a member of the technical and administrative staff of the embassy in Pakistan. It is possible he was an undercover spy. It is routine for countries to post intelligence operatives to diplomatic missions in other roles. Most times, the host country is aware of their true identity. Pakistan hosts one of the biggest overseas operations of the Central Intelligence Agency; its own Inter-Services Intelligence is a close collaborator of the U.S. agency. But it baulks at admitting this to its people. The Pakistan Army has a lot of answering to do on the nature of the country's relations with the superpower. It is truly unfortunate that Pakistan's civilian government should be in the dock for this.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-strange-affair/article15448270.ece
19,2,2011,The ICC doesn't own cricket,"The International Cricket Council (ICC), in attempting to regulate the media's coverage of the World Cup, has over-reached itself. While cricket's governing body has cause to protect what it perceives as its interests, its efforts to monitor and curb the packaging and the presentation of content, particularly in the print media, are excessive and in some respects over the top. The ICC's rationale is that staging an event of the magnitude of the World Cup requires a scale of money that can only be raised by guaranteeing exclusivity — without this assurance, sponsors would be reluctant to help fund the exercise. In itself, the argument isn't without merit; these are the realities of the world we live in. But its interpretation, in the ICC's instructions to news organisations, continues a worrying development. “The free and open coverage of sports events is under attack,” Larry Kilman, Executive Director of Communications and Public Affairs for WAN-IFRA, an organisation that promotes press freedom, said last year. Kilman pointed to the increasing tendency of sports companies and organisers to control coverage by limiting editorial and commercial freedom. Although some of the ICC's directives pertaining to “permissible and impermissible activity” appear reasonable, drawing a distinction between editorial and commercial work, there is sufficient cause for alarm.
At the heart of the matter is the question: who owns sport? Organisations such as the ICC contend they do, ignoring both sport's essence as a public activity and the media's role in developing and promoting sport. It is this contention that has seen administrators across the world lay claim to sport's every facet so that they can monetise it. Central to this endeavour is the prevention of others from doing similarly. One manifestation of the ICC's heightened urge for control is the severity of the restrictions it is imposing on fans who will attend the World Cup. Ostensibly, some of these regulations are security measures. But several, designed to thwart ambush marketing, verge on the draconian and the absurd. Not only do the restrictions establish a monopoly in what is a public domain; they also unduly curtail personal freedom. The ICC must realise that it hasn't total ownership of on-field action. Cricket, like every sport, is many things at once, one of them being a collective experience. Individual components of a sporting event moreover cannot be copyrighted. For the ICC to tell the media how “match content” may be presented is to challenge freedom of expression — which is guaranteed in Article 19 of the Indian Constitution — and also the right to information. Responsible news organisations must be trusted to use their judgment to account for both the ICC's commercial considerations and their own.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-ICC-doesnt-own-cricket/article15449795.ece
19,2,2011,Warning signals ignored,"The role of the International Monetary Fund during the period immediately preceding the global economic crisis has come in for sharp criticism by the Fund's independent evaluation committee. The panel's report, released recently, catalogues the warning signals — all of them emanated from the financial systems of the advanced countries — the IMF had failed to pick up and act upon. A number of its assumptions about the health of the financial sector in the West were incredibly naïve. For instance, as late as the summer of 2008, the IMF management asserted that the United States “has avoided a hard landing” and that the “worst news is behind us.” The collapse of Lehman Brothers, which happened on September 15, 2008, marked the lowest point of the crisis, the first signs of which had surfaced almost a year earlier.
According to the watchdog committee, the IMF has always been late in spotting the severe interconnected problems of the advanced economies. Its ability to identify and evaluate the risks mounting in the U.S. financial sector was hampered by a high degree of “groupthink”, “intellectual capture”, and the general belief that the large advanced economies are unlikely to be hit by a financial crisis. Moreover, even the bilateral surveillance system of the U.S. has failed to alert its authorities of the emerging risks and pinpoint policy weaknesses. What is worse, the IMF seemed to be championing the cause of the U.S. financial sector and its regulator. Dissenting voices heard from within and outside went unheeded. In one striking case, the warnings its chief economist Raghuram Rajan sounded as far back as 2005 about financial instability were ignored. Also, the IMF was relying on traditional macroeconomic approaches and modelling that were wholly inadequate to spot the emerging risks. Since the start of the crisis — and in the recovery phase too — it has been striving hard to regain its relevance, even as its management and operational structures are becoming more democratic and broad-based. The emerging economies, particularly China and India, are poised to play a greater role. The watchdog committee has pointed out that the Fund's earlier focus on exchange rate and current account policies of the emerging markets — rather than on the housing and financial sector bubbles of the advanced economies — for solving the problem of global imbalances has left a legacy that continues to hamper greater cooperation among major economies, especially China and the U.S.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Warning-signals-ignored/article15449794.ece
21,2,2011,Yet more Iraq lies,"The combination of bizarrely implausible factors that led to the United States-led and United Kingdom-backed invasion of Iraq in March 2003 has been exposed yet again by one of its own proponents. The Iraq-born former chemical engineer Alwan al-Janabi has told The Guardian in detail how, when approached by an official in the German security service, the BND, in March 2000, he made wildly inaccurate claims about Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). Mr. Janabi kept up the inventions for six months, and even thought they would go no further when the British and German secret services rejected his claim that the son of his former boss was a procurer of WMDs; the boy was in fact at school in the U.K. The ex-chemist says he was shocked when he heard his lies being repeated in the speech by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell to the United Nations Security Council. In that notorious speech, Mr. Powell made it clear that the invasion would proceed, and added more fictions about Baghdad's purchases of uranium ore from Niger and its links with al-Qaida.
Mr. Janabi says he was desperate for Iraq to be rid of Saddam Hussein and therefore uttered lie after lie about the regime. His capacity for invention is similar to that of the Bush administration's Iraqi favourite Ahmed Chalabi. But by saying that given the chance he would do the same again, he puts himself in the same class for self-exculpation as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Unlike Mr. Blair, however, he has not convinced himself that what he said about Iraq was true. What they both evade is the fact that if the evidence for WMDs had been strong enough, the U.N. would have been much more likely to legitimise further action against Iraq. Secondly, Mr. Janabi brings to light wider culpability for the war than is often acknowledged. Germany shared the lies with Washington; another blot on the record is that sceptical officers in the Central Intelligence Agency, as well as the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office and security agencies, made no impression on either George W. Bush or his British counterpart. It is not just that the White House, faced with post-invasion catastrophe in Iraq, blamed the CIA for intelligence failures and then tried to wreck it from inside. Nor is it just that Mr. Blair never discussed the case for war in the Cabinet. Instead, Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair had a supporting chorus in large sections of the international media, and no British or American political institution could stop them. It remains highly unlikely that either of them will ever face justice over the 100,000 Iraqis who died for the indulgence of their fantasies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Yet-more-Iraq-lies/article15452600.ece
21,2,2011,Monetise cross-LoC trade,"It is more than two years since India and Pakistan inaugurated trade across the Line of Control that divides Jammu & Kashmir. In this time, the increase in the trade, indeed its survival through the tensions between the two countries after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, is a tribute more to the spirit of the people on both sides of the LoC than to any effort by the governments. In fact, after flagging off the trade in October 2008, India and Pakistan appear to have more or less left it to the people to figure out the next steps. As yet, the most elementary requirement of modern-day business transactions — a banking channel — is not available to the traders despite repeated representations to both governments. The reason: given their firm positions on how the map of J&K should be drawn, the two governments are unable to reconcile themselves to opening branches of banks from the other side, to traders dealing in the differing currencies, and to cross-LoC money transfers. As a result, the businessmen have had to settle for a medieval barter system, exchanging goods of equal value, arriving at their own formula for calculating the value of the Pakistani rupee against the Indian rupee. There are other difficulties too. Traders can call their associates on the other side only from three or four designated phone lines in the entire State. This severely restricts their capacity to fix values for consignments, and even to find out what and how much to send. Nor can traders travel freely to assess the needs of the markets on either side.
Despite these restrictions, and evidently driven by the people's yearning to reconnect with the other side of the divided State and the hope of some economic dividend, the trade has grown beyond expectations. At present, a basket of only 21 items — mostly agricultural and horticultural products such as fruit, dried fruit, pulses, and honey — can be traded between the two sides. The trade, routed between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad and Poonch and Rawalakot, takes place only on two designated days of the week. Even so, the average weekly trade is to the tune of Rs.20 crore. It has created new economic opportunities for communities on both sides of the LoC and helped to build trust across. Such linkages offer a good peace-making platform for India and Pakistan on the Kashmir issue. When the two governments sit across the table for talks in the coming weeks, they would do well to discuss measures to ease the restrictions on cross-LoC trade so that it can live up to its true potential as a confidence-building mechanism. Monetising the trade would give it a big boost, and both sides should find a way to do this as soon as possible.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Monetise-cross-LoC-trade/article15453746.ece
22,2,2011,Now for a purposeful JPC,"With the central government at long last conceding the demand for a probe by a joint parliamentary committee into the irregularities in 2G spectrum allocation, no further time should be lost in getting to the bottom of the biggest scam in the history of independent India. The task now is to explore what went wrong at the policy level as well as in implementation, to fix responsibility wherever it belongs, and to present to Parliament and the people the whole truth about how government policy relating to a highly lucrative new sector was hijacked by a nexus among corrupt politicians, conniving or pliable officials, and big business. The JPC will start with an informational advantage: in addition to the breakthrough report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, it can make use of the abundant factual details gathered by the Shivaraj Patil committee, which uncovered serious lapses in the procedures followed by the Department of Telecommunications in issuance of licences and allocation of spectrum during 2001-2009. The report identified by name many of the public officials who, prima facie, appeared responsible for various irregularities in the implementation of laid-down procedures. It also pointed to the lack of fairness and transparency in the affairs of DoT under the watch, or at the instance, of successive Telecom Ministers. If therefore the government wants the terms of reference to include the whole 2001-2009 period, the opposition should have no credible objection. For the Bharatiya Janata Party to ask for the terms of reference to include multiple corruption scandals is pointless. Instead of a comprehensive probe into rising India's most damaging corruption scandal, the nation would then get a focus-less, all-over-the-place exercise.
Those like former Telecom Minister Arun Shourie, who handed over material evidence to the Central Bureau of Investigation, could be of real assistance to the JPC. While the CBI will be watched to see if it pushes hard enough in the criminal investigation and prosecution of the 2G scam, the JPC must empower itself to discover broader and deeper aspects of the truth. All political parties must cooperate to ensure the quick constitution of the high-powered body and the early completion of its probe. Much time has already been lost in the criminal investigation, raising the risk of the trails going cold. Once it is set up, the JPC must set itself clear tasks and goals, work in a time-bound way, and show results. It also needs to be transparent. This is an unusual opportunity for political India to demonstrate to the people that it is serious about rooting out corruption in policymaking and implementation in sensitive areas where temptations and traps abound.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Now-for-a-purposeful-JPC/article15453745.ece
22,2,2011,Big Brother is listening,"Reliance Communication's affidavit in the Supreme Court contained the revelation that authorities had asked the company to tap more than 150,000 phones between 2006 and 2010. That a single service provider was ordered to tap an average of 550 phones a week is shocking. It raises serious questions about how pervasive the phenomenon of phone tapping is and whether it is conducted and monitored in accordance with the law. Phone tapping is legal under the Indian Telegraph Act 1885 and the Information Technology (Amendment) Act 2008. But it is subject to a slew of procedures. Many of them are laid down in a 1997 Supreme Court order, which said that conversations may be intercepted only on certain grounds such as national sovereignty and public order. The court issued directions that tapping conducted on behalf of security agencies must be authorised by the Home Secretary of either the central or State government. It also said that all orders to intercept phones must be reviewed by an oversight committee headed by the Cabinet Secretary to examine if there is a contravention of the law.
Given the intermittent controversies over illegal phone taps, it is doubtful whether these judicial instructions are followed, in letter and spirit. By the Union Home Secretary G.K. Pillai's admission, at any given time, there are 6,000 to 8,000 phones that are legally tapped at the central level and an estimated 10,000 at the State level. This raises two questions. First, is it necessary to tap so many phones? Secondly, given the numbers, is it humanly possible for Home Secretaries or the oversight committee to examine each case with the attention it deserves? The Amar Singh case, in which the former Samajwadi Party leader's phone was tapped on the basis of a forged authorisation, is not a laughing matter. Today, private cellular service providers set up special cells with dedicated servers to intercept phones on behalf of the security agencies. Leaving tapping to private players has resulted in leaked transcripts of calls. The Cabinet Committee on Security has now proposed that the onus of monitoring conversations should be shifted from service providers to the government and that a centralised hub be set up for phone taps. But the problem goes well beyond unauthorised taps by service providers. The government must restore public trust by ensuring that phones are not tapped unless it is absolutely necessary. As the Supreme Court observed, the security of one's privacy against arbitrary intrusion is basic to a free society.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Big-Brother-is-listening/article15453718.ece
23,2,2011,The burning train,"Premeditated conspiracy or accident? Differences of opinion over what caused the death of 59 people, mostly kar sevaks, aboard the Sabarmati Express in 2002 have hinged on this fundamental question. In convicting 31 people in the Godhra train burning case on the twin counts of murder and criminal conspiracy, the Ahmedabad special court has upheld the broad thrust of the prosecution's contention, which is that the deaths were a result of a “pre-planned conspiracy” to set fire to the S-6 coach in which the victims were travelling. The theory that it was an “accidental fire” gained credence after the Justice U.C. Banerjee Committee, appointed by then Railway Minister Lalu Prasad, declared it as such in its preliminary report. It ruled out various other possible causes, including the possibility of the fire being caused by petrol poured into the bogey by miscreants. Although the Gujarat High Court subsequently ruled that the U.C. Banerjee Committee was “unconstitutional, illegal, and void,” the question remained whether forensic evidence would conclusively establish how the fire was caused. In arriving at its verdict, the trial court was evidently greatly influenced by the findings of the Gandhinagar Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), which concluded that petrol was the cause of the fire and submitted evidence that was consistent with the police theory that the culprits had forcibly entered the S-6 coach via the vestibule.
Paradoxically, the court acquitted the main alleged conspirator, Maulana Umarji, for lack of evidence, even as it upheld the prosecution's case that the conspiracy to set fire to the coach carrying the kar sevaks was hatched the previous night at a guest house in Godhra town. The verdict, which saw the acquittal of as many as 63 accused, is bound to be challenged by both sides. It is unfortunate that a case like this, tried by a fast-track court, should have taken nine years to complete, all the more so because many of the 63 acquitted spent years in prison after being denied bail. In the popular imagination, the Godhra train burning will also evoke horrifying memories of the genocidal pogrom against Muslims that earned Gujarat notoriety across India and round the world. The complex verdict must be looked at independently, in strictly legal terms, and not through any coloured political lens; it must certainly not be allowed to be exploited by demagogues of any communal persuasion. Only when the 815-page judgment becomes available will legal experts be able to assess the merits of the verdict, including the evidential basis of the convictions. Given the time already taken, it is important that we have a just and final judicial pronouncement on the case as quickly as possible.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-burning-train/article14741323.ece
23,2,2011,Qadhafi's time is up,"Inspired by the highly successful, and in the circumstances remarkably peaceful, mass uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, Libyans have been demonstrating and protesting throughout their country's major cities. The response by strongman Muammar Qadhafi, who has been in power for 41 years, has been very different from those of his neighbours. While Tunisia's Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia and Egypt's Hosni Mubarak tried and comprehensively failed to stand his ground, Mr. Qadhafi has responded with typically brutal repression. He has used fighter jets and helicopter gunships to attack protesters in the capital, Tripoli; street-level militias of Libyans and imported mercenaries have reportedly fired indiscriminately into crowds and made it impossible for rescuers even to collect bodies. On television, the dictator has even threatened to kill protesters “house by house” and “fight on to the last drop of my blood.” With almost all communications closed down, the death toll cannot be ascertained but foreign rights groups place it at over 200. Other sources report that protesters are in control of Benghazi, Sirte, Tobruk, and several other cities, and that in some places soldiers have left their posts and joined the people.
The mass rebellion expresses nationwide anger over the nature of the state, rather than over deprivation and poverty. In comparison with many other North African and West Asian countries, Libya is well off. It is Africa's fourth largest country, but has a population of only 6.4 million. Huge oil reserves have helped it to achieve the continent's highest Human Development Index and fourth highest GDP in purchasing parity terms. While the Libyan strongman's talent for realpolitik has put Tripoli on the contemporary international map, the politicality of the uprising and the speed of its spread are clearly a major shock to him. Even staff in high institutions of state are expressing open dissent. Libyan diplomats abroad have severely criticised the regime's conduct, using terms like “genocide.” The country's Permanent Mission to the United Nations has defected. Its deputy head states that the Mission represents the Libyan people, not Mr. Qadhafi; the official has also urged the U.N. Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court to investigate Libya. The world body's Security Council has called on Libya to address the legitimate demands of the people, to act with restraint, and to respect human rights. Meanwhile protesters demand a secular interim government comprising the army and representatives of the main tribes. With the rulers unable to rule, and the people not willing to be ruled, as before, surely this is the end of the road for the Qadhafi regime.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Qadhafis-time-is-up/article15455949.ece
23,2,2011,On real Internet freedom,"The United States has restated its commitment to keep the Internet free and make it a bulwark of democracy but, unsurprisingly, there is no chorus of welcome for its fulsome defence of online freedoms. In a recent university address titled “Internet Rights and Wrongs: Choices and Challenges in a Networked World,” Secretary of State Hillary Clinton berated authoritarian regimes and praised the people of Tunisia and Egypt for using digital tools to organise democratic protests. In the future, she said, America would partner civil society and governments and even fund technologists to protect the open Internet. This second assertion of net freedoms in two years should have impressed many but it did not — and with good reason. As the WikiLeaks episode makes clear, U.S. policy is deeply flawed by the contradiction of espousing an open Internet, and in parallel, working to prevent inconvenient disclosures. At the time Ms Clinton was underscoring high opportunity costs for countries which filter or shut down the Internet, the U.S. administration was pursuing legal action to arm-twist Twitter, the very website that she was praising for helping frustrated citizens of the Arab world. U.S. government officials are seeking court orders to compel Twitter to hand over personal details, including private messages, of Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, Bradley Manning, the detained American soldier, and Birgitta Jonsdottir, a member of Iceland's parliament.
To praise the Internet for aiding truth-telling and, in the same breath, dismiss the discussion on free speech for websites such as WikiLeaks as a “false debate” is hypocritical. It can be credibly argued that the simmering discontent in Tunisia exploded in public anger when WikiLeaks published the cables on the U.S. ambassador's assessment of corruption by President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. The Tunisian uprising, then, was triggered by the WikiLeaks revelations, and fanned by the Internet. In a more connected world the key question before the U.S. is to define confidentiality. The less of it, the better. For the media, and by extension the Internet, the decision to publish secrets is not a difficult one. The judicial position on the Pentagon Papers on Vietnam, refusing to grant prior restraint on publication of classified documents, serves as a clear guide. This unambiguous principle should underpin free speech online in the era of WikiLeaks. There is absolutely no evidence to show that the whistleblower website endangered lives. Through all the controversy, the media have done well to strengthen their oversight mechanism and redact sensitive information. As a tireless advocate of ‘democracy,' the U.S. needs to believe in its own assertions on unfettered free speech and stop introducing self-serving double standards.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/On-real-Internet-freedom/article15454902.ece
23,2,2011,Museveni wins again,"Uganda's longstanding leader, Yoweri Museveni, has won a fourth elected term, taking 68 per cent of the vote to the 26 per cent scored by his nearest challenger, Kizza Besigye of the Forum for Democratic Change. Including the 10 years the incumbent had as President after overthrowing Milton Obote in 1986, this will take his unbroken time in office to over 30 years. The result is consistent with prior polls, but the conduct of the election was problematic in several ways. The country has no independent election commission, and potential donors to opposition parties were discouraged by a climate of intimidation. Private radio stations refused some candidates airtime that had been paid for in advance, and the Commonwealth Observer Group has expressed concerns about the use of money and official positions for campaign purposes. In the last 15 years, furthermore, corruption has spread; thousands of lives have been lost in a partially successful war against the Lord's Resistance Army, with both sides using child soldiers; and one in three of the 34 million population still lives on $1.25 or less a day. The Ugandan army have also been accused of systematic brutality and of plundering resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The President himself has shown no embarrassment over other controversies too. In 2006, he abolished the constitutional two-term limit. Elections within his own party, the National Resistance Movement, have been marred by many allegations of vote-rigging.
Rural voters, however, backed Mr. Museveni strongly on the day, which suggests that to them his political contribution to rural stability outweighs the fact that for other voters he has long lost the shine of his early achievements. Those included rebuilding a country with bitter memories of Idi Amin's dictatorship and the two decades of civil war that followed it. Uganda also led Africa in addressing the AIDS epidemic. The defeated Mr. Besigye, the President's former personal physician, says he will not challenge the results in court, and his followers have not responded to his call for public protests. A lot is at stake, not least because the recent discovery of an estimated one billion barrels of oil in the Lake Albert Basin promises any government in Kampala greater international leverage. Mr. Museveni is relatively free from accusations of personal enrichment, and Ugandan voters have shown a degree of practical judgment throughout the election, both in keeping the polls peaceful and in making their decisions at the ballot booths.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Museveni-wins-again/article15454903.ece
24,2,2011,The killer aftershock,"Barely six months after Christchurch, New Zealand's second largest city, was struck by a 7 magnitude earthquake, the city was the target of another quake of 6.3 magnitude on Tuesday. This one, the sixth aftershock of last year's tremor, turned out to be a killer. Prime Minister John Key has warned that the total number of deaths will almost certainly exceed 200: the confirmed death toll is 98 and 226 people are still reported missing. This makes it the country's deadliest quake in the last 80 years. The tremor of September 4, 2010 damaged buildings but, mercifully, did not kill anybody. Though the February 22 aftershock was nearly ten times weaker, many died as the epicentre was very close to the city; last year's was about 45 km west of Christchurch. The shallow focus of the aftershock was another reason. Occurring at a depth of about 5 km from the surface, it struck the city hard. The September quake was at a depth of about 10 km from the surface. According to Nature, the earthquake had a directional thrust towards the surface, and “the amount of acceleration felt at the epicentre was almost 1.9 times the force of gravity.”
There was another factor that played an important role in accentuating the shaking process of buildings. Unlike many other quake-prone regions around the world, Christchurch sits atop loosely packed soil. The sand, silt, and gravel that make up the soil, when saturated with groundwater, behave more like a liquid than a solid during earthquakes. The liquefaction repacks the soil to make it compact and denser, and in the process leads to subsidence in some areas. Differential subsidence at the site of buildings can adversely affect the structures, causing walls to crack and even collapse. The February 22 quake typifies the fact that magnitude alone does not determine the killer nature of a tremor. While such a lethal combination would have proved catastrophic in a developing country, buildings in Christchurch faced relatively less damage with fewer deaths. This is primarily because structures in New Zealand are designed and built in compliance with one of the best building codes in the world. Such codes have become necessary as New Zealand is located in one of the most tectonically active regions. It is at the margin of a subduction zone where the Australian plate overrides the diving Pacific plate northeast from the North Island to Samoa. It suddenly changes to become a transform fault south of the North Island where the Australian and Pacific plates move past each other without one diving under the other. Additionally, a third major fault called the Alpine Fault runs along the South Island itself. Under the circumstances, New Zealand has done well not to let Nature wreak greater devastation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-killer-aftershock/article15457096.ece
24,2,2011,Partnership for the deep waters,"The BP-Reliance Industries (RIL) partnership announced on Monday is significant in many ways. Its very size makes it one of the largest foreign direct investments in the country and by far the largest in the hydrocarbon sector. BP will initially invest $7.2 billion for a 30 per cent stake in each of the 23 blocks of oil and gas controlled by RIL. With performance-related payments of up to $1.8 billion and other investments by BP, the deal could be worth as much as $20 billion. BP will contribute to a better exploitation of the 23 blocks, only one of which is now in production. All of them lie offshore, mainly off India's east coast and at depths ranging from 400 metres to more than 3,000 metres. BP's proven expertise in deep water exploration, more than its ability to invest huge sums of money, has been the major attraction for RIL. The BP-RIL partnership also envisages a 50-50 joint venture for the outsourcing and marketing of gas in India. Clearly the focus of the new venture is on supplying the domestic market where natural gas counts for a small but growing share of energy consumption. Reliance, though a strong player in the upstream business, should still benefit from the partnership with BP.
For BP, the deal with RIL marks a new stage in its recovery from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill which cost it an estimated $20 billion to settle the clean up and related claims besides being an inestimably large public relations disaster. That, along with a belief that the epicentre of the natural gas industry — both production and consumption — is shifting to the emerging markets, has driven the company to conclude mega deals in these countries with significant domestic players. The BP-RIL deal closely follows a $16 billion share swap deal with Rosneft, a Russian government-owned company. The investment by BP is a reaffirmation by global investors of India's potential and capacity to grow at a fast pace. Deals such as this should help reverse the recent declining trend in foreign direct investment. India could do even better by infusing consistency and transparency in the regulatory process governing key sectors. Foreign investors are apt to read wrong signals from the stalling of the London-listed Vedanta's efforts to buy the Indian assets of Cairn Energy. Again, it was the opaque pricing policies relating to natural gas that was one of the key factors behind the well-publicised legal battle between the two Ambani brothers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Partnership-for-the-deep-waters/article15457093.ece
25,2,2011,Mamata's populist budget,"Mamata Banerjee's third Railway budget in UPA-II contains few surprises: full of populist symbolism and sops but weak in substance. She made it clear to Parliament that the Indian Railways was passing through a very difficult phase financially but has failed to come up with any credible solution. With elections to the West Bengal Assembly round the corner, there was no question of the leader of the anti-Left coalition altering the fare structure. As the freight rates were raised a couple of months ago, she has left them untouched. Nevertheless, she proposed an increase in the annual plan outlay, from just over Rs.40,000 crore in the current year to Rs.57,630 crore in 2011-2012. This would involve a market borrowing of Rs.20,000 crore. The opposition, especially the Left parties and Ms Banarjee's predecessor in the Railway Ministry, Lalu Prasad, were quick to point out that the implementation record of the Railway Minister has left a lot to be desired. The truth is that most of the projects she announced in the last budget and a number of others under execution have failed to get the budgetary support necessary for early completion. Ms Banerjee's response to her critics is the proposal to set up a Central Organisation for Project Implementation, with four regional offices, to keep a tab on progress.
Making no bones about her preference for her home State, Ms Banerjee announced a metro coach factory in Singur and a Rail Industrial Park in Nandhigram district — two areas where her party, the Trinamool Congress, launched violent agitations, allying with extremists, to prevent major private industries from coming up. In addition, the Kolkata Metro is set for expansion and more services. In keeping with recent trends, Ms Banerjee has lowered the eligibility age for women from 60 to 58 years to avail themselves of the fare concession for senior citizens, besides increasing the concession rate from 30 per cent to 40 per cent for both men and women. A special package is on the anvil for the North Eastern region, with a mission to connect all these States except Sikkim in seven years. The proposal to develop an integrated suburban railway network for Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Ahmedabad is welcome. The really worrying aspect is the worsening operating ratio — which indicates how much the Railways spend to earn Rs.100 — to 92.1. For the Railways to be considered healthy enough, this figure should be in the 70s. If Nitish Kumar laid the foundation for the turnaround of the Railways, Mr. Lalu Prasad presided over the best years. What can Ms Banerjee claim at the end of the day?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mamatas-populist-budget/article15458449.ece
25,2,2011,Lessons from the kidnapping,"On Thursday evening, Maoist insurgents freed an upstanding public servant, Ravella Vineel Krishna, whom they had kidnapped and held hostage in a densely forested area near Jantapai village in Orissa's Malkangiri district. The State government had no choice but to accept 14 Maoist demands as the price for sparing the lives of the Malkangiri District Collector and junior engineer Pabitra Majhi, who had been abducted along with him, in the Papermetla panchayat. Thursday's release brought the curtain down on a tense drama that held the nation's attention for eight days. The Orissa administration as well as political leadership showed astuteness in handling the evolving situation. No less commendable was the role played by the three mediators, R.S. Rao, G. Haragopal, and Dandapani Mohanty, in narrowing the gap and paving the way for the releases. In the end, the episode raised civic morale by showing how people rally behind a dedicated, empathetic, and hard-working public servant. Mr. Krishna is possibly the only Collector to visit the tribal villages around the Balimela project, officially called ‘cut-off' areas as they are highly inaccessible. His willingness to move into these ‘Maoist strongholds' without any security, to implement development programmes, and to evaluate the development process with an open mind, rekindles hope about the integrity and efficacy of India's civil service, whose reputation has come under a cloud in recent times.
After this experience, Orissa would do well not to adopt the ‘battalion approach' of deploying a huge number of security force personnel for counter-insurgency operations. Such macho responses are guaranteed to be counter-productive. Instead, the government must reach out to the ‘cut-off' areas and take up developmental programmes — even if they are the ones the extremists suggested in their apparently earnest discussion with their captive, Mr. Krishna, on the nature of development. The spontaneous tribal rallies in these ‘cut-off' areas demanding Mr. Krishna's release should make the Maoists think twice before employing the tactic of hostage-taking again. Apart from honourably implementing the promises made on the release of jailed Maoist leaders and the withdrawal of cases against tribals, the State government must initiate processes for the speedy and effective rehabilitation of tribal people displaced by the Balimela reservoir and Nalco projects. One does not need a Kalashnikov-holding Maoist to highlight people's problems. There is no dearth of funds and there are other civil servants like Mr. Krishna, may his tribe increase. Sagacity lies in encouraging such officials and replicating their initiatives in the remotest parts of this vast country.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Lessons-from-the-kidnapping/article15458446.ece
27,2,2011,Cautiously optimistic,"The Economic Survey 2010-11 is positive on the macroeconomy without glossing over the challenges. The economy's resilience is seen in its ability to withstand two shocks in quick succession. The ripple effects of the global economic crisis (2007-09) that devastated world growth, trade, and finances have persisted in the form of the European fiscal crisis. On the domestic front, the farm sector that saw a negative growth in 2008-09 was further hit by erratic monsoons, severe drought, and unseasonal rains in two successive years. Despite this, the economy is poised to grow at rates seen during the pre-crisis period. On top of an estimated 8.6 per cent growth during the current year, the economy is projected to grow at 9 per cent during 2011-12. The optimistic forecasts as well as the downside risks are in line with the assessment of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council. The services sector, for long “the power house of the economy”, with a more than 57 per cent share of the GDP in 2009-10, has started gaining momentum. That should augur well for the medium term growth prospects. Another favourable feature is that India's demographic dividend is yet to peak. The growing trend in savings and investment rates should benefit from the gradual withdrawal of stimulus measures by the government. In a message that could be a pointer to the strategy in the Budget, the Survey notes that once the economy operates around full capacity, it is not the savings and investment rates that will drive growth but skills development and innovation.
The major downside risks to growth are weather, a disproportionate spike in petroleum prices, and a slowdown in the advanced economies. Inflation and a large current account deficit are major concerns. The Survey cautions that higher growth and a faster monetisation of the economy, through financial inclusion, may mean increased money supply and hence more inflationary pressures. It has recommended a phased entry of foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail, apparently in response to the concerns of farmers and consumers. That should also add to stable capital flows. Given its upbeat tone on growth, the Finance Minister is expected to meet the fiscal targets. As part of its reform agenda, the Survey calls for a streamlining of land acquisition and environment clearance procedures, using smart cards to target subsidy payments and issuance of basic banking licences. There should be an unrelenting thrust on infrastructure development. None of these is new or visionary but the Survey has stressed the doable and underlined the priorities in a way that demonstrates pragmatism.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Cautiously-optimistic/article15461158.ece
27,2,2011,Cutting plastic waste,"The Plastic Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2011 notified by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, should be viewed by State governments and municipal authorities as a good blueprint for a much-needed civic clean-up. The Central Pollution Control Board estimates the consumption of plastic products in India to be of the order of eight million tonnes a year. This ranges from shopping bags to household and industrial material. The volume of plastic waste is approximately 15,300 tonnes a day. It is welcome, therefore, that the new rules take into account the significant growth in waste generation, predominantly in the form of carry bags and multi-layered packaging, and call for a paradigm shift in the way it is collected, sorted, and disposed of. What is perhaps most significant is the formal recognition given to waste pickers in the management chain. As Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh has suggested, these labourers, now largely in the informal sector, must be constructively engaged by municipal authorities. Other laudable aspects of the rules include the stipulation of benchmarked Indian Standards for recycling facilities, mandatory pricing of consumer carry bags given by retailers, a labelling scheme, and introduction of extended producer responsibility for manufacturers to fund the creation of collection centres. The importance given to compostable plastics — defined as material that can be degraded through biological processes yielding carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds and biomass residue — can potentially reduce the use of traditional plastics.
Municipal authorities and State pollution control boards must use the momentum provided by the new rules to move away from business as usual on waste management. It is apparent that urban India has been a laggard in implementing the Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000, defeating the objective of the Environment (Protection) Act under which they were made. The new rules on plastics can help solve a major part of the national garbage crisis. Municipal corporations and other local bodies are obligated to ensure that the waste is properly segregated and recycled. They have little to fear by way of financial burden, as the cost of plastics use is to be borne by the producers and consumers. Implementing the provisions will have a salutary effect on the ecology of cities and towns where uncollected plastic waste clogs stormwater drains, rivers, and lakes. Moreover, the revised technical specifications for carry bags should make them attractive to recyclers as they will be thicker at 40 microns, up from 20 microns. Resolute action must follow.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Cutting-plastic-waste/article15461157.ece
28,2,2011,A lacklustre budget,"Bereft of any big idea and with its focus on minutiae, the budget presented by Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee disappoints as a political response to the perception of drift and the succession of scams that have emerged in the recent period. The Finance Minister has addressed desultorily three of the four problematical areas of political corruption, the play of unaccounted money in both the economy and the political system, Indian money stashed away in foreign accounts, and high inflation. He has been content with listing the ongoing efforts of the government in detecting and bringing back the money held in illegal foreign accounts, including negotiating tax information exchange agreements and double taxation avoidance treaties, its participation in international moves against tax havens, and the commissioning of a study on unaccounted income and wealth. Among the areas the group of ministers on corruption is examining are state funding of elections, the removal of the discretionary powers of government, and putting in place a competitive system of allocation of natural resources. Only on food inflation has the Finance Minister announced new initiatives and investments to increase the supply of specific food items such as edible oil, vegetables, pulses, and milk.
While the budget seems oblivious to the political context, on the positive side it will facilitate continuing high growth that is projected at 9 per cent for 2011-12. Its revenue-neutral character, the concessions in personal income tax and in corporate tax even if marginal, measures to boost investments in infrastructure and agriculture, the promise of pushing through reform legislation — including the constitutional amendment on the goods and services tax (GST), laws on insurance and pension funds and the new direct tax code — and information technology initiatives to streamline tax administration and the delivery of public services have had a positive impact on business sentiment. The introduction of an integrated GST will be a major move that will bring efficiency gains to the economy as a whole but there is still some way to go before all the States can be persuaded to get on board. The raising of the exemption limit for personal income tax from Rs.1,60,000 to Rs.1,80,000 has brought some cheer, even if it has fallen short of expectations. The lowering of the surcharge on corporate tax from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent has boosted market sentiment, as have customs and excise duty concessions to specific industries. To raise revenue and also in preparation for the introduction of GST, the service tax net has been widened to include high-end medical and legal services even while retaining the rate at 10 per cent.
The budget has provided for significantly larger outlays on education, health, women and children, affordable housing, the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, and minorities. Overall social sector spending at Rs.1,60,887 crore will be 17 per cent more than last year, with the outlay on education rising by 24 per cent and on health by 20 per cent. The big idea of food security that was announced in the last budget is still to be operationalised with differences having cropped up between the National Advisory Council and the government on the target group, extent of coverage, and the estimates of the outlays that will be called for. One hopes that this very worthwhile programme will be finalised and put in place over the next few months. Mr. Mukherjee has announced the replacement of the present system of kerosene, LPG, and fertilizer subsidies by direct transfers of cash subsidies to people below the poverty line. It is true that in some contexts, typically in Latin America, direct cash transfers have transformed the delivery system, eliminated leakages, and ensured that the beneficiaries receive the full amount of the subsidy. But serious apprehensions have been expressed by progressive economists that in India, considering the extent of mass deprivation and the actual experience, cash transfers are becoming a substitute for — and even an excuse for weakening — the public provision of essential goods and services.
On the face of it, the government seems to be comfortably placed on the path to fiscal consolidation. The overall fiscal deficit is projected to come down from 5.1 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the current year to 4.6 per cent in 2011-12. With adjustments to exclude the capital expenditure incurred by the States out of the transfers from the Centre, the ‘effective' revenue deficit is expected to come down from 2.3 per cent of the GDP to 1.8 per cent. Yet, holding down the fiscal deficit may not turn out to be as easy as it is made to sound. If last year there was a bonanza from 3G spectrum auctions that provided headroom for higher spending, the Finance Minister has proposed to raise Rs. 40,000 crore through disinvestment in public sector units in 2011-12 even while holding out the assurance that the government will not relinquish majority stake or management control. In addition to the uncertainty over disinvestment, a major question remains over the impact of the food security legislation. Even on the limited scale that the government wants to launch it, an annual outlay of Rs.68,539 crore (or an additional Rs.11,500 crore over the current food subsidy) would be required. Another imponderable is the trend in crude prices that have risen sharply in recent weeks. Persistent high prices will leave the government with three difficult choices: increasing the retail prices of petrol and diesel, reducing the duties on petroleum products, and forgoing revenue or subsidising the under-recoveries of the oil marketing companies. Overall, it is not a budget that is calculated to capture the imagination of the country even as it has sought to maintain the growth momentum through minor tinkering. Many of the promised measures are not specific enough and are as yet for the future.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-lacklustre-budget/article14930318.ece
29,2,2011,Right by birth: On daughters and Hindu succession act,"The latest decision of the Supreme Court on the right of Hindu daughters to ancestral property corrects an obvious anomaly in the interpretation of a crucial 2005 amendment to the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. The verdict settles the question whether the coparcenary right of daughters comes into effect only if the father through whom they claim that right was alive on the day the amendment came into force. The apex court has now categorically ruled that the daughters’ right flows from their birth and not by any other factor such as the existence of their fathers. In other words, it has rejected the common misinterpretation that only daughters of coparceners who were alive on that day could get an equal share in property. The court has rightly recognised that the amendment conferred equal status as a coparcener on daughters in Hindu families governed by Mitakshara law, and this right accrued by birth. The change came into effect from September 9, 2005, but with a provision that partitions or testamentary disposition that had taken place prior to December 20, 2004 — the date on which the amendment Bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha — will remain valid and unaffected by the change. This led to the interpretation that the daughters’ coparcenary rights, being prospective, would not come into effect unless both the coparcener father and his daughter were alive on September 9, 2005. This position was crystallised in a 2015 judgment of the Supreme Court in Prakash and Others vs. Phulavati. This judgment now stands overruled.
The court’s reasoning is unexceptionable. First, it locates the origin of the coparcenary right in one’s birth. Second, it finds that there is no necessity for a predecessor coparcener to be alive for one to acquire that status, as what is relevant is birth within the degrees of succession to which it extends. In that sense, the legislation, even though it comes into effect on a prescribed date, is retroactive in its application as it is linked to birth, an antecedent event. It also underscores that the legislation makes it clear that the daughter’s rights are the same “as that of a son,” and “as if she had been a son at the time of birth”. The coparcenary status given to daughters has been a subject of reform in many States, particularly in south India, long before the UPA regime brought in the amendment for the whole country. Kerala had introduced legislation in 1975, Andhra Pradesh in 1986, Tamil Nadu in 1989 and Maharashtra and Karnataka in 1994. The legislative aim was that a flagrant discrimination between sons and daughters in entitlement to an equal share in coparcenary property, that is property inherited from one’s father, grandfather or great-grandfather, should be done away with. It is indeed welcome that the apex court has sought to give full effect to this intent by setting at rest doubts arising from varying interpretations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/right-by-birth-the-hindu-editorial-on-daughters-and-hindu-succession-act/article32347299.ece
29,2,2011,Historic ratification: On universal ratification of a labour standard,"The welcome decision by the Kingdom of Tonga to outlaw the worst forms of child labour is the first time in the International Labour Organization (ILO)’s 101-year history that a labour standard has been universally ratified. Convention 182, which was adopted in the 1999 annual international labour conference, prohibits the sexual exploitation of children, trafficking, deployment in armed conflict and other conditions that compromise their overall well-being. The Convention complements the ILO’s efforts under the 1973 Minimum Age Convention to prevent the employment of children below a lower age threshold. Under the influence of both these ILO standards, millions of young boys and girls have been rescued from hazardous conditions of work. Concomitantly, these have resulted in significant increases in enrolments in primary education. The landmark ratification, however, does not detract from the enormity of the challenge that remains. An estimated 152 million are trapped in child labour and 72 million of them are engaged in hazardous work. If anything, current efforts would have to be stepped up significantly to achieve the ambitious goal of total abolition of the scourge of child labour by 2025. But the COVID-19 pandemic is threatening a reversal of recent gains, with widespread job losses, deterioration in conditions of work, decline in household incomes and temporary school closures.
The historic first universal ratification of a global labour standard may be an occasion for celebration; it is nonetheless a moment for sober reflection. The two instruments on child labour are among the eight core ILO Conventions regarded as embodying the spirit of the 1998 declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work. Instruments relating to the freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining and the elimination of discrimination in employment and occupation are among the others. These conventions provide the necessary framework to counteract the predominance of informality in the conditions of work and ought to be a priority for governments. Though belated, India has signalled its legal commitment to the elimination of child labour with its 2017 ratification of Convention 182 and the instrument prescribing the minimum age of work for children. As the world prepares to designate 2021 as the year to abolish child labour, governments must seize the moment to instil hope in the future generations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/historic-ratification-the-hindu-editorial-on-universal-ratification-of-a-labour-standard/article32347515.ece
1,3,2011,Spare a thought for cricket's fans,"The rumble of discontent near ticket counters at cricketing venues across India has reached a tipping point during this World Cup. The unseemly incident at Bangalore's Chinnaswamy Stadium where the police were forced to intervene after a restless crowd broke through the barricades wasn't surprising: with just 7,500 tickets (in a stadium with a capacity of 38,000) open to the public, it was only natural that fans would feel short-changed. Not that this feeling of discontent is likely to register any time soon with the controllers of cricket. For long, India's cricket administrators have been insensitive to the common fan, whose passion has fuelled the game's astonishing growth. The point made by an apologetic Javagal Srinath, secretary of the Karnataka State Cricket Association, that the system hasn't changed is at once truthful and dispiriting. The hyper-commercialisation of cricket, while benefiting those who run and play it, has disenfranchised the paying public. With gate collections bringing in an insignificant fraction of the money that telecast rights do, the game has been taken away from the people.
To be fair, every host association has its commitments: it has to allocate a share of its tickets to the game's governing bodies and associates ranging from the BCCI to sponsors. This apart, the five-star style hospitality boxes, while bringing in big revenue to the host association, have resulted in a loss of seating capacity. What is more, politicians, bureaucrats, police, and civic agencies partake of the shrinking pie. In global events such as the World Cup, the shortage is aggravated by the fact that the ICC has the ‘right of first refusal' for a percentage of the tickets. The Bangalore episode may have also had something to do with the pre-booking of tickets — the match between India and England was originally scheduled to be held at Kolkata. While it is true that the demand for tickets will far outstrip the supply for matches involving India, the game's administrators can't use it as an excuse to exclude the common fan. Reform is needed — and a start must be made by improving the viewing experience of those who do make it through the turnstiles. For all the enhancement of stadia across the country, watching a match remains an ordeal in many centres. The limitations on bringing food and drink to the ground are draconian — no one deserves to be subjected to standing in long queues for overpriced, mediocre refreshments. The hygiene and accessibility of restrooms need remedying as well. Fans who come to watch the game live are stakeholders who must be treated decently. Cricket cannot be allowed to become just a television game.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Spare-a-thought-for-crickets-fans/article14932720.ece
1,3,2011,The King rules the Oscars,"To no one's surprise, The King's Speech swept the major categories at the 83rd Annual Academy Awards. Crafted with a faultless restraint, the emotionally compelling story about the battle of Prince Albert (later King George VI) to overcome a nervous stammer bagged Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Colin Firth), Best Director (Tom Hooper), and Original Screenplay (David Seidler). The only major category the film did not win was the one for which it was not nominated — Best Actress. As the Duchess of York, Helena Bonham Carter plays at best a supporting turn. The other major acting role is played by Geoffrey Rush who, as the maverick speech therapist practising in Harley Street, strikes up an unlikely friendship with his royal patient as progress is made to control and eventually overcome the stammering. Rush failed to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor but his loopy, eccentric ways brings out the best in Colin Firth who, apart from maintaining a convincing stammer, expertly captures the inner turmoil of a man whose royalty imposes a suffocating weight of expectancy and decorum on a natural and tumultuous rage.
That the The King's Speech was the runaway favourite to sweep the Oscars was a tribute to a charming feel-good period drama supported by some truly fine acting. But it also reflects the Academy's continued preference for emotionally resonant stories over other genres. Did not Slumdog Millionaire sweep the 2009 Academy Awards, trumping The Reader in a contest perceived by some critics to be between populism and serious art? Oscar history is littered with such instances. In 1976, the conventional boxing feature Rocky won over Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, a film which all but redefined urban noir. Much earlier, the feel-good mining-town tearjerker How Green Was My Valley overcame Citizen Kane, which shaped cinematography as we know it today. This year's nominations for Best Picture had some serious challengers. There was The Social Network, the hip and emotionally detached biopic of the founder of Facebook. And there was the fabulous Black Swan, an edgy psychological thriller about a retiring ballerina — performed with extraordinary intensity by Natalie Portman (Best Actress) — who is haunted by hallucination and who rages at her repression. Edgy and challenging works of art rarely trump feel-good films at the Oscars. The King's Speech was by no means an undeserving winner. It's just that the Oscars may have been unkind to other deserving nominees, something that is perhaps unavoidable in a competition of this kind. Almost certainly, time will be kind — in fact, much kinder — to them.

2,3,2011,The summer stakes,"Elections to the Legislative Assemblies in four States and a Union Territory are set to send temperatures soaring through April-May. While Tamil Nadu and Kerala, as also Puducherry, will this time have single-phase polling, Assam will do it in two phases, as in 2006. West Bengal will, however, have the process in six phases. It has 294 constituencies, the largest number among the States in the fray. But as the Election Commission indicated, the stretching stems also from a perception of major law and order challenges. In truth, this reading can only derive from depredations by Maoist elements — thriving in a climate of political collaboration with the Trinamool Congress and, indirectly, with its ally, the Congress. Significantly, the ruling Left Front in the State has welcomed the decision to spread out polling. In its 34th consecutive year in power in eastern India's largest State, the CPI(M)-led Left Front has reason to be proud of its long-term record of governance in key areas, above all land reform. The 2009 Lok Sabha election in the State dealt the Left a severe blow, exposing an eroded base, and it remains to be seen whether anything has changed since then. In any case, given the animosities and the ideological intensity of the battle in this State, the Election Commission of India faces a major test this time. This calls for a heightened level of preparedness, anticipation, and monitoring.
The challenge will be of a different character in Tamil Nadu. Here the Election Commission's carefully structured machinery, which includes observers and micro-observers, will have its task cut out in checking the play of money power, muscle power, and misuse of the administrative machinery and the police. In a clever populist gambit, the DMK government managed to reduce the sales tax on petrol just before the Model Code of Conduct kicked in, although the next day its ongoing scheme of distributing free TV sets was ordered stopped. Assam will witness relatively peaceful conditions on the ground this time, with the United Liberation Front of Asom engaging in talks with the government. Given the political culture, Kerala elections rarely face law and order problems worth the name. This is the first time non-resident Indians will be able to exercise the franchise, provided they are in India. There are other issues that wait to be addressed and resolved, which the Election Commission and other bodies have broadly grouped under the head of electoral reform. There is also the challenge of preventing, and cracking down on, the vice of ‘paid news,' which came to the fore in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections. How the media conduct themselves this time, and how the Election Commission goes about rooting out this shameful corruption of journalism and the democratic process, will be watched with keen interest.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-summer-stakes/article14932633.ece
2,3,2011,New thrust on infrastructure,"The very large infrastructure deficit is a major constraint on faster economic growth and the Finance Minister was expected to focus sharply on infrastructure development and financing. An investment of about $1 trillion will be required for infrastructure development during the Twelfth Five-Year plan period (2012-17), almost double the amount the current plan is expected to mobilise. The latest budget's move towards fiscal consolidation — the deficit is expected to come down to 4.6 per cent — should ensure a greater availability of funds for the private sector. The outlay for infrastructure has been stepped up by 23.3 per cent in 2011-12 to Rs.214,000 crore, which is 48.5 per cent of the plan expenditure. Infrastructure funding is expected to get a fillip in other ways too. The Finance Minister has opened several avenues for the flow of foreign capital. The permission given to SEBI-approved mutual funds to accept subscription by foreign institutional investors (FII) should boost overseas investment in Indian companies including those engaged in infrastructure projects. To be specific, the ceiling on FII investment in infrastructure bonds has been raised to $25 billion from $5 billion and the overall limit for corporate bonds to $40 billion. FIIs can also invest in unlisted bonds with a minimum lock-in period of three years. Notified infrastructure-dedicated debt funds will attract withholding tax of 5 per cent, instead of 20 per cent as now. As a result of these measures, the corporate bond market may well emerge as an alternative to bank finance for funding infrastructure projects.
Individual Income Tax payers can continue to claim, for one more year, a deduction of Rs.20,000 by investing in select infrastructure bonds. Leading public sector companies engaged in a range of physical infrastructure activities will issue those bonds. The power sector, which has been a laggard, will be able to attract a larger share of investments. The excise duty exemptions on supplies to mega and ultra-mega projects would place domestic equipment manufacturers on a par with foreign suppliers. These and other measures will considerably enhance the flow of funds to infrastructure. However, the infrastructure deficit is attributed equally, if not more, to delays and failures in implementing them. Major governance issues have arisen even in those public-private partnerships (PPP) that are hailed as big successes. A comprehensive policy on PPPs both at the Central and State levels is overdue.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/New-thrust-on-infrastructure/article14931507.ece
3,3,2011,A severe indictment,"By quashing the appointment of P.J. Thomas as Central Vigilance Commissioner, the Supreme Court has brought to a dignified end a shameful episode that highlighted the United Progressive Alliance government's lack of respect for institutional integrity. The verdict is a serious indictment of the government at the highest level because the selection of Mr. Thomas was made by a panel that included the Prime Minister and the Union Home Minister. Adding further force to the severity of the blow is the fact that these two members had overruled what, in the final analysis, turned out to be a valid objection by the third member, the Leader of the Opposition. From the beginning of this litigation, it was clear to everyone but the Manmohan Singh regime that it was defending the indefensible, and that Mr. Thomas, who has been charge sheeted in a corruption case, could not have been made the country's premier watchdog against corruption. Moreover, he had been Telecommunications Secretary just prior to his appointment as CVC. This raised doubt about the impartiality of his supervisory role over the Central Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating the 2G spectrum allocation scam. Yet, with a chutzpah that has now become a hallmark of this ruling coalition — a quality displayed brazenly until judicial intervention jolts it back to its legal senses — the appointment was sought to be justified before the court. The government compounded the amorality of its position by resorting to the legally untenable contention that even the absence of “the full facts” concerning Mr. Thomas before the High Powered Committee did not vitiate the appointment.
By declaring the appointment non est in law, the highest court in the land has served a reminder to the executive that it is not enough to have an institutional mechanism for high appointments but that it should be allowed to function in a credible manner. Mr. Thomas has maintained all along that the conspiracy charge against him in a corruption case — dating back to the 1990s and relating to the import of palmolein by a Congress-led government in Kerala — was a by-product of political rivalry. It is a fact that the proceedings in the trial court were stayed for years by the Supreme Court and revived only recently, following the death of former Chief Minister K. Karunakaran, a co-accused who had obtained the stay. Mr. Thomas will get the benefit of due process and nothing connected with the unsavoury circumstances of his appointment as CVC can be allowed to weaken his defence in the case. However, there is little doubt that he leaves his office with the taint of having clung on to his chair in the face of grave doubts about his suitability, embarrassing questions from the judiciary, and damage to the institution of CVC.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-severe-indictment/article1506914.ece
3,3,2011,Change at the till,"A generation that enjoyed the value of paisa coins will feel a tinge of nostalgia as they shed their hoard of small change over the next four months. The call-in of coins with a face value of 25 paise and less and their planned demonetisation with effect from July 1, 2011 only reflects the changed currency use pattern across all sections of society today. With rupee losing its purchasing power, commerce was already beginning to cold-shoulder the paisa; for the government, the cost-benefit factors involved in minting and keeping them in circulation were strong enough to push for their demonetisation. It is unclear how many of the coins are still actually around. According to the Reserve Bank of India's books, at the end of March 2010, there were 54,738 million “small coins” (which, by definition, include the 50 paisa), adding up to Rs.1,455 crore. The demonetisation of what is virtually “dead money” will enable the RBI to issue currency notes or coins for an equivalent amount as replacement in the monetary system. Should a significant amount of the coins tumble out of jars and piggy banks, the handling of the mountain of small change will turn out to be a challenge for the banking system. But how much of it will surface is a moot question.
There has been concern over whether the consequent rounding off of bills to 50 paise or a rupee at the till would add to inflationary pressures. It will, but its effect can only be marginal. It is for the first time since India shifted to the decimal system in 1957 that coins are being demonetised on such a scale. In the past decades, the worth of the metal content in coins has often surpassed their face value, encouraging their melting for other uses. The ferritic stainless steel coinage of contemporary issue and the aluminium-magnesium coinage introduced in 1964, in place of the nickel and cupro-nickel ‘naya paisa' series introduced in 1957, faced the same risk eventually. The minting of 1, 2, 3 and 5 paise coins was phased out in the 1970s, and they have virtually disappeared from currency — even as 10, 20 and 25 paisa coins have become scarce. And rupee coins of 1, 2, 5 and 10 denominations have come since the 1990s in growing numbers. So, time is finally running out for small change. Only four months are left for people to rustle up their coins and take them to the bank for exchange. It is possible that the exercise will excite more interest among coin collectors than the general public.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Change-at-the-till/article14932771.ece
4,3,2011,Under-estimated outlays,"The latest budget accords high priority to fiscal consolidation at the Centre and in the States. The Finance Minister has noted that the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act 2003 (FRBM) at the Centre and the corresponding acts in the States have had a salutary effect on macroeconomic management. During this session, the government wants to introduce an amendment to the FRBM Act, laying down the fiscal road map for the next five years. This is unexceptionable and in line with the policy decision already taken. What, however, has evoked a great deal of interest and a fair amount of scepticism, is the level of deficit reduction achieved as well as the government's optimistic projections for the next year. In what is seen as the sharpest ever fiscal correction attempted by any government in two decades, the fiscal deficit, which is estimated at 5.1 per cent of the GDP this year, is proposed to be brought down further to 4.6 per cent next year. Since successive governments have, as a rule, under-performed on fiscal consolidation, the planned reduction in deficit appears to be nothing short of the spectacular. The 2010-11 target of 5.1 per cent could be achieved because of the large collections from the auction of spectrum for third-generation telecom services (3G) and broad band services. These two have contributed almost 1.3 per cent of the GDP, which means that without them the deficit would have been as high as 6.4 per cent.
It is unlikely that such a windfall will occur so soon or at frequent intervals. Therefore, the task of fiscal management the government has set for itself for 2011-12 — a steep reduction by almost two percentage points from the current year's “normal” level arrived at after deducting the one-time yields from the spectrum sales — appears daunting. The government is obviously betting on a robust economic growth, tax buoyancy, and a compression in expenditure. While the Economic Survey expects the economy to grow at the pre-crisis levels of around 9 per cent, the recent decline in manufacturing is worrying. By far the biggest challenge will be on the expenditure side. Given the sharp hike in global oil prices, the allocation for subsidies is meagre. The budgeted expenditure for Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), kept at last year's level of Rs.40,000 crore, might well fall short of the money required. The government is also silent on the subsidy implications of the Food Security Bill that awaits Parliament's approval. The projected 14 per cent growth in tax revenue looks achievable with better tax compliance but clearly expenditure looks like ending up far above the estimates.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Under-estimated-outlays/article14934186.ece
4,3,2011,Afghan exposé for U.K.,"In a damning report, the British House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee has found that the objective of achieving security for the United Kingdom was attained “some time ago”, as al-Qaida had been significantly weakened in Afghanistan; and that the British military presence in that country has far exceeded the time needed. Secondly, the decision to withdraw unconditionally by 2015 has no apparent security rationale. Thirdly, the military alone cannot create safety and security; force can subdue various regions temporarily, but senior British commanders have been excessively optimistic about the benefits of expanded military commitment. The problems are, above all, political. The egregious western assumption that al-Qaida and the Taliban form a single enemy has alienated the very people whose assent is essential for a political solution, namely the ordinary Afghans. Moreover, the 2009 military surge by the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) has worsened matters by increasing civilian casualties. The report recommends that the U.K. encourage direct U.S.-Taliban contact; that has already started. As for Pakistan, the Committee concludes that the continuing existence of Taliban safe havens in that country means ISAF may well find it impossible to succeed.
The British government's reaction was dismally predictable; foreign minister William Hague says parts of the report are out of date. That, however, is only a fig-leaf to cover executive embarrassment over the long list of disastrous failures, including a huge civilian death toll, in Afghanistan. Furthermore, the 2015 withdrawal date is arbitrary; it was not decided in the National Security Council, and was first announced to the media, not to Parliament — which is yet to hear any argument for it. Washington has not reacted publicly, perhaps because the report is not binding on the U.K. government; but the latter is now caught between the rock of U.S.-driven foreign policy and the hard place of domestic exposure. This is no mean achievement on the part of the Foreign Affairs Committee. British parliamentary select committees are not well-funded in comparison with congressional committees on Capitol Hill; nor can they compel Ministers' attendance or disclosure of official documents, but they are admirably non-partisan. Created by Parliament in 1979 against bitter opposition from the political executive and the civil service, they have often proved their worth in scrutinising the government. Tragically, this particular committee has had to compensate, a decade too late, for the failure of the House of Commons to rein in a war-obsessed Prime Minister, Tony Blair.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Afghan-expos%C3%A9-for-U.K./article14934185.ece
7,3,2011,"Yes, but what led to the 'error'?","It took a nudge from Sushma Swaraj, the Leader of the Opposition, for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to admit in Parliament that he had made an “error of judgment” in appointing P.J. Thomas as Central Vigilance Commissioner. Although Dr. Singh can be given credit for allowing himself to be coaxed into reiterating his acceptance of full responsibility for the appointment, which was set aside by a censorious Supreme Court, his statement throws no further light on the shameful episode. How did it come about that a senior civil servant charge-sheeted in a corruption case was chosen as the country's top anti-corruption watchdog? Were the Prime Minister and the Home Minister, who were part of the three-member selection committee that appointed Mr. Thomas, really unaware of this? Why did they not apply their minds to the objections raised by Ms. Swaraj who, as the third member of the committee, specifically raised the issue of the pending charges against Mr. Thomas in the palmolein import case? Was there pressure from any quarter to make Mr. Thomas CVC? Answering these questions is vital to institutional integrity.
The little we know officially about the circumstances that led to Mr. Thomas' appointment is a piece of obfuscation. This is in the form of Attorney General G.E. Vahanvati's laboured submission in the Supreme Court that the Department of Personnel had failed to place the full facts about Mr. Thomas, or the relevant “papers and file,” before the selection committee. This sounded like a lame attempt to absolve the Prime Minister and Home Minister of accountability by making out that the appointment was a result of bureaucratic inefficiency or oversight. As we have made clear in earlier editorials, Mr. Thomas is entitled to a fair trial under the procedure established by law and no presumption of guilt should be attached to his part in the palmolein import case. What is scandalous is the government's decision to shield him and ipso facto protect itself against the fierce criticism about the highly coloured circumstances under which he was selected for the post. After the Supreme Court quashed his appointment and indicted the government for attempting to defend the indefensible, the least Dr. Singh should have furnished was a detailed account of how or why he was led into 'error'. An acceptance of responsibility is a step forward but insufficient. The proper course for a Prime Minister with a reputation for personal financial integrity would be to square with Parliament and the public on what it was that made him and his senior government colleague insist on, and rush through, the appointment of Mr. Thomas in defiance of morality, the law, and common sense.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Yes-but-what-led-to-the-error/article14939225.ece
7,3,2011,Budget & housing for the poor,"Budget 2011-12 belies hopes of effectively addressing the housing needs of the poor. It fails to provide the much-needed impetus to improve the supply of affordable housing for economically weaker sections (EWS) and low-income groups (LIG), particularly those who live in the urban areas. About 99 per cent of housing shortage pertains to these two socio-economic categories. In absolute terms, by the end of 2012, the deficit will be as staggering as 26 million units. Instead of devising schemes to target this segment, the budget assumes that a broad stimulation of growth in the housing sector will solve the problem. It relies on the upgraded interest subvention scheme, which will now offer one per cent discount on home loans for dwellings priced at Rs.25 lakh and below, and revised home loan limits to improve the supply of affordable housing. But the question is will it? As the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation points out, any dwelling unit that costs more than Rs.250,000 for the EWS and Rs.500,000 for the LIG will not be affordable. It is clear that the budget schemes that encourage construction of houses priced at Rs.25 lakh and target buyers who can mobilise Rs.10 lakh on their own will neither benefit the poor nor bridge the housing deficit.
The Finance Minister has proposed to set up a Mortgage Risk Guarantee Fund and to offer investment-linked tax deduction for affordable housing schemes. Setting up a risk fund to guarantee housing loans extended to the poor is not a new idea. The draft National Housing Policy proposed it in 2005, recommending a corpus of Rs.500 crore for the purpose. Unfortunately, this proposal was not implemented. It has now been resurrected and integrated with the existing Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY). However, the ground reality is that RAY, announced in 2009 to improve the housing conditions of the poor, is itself in the preparatory phase, with the parameters yet to be finalised. Providing income tax benefits to encourage private developers to build houses for the poor is one of the approaches successfully adopted by several countries. Indian policymakers who are trying this method for the first time have an important lesson to learn: fiscal incentives by themselves will not produce desired results. Unless it is integrated with a well-worked out delivery mechanism and a regulatory framework, the scheme will not benefit the needy. It is true that State governments also have a responsibility to address the housing needs of the poor. But the Finance Ministry could have done its part better by showing more commitment to meeting basic needs.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Budget-amp-housing-for-the-poor/article14938140.ece
7,3,2011,Blocking out bloggers,"The blocking of a blogging website, even if only for a short period, raises the disturbing question of curbs imposed on free speech in India through executive fiat. There is a clear pattern of Internet censorship that is inconsistent with constitutional guarantees on freedom of expression. It is also at odds with citizen aspirations in the age of new media. What is worrying is that the rules governing online publication are being tinkered with periodically to facilitate such filtering. This is done under the Information Technology Act, 2000. The Department of Information Technology recently published the draft Information Technology (Due diligence observed by intermediaries guidelines) Rules, 2011 that specifically mark bloggers for scrutiny, and require intermediaries such as service providers not to themselves host or publish any information. Evidently, this can be interpreted to cover blogs and other websites. What is worse, the rules propose to authorise the intermediaries to remove access to ‘infringing' material if they themselves have actual knowledge or are asked to do so by a mandated authority. These are retrogressive provisions that weaken constitutional freedoms and the parent law. As it stands, the IT Act merely requires the intermediary to exercise due diligence and does not talk of not hosting or publishing information. Ideally, the only criterion online publications should have to meet is compliance with the general laws of the land.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Blocking-out-bloggers/article14937987.ece
7,3,2011,Challenges before India Post,"India Post's recent initiatives, which include slotting itself in cyberspace through the ePost Office, are pointers to the manner in which the world's largest postal network can be better leveraged to strengthen the financial and communication infrastructure. The Internet and other affordable alternatives have hit the basic function of post offices: delivering letters and other mails. In India, as an answer to a question raised in the Lok Sabha reveals, the volume of mail traffic fell from 6,677.18 million pieces in 2006-07 to 6,391.15 million in 2007-08, and rose marginally to 6,540.90 million in 2008-09. That the figure for 1997-98 was 15,749.30 million points to the severity of the fall. Internationally too, there are clear signs of the Internet eating into postal systems. Developed economies, in particular, saw postal businesses slump further with the onset of the recession. Statistics provided by the Universal Postal Union (UPU) show that between 2008 and 2009 domestic mail volumes were down 12 per cent globally (translating to about 13 billion pieces). Although there are signs of recovery now, particularly in the parcel and express segments, fundamental challenges posed by the emergence of alternatives to the post remain.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Challenges-before-India-Post/article14938056.ece
9,3,2011,BMI and risk of death,"That obesity is a causal factor for many lifestyle diseases such as cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, which in turn increases the risk of death, has been well established in the developed world. Similarly, being underweight increases the risk of death. A study published online in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) (“Association between body-mass index and risk of death in more than 1 million Asians” by Wei Zheng et al.,) finds a strong correlation between underweight and increased risk of death in all Asians. The study is an analysis of published data involving 1.1 million people living in Asian countries, including 287,000 Indians and Bangladeshis. The risk of death in the case of East Asians was high for those with a high body mass index (BMI), but not in the case of Indians and Bangladeshis. Indians and Bangladeshis were more prone to death when they were underweight. It is a fact that severely underweight people are malnourished, and hence very unhealthy. Low immunity levels seen in such people make them highly prone to several infections. Large-scale studies done in India, which has a huge malnourished population, are more likely to show a large percentage of deaths associated with lower BMI than higher BMI. Several small studies done in India have shown the risk of mortality increasing with higher BMIs.
The study reported in NEJM has several limitations. Being underweight increases the risk of infections but a person can become underweight as a result of an underlying infection. The researchers were not able to exclude, at the time of enrolment, underweight people already suffering from some infection, and hence at a higher risk. That many people were reported to be dying soon after enrolment suggests they may have had some underlying infection or disease at the time of enrolment. Waist-to-hip ratio or waist circumference is a better marker than BMI to know fat distribution in the body. Indians, even those who are thin, tend to accumulate fat in their waist. Abdominal adiposity is a causal factor for hypertension and diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Those with a BMI between 22.6 and 25 with less central adiposity have the greatest chances of living free of any infections and lifestyle-related diseases. With more urban children becoming obese, public health messages should address the increasing chances of health complications when the BMI is lower or higher than the normal range. They should also stress the need to reduce abdominal adiposity even when the BMI is within the normal range.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/BMI-and-risk-of-death/article14941704.ece
9,3,2011,In search of a second earth,"The discovery of six exoplanets or extra-solar planets (planets outside the Solar System) orbiting a single sun-like star, dubbed Kepler-11, at a distance of about 2,000 light-years from Earth makes it the largest collection to be ever found. Those found earlier using ground-based detection methods were single exoplanets orbiting a star. The discovery by the Kepler spacecraft launched in March 2009 and reported recently online in Nature (“A closely packed system of low-mass, low-density planets transiting Kepler-11” by Jack J. Lissauer et al.,) became possible as the Kepler telescope continuously looks out for exoplanets transiting the more than 150,000 stars in a specific region of the sky in the Cygnus and Lyra constellations. A transiting planet causes a dip in the brightness of the star. Three to four transits causing the same dip in brightness, taking the same time to transit the star, and taking the same amount of time between successive transits are necessary for confirmation that the object is a planet. Though several thousand planets may be present in the region studied, the actual number that may eventually be found will be smaller as the orbital plane of the transits must be perfectly aligned with Kepler's line of sight. All the six exoplanets have orbits smaller than Venus's, with the orbits of the first five being smaller than Mercury's. The innermost planet must have a dense and rocky core as it has 4.6 times Earth's mass despite being only 1.4 times the size of the Earth. Most of the other planets have significant amounts of light gas.
The main objective of the Kepler mission is to find Earth-sized planets orbiting Sun-like stars and capable of supporting life. All the six exoplanets are bigger than Earth, with the largest ones comparable with Uranus and Neptune. Like Mercury and Venus, they are too close to the star to support life. According to the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), finding an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone that is neither too close nor too far from the star may take at least three years; one transit would take nearly a year and three such transits are needed for planet confirmation. With Kepler only halfway into its mission, we cannot possibly expect discovery of an Earth-like planet before 2013. The Kepler finds add to our understanding of the universe. For instance, with ground-based instruments, generally only the radius and not the mass of the planets can be measured, and hence the density and composition would remain unknown; the size and mass of only three exoplanets smaller than Neptune used to be known. Kepler has added five more to that list.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/In-search-of-a-second-earth/article14940492.ece
9,3,2011,Of mercy and ending life,"“We could have dismissed the petition on the short ground that…the right to life guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution does not include the right to die,” observe Justices Markandey Katju and Gyan Sudha Misra sagely in the Aruna Shanbaug case. “However, in view of the importance of the issues involved we decided to go deeper into the merits of the case.” Negotiating the grey ethical areas relating to euthanasia in a humane, progressive, and persuasive way, this detailed Supreme Court judgment lays down a broad legal framework for dealing with a subject that has not received the attention it deserves from the legislature. The court's decision on the immediate matter at hand — the plea that Aruna Shanbaug, the nurse who has been lying in a vegetative state on a Mumbai hospital bed since she was brutally raped and strangulated in 1973, should be allowed to die — is largely based on medical evidence. The evidence furnished by a panel of experts showed that while Ms Shanbaug may be in a permanent vegetative state (PVS), she is neither brain dead nor in a coma. The court also went into the question of who could initiate the move to withdraw life support to a person in PVS. Its answer is that such decisions can be taken by parents, spouses, and close relatives or, in their absence (as in Ms Shanbaug's case), the “next friend.” Justices Katju and Misra held that her next friend was clearly KEM Hospital staff, “who have been amazingly caring for her day and night for so many long years,” and not the petitioner who urged that Aruna be allowed to die in dignity.
Upholding the distinction between active euthanasia, which involves taking specific steps such as injecting a person with a lethal substance, and passive euthanasia, which is withdrawing medical treatment with the knowledge that it will cause death, the court has held that the latter is permissible in exceptional circumstances — for example, when a patient is kept alive purely mechanically and when he or she is “only able to sustain involuntary functioning through advanced medical technology.” Citing a slew of international case laws on the subject, the Supreme Court has laid down a strict framework for the procedure to be adopted for non-voluntary passive euthanasia until suitable legislation is in place. All mercy-killing pleas should be heard by a two-member bench of the appropriate High Court and decisions may be taken only after seeking medical opinion from three empanelled doctors, who must examine the patient, his or her medical records, and also get the views of the hospital staff. Leaving such decisions entirely to a patient's relatives or doctors carries the risk that murders will be carried out in the guise of mercy killing. In its judgment, the court has struck a fine balance — it has shown great sensitivity in handling the heart-rending case of Aruna Shanbaug and her wonderful ‘next friend,' the KEM Hospital staff, taken a progressive and empathetic view about dying with dignity, but subjected it to exacting and rigorous procedures.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Of-mercy-and-ending-life/article14953671.ece
9,3,2011,Illusory tax concessions,"Except for senior citizens, the Union budget has very few major initiatives on the personal taxation front. The Direct Tax Code (DTC), which aims to revamp the existing direct tax structure, will come into effect on April 1, 2012. In a limited way, the budget proposals aim at bringing about a transition to the DTC. The exemption limit for the general category of taxpayers has been raised from Rs.1,60,000 to Rs.1,80,000, providing a relief of a little over Rs.2,000. But by far the most significant initiative has little to do with tax rates or slabs. It is an administrative decision to reduce the qualifying age for senior citizens from 65 years to 60. With the exemption limit raised to Rs.2,50,000 from Rs.2,40,000, this new segment of senior citizens will get over Rs.9,200 as relief. The Finance Minister has also created a new category of ‘Very Senior Citizens', 80 years and above, who will qualify for a higher exemption limit of Rs.5,00,000. This category can save on taxes up to Rs.26,780.
The tax saving for senior citizens may look significant. For many, however, it will be illusory. For one thing, one must have an income stream that is large enough to qualify for savings. Not many in the salaried class are likely to have a taxable income of more than Rs.2,50,000, after retirement. It is even less likely that there will be many taxpayers in the 80-plus age group with an annual income of Rs.5,00,000. Even more contrived is the logic that senior citizens can plan their taxes better by investing in tax-saving instruments up to Rs.1,20,000. Such instruments are essentially long-dated and even if senior citizens have enough income they would be ill-advised to lock their money in these. The Finance Minister is absolutely right when he says that senior citizens deserve special attention. Today's senior citizens depend on limited fixed incomes and did not have many opportunities to save and plan for their retirement during their working years. For instance, access to home loans and life insurance was minimal until not too long ago. That has made them extremely vulnerable after retirement. Government support to them ought to go well beyond tax reliefs and address the concerns of the aged in a holistic manner.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Illusory-tax-concessions/article14939314.ece
11,3,2011,Tragedy strikes Japan,"Japan, a land that is no stranger to earthquakes and from whose language the word ‘tsunami' is derived, is facing a natural calamity of unprecedented proportions. The magnitude 8.9 quake, one of the worst to have struck the country in a century, would have been trouble enough. Worse still, the quake occurred just 120 km offshore, resulting in a tsunami with waves many metres high that swiftly barrelled its way inland, producing some horrifying live television images. The unstoppable waters tossed boats aside, swept away cars and huge trucks, and left buildings marooned as they relentlessly continued to engulf more areas. Situated in one of the most seismically active regions of the world, Japan could turn itself into an economic powerhouse only by ensuring that its infrastructure was engineered to withstand quakes and its people endlessly drilled and prepared to face such eventualities. Although tall buildings in Tokyo swayed so much that their inhabitants were left feeling nauseous, they do not seem to have collapsed. The famed bullet trains promptly stopped running and many of the country's nuclear power plants were safely shut down. But human ingenuity and planning has its limits when facing the powers of nature. There are reports that there were problems in shutting down one nuclear power plant and a massive fire in an oil refinery sent thick clouds of smoke into the air. With tsunami warning and alerts issued to other nations ringing the Pacific Ocean, they braced themselves for a time of trial.
In Japan itself, the death toll will doubtless rise. There will inevitably also be the costs of destroyed houses, factories, farms, and various kinds of infrastructure to reckon with. It bears recall that the 1995 quake near the city of Kobe, with a magnitude of 6.9, killed more than 6,000 people and caused damage in excess of $100 billion. Decades earlier, in 1923, the Great Kanto Earthquake set off vast fires that claimed close to 140,000 lives in Tokyo and surrounding areas. As brave, resilient, and resourceful Japan picks itself up and rebuilds from the latest devastation, it will learn lessons about where improvements need to be made. But this natural disaster raises issues that must concern countries like India too. As this country experiences rapid economic growth, how much of its vital infrastructure and buildings can withstand a powerful tremblor? After the experience of the 2004 quake and the huge tsunami that it unleashed, India has put in place its own tsunami warning system. Japan's experience shows that even with preparation, loss to life and property can be tremendous. Without such preparedness, however, the tragedy would be unimaginably greater.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Tragedy-strikes-Japan/article14943281.ece
11,3,2011,Conserving the Bamiyan Buddhas,"One of the most horrifying acts of the Taliban was blasting the two magnificent, 1500-year-old Buddha statues in Bamiyan with dynamites, rocket launchers, and tanks. The 10th anniversary of this tragic destruction, which began on March 2, 2011 and took weeks to complete, provides an occasion to reflect on the future of the Afghan heritage. These statues, carved on the face of the Hindu-Kush Mountains, were great representatives of Asian art. The two unique colossi, 55 and 38 meter tall — the first of which was the tallest in the world — synthesised various art styles, including the Gandhara and Greco-Roman. They also represented a wonderfully creative phase of Buddhist history. The Indian government, through the Archaeological Survey of India, played a commendable role in the conservation of the Bamiyan monuments between 1969 and 1977. Although attempts were made in the early 1980s to declare them as World Heritage sites, it was only in 2003 that the effort succeeded. Simultaneously, these heritage structures were placed in the list of sites in danger, which helped mobilise international expertise and financial support for their protection.
UNESCO, which is coordinating the conservation efforts in Afghanistan, deserves the highest praise. Instead of rushing to rebuild the destroyed icons, as desired by some of the heritage experts and funding countries, it opted for a three-phase project to demine the area, strengthen the mountain cliffs, and improve the vicinity. Involving local communities in conservation efforts and building their capacities has been very sensibly made a priority. This sustainable approach, adopted since 2003, has paid dividends and the Bamiyan site is now ready to be removed from the list of World Heritage sites in danger. The demand to rebuild the Bamiyan Buddhas has gained fresh momentum after experts demonstrated the feasibility of reconstructing the smaller of the two statues, using fragments from the original statues. A final decision will be taken after carefully analysing the costs and benefits of the project, including the social gains that would accrue to the local community. The Taliban's barbaric destruction of the Buddhas exposes the limits of international conventions meant to safeguard heritage structures of universal value. In general, these conventions only address the damage caused by conventional war; they are ineffective in dealing with rogue States that vandalise their own cultural properties. There is an urgent need to review these international legal instruments and to make it mandatory for states to protect their cultural diversity and the heritage structures that represent it gloriously.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Conserving-the-Bamiyan-Buddhas/article14943280.ece
11,3,2011,Oppose military intervention,"The fact that western leaders are considering military options over Libya is deeply disturbing. Within Libya, President Muammar Qadhafi's brutally repressive regime appears to be gaining the upper hand in what has become a civil war. Government forces are using tanks and heavy artillery as well as warplanes in attacks on, for example, the oil town of Ras Lanuf, which is held by the ill-equipped and largely untrained rebels. Almost all the western options talked about, or under consideration, involve illegal military intervention of some kind. British Prime Minister David Cameron floated the over-the-top idea of parachuting weapons to the rebels; and The Independent reports that Washington has even asked Saudi Arabia to pay for and channel U.S. weaponry to them. Some suggestions are crazier. Senator John Kerry has said U.S. aircraft could “crater airports and runways” held by the Libyan government; and Senator John McCain wants Mr. Qadhafi removed, possibly by a “coalition of the willing.” Another proposal is for missile attacks on government positions; the U.S. did attack Tripoli and Benghazi in 1986. Special operations, like the 1961 Bay of Pigs attack on Cuba or the deployment of secret agents, and cyber warfare have been mooted. The most widely discussed plan is for the imposition of a no-fly zone.
All these proposals, however, are deeply flawed. Arming the rebels would bolster Mr. Qadhafi's claim that a colonialist plot is being hatched. Mr. McCain's suggestions sound very much like the threats the U.S. issued in the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Aside from the flagrant illegality, such an adventure would take a horrifying toll on civilian population. An invasion would discredit the rebellion, and could turn the majority of Libyans against the invaders. The idea of a no-fly zone may appeal to western leaders because it gives the impression of action without excessive danger to their own troops, but it cannot be implemented without attacks on Libyan air defences. The rebels, who may be losing momentum, have asked for international help — but the conspicuous void is the lack of political pressure on the Libyan regime. The Arab League, the Gulf Cooperation Council, and the African Union are yet to come up with a clear position. Western talk of military responses before anything else is not only hubristic but it also obscures the political failures that have led to the current situation. Above all, the military actions now proposed would constitute acts of war against a sovereign state and must be condemned outright. India, along with other developing countries, has done well to express its opposition to the use of force as well as to a no-fly zone to resolve the Libyan crisis.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Oppose-military-intervention/article14941860.ece
11,3,2011,Tackling the menace of piracy,"The plight of some 79 Indian mariners who remain hostages in ships hijacked by Somali pirates and the government's apparent helplessness in securing their release have quite dramatically brought home the menace of modern-day piracy in no uncertain terms. India is not alone in having to cope with the consequences of piracy, which has Somalia as its epicentre and seriously threatens the world's crucial energy shipping routes. Nor has India remained a silent spectator even as the pirates have become more audacious and extended their range close to its shores. In a visible contribution to global anti-piracy efforts, the Indian Navy has joined the navies of the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Russia, South Korea, and Vietnam in patrolling the worst affected sea lanes, achieving a degree of success through warding off attacks or capturing the outlaws. Yet these efforts have clearly not been enough. An expert recently told the United Nations Security Council that “the pirates are progressively becoming the masters of the Indian Ocean.” According to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), the current year might well mark a new ominous phase: there will be more hijackings and in many cases a level of violence not usually seen earlier. During January and February, Somali pirates carried out 61 attacks on vessels and 13 hijackings, and killed at least six hostages. Currently, 34 vessels and about 750 crew members are held hostage.
The financial cost of piracy is huge. According to informed estimates, the maritime industry has to bear up to $3.2 billion by way of extra insurance and another $2.95 billion to re-route ships round the Cape of Good Hope, away from the piracy-hit area. The average ransom rose from $3.4 million to $5.4 million between 2009 and 2010. While everybody is agreed on the gravity of the problem, there is a lot of controversy about the best way of tackling it. Concerns over the fate of hostages have precluded the use of more aggressive strategies. While the shipping industry is against arming its crew and stationing armed guards because of the risks to crew in a lethal fight, several softer options have been tried. Ultimately, the sure way to turn the tide against piracy would be to offer pirates and their families a better way of life. That, in turn, would depend on rebuilding the Somali state, improving socio-economic conditions, and countering and eliminating the iconic status pirates have acquired among that country's vast, mostly unemployed youth. It's a tough challenge even under the most favourable circumstances.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Tackling-the-menace-of-piracy/article14941831.ece
13,3,2011,The wellspring of judicial activism,"So cynical has the public become about the impartiality and seriousness with which corruption cases against the rich and the powerful are probed, that hardly an eyebrow is raised when the judiciary starts actively monitoring the investigation in such cases. Over the last couple of months, the Supreme Court has assumed a supervisory role in the CBI's investigation of the 2G scam, asking the agency to act against “persons who think themselves to be the law” and demanding to see the charge sheet before it is filed. Earlier this week, in the case relating to black money stashed abroad, another bench of the Supreme Court asked the government to consider invoking terror laws against Hasan Ali Khan. The provocation for such judicial activism lies in the suspicion — most often well grounded — about the lack of good faith in the manner these cases are being probed. An FIR in the 2G scam (against unknown persons and firms) was registered as early as October 2009, but it wasn't until the Supreme Court reprimanded the CBI for dragging its feet that the investigation really moved forward. Similarly, the Centre's persistent stonewalling in the black money case led an exasperated Supreme Court to ask: “What the hell is going on in this country?”
Some of the Court's prodding has been in the form of sharp questions and cutting observations on the investigations. It is hardly a surprise that its display of annoyance has led agencies such as the CBI to interpret oral observations made in the course of the hearing as if they were judicial diktat. Since the mid-90s, the judiciary has tried to strengthen the independence of investigating agencies, a process that both began with, and is highlighted by, the Supreme Court's judgment in the Jain hawala case, which centred on a diary that allegedly recorded the sums of money paid by a money-laundering agent to the country's leading politicians. The Court took the extraordinary step of barring the CBI from furnishing any information on the case to the then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. Eventually, it ruled that the superintendence of the CBI in relation to investigations will vest with the Central Vigilance Commission, and not with the Prime Minister's Office which, deplorably, continues to influence investigations informally apart from exercising formal administrative control. In an ideal world, the judiciary would stick to interpreting the law and refrain from treading on the domain of the legislature or the executive. But in an environment where justice is constantly being subverted, it is arguable that the courts are left with no choice but to step beyond their traditional domain and prod the executive into discharging its constitutional responsibilities.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-wellspring-of-judicial-activism/article14946219.ece
13,3,2011,Fiscal policy and inflation,"Given that inflation, especially food inflation, has been an extremely sensitive issue, it was certain that the budget would assume a strong anti-inflationary stance. In his budget speech the Finance Minister admitted that the government could have done better in controlling food inflation The Reserve Bank of India, which has for long advocated a fiscal policy that complemented its monetary policy, would certainly take note of the anti-inflationary elements of the Union budget when it reviews the credit policy later this week. The most important of these is the large reduction in the fiscal deficit. As a proportion of the GDP, it is expected, according to the revised estimates for 2010-11, to come down to 5.1 per cent from the budgeted figure of 5.5 per cent. For 2011-12, the budget aims at an even more ambitious target of 4.6 per cent. On paper, the government's commitment to fiscal consolidation is not in doubt. However, the windfall from the sale of 3G and broad band spectrum which has brought down the deficit sharply this year will not be repeated in the near future. At a more general level, the assumptions of tight expenditure management and revenue buoyancy to bring about fiscal consolidation will be closely watched.
Total government expenditure for 2011-12 is budgeted to be only three per cent more than this year, with a sharp contraction in non-Plan spending and a very modest rise in Plan outlay. It is doubtful whether any government can realistically cut down expenditure to such an extent. Moreover, the outlays for subsidies seem meagre. The budgeted expenditure on the government's key social sector programmes might well fall short of the money required. On the revenue side, the government is banking on robust economic growth and the consequent higher tax revenues. Even so, the anticipated increases in corporate tax collections (21.5 per cent) and excise collections (19 per cent) appear to be on the high side. The upshot of all this is that the government may be hard pressed to stick to its planned fiscal consolidation. Consequently, it might be forced to borrow more than what is budgeted for or raise taxes in a supplementary budget. What all these would do to inflation and inflationary expectations is anybody's guess. There are many who question the connection between deficit reduction and inflation control. For most part of the current year, the rise in inflation was attributed to demand-supply imbalances due to a poor monsoon and spike in the prices of specific food items. Deficit reduction, as a single line of attack, will meet with only limited success under these circumstances.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Fiscal-policy-and-inflation/article14946218.ece
14,3,2011,Japan's nuclear woes,"Hammered by a tremendously powerful earthquake and then bludgeoned by a gigantic tsunami, Japan really had enough trouble on its hands. But as fate would have it, the only nation ever to witness the full horrors of nuclear war is, in addition to its other woes, face to face with a nuclear power nightmare. Problems with cooling three reactors at Fukushima Daiichi have already led to the venting of radioactive steam and two explosions. There are similar concerns about another reactor at the nearby Fukushima Daini plant. A desperate struggle is on to prevent the worst from happening — a complete meltdown of the nuclear core that could lead to large releases of radioactivity into the environment. With few natural resources of its own, Japan opted for nuclear power to supply a third of its energy needs. It has today more than 50 commercially operating nuclear reactors. These reactors were built taking into account the fact that they would be operating in a seismically dangerous environment. Unfortunately, Friday's earthquake, which was the worst recorded in the country, and the huge tsunami it unleashed set off a cascade of problems at the two nuclear power plants.
Safely shutting down a nuclear power plant is not simple. Stopping the chain reaction that keeps fission going, thereby producing vast amounts of energy, is just the first step. But even after that is achieved, the core of a nuclear reactor is still very hot. In addition, radioactive processes continue in the nuclear fuel, which too produce heat. The plant at Fukushima Daiichi relied on pumps powered by electricity to keep cooling water circulating. Friday's quake and tsunami knocked out electric supply from the grid. Standby generators kept at the plant for such contingencies could not be used because of the flooding and damage caused by the tsunami. Batteries, which were intended only to keep the cooling going until the generators came on, were soon depleted. The lack of cooling led to what Japanese officials say is only a partial meltdown of the nuclear cores in two reactors. Even if a total meltdown is avoided, it is believed that for many months to come the plant's operator will have to continue pumping in seawater to cool the two reactors and periodically release radioactive steam. People who have been evacuated from the area may not be able to return home any time soon. Understandably, these events in Japan have set off waves of concern in countries that have nuclear plants of their own, with worries about some unforeseen chain of events producing serious safety issues. In India, the country's nuclear agencies have promised a revisit of safety issues at all atomic plants. Such a safety audit must be carried out with a transparency that engenders public trust, without which nuclear power will not flourish.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Japans-nuclear-woes/article14947314.ece
14,3,2011,Catching it early,"The public health priority identified by the international community of nephrologists to mark World Kidney Day 2011 is vital for advancing the campaign against cardiovascular disease. The key message is that protecting the kidneys also saves the heart. There is a lot of evidence on the link between hypertension and damage to renal function; in turn, chronic kidney disease (CKD) can produce high blood pressure; diabetes also leads to kidney damage. That is well known, but more recent data indicate that even lesser degrees of renal impairment, manifested as protein in the urine, result in elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This is true, in some cases, even where other factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and a history of heart attack do not co-exist. The findings may be disturbing, but affordable solutions are available to mitigate the risk. Where the problem is picked up early and a treatment regimen to reduce proteinuria initiated, there is a significant lowering of CVD risk. The promise of this approach, reported in the American Journal of Nephrology in February, is immense.
The number of deaths due to communicable diseases, and maternal, perinatal, and nutritional causes is projected to decrease in India between 2004 and 2030. By contrast, cardiovascular disease is expected to kill four million people in 2030, a sharp rise from 2.7 million for the base year. This forecast underscores the need for policy initiatives to achieve a substantial reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular disease. The reported CVD link to kidney disease makes it imperative to detect and treat early. As a goal, this is eminently achievable. Large-scale screening to detect proteinuria and early identification of CKD is the first step; involvement of the general practitioner and village nurse under rural health schemes will aid this. For those who are diagnosed with renal disease, other low-cost interventions, such as control of salt in diet, and treatment using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, can lead to a dramatic reduction in its progression. The processed food industry, which uses a large amount of salt, must be encouraged actively to participate in such a programme. The medical community has collected enough evidence to show that early detection and treatment stop individuals from slipping into irreversible renal failure. Now, it is pointing out that doing so can save them from CVD too. The agenda for prevention must get all possible support.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Catching-it-early/article14947313.ece
15,3,2011,Playing with lives,"The latest in the series of scams that are tumbling out of cupboards in New Delhi relates to the forged mark sheets submitted by pilots to secure an Airline Transport Pilot's Licence. Co-pilots need this licence to graduate to a commander. At least some of them decided they could fake their way through the qualifying examination, and it was not until one of them landed an aircraft with its nose wheel down first and the incident was investigated that it transpired she had not legitimately passed her examination. That pilot from IndiGo and another from Air India have since been arrested on charges of faking their mark sheets; two others are absconding. The industry regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) says between 3,000 and 4,000 such licences are now under the scanner. Evidently there seems to be collusion among the pilots, touts, and some staff in the DGCA, who are in charge of issuing the mark sheets after the special tests that are held every three months to enable co-pilots to move up the ladder. Strangely, the DGCA had warned pilots at least twice in the past two years, not to fall a prey to such touts. Now, Air India has set up a three-member committee to probe all the licences and the mark sheets. It has come to light that sons and daughters of many DGCA staff have become pilots, and this gave room for suspicion of collusion and the entry of touts into this business.
Safety experts in the Aviation sector believe that anywhere between 50 and 60 of the serving commanders in various airlines could be suspect in the forged mark sheets scam, and about 200 with a co-pilot's licence need to be investigated about the genuineness of their papers. The unbridled growth of the aviation sector over the past decade has created a huge demand for pilots in recent years, with a simultaneous increase in the number of commanders needed. A commander earns at least twice as much as a co-pilot and hence the incentive for co-pilots to graduate as quickly as possible. But there cannot be any shortcuts to the commander's seat. While cheap and competitive fares have made flying affordable to the common people, greed and trickery of these illegitimate commanders are now putting thousands of lives at risk. Worse, if it is proved that a pilot of an aircraft that meets with an accident had forged documents, neither the airline nor its passengers will be entitled for even insurance claims. The DGCA has to get to the bottom of this scandal and weed out all unscrupulous elements. With an estimated 6,000 pilots on rolls, the regulator needs to streamline the process and set the house in order.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Playing-with-lives/article14948571.ece
15,3,2011,Use and misuse of the placebo effect,"Are placebos inert substances with no real therapeutic effect? Placebos go back to the origins of medicine as a science and as an art and have been part of the stock-in-trade of charlatanism and quackery. Today they are routinely used in human clinical trials for comparing the efficacy of experimental drugs; this is based on the premise that placebos containing inactive substances have nil therapeutic potential. But, although their use in clinical care for treating patients with imaginary or real ailments is reportedly showing some promise, their undisclosed use is considered questionable and even unethical — and hence is not formally approved by medical authorities anywhere in the world. Yet doctors in several developed countries are using them even when effective medicines are available. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many doctors in India have long been doing so. A recent study by the German Medical Association (BAK) found that half of German doctors were prescribing placebos to ‘treat' depression and stomach complaints. The percentage of general practitioners taking advantage of the placebo effect to treat their patients shot up to nearly 90 per cent in Bavaria. That nearly 60 per cent of patients who had upset stomach and about a third of those with depression stood to gain shows that the placebo effect could be real. The placebo effect was maximised when administered as an injection, and factors such as size and colour of a pill determined the success rate. Being convinced that doctors understood their concerns and were taking them seriously played a major role.
This is not the first time placebo effects yielding positive results in clinical settings have been documented. A 2008 study covering nearly 680 U.S. internists and rheumatologists found that about half of them had prescribed placebos (without the patients being aware of it) over the past one year. Though the intent was to promote positive therapeutic expectations, it was considered unethical as the patients were kept in the dark. Withholding information amounts to cheating and threatens trust, so very central to clinical practice. Advocates of placebo treatment note that positive results can be achieved even without deception. But whether it can be adopted in clinical care after eliminating all kinds of deception is not fully known. Placebos given along with drugs in trials produced positive results but at reduced levels when patients knew of their doubtful efficacy. Evidence-based practice must wait for further research and for the formulation of clear guidelines for placebo use.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Use-and-misuse-of-the-placebo-effect/article14948570.ece
16,3,2011,Why exports need to be robust,"The robust export performance in February is attributed primarily to the rebound in demand in the U.S. and a few other advanced economies. According to figures released by the Commerce Ministry, exports grew by nearly 50 per cent over February 2010 to $23.6 billion. During the 11 months of the current year (April 2010-February 2011) exports have grown to over $208 billion, crossing the annual target of $200 billion with one month to spare. The government's strategy of encouraging diversification into newer markets and the focus on non-traditional exports — the two important features of the Foreign Trade Policy — have paid off. Heartened by the strong export performance, the government has, in a strategy paper released recently, called for a doubling of exports to $450 billion by 2014. That can happen if exports grow at an annual rate of 26 per cent over the next three years. More in the nature of a visionary statement, the strategy is based on four pillars: a product strategy that will build on intrinsic strengths of some industries; market diversification; incentivising research and development; and building a Brand India. None of these is new but obviously the government hopes to refine some of the ongoing programmes of export promotion for even better results.
However, while a visionary approach to exports is welcome, perhaps necessary, the limitations of the Commerce Ministry ought not to be overlooked. While significant success has been achieved in fine-tuning procedures, discarding unwanted ones and building up an impressive technology backbone, the Ministry depends on various other arms of the government for achieving even some basic goals such as reducing transaction costs. Despite the adverse impact of rupee appreciation on export competitiveness, it has not always been possible to counter it just for the benefit of exporters. Facilitating infrastructure development has been a challenge for the government as a whole. On the external front, the weak recovery in the industrialised economies and the disasters in Japan call into question the assumption of world trade bouncing back to pre-crisis levels. Obviously Indian exports ought to be encouraged by every possible means to maintain the recent momentum. But trade policy is about imports too and what matters most in today's macroeconomic calculations is the level of merchandise trade deficit and its implications for the current account of the balance of payments. To a large extent, the growth in imports last year was due to the buoyant economic conditions at home, but the recent spikes in petroleum prices are a big cause for worry as energy imports are bound to enlarge in the coming years.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Why-exports-need-to-be-robust/article14949729.ece
16,3,2011,Contrasting elections,"Niger and Ivory Coast provide a stark contrast in responses to democratic voting. They also pose problems for globalisation theory. Niger's presidential election has been acclaimed as peaceful, free, and fair by 2,000 observers from the African Union (AU), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the European Union, and others. The dictator, General Salou Djibo, who seized power in 2009 when the previous president, Mamadou Tandja, repealed a constitutional ban on a third term in office, is carrying out his promise to step down. The election is no mean achievement. Niger — vast, landlocked, and drought-prone — is desperately poor. Foreign corporations profit hugely by exploiting Niger's minerals; uranium extraction in particular is tainted by poor safety records and high rates of radiation-induced diseases. In addition, the country is a target for al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and faces a long-running Tuareg rebellion in the northern region. As for the election result, the second-round turnout of about 35 per cent is likely to give victory to Mahmadou Issoufou, who, having won the first round by 13 percentage points over an ally of Mr. Tandja's, Seini Oumarou, is now endorsed by many of the first-round losers.
Ivory Coast, on the other hand, has collapsed into near-civil war with a concomitant humanitarian catastrophe. The election was free and fair, and the country is far wealthier than Niger. But the incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo has rejected the result, which was a clear win for Alassane Ouattara. He has unleashed his troops, who machine-gunned an all-women demonstration in Treichville; 80,000 Ivorians have fled to Liberia, and 450,000 have been internally displaced. As essential supplies dwindle, militias claiming to support Mr. Ouattara have created a condition of near-total lawlessness in Abidjan's Abobo district, amid tribal rivalries with other groups. Mr. Ouattara and his entourage are holed up in a luxury resort, and the 8,000 troops of the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI) have only a limited mandate. There is no doubting the popular commitment to the ballot-box in both Niger and Ivory Coast. The key difference lies only partly in the response of the two authoritarian regimes. The AU and ECOWAS have attempted to mediate in Ivory Coast and have imposed sanctions, but to no apparent effect. What Mr. Gbagbo is exposing, among other things, is that unless multilateral bodies create strong mandates for justifiable humanitarian intervention, the theory that national sovereignty has been vitiated in these purportedly globalised times is a vast overstatement.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Contrasting-elections/article14949728.ece
17,3,2011,Bahrainis betrayed,"The Bahraini ruler, Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, has combined a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests with a request that Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) forces take up station in his country. About 1,000 Saudi Arabian troops, together with police from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), have moved in. The Emir has declared that a state of emergency will obtain for the next three months. There have been violent clashes between demonstrators and government forces. Doctors have reportedly been attacked in hospital wards and six opposition leaders, including the human rights campaigner Abduljalil al-Singace, arrested. Moreover, the very nature of the confrontation is changing rapidly. Although the Saudi troops are located 20 km from the capital, Manama, protesters have called their presence an occupation which gives Bahrain's own forces “a green light to kill our people.” Inevitably, leaders and members of the public elsewhere in West Asia, and further afield, have reacted angrily. In Iraq, 4,000 followers of the Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr have marched through Basra, chanting that Bahrain is doing to its own Shia population what Israel is doing to Palestinians in Gaza. Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has likened the foreign troops' arrival to Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
While such responses are a clear result of Emir al-Khalifa's appeal to his neighbours for troops, they also introduce a further and very dangerous element, namely the exploitation of existing sectarian issues. The Bahraini government has long been known for discrimination against its own Shia majority, who comprise 60 per cent of the population. Secondly, Saudi Arabia itself has a 12 per cent Shia minority, most of whom live near the border with Bahrain; furthermore, the Saudi ruling family's commitment to rigid Salafism makes Riyadh very anxious about any Shia influence real or imagined. The United States, not for the first time in this part of the world, is revealing its own impotence. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has criticised the Bahraini crackdown and has called for peaceful political change, but the White House can easily be put under many forms of pressure. Manama can close the U.S. Sixth Fleet base in Bahrain. Secondly, the U.S. imports substantial amounts of Saudi oil, and is also very hostile to any Iranian support for Shia groups in the Gulf, irrespective of the evidence for or against Tehran's actual influence. Tragically for the ordinary people of Bahrain, their largely non-sectarian and entirely justified campaign for democratic reforms is at serious risk of obliteration by a combination of outside religious agendas and Washington's concern with its own instrumental interests above all else.

17,3,2011,Mainstreaming domestic workers,"The International Labour Organisation has done well to include a draft convention on decent work for domestic workers in the agenda for the 100th session of the International Labour Conference, scheduled for June. For centuries the domestic workers have lived along the margins of the international workforce. Well-documented reports by the ILO and other organisations point to the universality of their woes. Entirely informal in nature, domestic work, at its most anguished state, is nothing but a form of slavery; at its best, it is dogged by uncertainty. The most common failing by societies is the exploitation of this ubiquitous group of workers. Data available with the ILO suggest that domestic work ranges from four per cent to 10 per cent of total employment in developing economies and between one per cent and 2.5 per cent in industrialised countries. As the ILO's 2010 report, ‘Decent work for domestic workers', points out, this section of the workforce is “undervalued and poorly regulated” and a major part of it is “overworked, underpaid and unprotected.” An international convention backed by the ILO is an overdue move towards mainstreaming this long-neglected workforce.
In India, as in the rest of the world, there is no clarity on the number of domestic workers. National estimates vary from 4.5 million to more than 100 million. As elsewhere, they are drawn from the informal sector and comprise, largely, women and children. However, there are moves by the Central and various State governments to put in place legal measures that have the potential to create a better future. That only a handful of States have set minimum wages for domestic workers is one clear indication that the country has a long way to go before it gives them statute-backed recognition and dignity. Two recommendations by the Central government's task force merit urgent attention: the need to include domestic work in the Union list of scheduled work for fixation and enforcement of minimum wages, and the extension of welfare measures, including health, maternity, and disability benefits and old age pension, to domestic workers. The current moves, in India and elsewhere, can only be described as a much-delayed attempt to do the minimum decent thing by this crucial segment of the workforce. The hope is that this will be the beginning of a coordinated process that addresses a global social injustice that has persisted for centuries and will continue unless there is political and social will to end it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mainstreaming-domestic-workers/article14950944.ece
18,3,2011,Qadhafi regime climbs down,"In a move preceded by acrimonious argument, the United Nations Security Council voted by 10 to none, with five abstentions, for a no-fly zone throughout Libyan airspace — and Libya caved in by announcing acceptance of the resolution as well as a ceasefire. The no-fly zone, from which aid flights would be exempt, is backed by authority to member states to “take all necessary measures” to enforce compliance; this is diplomatic code for military action. In addition, the Security Council has widened the existing U.N. asset freeze and arms embargo against Tripoli and called on member states to stop mercenaries going to Libya. An occupation force is expressly excluded. The resolution would almost certainly have failed had the League of Arab States (the Arab League), the African Union, and the Secretary-General of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference not already condemned Libyan violations of human rights and international law. Muammar Qadhafi's first response was, in fact, a mindless rant: he said “no mercy” would be shown to residents of Benghazi who resisted him and also threatened retaliatory targeting of all air and maritime traffic in the Mediterranean.
The possibility of air strikes against one's own people, combined with Mr. Qadhafi's imprecations, might bring to mind the widely publicised possibility raised in 2009 of Indian Air Force action against Maoists, which would surely affect civilians as well; this was quickly ruled out. The Libyan strongman's threats, however, were of a quite different order, especially in the context of his regime's acts of brutality against its own people. As for the U.N. Security Council, while its tough stance might have worked for now, the course of action indicated in the resolution is deeply flawed. Jana, the official Libyan news agency, has reported that government forces might cease military operations on Sunday so that rebels could hand over weapons; a “general decision on amnesty” has also been mentioned. It is not clear what kind of Libyan action would qualify as sufficient compliance for the resolution not to be implemented. A no-fly zone would not stop Tripoli's ground troops and armour from advancing on and attacking rebel-held areas; the 1990s NATO no-fly zone in Bosnia failed, with terrible consequences for civilians. Finally, the Security Council resolution has no clear political objective. Is it to protect rebels or all Libyan civilians? Remove Mr. Qadhafi in what will amount to regime change? Something else? The U.N. has not even waited to hear from its Special Envoy to Libya. External military intervention in Libya would be both wrong and disastrous. Given the murky circumstances, India has done well to express its reservations and abstain in the Security Council vote.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Qadhafi-regime-climbs-down/article14952372.ece
18,3,2011,A multi-pronged strategy,"The Reserve Bank of India's action in hiking the short-term policy rates — the repo and the reverse repo rates — by 0.25 percentage point was not unexpected. That the central bank would continue its focus on inflation was also well known. However, the tone of the latest review, the last before the annual credit policy, is distinctly hawkish on inflation. In raising its short-term inflation target from 7 per cent to 8 per cent for March 2011, the RBI is, in effect, admitting that all the monetary measures undertaken so far have not been able to contain inflation within the pre-stated range. (The policy rates have been raised eight times during the year) The tacit admission has led to an explicit recognition that inflation can no longer be attributed substantially to structural, supply side factors relating to food items. In fact, the prices of food articles, barring those of milk, eggs, meat, and fish, have declined since January 2011. However, while the weekly food inflation index has been declining, the inflation linked to non-food manufactured products rose from 4.8 per cent in January to 6.1 per cent in February. This is well above its medium-term trend. The RBI has pointed out that the acceleration is spread across manufacturing activities, indicating that producers are able to pass on higher input prices to consumers. High petroleum prices and the increase in administered coal prices have heightened the risks further.
The latest budget, by aiming at a sharp reduction in the fiscal deficit, gives comfort to the RBI's inflation containment strategy on the demand side. Yet questions have been raised as to whether it would be possible to compress public expenditure so aggressively. Nor is it certain that the outlays for subsidies on petroleum, and fertilizers as well as for the government's flagship social sector programmes will be sufficient. Economic growth has been in line with expectations. Although there are a number of favourable indicators such as buoyant direct and indirect tax collections, significant downside risks have emerged. On the external front, the central bank takes comfort from the fact that the current account deficit at the end of this year will be lower than expected, at around 2.5 per cent of GDP. However, this year has seen robust export growth and a relatively stable inflow on account of remittances and invisibles, factors that cannot be taken for granted. There is a need to focus on the quality of capital inflows, with greater emphasis on attracting more stable foreign direct investment.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-multi-pronged-strategy/article14952371.ece
21,3,2011,Learning from Fukushima,"Events over the last nine days at the crippled six-reactor Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) complex, since the unprecedented earthquake-tsunami combine struck Japan's north-eastern coast, seem to be slowly moving towards a stable situation. Barring the sporadic spikes during March 15-16, radiation levels at distances more than 20 km from the site have not been abnormal. The single event of radioactive iodine release on March 12 seems, however, to have found its way into the food chain. But in the unfolding story of this nuclear disaster, the third worst after Three Mile Island in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986, there are a lot of unanswered questions. Evading safety requirements seems to be an endemic problem in the nuclear industry, as is a general lack of transparency on safety issues. For India post-Fukushima, the preparedness of the nuclear establishment to ensure the safety of its nuclear power plants, current as well as those planned, when faced with an extremely unlikely accident is a vital concern. While the Fukushima NPP structures withstood the impact of a shock of 9.2 magnitude 130 km from the site, the 10 metre high tsunami waves — 2.5 metres above the safety margin provided — exposed the ill-preparedness of the operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). A former Vice-Chairman of Japan's Nuclear Safety Commission, Kenji Sumita, wrote: “Every step TEPCO has taken is a day late and a dollar short. The release of information from TEPCO is even further behind.” If this could happen in Japan, an industrially advanced country with a high level of safety consciousness, one can well imagine the situation in India.
While the three operational boiling water reactors (BWRs) of General Electric's 1970s vintage Mark-1 design shut down automatically, as required, following the earthquake, TEPCO could not maintain the continued cooling necessary to remove the residual decay heat from their reactor vessels. Although this is only 3 per cent of the total power, it can last for over a month. This, it appears, was due to the absence of adequate back-up arrangements, which became clear following the station blackout caused by the tsunami. The emergency diesel generators that came on stopped functioning after an hour; the batteries packed up after eight hours; and the mobile generators that were rolled in failed to activate the pumps even as water levels in the reactors were falling, making a core meltdown distinctly possible. It appears that the flooding by the tsunami had also damaged the switchgears. Inadequate on-site water inventory also seems to have been a problem considering that sea water pumping was resorted to almost immediately. This also suggests that the reactors did not have appropriate passive cooling measures retrofitted for such a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). Indeed, in 1992 the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) highlighted several safety-related issues with the containment features of Mark 1 BWRs, which significantly included alternative water supply for reactor vessel injection and hydrogen control. The NRC specifically called for maintaining an inert nitrogen atmosphere in the containment during shutdown. The hydrogen explosions in two units suggest the absence of nitrogen-inerted containment at Fukushima. Further, one of the serious problems with Mark 1 reactors is the smaller containment volume to power ratio. This results in higher containment pressure, rendering the reactor more vulnerable to breach than later BWR designs or even the earlier Tarapur type pre-Mark 1 design.
In the Indian context, the issue of safety of the Tarapur nuclear power plant, which houses BWRs similar to Fukushima, has been raised. While containment itself is not an issue here, TAPS maintains a large inventory of water in huge reservoirs and has a much bigger suppression pool than those in Fukushima, which exploded in one of its units. Further, improved and redundant back-up power as well as passive cooling have been incorporated at TAPS. As regards the other mainstay reactors of the Pressurised Heavy Water (PHWR) kind, the safety features are much superior to earlier generation BWRs. Unlike Light Water Reactors (LWRs) — boiling or pressurised — PHWRs have separate coolant and (low temperature) moderator circuits and the reactor vessel calandria itself is maintained in a large water vault. The on-site water inventory for cooling in PHWRs is thus inherently very large. In addition, they have other mutually independent parallel means to remove the decay heat in case LOCA occurs. The more recent designs of PHWRs have added passive cooling features as well. The yet-to-be-built Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) has a passive cooling feature that is intrinsic to the design. The new generation LWRs that are being imported are also expected to have passive cooling features. The Russian VVER-1000 of the kind being built at Kudankulam and Areva's EPR1600 have, in addition, a ‘core catcher' at the bottom of the reactor vessel to contain the core melt in case of a meltdown and prevent it from leaching into the soil below.
In light of the Fukushima accident, the lesson for India is not necessarily a roll-back on the nuclear energy option. It is that there is an imperative need to allow for the unimagined very low probability event with high impact potential in safety analyses. The current paradigm and methodology of Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PSA) may have to change once the details and the exact timeline of events at Fukushima become available. Notwithstanding the assurances given by the Department of Atomic Energy, the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board — which needs to be empowered — must carry out a thorough technical safety review of all the nuclear power plants, including those on the import list. This must be done against new benchmarks, and regular safety audits of each plant must be done and the results made public. Transparency in matters of nuclear safety is needed more than ever, post-Fukushima.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Learning-from-Fukushima/article14669652.ece
22,3,2011,Obama in Bush's footsteps,"Less than two days after the start of attacks on Libya by the United States, British, and French warplanes and missiles, and as news and images of civilian casualties and destroyed buildings spread, powerful dissenting voices are being heard. Russia, which abstained from the United Nations vote, cites civilian casualties in calling on Britain, France, and the U.S. to stop using “non-selective” force; China, which also abstained, has expressed regret over civilian casualties. Turkey has blocked NATO from taking over the enforcement of the no-fly zone. Above all, the 23-state Arab League — which, by supporting Britain and France in their proposal for a U.N.-enforced no-fly zone, provided essential credibility and thereby persuaded President Barack Obama to back the idea — has expressed its doubts. The League's Secretary-General, Amr Moussa, condemns “bombardment of civilians.” In addition, the operation is already showing what is euphemistically called mission creep, with Muammar Qadhafi's ground forces and his own residential compound being targeted.
The parallels with other episodes of western military adventurism since the early 1990s grow stronger by the day. First, the limitations of air power have been repeatedly exposed. In Kosovo, President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair were so terrified of casualties among their own forces that they ordered bombing from 15,000 feet, which was inaccurate and ineffective. That mission rapidly expanded to include attacks on Serbian infrastructure. In Afghanistan, indiscriminate NATO bombing has taken a huge and continuing civilian toll and caused great enmity towards the invading westerners. Now, although Libya's anti-aircraft defences have been attacked, the regime can still make low-level sorties very dangerous. That raises the spectre of a land invasion, despite the U.N. Resolution's explicit interdiction. Furthermore, like George W. Bush, the western protagonists have been less than clear about their purposes. U.S. commanders say regime change is not part of the plan. But British Secretary of State for Defence Liam Fox says Mr. Qadhafi is a “legitimate target”, and Prime Minister David Cameron insists that the Libyan leader must go. An even uglier element the current attacks have in common with the 2003 invasion of Iraq is the domestic political factor. France's President Nicolas Sarkozy, facing heavy electoral defeat in 2012, thinks he has nothing to lose by international grandstanding. The parallels therefore must include the morality tales of George W. Bush and Tony Blair. Countless Iraqi civilians paid for that with their lives. Now Libyan civilians are dying to get Mr. Sarkozy re-elected, and Mr. Obama, by backing the attacks on Libya, is following in his far-Right predecessor's footsteps.

22,3,2011,The tightening noose,"The move to impeach the disgraced Sikkim High Court Chief Justice P.D. Dinakaran is inching forward. Constituted under the Judges Inquiry Act 1968, the three-member committee comprising two judges and a distinguished jurist has framed 16 charges against him for a shocking range of offences, including corruption, land-grab, abuse of judicial office, destruction of evidence, and violation of human rights. The committee, reconstituted after a judge recused himself following objections that he and Justice Dinakaran had heard many cases together, has taken a little over a year to arrive at framing the charges. Under Section 3(4) of the Judges Inquiry Act, such definite charges “together with a statement of the grounds on which each such charge is based” will be communicated to the judge to enable him or her to present a written statement of defence. Justice Dinakaran has been given until April 9, 2011 to reply. This will be considered and, if the panel deems it necessary, it will amend the charges and provide him “a reasonable opportunity of presenting a fresh written statement of defence” [Section 3 (8)].
With the impeachment noose slowly tightening, it remains to be seen whether Justice Dinakaran will do what he ought to have done long ago: resign. The temptation to ride it out — an attitude he has shared with Calcutta High Court Justice Soumitra Sen, who also faces a move for removal — stems from the unwieldiness of the process, which has not resulted in a single impeachment yet. Removing a judge lacking in integrity requires a two-third majority in both Houses of Parliament after various procedures are completed; it is far more difficult than dismissing a government, which can be brought down by a simple majority. The rationale for making the dismissal of judges so difficult was to insulate the higher judiciary from executive interference. But experience has shown that procedures to protect judicial independence have been exploited to promote judicial impunity. The Judicial Standards and Accountability Bill, which is meant to replace the Judges Inquiry Act, contains less cumbersome mechanisms to deal with complaints against erring members of the higher judiciary, including the Chief Justice of India. The proposed legislation, which has provisions to prevent judges suspected of corruption or impropriety from being elevated to higher courts, promises to make a significant difference to the manner in which judges are appointed and removed. The question is: what and who is holding it up?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-tightening-noose/article14956344.ece
23,3,2011,All set for the fight,"By taking three weeks for their pre-electoral exertions such as cobbling together alliances and identifying seats and candidates, political parties in Tamil Nadu have taken up half the time the Election Commission of India gave them to face a general election to the State Assembly on April 13. None of the parties was quite ready for elections at such uncomfortably short notice, but the election authorities perhaps felt that the campaign phase might be better supervised and the possibility of voter bribery and more subtle blandishments more effectively curbed if the campaign phase was kept to the minimum. The campaign dust is set to swirl from now on, marking the beginning of an acrimonious spell of electioneering. This is essentially a two-cornered contest between the fronts led by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). History bears down on the DMK as no party has been elected back to power since 1984. But its veteran leader, Chief Minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi, nurtures hope of bucking this trend, armed with what he believes is a winning election manifesto and a track record of implementing a number of welfare measures. On the other side, the AIADMK led by a charismatic and strong leader has roped in the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) led by actor Vijayakant, whose ambition to emerge a leading player in the State political stage has been tempered by experience and is now a willing ally in the project to oust the DMK regime. With the Left parties on her side, the alliance leader, former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, will seek to cash in on the DMK's 2G-related travails and other embarrassments, besides anti-incumbency ingredients such as the price spiral, the power shortage, and allegations of corruption and ‘family rule.'
With DMK-Congress ties coming under strain in the shadow of the Supreme Court-monitored investigation into the 2G spectrum allocation scandal, the Congress resorted to unabashed arm-twisting to extract 63 seats from the DMK kitty, thereby shrinking the ruling party's own presence in the poll fray to just 119 candidates of its own and a few from minor allies contesting on its symbol. There is no chance of the DMK forming a government on its own strength, as any party would need 118 seats to touch the majority mark in the 234-member legislature. Despite the fight being mainly between two muscular opponents, the bewildering array of smaller parties — which bank on caste support or whose sway is confined to regions — in both fronts makes Tamil Nadu a laboratory specimen for notions of alliance arithmetic and inter-party chemistry. The alliance leaders will hope that the bitterness and brinkmanship of the negotiation phase would not spill over to the campaign stage. But across the divide, the fight is set to be fierce.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/All-set-for-the-fight/article14958563.ece
23,3,2011,Saleh tries to hang on,"President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the strongman who has ruled Yemen for 32 years, is resisting all demands by a growingly popular opposition coalition, the Joint Meeting Parties (JMP), to step down immediately. Following the death of 52 people in shooting by government loyalists in the capital, Sanaa, Mr. Saleh has imposed a 30-day state of emergency. He has promised a “constitutional” transfer of power at the end of the year. He seems untroubled by the resignation of several Ministers, provincial governors, and diplomats over the shootings. Even the backing given by many senior military officers to the people's uprising has made little difference to his obduracy. Protesters say the defections enable them to ignore the President's warnings of a long civil war. But the leader's confidence in his capacity to retain office seems undiminished.
The reasons for the President's intransigence almost certainly lie in the nature of the Yemeni state. The country, unusually for the region, has universal franchise for all citizens over 18 and also elects a 301-seat House of Representatives, which currently includes a woman. But Mr. Saleh has consistently evaded the task of creating the institutions of a modern democratic state – the very thing ordinary people throughout North Africa and West Asia are demanding now. The elected chamber co-exists with a presidentially appointed and manipulated 111-member Shura Council. As though this were not enough, Mr. Saleh has been adept at playing rival tribes against one another to sustain his power base. This makes it difficult even for high-profile defectors, such as General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, to carry credibility with the public, as he has been involved in the brutal repression of Shia Zaidis in northern Yemen and is tainted by his long membership of a venal political elite. Now, however, it is clear that the strongman cannot rule, and the people of Yemen are not willing to be ruled, in the old way. Inspired and encouraged by the success of the popular ‘revolutions' in Tunisia and Egypt, ordinary Yemens want to throw off the authoritarian yoke and win for themselves basic freedoms in a modern democratic polity. It is not at all clear when and how Mr. Saleh's heavy-handed rule will end but when it does, his successors must cope with tough problems — an al-Qaeda presence, even if it is small, tribal rivalries, and socio-economic challenges, starting with an unemployment rate of about 35 per cent.

23,3,2011,Let the quarters begin,"The current edition of the Cricket World Cup has already been more of a success than the previous one, partly by design, partly by accident. After the early departures of India and Pakistan in 2007, the format was re-structured to ensure the top teams reached the business end: six league matches as opposed to three meant a side of lesser ability couldn't progress from the preliminary level on the strength of one above-par performance. Fortunately, the heart-warming underdog stories of Ireland and Bangladesh in 2007 weren't done away with altogether. Ireland showed it has improved into a team capable of defeating the big boys while the Netherlands nearly pulled off an upset of its own. Bangladesh was schizophrenic, capable of both world-class cricket under pressure, demonstrated in the match against England, and abject surrender, seen in the collapses against West Indies and South Africa. England nearly ruined the script of the best eight teams reaching the quarterfinals, but it provided rich drama in the process. The league stage had its moments — it wasn't until the last game that the quarterfinal fixtures were determined — but it didn't escape the tedium that is common with embarrassing mismatches and inconsequential contests.
The intention to prolong the presence of the contenders has, however, also led to a situation where either India, the perceived favourite ahead of the tournament, or Australia, which has won the last three World Cups, will make it to the last four. This risk was inherent in the inclusion of an additional knockout round — the quarterfinal — but if the organisers had had their way the marquee encounter would have been saved for later. No side has stood out thus far, confirming this is the most open of World Cups. Australia isn't as formidable or as feared as it once was, but it tends to do well in knockout games. India's bowling and fielding haven't inspired confidence nor has the tendency when batting to self-destruct from positions of strength; it needs to pull itself together if it is to get past Australia. South Africa and Sri Lanka appear the teams with the most options. But the former has yet to answer questions about its mental frailty in crunch games and the latter is vulnerable to being overpowered. Pakistan and West Indies are the wild cards; New Zealand continues to make the most of what it has; and England, which often teetered on the brink before surviving, may believe the force is with it. The extra knockout game has ensured that the team with the most-rounded roster and the strongest desire will triumph. It will also be the team that best compensates for its weaknesses, which are more or less evenly distributed among the quarterfinalists.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Let-the-quarters-begin/article14957478.ece
23,3,2011,Water woes,"Despite rapid technological progress and economic growth, close to 900 million people the world over do not use drinking water from improved sources and over 2.6 billion lack access to decent sanitation facilities. This indefensible public failing, which is conspicuous in the developing world, comes with tremendous economic and social costs. Safe drinking water and basic sanitation, as United Nations organisations have often emphasised, help prevent water-related diseases. Specifically when it comes to diarrhoea, which kills 1.6 million annually, improved water supply reduces morbidity by 20 per cent while improved sanitation cuts it by 37.5 per cent. The indirect benefits of providing access to drinking water to households, such as the time saved by women and children — who are often carriers of this precious commodity from source — are reflected, for example, in better school attendance. The debilitating effect of the lack of sanitation facilities is seldom appreciated. A World Bank study placed the total economic impact of inadequate sanitation in India at Rs.2.44 trillion (6.4 per cent of India's GDP in 2006). Three ongoing UN initiatives spotlight the importance of water and sanitation: the Millennium Development Goals, the Water for Life Decade (2005-2015), and the annual World Water Day (March 22) which had “Water for Cities” as the theme this year.
India, its urban areas included, is a laggard, especially in sanitation. More than 37 per cent of urban India's human excreta is unsafely disposed of, posing significant health hazards. The country is also home to the world's largest number of persons who defecate in the open (665 million persons of a global total of 1.1 billion). Shockingly, 4,66,853 elementary schools did not have toilet facilities, going by the data for 2009. The crisis looming over urban India is best revealed by a central government survey between December 2009 and March 2010. In this exercise, which ranked the 423 class-I cities according to metrics set by the National Urban Sanitation Policy, not a single one was eligible to be in the top slot of a “green city” (which needed to score at least 90 per cent) and only four were “blue cities” (67 per cent to 90 per cent). With 189 cities categorised as “red” (less than 33 per cent), and the remaining 230 in the “black” zone, it is evident that India has a long way to go in providing this basic infrastructure, which not only offers minimum dignity to life but is the elementary requirement for a healthy society. High economic growth rates, even if they are sustained, do not such a society make.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Water-woes/article14957476.ece
25,3,2011,The hunted turns hunter,"For an opposition party, the Congress is in a strange situation in Kerala: the party is more on the defensive than on the attack. After five years in power, the Left Democratic Front led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has effectively revived memories of corruption scams and sex scandals of the previous Congress-led United Democratic Front. A former Minister of the UDF, R. Balakrishna Pillai of the Kerala Congress (B), is in jail after being sentenced by the Supreme Court to a year's rigorous imprisonment in the Idamalayar hydel project corruption case. Mr. Pillai was felled by a sustained political campaign and legal battle waged by CPI(M) leader and Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan — who is now using the success in court to great advantage in the electoral arena. Another former Minister of the UDF, P.K. Kunhalikutty, the general secretary of the Indian Union Muslim League, is facing fresh allegations in the ice cream parlour sex scandal. Moreover, the Congress is having a tough time fending off charges of corruption directed at the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre. Thus what looked like a one-horse race in October 2010, when the UDF decisively won the local body polls at every tier, is now developing into a keen contest.
However, the LDF faces the challenge of fighting off the anti-incumbency factor and voter fatigue. After 1977, when the Congress was voted back to power, Kerala voters have never given a combine two consecutive terms in office. There is still a substantial gap for the LDF to bridge, and to do this Mr. Achuthanandan and the CPI(M) will need to sustain the newly gained momentum till the very end. The UDF is trying to position itself as pro-development, a euphemism for pro-industry, in an attempt to take up the space provided by the pro-labour policies of the LDF government. But the Cabinet approval for the agreement on the revival of the much-delayed SmartCity Project in Kochi in February this year might blunt criticism on this score. Another concern for the CPI(M) is the factionalism involving State party secretary Pinarayi Vijayan and the Chief Minister; the LDF will be hoping the bad blood at the top will not seep down to the cadre level. Mr. Achuthanandan was given the ticket only at the intervention of the party's Polit Bureau. Whether he can work up a groundswell of support, as he did in 2006 when he was similarly nominated after being denied the ticket, remains to be seen. What is likely is that after two one-sided contests in 2001 (when the UDF won 99 of the 140 seats) and 2006 (when the LDF took 99) in a State where ideology and policies matter, 2011 will witness a close finish.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-hunted-turns-hunter/article14959874.ece
25,3,2011,Liz Taylor: art and allure,"Ask young people what they remember of Elizabeth Taylor and the answer is likely to be in the form of a furrowed brow. But there is little doubt they would have heard of her. That is how she left us, more a creature of the public consciousness than a prisoner of the pictures. As the stormy spouse of Richard Burton (and six others), she came to embody the romantic pursuit of lifelong love. As an AIDS activist, at a time few people were fully aware of the disease and fewer still wanted to be tainted with its homosexual associations, she came to represent strength and courage. As an outspoken critic of former U.S. President George W. Bush's handling of the Iraq war — in protest, she declined to attend the 75th Annual Academy Awards — she revealed a hitherto unsuspected political side. As gossip fodder, she, with her reckless lifestyle, spilling over with yachts and diamonds, virtually birthed the tabloid frenzy that envelops stars today. And as a world-class beauty, her name came to stand for physical perfection, even to those who had never seen a film of hers. It's a pity that these associations today have overshadowed what she was foremost — a wonderful actress, winner of two Oscars, co-star to giants such as Spencer Tracy, Richard Burton, Marlon Brando, Paul Newman, Montgomery Clift, and James Dean.
Taylor's cinematic career effectively ended when she won her second Oscar for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, in which she played a blowsy harridan opposite Burton. She was terrifyingly convincing as a wife on the brink of a marriage breakdown and a woman at the edge of sanity. But the public seemed less interested in her interpretation of Edward Albee's scabrous dialogue than in her intimacies with her co-star and real-life husband. Were Liz and Dick simply performing their parts, or were they making thinly disguised art of their real lives? This voyeuristic cloud completely eclipsed what was — and still is — a chillingly splendid portrait of the mysteries of marriage. Thereafter, Taylor's films (many of them with Burton) were mostly much less memorable, and her fame came less from being a star on the screen and more from being a regular in the tabloid press. For her greatest screen roles, we must look much earlier — he luminous child-aspirant of National Velvet; the pampered socialite of A Place in the Sun; the generations-spanning matriarch of Giant; the tempestuous empress in Cleopatra; and the wide-eyed manipulator of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, where she is breathtakingly beautiful, the very embodiment of temptation that Tennessee Williams dangled, like a ripe fruit, in front of his physically crippled hero. Few actresses have combined art and allure with such effortlessness.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Liz-Taylor-art-and-allure/article14959872.ece
26,3,2011,What it looks like in Assam,"Assam's two-phase Assembly election, scheduled for April 4 and 11, is quite different from any contest that the State has witnessed in the post-Emergency period: this is the first time an incumbent party is seeking a mandate for a third consecutive term. For Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, the contest presents an opportunity to make history — as the second Chief Minister in Assam after Bimala Prasad Chaliha to ascend the gadi thrice in succession. Assembly and Lok Sabha elections since 1991 have been overshadowed by insurgent violence and boycott calls but it is unlikely there will be any major disruption or sabotage this time. It augurs well for the democratic process that the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) and the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) — weakened over time and more recently by the earnest crackdown on their bases in Bangladesh by the Sheikh Hasina government — have initiated talks with the government. The Paresh Barua-led faction of ULFA and the Ranjan Daimary faction of NDFB, which have kept out of the peace process, will be desperately looking for chinks in the security armour to carry out sporadic strikes to prove their presence on the ground and to win media attention. A recent bomb blast at Rajiv Bhawan in Guwahati by the ULFA faction and an ambush on Border Security Force (BSF) in Kokrajhar by the NDFB faction suggest there is no room for complacency.
Although the Congress and it fellow-traveller, the Bodoland People's Front (BPF), have not been able to come to an understanding on seat sharing, their post-poll alliance looks set to continue. There are also indications that in the event of falling short of the majority mark, the ruling party will fall back on the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), which caused an erosion in Congress vote banks among immigrant Muslim settlers in 2006. The Left parties were hoping that the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) would take the lead in uniting all non-Congress, non-BJP parties to present a viable alternative to the Congress-BPF coalition. This followed the General House of the AGP adopting a resolution calling for the severance of poll ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party, which had made gains at the expense of the regional party in the 2009 Lok Sabha contest. Nevertheless, the vacillations of the AGP leadership continue. The regional party tried to push through its proposal of a ‘grand alliance' of all opposition parties, which was rejected by the Left and the AIUDF and by the BJP as well. The opposition parties claim there is strong anti-incumbency sentiment engendered by the scams and by alleged misrule in the State. However, in the absence of any pre-poll alliance based on an agreed minimum programme, it is the ruling combination that seems to have the advantage.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/What-it-looks-like-in-Assam/article14961174.ece
26,3,2011,Budget rollbacks and promise,"The smooth passage of the Finance Bill by Parliament was facilitated by the slew of concessions extended by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee. As many as 47 amendments to the original bill were passed. The concessions aggregate Rs.1,500 crore, a large portion of this attributable to procedural changes in the method of levying and collecting taxes. For instance, the deferment by three months of a new procedure to collect service tax on an accrual basis instead of on actual receipts will mean less revenue than what was envisaged in the budget. Manufacturers of readymade garments, especially those in the small-scale segment, have got relief by way of higher excise duty abatement. By far the most anticipated announcement was the rollback of the 5 per cent service tax on certain grades of hospitals and diagnostic services in the private sector. This budget proposal drew a good deal of flak. Had it been implemented, it would have increased the already high health care costs. However, while the government will now forgo around Rs.300 crore, it was not just revenue considerations that were behind the proposal. The idea of bringing the various entities in the booming health care segment under the tax net has been around for quite a while. Besides, as the Finance Minister said, the move was meant to prepare the ground for the Goods and Services Tax (GST). It is unlikely that this sector will be exempted when the GST is finally in place. The principal idea behind the GST and the Direct Taxes Code (DTC) — the two key reform measures — is to have a tax structure with moderate taxes, minimum exemptions, and wide coverage.
Mr. Mukherjee has kept the promise he made in the budget speech by introducing a Constitution Amendment Bill to pave the way for the GST. Essentially, the Bill seeks to give powers to the States to tax services and to the Centre to levy duties beyond the factory gate. The Bill incorporates features that seek to resolve the sharp differences between the Centre and the States over the implementation of the far-going structural change. A GST Council, headed by the Union Finance Minister, and a GST Dispute Settlement Authority are proposed. In bringing the Bill before Parliament Mr. Mukherjee may have kept his word. But it will be over-optimistic to expect the GST to become a reality on April 1, 2012. The legislation, which will now go to a standing committee, requires two-thirds support in both houses of Parliament and to be ratified by at least half the number of State legislatures.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Budget-rollbacks-and-promise/article14961173.ece
27,3,2011,Green reform,"Minister for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh must be commended for his frank comments on the state of the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) process. Many well-regarded scientists have been making the point that the EIA, a mechanism instituted by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in the early phase of India's economic liberalisation and amended in later years, has been turned into a joke because it is left to the project proponent to arrange for the EIA report. This dyfunctional system has produced only a thriving industry of consultants. Many of them without the requisite qualifications; some are nothing more than paid pipers. It is no surprise that several reports submitted by these consultants have been exposed as plain cut-and-paste reproductions of other publications. Among the prominent examples of ill-advised shortcuts leading to flawed conclusions is the Kudremukh iron ore mining project in Karnataka, which was eventually ordered closed. In that case, only rigorous assessment by the Indian Institute of Science and other agencies produced evidence of harm to fragile ecology; comprehensive study by the Centre for Wildlife Studies documented environmental damage on account of the sediment load in the Bhadra river. Evidently, the earlier EIA reports based on rapid assessments provided little insight. This experience is not unique and there is a strong case to introduce stringent checks now. Reform should begin with the choice of agency to conduct the impact assessment, and include the setting of wide terms of reference.
The task of reforming the EIA process is a challenging one for Mr. Ramesh, who has initiated welcome steps to introduce transparency in his Ministry. State-level authorities must also be made partners in the effort because some categories of environmental clearances come within their ambit. Independent studies of the working of expert appraisal committees formed under the EIA Notification of 2006 show that the rejection rate for projects in sensitive sectors such as construction, industry, thermal power plants, and mining is suspiciously low. The Union Ministry's discovery that some consultants submitted wrong reports, resulting in penal action, is proof positive of systemic rot. The cure lies in genuine, science-based EIA. All this is not to say that fresh barriers must be erected to development. What needs to be emphasised is the importance of assessing externalities associated with individual projects and consider them in perspective. The loss of ecology has irreversible, inter-generational consequences. The protection of air, water, soil health, and biodiversity should be primary environmental imperatives.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Green-reform/article14964064.ece
27,3,2011,Open-ended war,"The announcement by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) that it is to enforce the United Nations no-fly zone over Libya confirms the extent of confusion over western policy on Libya. The alliance's Secretary-General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, says it will command only the no-fly zone, and admits that there will be two operations, one run by NATO and the other, comprising the arms embargo and air strikes — which Turkey says go beyond the United Nations resolution on intervention — by a “coalition.” There may be yet more squabbling to come, not least because the decision on the transfer of command was preceded by a week of angry disputes among NATO's 28 members. Turkey, in particular, objects strongly to what it sees as French plans to control the scope and nature of the current U.N.-backed action. It has also accused President Nicolas Sarkozy of using the confrontation with Tripoli as a launching pad for his own re-election campaign.
Such issues, however, only form a subset of wider problems. One of those is domestic public support. In the United Kingdom, backing — usually high at the start of such military adventurism — is 45 per cent, with 35 per cent against; that is even worse than the 53-39 per cent reported when the illegal 2003 Iraq invasion began. In the United States, 74 per cent favour multilateral action to protect Libyans against their current dictatorship; but 79 per cent express concern over the continuing violence in Libya. In North Africa and West Asia, public feeling against the intervention is hardening rapidly, not least because of French Interior Minister Claude Guéant's foolish comment that his country was leading a “crusade” to stop President Muammar Qadhafi killing fellow-Libyans. Secondly, President Obama, whose administration refuses to call the Libya mission a war, is under pressure to explain the policy and to specify an exit strategy. His attempt to transfer command to NATO and his European allies will achieve neither; the U.S. will remain the major participant, but involving NATO will reduce the accountability of the warmongers to their electorates. The absence of clear aims, furthermore, heightens the risk of an open-ended conflict, into which the foreign participants will almost certainly be drawn more and more deeply — with the additional risk that the main aim becomes regime change and not civilian protection. In view of the vagueness of the U.N. Security Council resolution on the no-fly zone, it is regrettable that Russia and China abstained instead of vetoing the resolution that has enabled this military aggression and expanding war in an already tormented region.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Open-ended-war/article14964063.ece
28,3,2011,Padding up for better ties,"Irrespective of whether ‘cricket diplomacy' between New Delhi and Islamabad gets third-time lucky — Zia-ul Haq tried it in 1987 and Pervez Musharraf in 2005 — Prime Minister Manmohan Singh must be commended for sticking his neck out and inviting Pakistan's President and Prime Minister to Mohali to share in an event that will be watched by hundreds of millions of people in the subcontinent and around the world on Wednesday. Since the high-excitement World Cup semi-final between India and Pakistan coincides with the resumption of full spectrum dialogue after a hiatus of 27 months, much is being read into the invitation, which has been received in Pakistan with guarded optimism amid talk of a possible high-level interaction on non-cricketing issues as well. But even if nothing tangible comes out of it, the sight of the two premiers sitting side-by-side cheering their teams and applauding good efforts from either side makes for powerful imagery. Cynics on both sides of the border have sought to dismiss this latest edition of cricket diplomacy as a non-starter, given the general impression that neither Prime Minister carries much weight within the government he heads. In Pakistan, Dr. Singh is viewed as a man isolated in his advocacy of better relations with Islamabad and some have interpreted the invitation as an attempt by the telecom-scam-cum-WikiLeaks-bruised premier to deflect attention from the damage caused to his image.
Whatever happens on the cricket field on Wednesday, there can be no denying the feel-good factor Dr. Singh's invitation and the Pakistan President's reciprocal gesture of pardoning a long-incarcerated Indian prisoner have generated. The Facebook generation seems to have caught on to the spirit; creating a ‘Together We Shall Win' link that is already celebrating the subcontinent's half-a-chance at winning the cup and deciding to cheer together irrespective of which team goes on to Mumbai for the final. Since this is the generation for whom today's policymakers are supposed to be making decisions, the sentiment ought to be celebrated even if history is replete with instances of bilateral relations souring on one pretext or another, including non-inclusion of Pakistani players in the IPL teams last season. A U.S. Embassy cable, accessed by The Hindu through WikiLeaKs and published on March 15, reported former National Security Adviser M.K. Narayanan's embarrassingly frank observation that the Prime Minister was isolated within his own inner circle on the question of how to deal with Pakistan. On this crucial issue, it is Dr. Singh who is right and he must be supported in staying the course. Non-engagement with Pakistan is not a real option for India; and engagement, if it is to be meaningful, must necessarily encompass dialogue on outstanding issues.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Padding-up-for-better-ties/article14965346.ece
28,3,2011,Unintended boosters,"The Economic Survey 2010-11 makes the fairly obvious point that it is necessary to get the micro-foundations of the economy right for macroeconomic development. Among the key economic problems affecting the micro or unit level is of course inflation, which has remained persistently high for the greater part of this year. The RBI has recently raised its inflation target for 2010-11 by one percentage point to eight per cent. Food inflation, after showing signs of moderating, has climbed back to double digits. One of the key tasks is to understand how inflation, especially food inflation, affects the poor particularly severely. Not all segments are partaking of the fruits of economic growth in the same measure. While the average Indian may be better off — per capita incomes have risen by about 7 per cent — some sections of the people are worse off because their nominal incomes have hardly grown and inflation has negated whatever growth there has been. Moreover, despite the high real GDP growth, many in the bottom quintile of India's rural population, whose expenditure on food accounts for 67 per cent of their spending, are bound to be worse off.
The case for comprehensive policies to support inclusive growth and providing safety nets to the poor has never been stronger. It is certain that the relatively high inflation will accompany the expected high economic growth well into the medium term. In an insightful analysis the Survey points out that some undoubtedly beneficial developments have the unintended consequence of stoking inflation. Financial inclusion is on top of the agenda because it aims at encouraging particularly rural households that hold their savings in cash to deposit them with banks. Once the previously dormant money gets into a bank or a mutual fund, it automatically gets lent to other people, increasing the total money supply in the system. There is evidence from around the world that monetisation of the economy and the roping in of more and more people into formal financial systems add to the pressure on prices. Integration with the global economy can also create inflationary pressures. In India and other emerging economies the purchasing power parity (PPP) is low to begin with, but once industrialisation gathers pace, the PPP correction has to become smaller. This happens partly because of exchange rate changes but more substantially because the prices of basic non-traded goods and unskilled labour that ruled low catch up with the prices in the developed world.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Unintended-boosters/article14965345.ece
29,3,2011,Tracking Sher Khan,"The results of the year-long national tiger estimation exercise indicate that, overall, there has been a significant rise in numbers of the charismatic big cats. The population estimate for 2010 is 1,706 tigers (based on a lower limit of 1,571 and an upper limit of 1,875) compared with 1,411 four years ago. The latest estimate includes those in the Sunderbans, which were not counted earlier. To conservation-minded citizens and research scientists, this increase is extraordinary, given the severe pressures on the habitat of the animal. The answer is to be found, in part, in the science-based conservation methods that some States have adopted in recent years, and the transparent, constructive partnership they have forged with research organisations. Arguably, the best such ‘public-private-partnership' model is to be found in Karnataka, where the Forest department and independent scientists have, over time, evolved a rigorous protocol. That approach consists of camera trap-based data collection, prey species assessment, enforcement of anti-poaching laws, and, crucially, convincing forest communities to accept substantial compensation to voluntarily relocate and make space for the tiger. Tamil Nadu also has a keen focus on conservation. It comes as no surprise that the Western Ghats, which straddle these States (and Kerala), have achieved a big increase in tiger numbers. Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh have, by contrast, registered a decrease.
Encouraging as the overall results are, there is a need to progress to a more intensive system of counting tigers and their prey. This exercise needs to be carried out not every four years, but annually, to assess changes in ‘source populations' of tigers that are confined to a small part of their natural range. There are an estimated 40 such distinct groups across India and they hold the key to sustainable conservation efforts in the long term. It is important that these are monitored using fool-proof tools such as camera traps, rather than by forest guards on foot patrols. The foundation for such study was laid nearly two years ago through a consensus reached among officials of the National Tiger Conservation Authority, the Wildlife Institute of India, research scientists, and leading conservationists on the methodology for future monitoring and assessment. Essentially, this consists of the capture-recapture method of camera trapping supplemented by DNA analysis. With a supportive Environment and Forests Minister in Jairam Ramesh, the Authority should quickly operationalise a national action plan to monitor tigers year-round and ensure that local extinctions get as much attention as national increases.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Tracking-Sher-Khan/article14966451.ece
29,3,2011,Highly skilled early knappers,"Though our early ancestors used stone tools for more than two million years, certain techniques used for shaping them into more potent weapons are of relatively recent innovation. Pressure flaking, one of the techniques used to produce sharp-edged points on the tool, was believed to have originated merely 20,000 years ago. But a paper published online in Science (“Early use of pressure flaking on lithic artefacts at Blombos Cave, South Africa,” by Vincent Mourre et al., October 29, 2010) shows that our ancestors used this technique 75,000 years ago. The samples studied were collected from the Blombos Cave near southern Cape, South Africa. Pressure flaking involves the use of objects to exert pressure at the tips of stone tools to remove small flakes. The finished tools thus produced have thinner, sharper, and narrower bifacial points that are difficult to achieve by using only percussion. Pressure flaking gives the toolmaker a greater degree of control on the final shape of the tool edge. Detailed study of the flaked points and comparison with experimentally produced pressure-flaked points by the authors helped confirm that the silcrete artefacts from the Blombos Cave were heat-treated prior to flaking. They also revealed that pressure flaking was used only at a final stage and was preceded by percussion with hard and soft hammers.
Stone tools used by early Homo sapiens provide direct evidence of their cognitive and technological evolution. Oldowan tools, which are sharp stone flakes struck from river cobbles, first appeared some 2.6 million years ago. Acheulian tools, also called the hand axes, are teardrop-shaped cutting tools that followed the Oldowan tools about 1.7 million years ago. Researchers recently reported in Science (“Early Pleistocene presence of Acheulian hominins in South India” by Shanti Pappu et al., March 25, 2011) the discovery of hundreds of typical Acheulian artefacts as old as 1.51 million years at Attirampakkam site near Chennai. Despite the simplicity of production, both Oldowan and Acheulian tool-making processes activate different parts of the brain. If these techniques called for manipulative complexity, South African knappers should have possessed a greater degree of cognitive development to produce the Blombos Cave artefacts — combining hard and soft percussion with pressure flaking after heat treatment. Along with other advanced tool-making techniques, the early humans who migrated out of Africa after the Acheulian hominins were probably better wired neurologically and more adept at hunting for food than the Neanderthals.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Highly-skilled-early-knappers/article14966450.ece
30,3,2011,Learning from Detroit & Turin,"Recently released United States census data have confirmed the sad truth that Detroit's 40 square miles of abandoned and vacant plots have conveyed in recent years: the city has collapsed. Over the last decade, Detroit, which in 1990 was the seventh largest city in the U.S., lost 25 per cent of its population. In absolute numbers, this outward migration is worse than what happened to New Orleans after hurricane Katrina ravaged it. Detroit's urban decay explicates the perils of myopic urban policies that tether a city's growth to only one economic activity and neglect the challenge of urban inequalities. Since the beginning of the 20th century, when Ford revolutionised automobile production, the city has emerged as one of the world's largest hubs of the automobile industry. It peaked in population in 1950. In the two decades that followed, city planning imprudently encouraged urban sprawl: as many as 20 auto plants were set up in the suburbs, draining the city of employment and importance. This unsustainable suburbanisation also split the city racially, with the relatively affluent white population living in the periphery and the deprived African-Americans inhabiting the core. Investment in infrastructure on the less inhabited periphery at the expense of the deteriorating city core widened the inequalities. From the late 1980s, the automobile industry in Detroit witnessed an economic slide and this one-industry town a flight of capital and people. The recent recession made a bad situation much worse.
Detroit is an example of what could go wrong when industries get complacent and cities lose their bearings. Efforts to revitalise the core area of the city by constructing a spectacular convention-cum-office complex and a $300 million baseball stadium did not produce the desired results. Such cases demonstrate that development projects, however huge they may be, will not deliver unless they are integrated with the overall redevelopment and the benefits get equitably distributed. Lessons can also be learnt from Turin, the Detroit of Europe and the headquarters of Fiat, the Italian car company. Between 1980 and the early 1990s, the city was severely affected by the economic slide in the automobile industry: it lost 80,000 jobs and was saddled with one million square feet of abandoned industrial sites. Good governance, the creative re-inventing of Turin as the cinema capital, and a public-participatory planning process turned the ailing city around. All this should serve to remind Indian city managers — who in the last decade have tended to over-emphasise the role of the IT sector in urban growth — that the key to a prosperous city is economic diversity and equitable growth.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Learning-from-Detroit-amp-Turin/article14967557.ece
31,3,2011,Don't ban Great Soul,"Union Law Minister Veerappa Moily's announcement that the central government would ban the book Great Soul: Mahatma Gandhi and his Struggle with India had no justification in fact, law, or common sense. The threatened ban on the book — the contents of which Mr. Moily dramatically described as “heresy” — was based, at best, on a total misreading of it and, at worst, on no-reading but relying on grossly misleading reviews in a section of the western media. The biography, written by Joseph Lelyveld, a former editor of the New York Times, does not claim that Mahatma Gandhi was bi-sexual; neither does it portray him as a racist. In the course of a serious exploration that traces the links between the beginning of Gandhi's political life in South Africa and its development in India, the book refers to his close relationship with East Prussian architect Hermann Kallenbach. The strong emotional bond between the two, who lived together for a while on Tolstoy Farm near Johannesburg, is more than borne out by the letters Gandhiji wrote to Kallenbach. Mr. Lelyveld quotes a Gandhi scholar in the book as characterising their relationship as “homoerotic” rather than “homosexual,” an interpretation one is free to dispute. But surely, that cannot be a basis for banning a book as the Gujarat government has done with great alacrity and the Government of India was seriously considering until Mr. Moily did an about-turn on the issue.
“I am of the earth, earthy … I am prone to as many weaknesses as you are,” the Mahatma famously declared. He explored a number of these weaknesses with extraordinary honesty in My Experiments with Truth. Most publishers love, and some even stage-manage, the kind of controversy that has broken out over what is a small section of a chapter in Mr. Lelyveld's biography. Not so long ago, in grandson Rajmohan Gandhi's Mohandas, a small episode in the Mahatma's life — his relationship with Rabindranath Tagore's niece Saraladevi Chaudharani (“around which Eros too might have lurked”) — became the frenzied focus of the media. Section 95 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers authorities to proscribe books if they contain material that breaches the peace or causes communal tension. Surely, it is no one's case that Great Soul does that. The Supreme Court, which has consistently opposed crude attempts at censorship, has severely limited the use of Section 95 to proscribe books. From a quick reading of the controversial references in the Kindle edition, it seems that Mr. Lelyveld has made too much of what is essentially thin source material on the subject. The answer to that is reasoned, informed criticism. The Mahatma would have been the first to protest against any suggestion of an obscurantist ban.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dont-ban-great-soul/article1588485.ece
31,3,2011,Germany's Green spring,"In a historic development, Winfried Kretschmann is set to become the first Green Minister-President of a German state. The German Green Party has emerged as the senior partner in a coalition with the Social Democratic Party that has captured the state assembly or Landtag in Baden-Württemberg. The coalition defeated the conservative incumbent, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which had led the government of the very wealthy province for almost 58 years. On a turnout of 66 per cent, the Greens more than doubled their 2006 vote-share to 24 per cent, which gave them 36 seats. The CDU remains the biggest single party with 60 seats, but the new alliance will have a majority of four over the bloc formed by the CDU and its ally, the Free Democrat Party (FDP), which lost eight of its 15 seats. Further, the CDU-FDP share of seats in the powerful federal upper chamber, the Bundesrat, will fall in proportion to their regional losses — and Mr. Kretschmann will also have a Bundesrat vote. One consequence is that the CDU national leader and federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will find it even harder to get legislation passed.
Ms Merkel has blamed her party's losses on the stream of bad news from the wrecked Japanese nuclear plant at Fukushima. The Chancellor lost a lot of credibility by announcing a 12-year extension to the life of all 17 German nuclear plants and then doing a U-turn post-Fukushima to state that seven plants built before 1980 would be closed down for three months. But German public opposition to nuclear power, although strong and of long standing, forms only a part of the Greens' strength. Stuttgart, the capital of Baden-Württemberg, has been the focus of controversy over a multi-billion-euro plan to redevelop the central station as part of a high-speed rail link across Europe. The plan, called Stuttgart 21, catalysed a feeling among ordinary people that they were being subordinated to big business; after the election, the national rail company Deutsche Bahn suspended the project. But the news for the Chancellor is even worse. Voters across Germany are deserting the pro-market conservative and Right parties. The rising political stock of the Greens was reflected in a tripled vote-share of 15.4 per cent in Rhineland-Palatinate, which also elected a new assembly on March 27. In this contest, the FDP did not even get the 5 per cent needed for one seat. The most significant implication seems to be that ordinary German voters now want to address concerns and issues very different from those of the mainstream parties. The Greens have an unprecedented chance to initiate significant changes in the style and substance of German politics.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Germanys-Green-spring/article14968666.ece
31,3,2011,Problems of abundance,"Even as a season of bountiful harvest of the rabi season crops, wheat followed by rice, gets under way, India's food management policy has come under a great deal of stress. The main objectives of food management are unexceptionable: procurement of food grains from farmers at remunerative prices; distributing them to consumers, particularly deprived and vulnerable sections of the people at affordable prices, and maintaining buffers for food security and price stability. It is the instruments used — the minimum support price (MSP) and the central issue price (CIP), and the nodal agency, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) — that have come under scrutiny at a time India is facing problems of plenty. An immediate problem has been one of storage. As of March 1, the FCI was reportedly holding 45.8 million tonnes of rice and wheat — more than twice the prescribed buffer stock norm, which includes a food security reserve of five million tonnes. A sizable part of this is stored in the open, with minimal protection. The FCI has also used private warehouses for stocking grain for which it incurs a heavy carrying cost. The problem of storage will become acute if, as expected, the FCI procures another 15-20 million tonnes of wheat during this season.
There are no easy ways out. Export of grains to reduce the surplus may not be an optimal solution. Like many countries, India has been very selective in permitting exports of food grains. The interests of domestic consumers have been paramount. There have been occasions when Indian exporters were priced out. Sales in the domestic markets to reduce the stocks are possible but even here a coherent strategy is needed. In many places, open market prices of wheat are reportedly ruling below the MSP. Solutions to the storage crisis will have to be found in a larger context of reordering the food management and procurement policies. The old fixes will not work at this juncture. Procurement of wheat and rice is open ended and the MSP, which has been raised by successive governments, sets the floor price, thereby contributing to higher prices. There is, at this point, very little chance of restricting each year's procurement to actual production. Nor can the mechanism of MSP be revisited in its entirety, given the political sensitivity involved. According to the Economic Survey 2010-11, the economic cost of food grains to the FCI has increased substantially over the last few years but the issue price has not gone up, so the food subsidy bill will go up. The continuing tragedy is that the Indian system is not able to deliver the ‘surplus' food grain to the hungry.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Problems-of-abundance/article14967558.ece
1,4,2011,Mixed news from Census 2011,"Sometimes, the good news is inextricably tied up with the bad. Provisional data from Census 2011 indicate that India's population might stabilise soon with the slowing down of the growth rate. From 21.54 per cent in Census 2001, the decadal population growth fell to 17.64 per cent in 2011. In absolute terms, 2001-2011 is the first decade (if 1911-1921 is excluded) to add a smaller number to the population than the preceding decade. The other good news is that literacy rate climbed from 64.83 per cent in 2001 to 74.04 per cent in 2011. While literacy among males rose from 75.26 per cent to 82.14 per cent, an increase of 6.9 points, it rose among females from 53.67 per cent to 65.46 per cent, an increase of 11.8 points. Of the additional literates, women (110,069,001) outnumber men (107,631,940). The gap of 21.59 percentage points between men and women in 2001 now stands reduced to 16.68 points. The full census data, to be released next year, should provide policymakers a comprehensive view of where India stands on key indicators of socio-economic development, set against the goal of creating a more egalitarian and just society.
It is no surprise that the overall sex ratio (number of females for every 1,000 males) has shown improvement, from 932.91 in 2001 to 940.27 in 2011; a good part of this can be explained by the greater natural longevity of women and improvements in health care over the years. Lurking in the provisional population data, however, is a deeply disturbing set of statistics: a steep fall in the child sex ratio, which measures the number of girls for every 1,000 boys in the 0-6 years age group. The sex ratio in the 0-6 age group has been continually declining since 1961 but the fall from 927.31 in 2001 to 914.23 in 2011 is the worst since Independence. This trend and scale of decline in rising India is shocking. It can only be explained by the deadly application of the ‘son preference' on a growing scale — through the instrumentality of sex-selective abortion, or female foeticide. Attempts to tackle female foeticide through bans on sex-determination tests imposed by the Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act have been largely ineffective. In his essay ‘Many faces of gender inequality' ( Frontline, November 9, 2001), Amartya Sen drew on the 2001 Census data to highlight the fact that India split into two when it came to the sex ratio in the 0-6 age group: the South and the East had a decent ratio while the entire North and the West revealed a deeply disturbing picture. Even though the regional split concealed many micro-level variations, the contrast was striking. It would be interesting to see if the same regional pattern continues in the 2011 Census but the overall child sex ratio data, which throw sharp light on social mores, are depressing.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mixed-news-from-Census-2011/article14666858.ece
1,4,2011,Going round and round,"Two recent exhortations by Jagdish Bhagwati and the WTO's Director-General Pascal Lamy to conclude the Doha round, though not original, are timely and send out some important messages. Both have warned against the consequences of a failure. The odds against concluding the round have remained high despite the lip service multilateralism has received over the years. Repeated failures to adhere to negotiating deadlines have induced a sense of scepticism, if not cynicism, over the final outcome. More than nine years after the start of the round, few people are willing to bet on a wrap-up any time soon. In fact, the possibility of a total failure is not ruled out, although trade negotiators, meeting periodically at Geneva, have been working hard for a consensus on some of the key contentious issues. In several ways, the world's major trading nations are moving away from the spirit of multilateral trade. For instance, there has been a strong preference among countries, India included, for bilateral ‘free trade' agreements, which, generally, take less time to forge and promise almost immediate results. However, it is not in the best interests of either trade or individual countries that a slew of bilateral pacts should dominate international trade. Going by the experience, these pacts lead to hegemony by the rich countries over the poor as well as discrimination and distortion in trade practices.
A multilateral trade agreement governed by uniform rules and procedures would help avoid such traps. Besides, it would give all member countries access to the disputes settlement body of the WTO, an institution through which the smallest member countries can direct the richest to stop distorting trade practices. Absent an agreement, the rule of law the WTO helped establish would be at risk of being considerably diluted. Even worse, the WTO might find itself becoming irrelevant. The irony is that after the global economic crisis of 2007 the world's leading economies have become acutely aware of the interdependence among them. The G20 countries, which tried to assume leadership of the global economy, bravely tried to find global solutions to common economic and social problems. The Seoul Summit of 2010 wanted the Doha round to be completed by 2011. However, with economic recovery spreading to the richer countries, there have been fewer compulsions to cooperate. On the contrary, jobless growth in the United States has stoked protectionist sentiment. At this juncture, the outlook for the Doha round is anything but bright.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Going-round-and-round/article14666857.ece
3,4,2011,Behind India's World Cup,"Ahead of the World Cup, widely perceived as the most open in recent times, India found itself in an unenviable position: anointed as the favourite and appointed to play in front of volatile, demanding home crowds. A measure of the constricting pressure India's cricketers experienced during the tournament may be had from captain M.S. Dhoni's revelation that his men struggled to keep their food down and that Yuvraj Singh was physically sick because of anxiety. Seen in this light, India's second World Cup triumph — 28 years after the gloriously improbable victory Kapil Dev's team achieved against the mighty West Indies — appears all the more remarkable. Four distinct qualities characterise this triumph. One, the facility for natural expression under pressure, especially when batting. Two, game-toughness, which manifested itself in the wherewithal to meter resources through a draining tournament. Three, the peculiar yet much-desired ability, common to teams Dhoni leads, not so much to solve problems as to transcend them (the lift in the fielding standard of a largely unathletic side inured to mediocrity was hard to explain). Four and most important of all, an unbending desire to win that was stronger than any of the other teams.
From a unit that looked flawed in the league stage — its bowling inadequate, its fielding incompetent, its batting inconsistent, particularly in the Power Play overs — India transformed itself into a side that got the job done in the big matches. As Dhoni noted, his team peaked at the right time. No one better illustrated this transformation than the captain. He reserved his best innings — a poised, calculated, and ultimately devastating 91 — for the finale. His decision to promote himself in the big game was a classic case of leading from the front, and while he made tactically questionable calls, his ability to inspire a band of men to stay invested in a contest is second to none. Gautam Gambhir seems to escape notice in a team of superstars, but he must be acknowledged as one of the finest big-match batsmen of his generation. His record in second innings in important Tests and in run chases and grand finals in ODIs and Twenty20 games is exceptional. India discovered and re-discovered many heroes in the World Cup. Yuvraj had a standout tournament, his runs and wickets often coming when his team needed them most. Zaheer Khan held the bowling together, delivering wickets whenever his captain threw him the ball in the middle-stages. He might not have ended as he wished, but his brilliant opening spell in the final set the tone. Virender Sehwag, Virat Kohli, and Suresh Raina made runs that were worth more than their quantity while Harbhajan Singh, Munaf Patel, and Ashish Nehra contributed vital spells without having consistently good tournaments. R. Ashwin, curiously overlooked for much of India's campaign, added an edge to the bowling and forced Harbhajan to raise his game. Sachin Tendulkar, for whom the team said it wanted to win the World Cup, continued his scarcely believable second wind which now spans three years. The team's spontaneous gesture of chairing a visibly emotional Tendulkar and parading him before an adoring home crowd showed how much it meant to all involved. Coach Gary Kirsten and the rest of the backroom staff deserve high praise for creating an atmosphere in which India's cricketers could relax and thus express their skills naturally. Sri Lanka might have fallen at the last hurdle, but much like Pakistan, it won fans for its cricket, its comportment, and its captaincy. But this was India's World Cup, and Dhoni's men were worthy winners of a well-staged tournament.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Behind-Indias-World-Cup/article14669656.ece
3,4,2011,An exciting discovery,"The discovery of Acheulian tools no younger than one million years, and possibly as old as 1.5 million years, in Tamil Nadu overturns the current thinking that hominins or early humans lived in India merely 0.6 million to 0.5 million years ago. The exciting finds are from a site at Attirampakkam, in the Kortallayar River basin, about 60 km northwest of Chennai. Previous age estimates indicated that hominins who moved out of Africa dispersed across Asia and Europe around the same time. This was inconsistent with the widely accepted current theories of early human migration from Africa to Asia. By dating the artefacts as at least one million years old, a paper published online in Science (“Early Pleistocene presence of Acheulian hominins in South India” by Shanti Pappu et al., March 25, 2011) comes close to placing them in sync with the migration of early humans from Africa to the rest of the world through Asia. The latest study used two dating methods – palaeomagentism to date the sediments from where the tools were recovered, and aluminum-beryllium isotope technique to date six artefacts. Combining the two techniques helped make the dating robust.
Attirampakkam was identified by the British geologist Robert Bruce Foote in 1863. The Indian researchers took nearly a decade of holistic study of the site to understand the archaeology in relation to paleo-environment. Among the more than 3,500 quartzite tools recovered from the site, the most common ones were the oval and tear-drop shaped bifacial hand-axes, cleavers, and small fakes (small chipped stones). Quite a number of tools discovered at the lowest buried Acheulian levels indicate that they were brought from elsewhere and only the final shaping was done at Attirampakkam. This is not unexpected: hominins using Acheulian tools were highly mobile.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-exciting-discovery/article1597038.ece
4,4,2011,Educating India,"India's performance over the past decade on one key development indicator, literacy, is not bad at first glance. Data from the provisional population tables of Census 2011 show the ‘effective literacy rate' (the percentage of the population above seven years that is literate) has increased by 9.21 percentage points over the decade to reach 74.04 per cent. A clear positive is that literacy rates among women grew faster than those for men. This growth in bare literacy reflects the significant steps free India has been taking to create a more literate society. It stands out when one compares the relevant pre- and post-1947 data. In 1901, the crude literacy rate (the number of literates as a percentage of the total population) was an insignificant 5.35 per cent. In 1951, this was a still dismal 16.67 per cent. In contrast with a 11.32 percentage point increase between 1901 and 1951, the crude literacy rate rose by 48.22 points between 1951 and 2011, with the 1991-2001 decade registering the highest growth (11.67 percentage points).
But this encouraging portrait must be understood in context — and also in comparison with what other countries have achieved. Any set of data is only as good as its definitions. By the prevailing Census definition, anyone above the age of seven who can read and write with understanding in any language is considered ‘literate'. The giveaway is that it is not necessary for the literate person to have received any formal education or to have attained any minimum educational standard. This is a huge conceptual weakness that calls for a radical course correction. The rhetorical question before policymakers is this: does the mere ability to read and write ‘with understanding,' albeit no mean achievement, add real value to the self-realisation of the individual and to social development? Conceptually, therefore, rising India must earnestly set about realising the true meaning of literacy by aiming to provide its whole population — male as well as female — a nationally acceptable minimum level of educational qualification. This floor can be nothing other than school education for ten years. This means creating public opinion and developing public action that obliges policymakers to put in place effective measures to solve the problem of school dropouts, especially in the Hindi-speaking States. It also means no-nonsense implementation of the fundamental Right to Education and taking this beyond the primary stage.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Educating-India/article14670626.ece
5,4,2011,Charge sheet in the time of elections,"Despite some breakthroughs made in the criminal investigation into the 2G-spectrum allocation scam, the Central Bureau of Investigation has been unable or unwilling to go more than half steam in the charge sheet filed before the Special Court constituted to hear the case. That the Supreme Court of India is monitoring the investigation does not seem to have prevented the CBI from wilting under political pressure and piecing together a charge sheet that is unsatisfactory on several counts. True, a charge sheet in a criminal case needs to be filed within 60 days of the arrest of the accused to ensure they are not entitled to bail, and the CBI was working under a time constraint. But this does not explain why the leads in the investigation have not been followed to their logical conclusion. The arrests too have been suspiciously selective. Robust investigation into the money trail — which according to the charge sheet leads circuitously to Kalaignar TV, a television channel owned by members of the family of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi — has been put off until after the Assembly elections, which is why there is talk of a supplementary charge sheet. The investigating agency appears to have relied for the most part on the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General. However, while the C&AG indicated presumptive losses between Rs.57,666 crore and Rs.176,645 crore, the charge sheet pegs the figure at about Rs.22,000 crore.
The CBI has also betrayed a keen desire to absolve Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of any culpability in the allocation of 2G spectrum by stating that he was “misled” on the issue and that he had “appropriately flagged the issue of processing of large number of applications received for fresh licences against the backdrop of inadequate spectrum to cater to overall demand.” As Arun Jaitley, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, has pointed out, the job of the investigating agency is to deal with criminality — not give a “clean chit” to any one. It is no one's case that the Prime Minister is criminally culpable but what is clear is that he had foreknowledge that something was rotten in the state of telecom, evidenced by the fact that he had received several complaints, which he took up with Telecom Minister A. Raja but failed to do anything about. It is possible that the CBI's investigation has been constrained by the proximity of the Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu and three other major States and that the situation will change after May 13. But what lowers public confidence in the independence of the investigation into India's biggest ever corruption scandal is the fact that other than Mr. Raja, no politician or major corporate figure has been named in the main charge sheet.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Charge-sheet-in-the-time-of-elections/article14671683.ece
6,4,2011,‘World's greatest spying machine',"Speaking to students at Cambridge University earlier this month, Julian Assange, Editor-in-Chief of WikiLeaks, offered an important insight: “while the Internet has in some ways an ability to let us know to an unprecedented level what government is doing … it is also the greatest spying machine the world has ever seen.” Now, the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, has cautioned against the Net coming under a regime of espionage and censorship in various countries, negating its potential for good. These warnings underscore the rising importance of the world's biggest public network and the need for the people to ensure that it remains truly free and open, unimpeded by official controls, technological discrimination, and cost barriers. The digital natives who inhabit the world look upon unrestricted, good quality access to the Internet as a fundamental right. Indeed, some progressive countries have initiated action to legislate such an entitlement. Finland became a model state last year by making broadband connectivity a legal right. There is a message here for India, which brings up the rear among fast-growing countries when it comes to high-speed Internet connectivity. After setting ambitious targets, it has taken weak, jagged steps to improve broadband coverage, particularly in rural areas. The target is to provide high bandwidth connections to 160 million households by 2014, but this involves a steep climb — the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India says only about 10 million were connected at the end of 2010.
Physical access to the Internet is crucial, but as Mr. Assange and Mr. Berners-Lee emphasise, the more complex issue is one of official controls. India put in place the Information Technology Act, 2000 and amended it subsequently in a bid to address public and industry concerns. But the law is still founded on the principle of executive control of online publication, rather than judicial due process. The amended Act has drawn criticism from advocates of free speech and data protection for its over-broad sweep and poor legislative clarity. This law must be rewritten in plain language and the fundamental right of free speech protected without dodges and equivocation. The more odious provisions enabling pre-censorship must go, and generic descriptions that serve as definitions of infringements need to be replaced with specific ones. India also needs a data protection law that restricts access to personal data collected and held by government. The Internet era is all about sharing and enabling people to express themselves freely. The imperative is to specify just what governments are allowed to do — and prevent them from exercising Orwellian control.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lsquoWorlds-greatest-spying-machine/article14672829.ece
6,4,2011,Goldstone's continuing value,"Richard Goldstone, the internationally renowned jurist, has attracted attention by retracting key conclusions in the report he prepared for the United Nations Human Rights Council on Israel's 2008-09 Gaza Strip Operation Cast Lead. Writing in the Washington Post on April 1, he drew upon an independent investigation, chaired by the United States judge Mary McGowan Davis, to state that “civilians were not deliberately targeted” as a matter of Israeli policy — although both the Israeli government and Ms McGowan Davis have confirmed the validity of cases against certain Israeli soldiers. Mr. Goldstone also noted that Israel had investigated more than 400 cases of “operational misconduct” by members of the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) in Gaza; but that the Palestinian ruling party Hamas, for which Gaza is a stronghold, has investigated none of the allegations the Goldstone report made against both sides.
As can be expected, official reactions in Israel have been intemperate. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu wants the original report to be “thrown into the dustbin of history.” Other leading Israelis have launched vitriolic attacks on Mr. Goldstone, and there has been talk of attempts to persuade the U.N. to withdraw the report altogether. But the retractions do not alter the core fact that during Operation Cast Lead, more than 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed — and that half the number of Palestinians and three of the Israelis were civilians. Secondly, Judge McGowan Davis was herself critical of Israel; several investigations remain open, and there is “no indication” that those who planned and oversaw Cast Lead will be questioned. Thirdly, Mr. Goldstone states that he reached his original conclusions after Israel blocked all cooperation with his inquiry. He was given no information about Israeli forces' behaviour during Cast Lead, and his team was barred from the country. Fourthly, as Israeli journalist Aluf Benn points out in The Guardian, the IDF has investigated its own conduct in the Gaza war precisely because of the U.N.'s criticisms; it has also devised new procedures to protect civilians in urban warfare and to limit the use of white phosphorus in civilian areas. While a just solution to the Palestine question is nowhere in sight, the U.N. can claim two significant achievements. Its strictures dealt a great shock to the Israeli polity; and it has shown the Zionist state that not cooperating with legitimate international investigations could lead to indictments in the International Criminal Court.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Goldstones-continuing-value/article14671780.ece
7,4,2011,Tackling drug resistance,"There was a time around the middle of the last century when it seemed that humans could decisively vanquish the microbes that caused so many dreadful, often deadly, diseases. But that sense of victory over an enemy has given way to alarm. Drug-resistant pathogens have sprung up and ‘superbugs' that can shrug off most drugs that are thrown at them have surfaced and spread across the world. With few new antimicrobials under development, there is a real sense among medical experts of humanity having its back to the wall and of the frightening possibility of a return to the bad old days when what started as a simple infection could get completely out of control. This year's World Health Day (April 7) focusses on antimicrobial resistance and its global spread. In a highly interconnected world, drug-resistant microbes can leap from one country to another. Last year, there was a furore over the spread of highly drug-resistant bacteria, which had the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) gene, from South Asia to several countries. But ‘superbugs' have made their way to India from elsewhere in the world too. For instance, studies of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria isolated in India have indicated a movement of such organisms from the United States, Europe, and Australia to this country.
In India, as in other countries, such dangerous microbes are circulating not only in hospitals but also in the larger community; poor sanitation and faecal contamination of water supplies have allowed some highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria to spread. Drug-resistance is a major issue in tuberculosis. India accounts for one-fifth of the global burden of the disease and two people die of it every three minutes. The rise of resistance as a natural consequence of the process of evolution is perhaps inevitable. But the misuse of antibiotics greatly hastens this process. There is a great deal that can and must be done to conserve the drugs that are available and still effective. Over-the-counter sales of antibiotics must be stopped. Physicians need to be educated on when it is appropriate to use antibiotics. Even when an antibiotic is needed, it is essential that the right drug is given at an adequate dosage and for a suitable duration. A proper system of surveillance for antimicrobial resistance as well as regularly updated guidelines for treatment would help doctors make the right choices. Further, the use of antibiotics as growth-promoters in livestock needs to be curtailed. In all of this, the government, the medical fraternity, and the public must play their part.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Tackling-drug-resistance/article14672935.ece
7,4,2011,Changing an established order,"The international monetary system has been in need of fundamental reform. It is dominated by dollar holdings, with the American currency remaining the world's principal reserve currency as well as the most widely used in private transactions. The dollar, which faced many challenges, has remained supreme mainly for want of an alternative. A recent G20 seminar held in Nanjing, China, ended without any consensus on international monetary reform. The stasis is unfortunate. The system may not have caused the recent global imbalances or current instability in the global economy, but it has certainly been ineffective in addressing them. First, it has created a global recessionary bias both during and after financial crises. Secondly, there is a certain amount of tension in using a national currency as a reserve. The U.S. has been running huge budgetary and current account deficits. Should it succeed in reining in the deficits, global liquidity would shrink. Thirdly, the system has encouraged large dollar accumulations by several countries by way of “self-insurance” against future crisis. The very large dollar holdings by China and some other countries have added to global imbalances.
Various attempts at identifying alternative reserve currencies have floundered. The euro seemed promising at one time but the current debt problems in some euro zone countries have raised doubts over its long term suitability. Given the strength of China, the yuan is bound to become an important reserve currency in course of time, freely convertible and with an exchange rate mirroring its growing clout. Some out-of-the-box solutions are required. Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz has, in a recent article in the Financial Times, suggested that the SDRs issued by the International Monetary Fund should play a greater role in the international monetary system. SDRs, which are strictly the IMF's unit of account, represent a potential claim on other countries' freely usable currency reserves, for which they can be exchanged voluntarily. The specific proposal is to issue a significant amount (up to $390 billion) of new SDRs every year for the next three years. Central banks can exchange the SDRs for hard currency and use it to finance imports. The inherent recessionary bias in the existing system is thus avoided. Being relatively small, the new issues will not accentuate global imbalances. The effectiveness of the SDRs ought to be enhanced through a variety of measures, which are inextricably linked to IMF reform. The medium-term goal is to make SDRs the main, or even the only, means of IMF financing. The dollar's pre-eminence in private trade and remittances will remain unaffected.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Changing-an-established-order/article14672933.ece
8,4,2011,The stand-off over corruption,"Few could have anticipated that Anna Hazare's movement for a stronger Lokpal bill would generate such an extraordinary groundswell of public support, particularly among the urban middle class. By the fourth day of his indefinite fast, the nationwide protests led by 71-year-old social activist have forced the Centre to drop the anti-corruption bill it had drafted, to agree to prepare a new and stronger draft in consultation with civil society activists, and to desperately seek an agreement to end the crisis. It is imperative that the Manmohan Singh government seeks to resolve the remaining differences — on whether the committee must be formally notified and whether a civil society nominee should head it — by forsaking obstinate stances and respecting the popular mood. With the Centre rejecting the positions staked out by Mr. Hazare on these two issues, he has called for a nationwide jail bharo on April 13. It is not certain how long the deadlock will continue. But in the welter of protests and the general anger about corruption, the key details about what this specific crusade is really about must not be lost.
Essentially, the battle is to formulate a Lokpal bill that will allow for impartial and effective inquiries into complaints against public officials. The civil activist camp is correct in pointing out that the official draft is weak and ineffectual. For instance, rather than allow the Lokpal (or ombudsman) to probe all corruption-related complaints against public officials received from the general public, it restricts such inquires to those forwarded by the Lok Sabha Speaker or the Rajya Sabha Chairman. The reluctance of the Centre to draft a tough Lokpal bill has been coupled with a longstanding reluctance to enact it; one or another version of the bill has been introduced in the Lok Sabha eight times since 1968 only to find the House being dissolved before it could be passed. Mr. Hazare and his supporters have demanded that the Jan Lokpal bill drafted by civil society activists be adopted instead. But this piece of legislation, although having much more teeth, is not without its share of serious flaws. For instance, it stipulates that the selection committee for the Lokpal must include Nobel laureates of Indian origin and recent Magsaysay award winners. It also makes drastic changes in the existing criminal justice system by envisaging the Lokpal as something of a supercop, under whose jurisdiction a good portion of the Central Bureau of Investigation will be subsumed. The challenge is to formulate a Lokpal bill that has the teeth lacking in the government draft and is free from the angularities of the civil society version.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-stand-off-over-corruption/article13673239.ece
8,4,2011,Saving vultures,"The inter-Ministerial consultation on vulture conservation, convened by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, has sent out a clear message to the State agriculture departments: it is they who hold the key to the fortunes of three critically endangered species in India. After years of research, scientists concluded that the cause for extermination of about 95 per cent of the estimated populations of oriental white-backed, slender-billed, and long-billed vultures in the subcontinent is the painkiller diclofenac. Feeding on carcasses of cattle that had been administered the drug proved fatal to the birds. The Ministry responded positively to that finding by coming up with a multi-pronged strategy. It essentially consists of banning veterinary formulations of diclofenac, popularising the drug meloxicam to eliminate the threat to vultures from contaminated carcasses, and opening breeding centres. The results have been encouraging. There is a declining trend in the use of the toxic drug. The breeding centres at Pinjore in Haryana, Rajabhat Khawa in West Bengal, and the Rani range in Assam now host a good number of birds. Yet, given the scale of the ecological disaster that has struck vultures, much more needs to be done.
The supply of meloxicam, which leaves cattle carcasses safe for vultures, is unable to meet the demand. Such a situation exists in spite of an increase in the number of companies manufacturing the drug, since it became the molecule of choice for veterinary application five years ago. Farmers facing a shortage would naturally opt for alternatives such as diclofenac meant for human use. There is also a case for reviewing the pricing of meloxicam, an issue the Environment Ministry has been pursuing with the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority. A third drug tried for toxicity to vultures, ketoprofen, has failed to pass the test. What makes these issues critically important is the anecdotal evidence of a large number of vultures dying in agricultural areas, depleting the overall numbers. In a recent instance, 21 of these birds were found dead in Assam in a paddy field, reportedly after feeding on a carcass sprinkled with pesticide. The conservation programme should therefore make a systematic, annual count of all nine vulture species found in India, particularly the three species threatened with extinction, and assess all threats. Such a census is part of the Action Plan for Vulture Conservation prepared by the Environment Ministry in 2006; it is important to continue it even after self-sustaining populations have established themselves in the range States. The health of vultures in nature is indicative of the state of the ecosystem.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/saving-vultures/article1628432.ece
8,4,2011,End to a misguided saga at the UN,"Good sense has finally registered a victory at the United Nations. The countries of the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) have given up a 12-year long drive to have the U.N. accept the idea of “defamation of religions” and incorporate it in international human rights law. From 1999, the U.N. General Assembly, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, and its successor body since 2006, the U.N. Human Rights Council, annually passed OIC-sponsored resolutions that sought to protect religions, particularly Islam, from “defamation.” Muslim countries saw these resolutions as necessary to defend the religion from the post-9/11 Islamophobia in the West. Incidents such as the Danish cartoons strengthened the campaign, and the OIC pushed to bring the issue on a par with racism. But human rights law protects individual freedoms rather than groups of people. The idea that a religion can be defamed places it in conflict with the freedom of expression, thought, and opinion, blurring the lines between criticism of, and critical thinking about, religion on the one hand, and incitement to hatred. The resolution also raised concerns about opening the doors to an “international blasphemy law” and providing a justification for the suppression of religious minorities, non-believers, and political dissidents. Every year, the resolution was hard-fought and divisive. Support for it dropped in the last two years as the OIC pushed for adoption of an internationally binding standard on this issue, with more countries voting against or abstaining (India in the latter group) than supporting. The recent assassinations in Pakistan of two brave opponents of the country's blasphemy law — Punjab Governor Salman Taseer and Federal Minister Shahbaz Bhatti — appear to have finally sunk the effort. On March 24, the HRC unanimously adopted a resolution on “Combating Intolerance and Violence against Persons Based on Religion or Belief” that contained no reference to “defamation.”
The Koran-burning episode in Florida reminded the world that concern among Muslims that their religion is being targeted is not baseless. A fierce backlash in Afghanistan has claimed the lives of 24 people, including seven U.N. employees. Worldwide, there are innumerable instances of prejudice and bias against Muslims. But as Asma Jahangir, the eminent Pakistani human rights lawyer, pointed out to a U.N. committee deliberating the defamation resolution back in 2009, education and dialogue among religions would be more effective than legislation at promoting tolerance. Moreover, existing human rights laws provide a strong framework through which countries, and the international community, can fight discrimination without endangering other freedoms.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/End-to-a-misguided-saga-at-the-UN/article14674174.ece
8,4,2011,Obama's betrayal,"The announcement by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-professed mastermind behind 9/11, will be tried by a military commission at Guantánamo Bay, and not by a U.S. federal court, is a serious betrayal of a human rights and political promise Barack Obama made as he began his presidential term. The promise was to shut down the notorious detention and torture centre within a year. Now President Obama has decided not to veto a Republican-inserted budget clause that bars the use of Department of Defense funds to transfer Guantánamo detainees to the U.S. His excuse might be the pragmatic need to back away from a showdown with the Congress, which would mean confronting an intensely partisan Republican majority in the House of Representatives. Another influential opponent of terrorism trials on U.S. territory is New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He originally favoured trying Mr. Mohammed in New York but then changed his mind, saying the security arrangements alone would cost over $400 million. The opponents of trying the jihadist in the U.S. have exploited widespread public apprehension that such trials would again make the country a target for terrorists.
Trial by a military commission at Guantánamo Bay is a travesty, by any rule of law and human rights standard. The commissions can admit some evidence obtained under coercion; they apply criminal law retroactively; they have applied rules of evidence inconsistently; and they cannot try U.S. citizens. As the international NGO Human Rights Watch points out, these tribunals are “highly vulnerable to appellate challenge” and could be ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. As for the costs and risks entailed by a proper trial in the U.S., these are exaggerated. After all, in 2010 Guantánamo detainee Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani was tried without incident in New York for plotting al-Qaida attacks on U.S. embassies in Africa; he was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. Some of the hostility to federal trials may stem from the fact that Ghailani was convicted on only one of the 286 charges against him. But the commissions themselves have succeeded in convicting only six of more than 770 defendants. U.S. civilian courts, by contrast, have convicted hundreds of people on terrorism charges since 9/11. The advocates of military commissions at Guantánamo just don't seem to get it: these trials offend every canon of human rights, national sovereignty, and the rule of law, and the convictions are asking to be overturned on appeal.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Obamas-betrayal/article14674173.ece
11,4,2011,Starting early for 2012,"A standoff with the legislative branch over the budget would seem hardly the best time for President Barack Obama to declare the start of his re-election campaign. The tussle with the Republican-dominated U.S. Congress over cuts in spending brought the federal government to the brink of a shutdown. But the announcement of his 2012 candidacy in the middle of this was less about finding the right political moment than about garnering finances for re-election — the second quarter of the year marks the beginning of a new fund-raising period under U.S election laws. All the same, it has turned the spotlight on Mr. Obama's leadership even as the White House struggled to bring about a last-minute compromise between the Republicans and Democrats on the budget. This battle may eventually work to President Obama's political advantage if enough Americans see the Republicans as confrontational to the point of stopping the work of government. The harder part for the Democrats is to answer a more fundamental question: where is the change Mr. Obama promised during his inspirational 2008 presidential campaign? Americans are clearly disillusioned because the dynamism and hope Obama, the candidate, represented has been replaced by diffidence and over-caution in Obama, the President. The mood was evident when voters gave Republicans a majority in the House of Representatives and drastically cut back the Democratic majority in the Senate in November 2010.
Mr. Obama's approval rating of 62 per cent when he entered the White House has dropped to 46 per cent. The Libyan misadventure may push this down further. The latest let-down for his supporters is the decision to put Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-confessed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, on trial by a military tribunal at the Guantanamo prison, instead of in a federal court. Coming just a day after he was declared the first official candidate for the 2012 election, it showed President Obama in poor light: he had promised during the last campaign to close down the camp within a year of taking office. The presidential election is still 20 months away. No credible Republican contenders are in sight. Surprising though this may sound, of the many moving parts at work, the one to the incumbent's advantage is the economy. President Obama inherited an economy in deep crisis, but managed to keep it from sinking. Last month, the claim that the economic recovery was well on its way was buttressed by a fall in the unemployment rate to its lowest in two years. Elections in the U.S. are often about the state of the economy. Mr. Obama's political stock has been visibly degraded but all things considered, he remains the favourite for November 2012.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Starting-early-for-2012/article14678634.ece
11,4,2011,Primary market messages,"There are some important messages from the recently released data on primary markets. Last year (2010-11) a sum of Rs.46,267 crore was raised through public equity issues. The mobilisation was roughly the same as that of the previous year. According to Prime Database, one of India's oldest and most reliable purveyors of capital market data, the mobilisation last year — incidentally the third highest ever — could have been even more but for the fact that some public sector undertakings (PSUs) deferred their planned large public offerings. One of the reasons for the postponement was the volatility in the secondary markets that had set in during the last quarter of 2010-11. Indeed, continuing volatility poses daunting challenges to primary market issuers, especially in timing the issue and price discovery. When iconic PSUs are involved, the issue price can never remain outside the pale of controversy, no matter what method is used to discover the price.
In 2010-11, a total of 57 public issues entered the market, compared to 44 the previous year. Of these, 52 were initial offerings and the remaining five follow-on offers. The average deal size was Rs.811 crore. Ten issues were for Rs.1,000 crore and above. At the other end, there were six issues of less than Rs.50 crore and none below Rs.10 crore. The important message here is that India's primary market remains tilted towards large companies. The ongoing efforts of the government and the regulator, SEBI, to encourage small and medium enterprises to seek funds from the capital market instead of depending solely on bank finance have not been successful. Dedicated exchanges for small share offerings have not taken off. The OTC exchange, which goes back to the early 1990s, was well conceptualised but it found few takers. Public issue of shares continues to be an expensive affair. The system, derived from regulatory rules as well as deeply ingrained market practices, favours the larger issuers over the small. Irrespective of the issue size, there are certain fixed costs such as advertising and publicity that the issuer has to incur. That, in many cases, raises the bar for the smaller issues. While there is absolutely no doubt that a public listing of shares confers many advantages to a corporate, the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) will have to weigh the costs involved against the advantages. Many SMEs therefore depend on outside equity support from venture capital, private equity and many categories of institutional investors.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Primary-market-messages/article14678633.ece
12,4,2011,Fifty years since Gagarin's flight,"On a sunny morning 50 years ago, the 27-year-old carpenter's son turned Soviet cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, stunned the world. Blasting off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Gagarin became the first human to travel into space. His journey aboard the Vostok spacecraft was unquestionably one of the great achievements of the 20th century and a landmark in human history. Coming as it did during the height of Cold War, Gagarin's success appeared to establish his country's supremacy in space technology. Just four months later, another Soviet cosmonaut, Gherman Titov, spent more than 25 hours in space and completed 17 orbits of the earth. America's muted response saw Alan Shepard carrying out a sub-orbital flight lasting just 15 minutes in May 1961. The United States could redeem some pride only in February 1962 when John Glenn completed three orbits in space. Just a month after Gagarin's historic space voyage, President John F. Kennedy declared that the U.S. would put a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. The space race was on — and it was a race that America won hands down. In July 1969, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin became the first men to set foot on another world. Ten more of their compatriots too left their footprints on the Moon.
But the U.S. Congress and the American public were not willing to continue funding further manned space exploration on the same scale. The U.S. space agency then turned to building the world's first reusable spacecraft that could take humans and cargo into orbit. The first space shuttle, Columbia, flew in 1981, followed by four of its siblings, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour. America's dominance in space has continued unabated after the Soviet Union's break-up. But with space programmes becoming more demanding, many major space initiatives are now joint endeavours involving many countries. The launch of the Hubble space telescope in 1990, a joint venture between the U.S.'s National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency was the first such initiative. The International Space Station (ISS) involving 16 countries, including the U.S. and Russia, is another excellent example. Even India's Chandrayaan-1 carried payloads from other countries. After NASA mothballs its shuttle programme this year, Russia's Soyuz spacecraft will be the only way that astronauts can travel to the ISS. The interest in manned spaceflight appears to be flagging in both the U.S. and Russia. It is, however, on the rise in China and India. Fifty years after man first ventured beyond the confines of Planet Earth, it is perhaps time for the spacefaring nations of the world to come together on a bold programme of manned space exploration.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Fifty-years-since-Gagarins-flight/article14679725.ece
12,4,2011,Creative economy and development,"If information technology has enabled emerging economies such as India to change the commercial equations with the developed world, another speciality is being recognised for its potential: the ‘creative economy'. This segment, according to a classification by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), comprises goods and services produced by the ‘creative industries' such as art-crafts, audio visuals, design, new media, performing arts, publishing and visual arts, the ‘creative services' (including advertising and architectural services), and their ‘related industries'. For nearly a decade, UNCTAD has been attempting to turn the spotlight on the promise the creative economy holds for domestic development and international trade. Going by the evidence available, this segment emerges as one of the better performers even during a recession. In 2008, despite a contraction of 12 per cent in international trade, the creative economy did well: global exports in this sector, at $592 billion, were more than double of what they were in 2002.
The UNCTAD report, Creative Economy: A feasible development option, released in December 2010, has done well to urge developing countries to enhance their creative capacities. For, this sector's exports grew faster in developing economies between 2003 and 2008 (at 13.55 per cent a year) than in developed countries (10.02 per cent), and were above the world average (11.53 per cent). There is a difference, however, in the composition of exports. While music and audiovisuals, publishing/printed media, and new media and design topped the list of exports from the developed world, art-crafts and design products dominated the list from developing countries. Although India — unranked in 2002 — registered the fastest growth in such exports between 2003 and 2008 (15.7 per cent) to reach the 10th position in 2008, its market share of 2.3 per cent is way behind that of world-leader China at 20.8 per cent. China's rise in this dynamic sector can be traced to two policy actions: identifying this as one of the pillars of its future economic development and integrating it to its planning process. India, on the other hand, is yet to have a clear focus. Given the vast potential the country has to gain from its creative industries — be they films or crafts — a well-conceived policy that coordinates issues at the national level will go a long way in elevating its global position in this dynamic sector.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Creative-economy-and-development/article14679723.ece
13,4,2011,The future of Asian cities,"After two decades of rapid urbanisation, many Asian cities have become economically productive and prosperous. But have they become desirable places to live in? A report on the “State of Asian Cities 2010/11,” published by the U.N. Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), says ‘No' on the strength of an empirical study. This insightful report cautions urban planners that unless they are made more liveable and environmental damage is reduced, Asian cities will not be able to harness the urban dividend any longer. Over the past two decades, 45 million people have been added every year to the Asian city population, which in 2010 touched a staggering 1.76 billion. This transformation has created vibrant economies and reduced poverty levels. However, the benefits have been unevenly spread and a spatial divide has emerged at the regional as well as intra-city level. In India, for instance, while mega cities receive a good deal of investment, many smaller towns have suffered neglect through short-sighted state policies. Within cities, access to water supply and sanitation has improved, but affordable land and health facilities have become less accessible.
Urbanisation in Asia is set to accelerate. Based on current trends, this means the conversion of more than 10 square kilometres of fertile land to non-agricultural use every day. City planners, as the U.N. report points out with concern, have to build a minimum of 20,000 houses and mobilise an additional six million litres of potable water every year to meet basic needs. Such demands on resources may appear daunting, but restraining urban growth is neither a workable nor a wise option. A business-as-usual approach will not be sustainable. Neither a vastly expanded low-density city nor a linear urban-corridor pattern that depends on private motorised transport, a model that is popular in India, can be the answer. Instead, a network of dense nodes, linked by efficient and affordable public transport and served by an intra-nodal non-motorised transport grid, is an alternative to explore. When 215 cities across the world were surveyed using a ‘liveability index' — an evaluation of 39 aspects of a city including environment and safety — none of Asia's cities made it to the top 30. Only Singapore and four Japanese cities managed to get into the top 50. This does not augur well for Asia's urban future.

13,4,2011,Peruvian priorities,"The Peruvian presidential election has shown what ordinary people, given voice by imaginative political leadership, can achieve in a democratic polity. With the incumbent, Alan García Pérez, constitutionally barred from contesting a second consecutive term, the campaign has been dominated by the leftist Ollanta Humala — a former army officer who had made a quiet start but then forged ahead by focussing on the country's huge inequalities and rampant corruption. With about 96 per cent of the votes counted, Mr. Humala led by 31.8 per cent to 23.4 per cent for Keiko Fujimori, daughter of the authoritarian former President Alberto Fujimori (currently serving a 25-year prison term for his involvement in death squads and corruption), and 18.7 per cent for former Prime Minister Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. As for the key issues, the huge inequalities persist despite 7 per cent aggregate growth, which is driven mainly by the exploitation of mineral resources. A third of the 29-million population lives in poverty, one fifth lacks access to running water, and one child in five is malnourished. The poor also suffer disproportionately from the effects of climate change and Mr. Humala's rivals have had no option but to promise action. Former President Alejandro Toledo, who is also a candidate, says companies do not have a blank cheque to pollute. Mr. Kuczynski calls for an end to violence over the Southern Copper Corporation's $1 billion project in Arequipa province. The company has now suspended work.
Although all indications are that Mr. Humala will not win outright and the presidential contest will go into a runoff round on June 5, his commitments such as state ownership of natural resources are in line with a powerful social-democratic trend across the whole of Latin America. No fewer than nine major countries in this region have elected Left or centre-left leaders since 1999 — from Hugo Chávez of Venezuela to Cristina Kirchner of Argentina — in response to the political and economic destruction wrought by decades of brutal dictatorships and economic policies enforced by international financial institutions. The progressive policies have led to heartening social outcomes. On a continent that has some of the world's worst inequalities, primary school completion rates are now close to 100 per cent. Robust counter-cyclical government spending has mitigated the effects of the global economic crisis. Further, bodies such as the Union of South American Nations have strengthened multilateral cooperation. Latin America's working people are asserting their priorities in no uncertain terms and there are lessons here for developing countries in Asia and Africa.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Peruvian-priorities/article14680854.ece
14,4,2011,Renewing the telecom agenda,"When it comes to telecommunication gadgets, obsolescence is measured in months rather than years, not to mention decades. That was not the case with governance in the telecom industry, considering that the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885 is still the law that applies to the use of telephones, telegraph, and communications across the land. But the 2G scam has laid bare the disastrous consequences of persisting with an outdated and ambiguous policy framework, which a succession of Telecommunications Ministers handled questionably and which A. Raja used to scandalous effect, resulting in the biggest scam in the history of independent India. It is not difficult to see why this industry needs a periodically fine-tuned policy regime. India's telephone-using population is swelling phenomenally: it took a hundred years for the number of telephone subscribers to touch 20 million; now 20 million subscribers are added every month. The mode of connectivity has changed: 96 per cent of the 826 million subscribers use mobiles, which were unseen just 16 years ago. Indeed, even among the wireless services that became available in the 1990s, pagers and mobile radio trunking phones, which ranked quite prominently in the New Telecom Policy of 1999, have passed into oblivion. The value of the wireless spectrum has skyrocketed in consonance with the number of subscribers connected.
It is hardly surprising that post-scam, Telecommunications Minister Kapil Sibal wants to draft a new telecom policy to replace the one that was set 12 years ago. Mr. Sibal does not have some of the challenges NTP 1999 faced, especially the challenge of increasing the tele-density in the country. The industry has over-delivered on targets, with 154 phones today for 100 people in urban areas and 30 phones (against a target of four) for every 100 people in rural India. But Mr. Sibal needs skillfully to draft the policy in a manner that will let consumers continue to enjoy the benefits of low tariffs and of access to the latest technologies. Ensuring that there is a sufficient number of service providers competing in each area will take care of the former. Mr. Sibal has talked of having a minimum of six, but that is no problem for now since most areas have almost twice that number of service providers. He has also talked of granting a unified licence, which one trusts will be agnostic to technology choice. This will be crucial in letting companies offer their subscribers the benefit of technology as it changes and improves. But the more intractable issue will be that of spectrum and its pricing, given the proliferation of mobile devices and the increased demand on the air waves. Mr. Sibal wants to separate the issue of the telecom licence from the grant of spectrum. Yet that does not solve the problem fully. Since spectrum is commonly owned but scarce, a transparent mechanism must be devised to let phone companies pay the appropriate price to the government for the slices they use. That was the issue that trapped Mr. Raja; let not his successors also trip on it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Renewing-the-telecom-agenda/article14681972.ece
14,4,2011,Realistic assessment of trade,"The impressive trade performance during 2010 helped in no small way in checking the global economy's slide into recession. Highlighting this and certain related aspects, the World Trade Organisation in a recent report has cautioned that expectations of trade growth in 2011 ought to be more subdued. After the record-breaking 14.5 per cent surge in terms of volume in 2010, the expansion in world trade is unlikely to exceed 6.5 per cent during 2011. In 2010, trade was essentially bouncing back from the sharp drop of almost 12 per cent during the previous year. The 14.5 per cent increase was the highest since 1950 and was buoyed by a 3.6 per cent growth in the global output. Such a performance returned trade to the 2008 peak. The WTO's muted expectations are rooted in the realisation that the “hangover from the financial crisis is still with us.” High unemployment in the developed economies and sharp belt-tightening in Europe have fuelled protectionist pressures. The Doha development round shows no signs of moving forward. The earthquake, the tsunami, and the nuclear disaster in Japan have added to the uncertainty surrounding the trade outlook while the spiralling prices of commodities, especially petroleum, and the continuing unrest in major oil exporting countries have added to the risk factors.
But that is not all, according to the WTO. The factors that contributed to the unusually large drop in world trade in 2009 may have also boosted the rebound in 2010. The proliferation of global supply chains is one factor. The product composition of trade compared with output is another. Global supply chains cause goods to move across national boundaries several times during the production process, thereby increasing measured trade flows. Certain goods such as consumer durables and industrial machinery, which were severely affected during the downturn, have a larger share in world trade than in global GDP. Consequently, while they exaggerated the magnitude of trade slump relative to the GDP in 2009, they had a positive effect the next year. The trade recovery needs to be sustained by sound policy measures. Exhorting its members to be vigilant against protectionist forces, the WTO has said that salvation lies in opening, not closing, markets.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Realistic-assessment-of-trade/article14681971.ece
15,4,2011,"Cash, checks, and elections","The 2011 Assembly election in Tamil Nadu stands out for several reasons, some of them heartening, others deeply disturbing. The record turnout of 77.8 per cent, which beats the 76.57 per cent of the landmark 1967 election when the Congress was voted out for the first time, came on the back of commendable efforts by the Election Commission of India to ensure comprehensive coverage of voters in the photo electoral rolls. With the names of the dead and the absent punctiliously deleted, the rolls were more accurate this time. Quick, efficient polling through the Electronic Voting Machines shortened the queues at the polling stations. But the 2011 election will also be remembered for the widespread, systematic distribution of cash as inducement to voters, especially by the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and allies such as the Congress. Cash-for-votes is not a new phenomenon, but it acquired an extraordinary dimension after the Thirumangalam by-election in Tamil Nadu in January 2009, when the ruling party doled out cash to almost every eligible voter in the constituency. This was a new trend, and was captured brilliantly in a United States Embassy cable sent on May 13, 2009, which was accessed by The Hindu through WikiLeaks ( >https://www.thehindu.com/news/the-india-cables/article1541385.ece). To the extent available resources allowed, the Thirumangalam formula was replicated by the DMK at the State level for the Lok Sabha election in May 2009. But in 2011, the ruling party found a clear-sighted, resolute, and pro-active Chief Electoral Officer, Praveen Kumar, standing in its way. Acting on the instructions of the ECI in letter and spirit, Mr. Kumar and his dedicated team managed to curb the distribution of money and other inducements, by effecting seizures of about Rs.33.78 crore in cash and Rs.12.59 crore worth of materials.
Corruption, the rise in the prices of essential commodities, and freebies dominated the campaign, which was restricted to about two weeks thanks to the tight schedule drawn up by the ECI to ensure effective monitoring of the election process. The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam led by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa projected the 2G scam as a defining issue and improved upon several freebie promises made in the DMK's manifesto. For the DMK, octogenarian Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi dwelt on the welfare measures of his government, promising to do more if given a sixth term in office. Fortunately, despite the keen contest and the bitter political rivalry, the State witnessed no major incidents of violence during the campaign or the election. Until May 13, when the results will be out, Tamil Nadu is set for a period of suspenseful peace and quiet.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Cash-checks-and-elections/article14683215.ece
15,4,2011,The killing of a moderate,"As a religious leader, Maulana Showkat Ahmed Shah was a promoter of the purist Wahabi school of Islam in Kashmir over its indigenous liberal Sufism. As a political voice, he stood with the separatists. Within the limits of these categories, the cleric, who headed the religious group Jamiat Ahle Hadees, was a known moderate who was at pains to dissociate the Wahabism he preached from its violent and regressive avatar in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Although not part of the Hurriyat Conference, he was associated with the less hardline of the two factions and was vocal against violence and militancy. He was allied with the secular-minded Yasin Malik of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front. Last spring, he opposed the stone-pelters, issuing a fatwa against the protest as un-Islamic. Earlier this year, the cleric defied a taboo in Kashmir by demanding a new inquiry into the killings of three separatist leaders — Mirwaiz Farooq, Abdul Gani Lone, and Qazi Nissar. This is possibly why Abdul Ghani Bhat, former chairman of the Hurriyat Conference, dared to declare that these leaders were killed by “our own people,” a cry later picked up by the Lone brothers, Sajjad and Bilal, about the killing of their father. Mr. Shah was also the only separatist leader to meet the government-appointed team of interlocutors. Tragically, but not surprisingly, the man who escaped attempts on his life in 2006 and 2008, finally fell victim to Kashmir's relentless violence. This time, the assassins left nothing to chance; they killed him with an improvised explosive planted on a bicycle as he entered a mosque in Srinagar to deliver the Friday sermon on April 8.
The killing has served to highlight the uncertainty in the Valley. The hope is that the tentative moves to break the 26/11 ice on the India-Pakistan engagement will lead to forward movement in Kashmir. The interlocutors are set to hold a round-table conference with all sections of Kashmiri opinion later this month, and have invited the separatists to participate. If the moderate Hurriyat faction led by Mirwaiz Omer Farooq was at all reconsidering its refusal to engage in the dialogue, the killing of Mr. Shah is likely to act as a deterrent. An unusually strong statement from the Pakistan government has condemned Mr. Shah's killing as “abominable,” and stressed that “violence against innocent persons cannot be justified on any grounds.” But it does not bode well that Hafiz Saeed, head of the Jamat-ud-dawa, who vows to take Kashmir by force, used the killing to resurface in Islamabad, reiterating his own agenda, and criticising last month's cricket diplomacy. All in all, complacency is the last thing Kashmir needs.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-killing-of-a-moderate/article14683216.ece
16,4,2011,BRICS moves ahead,"The Sanya Declaration by the heads of state and government of Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) marks a strengthening of this emerging country partnership on the world stage in at least two significant respects. First, BRIC has become BRICS with South Africa — a rainbow nation of 50 million people, abundant natural resources, a middle income economy, and tremendous potential — joining the forum as a full member. Secondly, the grouping has gained coherence as well as confidence in articulating forward-looking positions on global economic and, to an extent, political issues. The formulation of an Action Plan at Sanya to enhance existing cooperation programmes, engage in new areas, and explore new proposals for working together indicates increased commitment. The global financial crisis brought BRIC to the fore and gave its emerging common positions salience; and on the trade and economic front and also on climate change, BRICS solidarity has been real and quite robust. Further, the Sanya declaration sends out a message on what is badly needed in international relations: a greater role and voice for developing countries — and specifically these five rising powers, which have a combined population of three billion, that is, more than 40 per cent of the global population — on issues of “world peace, security and stability, boosting global economic growth, enhancing multilateralism, and promoting greater democracy in international relations.”
However, the reality is that each of the five countries regards its ties with the United States as its most important bilateral relationship and is excessively wary of displeasing Washington. How else to explain their attitude to the indefensible military attacks, from the air, on Libya by the United Kingdom, France, and the U.S.? The BRICS stance, formulated in the Sanya declaration, is disapproval of external military intervention in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) and West African regions; thus, “we share the principle that the use of force should be avoided...[and] we maintain that the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of each nation should be respected.” How to square this stance with the vote of each of the five BRICS members — despite their concurrent presence in the United Nations Security Council in 2011 — on Resolution 1973, which provided cover for the western military attacks? The two permanent members, Russia and China, failed to veto the resolution but abstained; South Africa voted for the resolution; and India and Brazil equivocated by abstaining. There is a moral here. BRICS has made real progress since Brazil, Russia, India, and China held the grouping's first summit in June 2009 at Yekaterinburg in Russia and issued a declaration calling for the establishment of an equitable, democratic, and multi-polar world order. Now they need to put more sincerity and substance into this very worthwhile coming together.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/BRICS-moves-ahead/article14684512.ece
16,4,2011,Nigerians back democracy,"The legislative assembly elections in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country with 160 million people, stand out for improved procedures after a bad start. The polls had been scheduled for April 2 but ballot papers did not arrive in time; officials were absent from several polling stations; and electoral registers were incomplete. However, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) rose to the challenge, and the postponed poll took place a week later. Given the troubled record of Nigerian elections since the 1999 restoration of democracy, problems were expected. A bomb killed 10 people near the national capital Abuja; in the north-east, a polling booth and a counting centre were bombed; gunmen murdered a politician belonging to the All Nigeria Peoples Party, and four others died in an attack on officials; and in the west, seven died in election-related violence. As for the outcome, all opposition parties in Enugu state have complained of vote-rigging in favour of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and there have been complaints in several other states as well.
With 70 per cent of the results declared so far, President Goodluck Jonathan's PDP have suffered significant losses. The main gainers are the newly-formed Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) and the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC). But final results will not be known until after April 26, when postponed polling is to take place in about one sixth of the constituencies. Although public perceptions of the overall election are favourable, any procedural improprieties could have wide effects. An exaggerated PDP presence, besides undermining public confidence, would render the national assembly much less capable of holding the executive to account over matters such as the influence of the Shell oil corporation — exposed by WikiLeaks — on the governance of the country. That, in turn, could affect the legitimacy of the Nigerian state itself. Any new government will face the challenges of reducing endemic corruption and distributing less inequitably the benefits of growth. The electorate has shown strong public spirit, by participating in vote counts and pushing party thugs away from polling stations. Women turned out in large numbers in the culturally traditional Muslim-majority north. Nigerian voters have shown their commitment to democracy; their newly-elected representatives will have to live up to this trust.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Nigerians-back-democracy/article14684511.ece
17,4,2011,A lesson in justice for Chhattisgarh,"In granting bail to Binayak Sen, the doctor who was convicted earlier this year by a trial court in Chhattisgarh, the Supreme Court has sent a clear message to the lower judiciary and law enforcement agencies throughout the country: the charge of sedition should not be bandied about lightly. Although the court passed only a one-line order, the observations made by Justices H.S. Bedi and C.K. Prasad during oral arguments on Friday add up to a scathing indictment of the weak case the Chhattisgarh government put up against the paediatrician and human rights activist. Their remarks also suggest the trial court did not apply its mind to the case. Justices Bedi and Prasad demolished two key parts of the prosecution's case during the bail hearing. First, they said the mere possession of Maoist literature did not make a person a Maoist. Secondly, and more crucially, they noted that since jailors supervised every meeting Dr. Sen had with Narayan Sanyal — the jailed Maoist leader whose messages he allegedly helped smuggle out — “the question of passing letters or documents does not arise.” If Chhattisgarh had a professional police force and well-functioning judiciary, these glaring weaknesses in the case against Dr. Sen would have been spotted at the very beginning of the legal process and the charges thrown out. Sadly, it has required the highest court in the country to lay this bare before the world.
In legal terms, Dr. Sen's appeal against his conviction will now continue at the Bilaspur High Court but the endgame, should that forum uphold the charge of sedition, is clear: going by its own observations, the Supreme Court is likely to acquit him eventually. Unfortunately, the Binayak Sen case is not the only Chhattisgarh-related matter involving blatant injustice to come to New Delhi. For the past two years, the Supreme Court has been considering a public interest litigation petition on the role of officially sponsored anti-Maoist vigilantes who have been responsible for the death and displacement of adivasis on a large scale. Though the Chhattisgarh government has repeatedly assured the court that the vigilante squads have been disbanded, it has dragged its feet on the registration of criminal cases and the provision of compensation for the victims of violence. Moreover, as the well-documented attack on innocent tribals in Tarmetla and other villages by the security forces last month demonstrates, vigilantism continues to exact a terrible human toll in the State. With the Raman Singh government refusing to accept responsibility for the appalling state of affairs in Dantewada, the one hope the adivasis of the region have for justice is with the Supreme Court.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-lesson-in-justice-for-Chhattisgarh/article14687061.ece
17,4,2011,Unlocking Mercury's secrets,"After a voyage of nearly eight billion kilometres that took over six and a half years, the Messenger spacecraft has settled down to its task of scientifically surveying Earth's enigmatic sibling, the planet Mercury. Recently, the American space probe began sending back images of that far away world, the first to be taken from a spacecraft in orbit around it. It is now 37 years since the Mariner-10 probe, which too had been despatched by the United States' National Aeronautics and Space Administration, provided images of that terra incognita as it thrice flew past the innermost planet in the Solar System. While the Mariner-10 could image less than half the planet, the Messenger (an acronym for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging) will cover all of it with 75,000 high-resolution images and also send back data from a variety of onboard instruments. The first such image shows in great detail a 90-km-wide crater called ‘Debussy' located in the South Pole, an area that was never seen before. Protected by a shade from the Sun's scorching heat, the Messenger's science mission will last a year as time is measured on Earth. But that is equivalent to just two Mercury days because the planet takes 176 Earth days to complete one rotation. So, although the probe is circling the planet once every 12 hours, it will be able to view any place on the surface under similar lighting conditions only twice during its mission. By combining information from images taken from two different angles, the topography of the planet can be mapped.
Mercury, one of the four inner rocky planets like Earth, could hold the key to understanding the formation and evolution of the planets in the Solar System. It is the smallest and densest of these planets; has the oldest surface; and experiences the largest daily surface temperature variations. Aside from imaging the planet, the mission has been designed to provide answers to six key questions: the planet's density; its geologic history; the internal magnetic field; the materials at its poles; its exosphere; and the structure of its core. The answers to these questions will help unlock many scientific secrets. For instance, knowing the size and nature of Mercury's core will make it possible to decipher its high density and possession of an internal magnetic field that is akin to the Earth's. Diverse data from Mariner-10's flyby of Mercury provided insights into its unknown features and raised questions about the then-prevalent theories. The next year promises to be rich in planetary surprises, as vast amounts of data from the Messenger come flooding back.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Unlocking-Mercurys-secrets/article14687059.ece
18,4,2011,Regime change under UNSC cover,"It is now obvious that Nato's purported mission, under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, to protect civilians in Libya is expanding into a flagrantly illegal attempt at regime change. With fierce fighting between rebels and government forces reported in the eastern city of Adjabiya and the western one of Misrata, President Barack Obama has stated that a military stalemate obtains. That means Nato has failed to protect civilians and prevent Muammar Qadhafi's ground forces from recapturing key rebel-held areas, with civilian casualties as a tragic consequence. In response, however, Mr. Obama and his main Nato collaborators, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister David Cameron, have published a joint article in The Washington Post, The Times, and Le Figaro, holding that “it is impossible to imagine a future for Libya with Gaddafi in power” and that “so long as Gaddafi is in power, Nato and its coalition partners must maintain their operations.”
The main problems in this exercise in military adventurism have been caused by the Resolution's lack of a clear political objective; it is the political issues that are now proving the most troublesome for the Alliance. One major miscalculation was the assumption that Mr. Qadhafi might be sufficiently influenced by the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) or the League of Arab States (the Arab League) to consider an agreement with the rebels or even to leave office. The Libyan President's defiant reaction exposed that idea as vacuous. Now Mr. Cameron refuses to rule out the deployment of ground troops, despite the fact that the U.N. Resolution specifically excludes that. The coalition's disarray is further confirmed by France's proposal, with which the United Kingdom disagrees, of a new Resolution; in any case Russia and China are likely to oppose anything that authorises regime change. Nevertheless, the evidence is increasingly clear that, even before they obtained the existing mandate, Washington, London, and Paris wanted only to remove Mr. Qadhafi. The U.S. has since approached various African Union member states about giving asylum to Mr. Qadhafi provided he leaves office. Secondly, at a recent coalition conference, Qatar and Italy pressed for arms supplies to the rebels. The most damaging evidence, however, is that the U.S. has sent an envoy to Benghazi to learn more about the rebel grouping, the Interim Transitional National Council. In effect, going through the U.N. was only a smokescreen for regime change. The Obama administration and its allies are repeating all the mistakes and miscalcuations made by George W. Bush and Tony Blair over the infamous and illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Regime-change-under-UNSC-cover/article14688117.ece
18,4,2011,Free this man,"No angle of the Khalil Chishty episode provides a pretty view. The octogenarian Pakistani was recently convicted in a 1992 murder case and handed down a life sentence by a trial court in Ajmer. Two weeks ago, the Rajasthan High Court turned down his plea for suspension of the sentence. For the nearly 20 years the case took to be decided, Dr. Chishty — a highly-qualified virologist — was out on bail, but remained hostage to the shockingly slow pace of the proceedings. His passport impounded, he could not return to his country. The case in which he was one of four accused related to a group clash in Ajmer that resulted in one person succumbing to a gunshot injury. Dr. Chishty, on a visit to Ajmer from Karachi, was present when the clash took place, apparently between two sets of his relatives. The trial court was evidently not impressed with his claim that he was only an onlooker and played no part in the violence. Independent of the merits of the case, it defies comprehension that a sessions court should have taken 19 long years to decide the matter. This is glacial speed even by the standards of the Indian judiciary. Even less comprehensible is the Rajasthan High Court's observation while turning down Dr. Chishty's plea for suspension of the sentence that “no leniency” could be shown to him as he was a Pakistani national, even as it granted identical appeals by the three others convicted in the case. Dr. Chishty, who is unable to walk unaided, began his sentence at the end of January this year; he is warded in the Ajmer jail hospital. While the courts may have decided to make an example of Dr. Chishty, awarding an old, infirm and ailing Pakistani, a life sentence after a delay of two decades is hardly a shining example of the Indian judiciary at work.
Dr. Chishty's saga stands out all the more in the light of the generosity of spirit Pakistan demonstrated by releasing Gopal Dass, an Indian citizen who had been incarcerated for 27 years, on an appeal from the Supreme Court of India. The recent thaw in relations has also seen Pakistan and India release a number of each other's nationals from jail. The two governments have decided to speed up the release of other prisoners. It seems to have finally dawned on the two sides that prisoners — mostly arrested for minor offences such as overstaying their visa or crossing the border — must not be used for settling scores between the two countries. In keeping with this, it would only be right for the Indian government to respond positively to the appeals for the release of Dr. Chishty by his family and human rights activists in both countries. He should be allowed to return to Pakistan and to his family immediately.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Free-this-man/article14688116.ece
19,4,2011,Looking forward to good rains,"The south-west monsoon, which provides about 80 per cent of the rainfall that India receives annually, sets the pace for the country's economy. Shortfalls in the monsoon not merely affect agriculture but set off reverberations in other sectors too. There will, therefore, be relief all round that the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has, in its seasonal forecast issued on Tuesday, predicted that this year's monsoon is “most likely to be normal.” The IMD has used a statistical model to predict the probabilities for the monsoon falling in one of five categories: deficient (where the total nationwide rainfall is less than 90 per cent of the long-period average); below normal (from 90 per cent to 96 per cent); normal (96 per cent to 104 per cent); above normal (104 per cent to 110 per cent); and excess (above 110 per cent). The ‘normal' as defined in the IMD's probabilistic forecast is very different from the normal in the vocabulary of atmospheric scientists. In the latter case, it refers to a monsoon when the rainfall is between 90 per cent and 110 per cent of the long-period average. However, when the probabilities for the middle three categories are added, the chances of a ‘normal' monsoon (in the sense used by scientists) will work out to 93 per cent. The rainfall data for over a century show that such a ‘normal' monsoon occurs in seven out of ten years. In other words, there is a greatly heightened probability of the monsoon turning out to be normal this year. By the same token, the prospect of a deficient monsoon, which always arouses the most concern, is put at just six per cent this year. That too is good news since such deficient monsoons have occurred in about 18 per cent of the years and, what is more worrying, on three occasions in the last 10 years. The chances of this year's monsoon turning excess are put at just one per cent.
The outlook for the monsoon can change in the coming months and this year's outcome is particularly difficult to forecast. Last year's monsoon was helped by a La Nina that began to develop in June, with the waters of the equatorial eastern and central Pacific Ocean turning cooler than usual. That La Nina has weakened. This transition phase is difficult to predict and the models are currently displaying a range of possibilities. A majority of the models suggest the present La Nina conditions could continue till June and then weaken further, according to the IMD. The question is whether this could set the stage for an El Nino to develop, with the equatorial Pacific becoming warmer than usual. An El Nino often adversely affects the monsoon and has been associated with 65 per cent of the drought years. Changes in the Indian Ocean too can have an impact. Let us hope that the IMD's prediction for a normal monsoon holds.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Looking-forward-to-good-rains/article14689301.ece
19,4,2011,Elusive development goals,"The latest reality check on global progress to make the world more inclusive presents mixed results. The Global Monitoring Report 2011 (GMR) on the Millennium Development Goals, prepared jointly by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, makes it clear that, despite some progress, key targets will remain elusive when the 2015 deadline is reached. There are positive signs that the goals relating to parity in primary and secondary education, completion of primary education, access to safe drinking water, and halving extreme poverty and hunger can be met. But there is cause for serious concern in the areas of child and maternal mortality and access to sanitation. One reason for this uneven progress is that access-based goals, such as education, are easier to achieve than those that can be measured by specific outcomes, such as healthcare. What emerges from this year's GMR, based on impact evaluations in health and education, is that, while the quantity of services has increased, the quality has not improved. Correcting this will be the key challenge that nations face in their endeavour to make the world less unjust. The mixed global picture, however, serves only a limited, albeit important purpose: to know how the world has fared in respect of the MDGs. And the answer is ‘not encouraging.' More critically, policies and institutions that are central to a country's ability to meet the MDGs are just not up to the challenge.
The performance of individual countries within this global picture is at least as important. Well-conceived and sincerely implemented policies can make the difference to people in countries that have to shake off persistent poverty. The GMR makes special mention of the economic growth witnessed in China and India as a positive factor in the world's progress towards MDGs. However, high economic growth rates do not at all mean inclusive growth. Further, absolute figures on poverty reduction do not tell the complete tale. Methodological issues aside, even if one looks at the rate of decline of poverty in India, it was 12.4 per cent between 1977-78 and 1987-88 compared with only 8.5 per cent between 1993-94 and 2004-05, as the recently released Chronic Poverty Report points out. Even going by the low poverty line measure that prevails in India, it is still home to the world's largest number of poor, estimated at 301.7 million. Herein is the clearest indication that present policies in India are ill-equipped to correct chronic poverty.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Elusive-development-goals/article14689300.ece
20,4,2011,Halt work at Jaitapur,"With the death of one person and injuries to several in police firing against the background of violent protests against the proposed nuclear power complex at Jaitapur in Maharashtra's Ratnagiri district, the controversy surrounding this project is all set to escalate. Some responsibility for this lies with the leading political opposition in the State, the Shiv Sena, which has spotted a political opportunity in the widespread unease among local communities in and around the proposed project area. However, the main reason for the rising tensions in Ratnagiri district is the peculiar intransigence of the State and central governments in this matter. Despite the Japanese nuclear emergency, they have dogmatically refused to put further execution of the project on hold; this is reflected in Minister for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh's statement last week that the project was a fait accompli. Risk theory as well as elementary norms of democratic governance suggest that nuclear power projects cannot be thrust on unwilling communities, in business-as-usual fashion. Predictably, the continuation of construction work on the boundary of the project area set off the latest round of protests.
The Japanese nuclear emergency has hardly abated. That the promised review of Indian nuclear installations has already been partially completed without any role for independent scientific expertise or public interventions suggests little willingness on the part of the central government and the atomic energy establishment to reassure the public through a transparent and thorough exercise. Even the scale of the Fukushima calamity appears to have done little to modify the insensitivity the Manmohan Singh government has shown on nuclear matters. The passage of the Nuclear Liability Act to reassure potential foreign investors in India's post-deal nuclear industry appeared to take precedence over safeguarding the interests of the Indian people; it actually happened during a countrywide stocktaking of industrial and environmental safety on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the Bhopal gas calamity. The current attitude to the Jaitapur protests only heightens the perception that assuaging genuine safety concerns in an open, democratic fashion matters little to a government that privileges the realisation of the nuclear deal above all else. There is no question of ruling out nuclear power tout court — but there is certainly a need for a larger debate, post-Fukushima, on its role vis-à-vis other sources of energy, including both fossil fuels and renewable sources. Forcing questionable projects on apprehensive communities after a traumatic international disaster is not the intelligent way to go.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Halt-work-at-Jaitapur/article13369659.ece
20,4,2011,PSLV notches up another success,"Buffeted by two consecutive failures of the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) and the scandal that erupted over a deal to provide S-band spectrum to a private company, the Indian Space Research Organisation has been yearning for some good news to lift the morale of its scientists and engineers. It got that on Wednesday when the workhorse of India's launch vehicle programme, the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), turned in another flawless performance. Well aware that it could ill-afford another launch failure, and that too of the PSLV with its impeccable record, the space agency had gone to great lengths to ensure a successful flight. The launch, originally scheduled for earlier this year, was postponed for checks on the Vikas liquid propellant engine. Lifting off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota on its 18th flight, the rocket precisely followed the planned trajectory and delivered three satellites into orbit 18 minutes later. The main payload, the earth-viewing Resourcesat-2, will provide data for a multitude of practical applications ranging from agricultural monitoring to studying snow cover and coastal zone mapping. India launched its first remote sensing satellite, the IRS-1A, aboard a Russian rocket in 1988. Many more followed, especially after the PSLV became available. India now has one of the largest constellations of remote sensing satellites in operation, supplying data to users at home and across the globe.
The PSLV was conceived as a rocket that would put 1,000-kg remote sensing satellites into orbit. After the failure of its first flight in 1993, the rocket was successfully flown a year later and has not looked back since. In the course of 17 successful launches, it has put 47 satellites into orbit, 21 of them Indian. Through a variety of weight-reducing measures and increased propellant loading, the rocket's performance has been steadily enhanced. In Wednesday's flight, the PSLV effortlessly carried three satellites that together weighed over 1,400 kg. The rocket has also proved capable of carrying out a range of missions. Apart from launching remote sensing satellites into polar orbit, it put the Kalpana meteorological satellite into a near-equatorial orbit and took the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft on the first leg of its journey to the Moon. Three more launches of the PSLV are scheduled this year. ISRO chairman K. Radhakrishnan has promised that a launch of the GSLV will follow. Indeed, a key challenge for the space agency will be to transform trouble-prone GSLV, equipped with an indigenous cryogenic stage, into as reliable a rocket as its predecessor.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/PSLV-notches-up-another-success/article14690381.ece
21,4,2011,Repeal the sedition law,"“I have no desire whatsoever to conceal from this court the fact that to preach disaffection towards the existing system of Government has almost become a passion with me,” declared Mahatma Gandhi in 1922, while pleading guilty to sedition as charged. “Affection cannot be manufactured or regulated by law,” he went on to say memorably, describing Section 124A as the “prince among the political sections of the Indian Penal Code designed to suppress liberty of the citizen.” The case, which related to two articles penned in Young India, ended with a reluctant judge, bound by the letter of the law, sentencing the Mahatma to six years in prison; in the same breath, he noted that no one would be “better pleased” were the man he sentenced released earlier. If Gandhi thought it was a “privilege” to be charged under Section 124A, it was because “some of the most loved of India's patriots have been convicted under it” — most famously, Bal Gangadhar Tilak who, when prosecuted for his speeches and writings twice, asked each time whether he was guilty of committing sedition against the British government or against the people of the country. That this is an archaic colonial-era law that has no place in any democracy that values freedom of expression was recognised by no less than Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who told Parliament in 1951 that he found Section 124A “highly objectionable and obnoxious.” “The sooner we got rid of it the better,” was his opinion of the broad and inexact provision that punishes those who, by use of words, signs or visible representation, “bring into hatred or contempt” or “excite disaffection” towards the government with a maximum of life imprisonment.
This raises the obvious question: why does the provision still remain in our statute books? And just as pertinently: why is it used to threaten and prosecute our thinkers and social activists because of an opinion they express or an ideology they may have some sympathy with? The conviction by a Sessions Court of civil rights activist Binayak Sen under Section 124A for his alleged links with a Maoist ideologue, and the sedition case registered against writer Arundhati Roy over a speech she made in Kashmir, are just two high-profile cases of the outrageous misuse of the law. Ms Roy is right in saying that “little pinholes of light” have emerged from the recent Supreme Court order granting bail to Binayak Sen, in which it said “no case of sedition has been made out” and where it drew a distinction between merely sympathising with a movement and committing an offence under Section 124A. Within hours of the order, Law Minister Veerappa Moily declared there was a need to review the sedition law and that the Law Commission of India would be asked to take a fresh look at it. While this is a positive development, the important thing is to scrap Section 124A — and quickly.
A climate in which it is permissible to express political dissent and question —– even savage — government policy is integral to the idea of free expression. The Supreme Court may have upheld the constitutional validity of Section 124A in Kedar Nath Singh vs. State of Bihar (1962), but made it more than clear that sedition does not apply to mere “criticism of government action, however strongly worded.” The operation of the provision, the five-member bench ruled, would be limited to cases where what is said or spoken incites violence and public disorder — a line of thought that broadly conforms to John Stuart Mill's famous ‘harm principle,' which suggests that the only justification for curbing a person's expression against his will is to prevent him from causing harm to others. Unfortunately, our prosecuting authorities and the lower judiciary have failed to understand that the scope of the sedition law is severely limited. Otherwise, a magistrate would not have ordered a sedition case against Ms Roy for saying, at a seminar, that Kashmir's status was not settled despite accession to India. And a sessions court would not have held that possessing Maoist literature, as Binayak Sen was charged with having, would constitute a ground for treating the person as a subversive. As the Supreme Court sarcastically observed, “If a copy of Gandhi's autobiography were found in somebody's place, can he be called a Gandhian?”
Section 124A was not a part of the original Indian Penal Code 1860. It was introduced 10 years later and then amended in 1898 to include seditious libel (bringing the government into hatred or contempt). It is distressing that we are slapping sedition cases on people when the offence has been rendered obsolete in many countries, either through a formal scrapping of the sedition law or by rendering it virtually toothless because of judicial rulings. Over the years, the United States has had a slew of laws making it an offence to bring its government into hatred or contempt. Some like the Sedition Act of 1918 have been repealed; others like the Smith Act, which was enacted in 1940, have been made a dead letter thanks to Supreme Court intervention. The last completed trial in a case of sedition (a common law offence) in Britain dates back to 1947. Even so, the British government thought it fit to abolish the offences of sedition and seditious libel in early 2010. One of the reasons cited for scrapping these offences — obsolete though they had become — was that their formal existence in Britain was used by other countries to justify their retention and use them to suppress political dissent. There is no place in a democracy for a law that conflates disaffection with disloyalty and regards trenchant criticism as a form of treason. What was once an instrument by British colonialism to suppress the freedom struggle cannot be retained by the state to silence the voices of its own people. It's time Section 124A was sent to where it really belongs — to the scrapheap of repealed laws.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Repeal-the-sedition-law/article14691554.ece
22,4,2011,The superbug effect,"The discovery of the New Delhi mettallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) in 51 of 151 sewage samples and two of 50 drinking water samples taken from India's capital indicates that the superbug is present in the environment and is no longer a hospital-born infection. The study published online in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal (“Dissemination of NDM-1 positive bacteria in the New Delhi environment and its implications for human health: an environment point prevalence study,” by Timothy R. Walsh et al.) found that the NDM-1 gene has spread to families of gram-negative bacteria like E. coli that populate the human gut. The drug-resistant gene has been found even in pathogenic bacteria that cause cholera and dysentery. Transfer of the NDM-1 gene to bacteria belonging to a different species is possible as it is carried in the plasmids, which are capable of moving from one bacterium to another. Transfer of the plasmids carrying the NDM-1 gene was highest at 30°C, the average peak temperature, and within the daily temperature range of New Delhi from April to October. Most importantly, the transfer has been facilitated by poor sanitation, as reflected by the oral-faecal route of transmission.
It is clear that the two papers (August 2010 and April 2011) have at last shaken the government, which has initially been in denial, out of its slumber and inaction. The Indian Council of Medical Research has invited research proposals from scientists to generate scientific evidence on antimicrobial resistance. This move indicates that the apex medical research body has finally realised there is no place for jingoism in matters of science, and that the latest findings must be taken seriously and verified scientifically. The exercise will prove useful only if researchers are truly free to report the presence of the superbug and the extent of its spread. The second important development has been the drafting of the much-needed national policy for containment of antimicrobial resistance. The policy admits that the use of antibiotics is inappropriate in 20 per cent to 50 per cent of cases. It targets the indiscriminate use of antibiotics in food animals and intends to curb the practice since it ultimately causes drug resistance in humans. Most importantly, access to third generation antibiotics like carbapenems is to be restricted to tertiary hospitals. But even in these hospitals, efforts must be directed toward restricting its use to patients with severe infections. The government should waste no time in creating a national surveillance system for measuring antibiotic resistance if it is serious about getting on top of the problem.

22,4,2011,Syria starts reforming,"Against a background of nationwide public protests in which scores of people were killed in the past few weeks, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria has, in two major speeches, outlined potentially far-reaching reforms. To start with, he would lift the 48-year-long state of emergency. He also signalled substantial changes of perspective. For example, he has stated that a “gap” had appeared between the public and the state as a result of corruption and unemployment, and that the government, state institutions, and the people must “move in parallel” on the basis of wider communication or a “broad dialogue” involving different sections of society, including trade unions. Explicitly recognising that transparency and public trust are essential to this process, Mr. Assad indicated that the draft law on multi-party political system would receive fresh attention, though he cautioned that reform must not turn into chaos and repeatedly referred to outside forces and conspiracies. The Syrian cabinet moved swiftly after the second speech, approving an end to the emergency and permitting peaceful protest.
Nevertheless, it could take some considerable time for institutions of state, and the security forces in particular, to fall in line with the government's new thinking. During the night following the President's second speech, the cities of Homs and Baniyas were virtually shut down after shootings by security forces, which reportedly claimed 25 lives. The Interior Ministry, for its part, has said “terrorist activities” would not be tolerated; it has blamed Salafist bodies for the continuing confrontation. In response to the killings, protesters now demand that Mr. Assad should step down. This has much wider ramifications in view of Syria's modern history. In 1916, Syrians paid with their lives because their country was the only one to resist the Anglo-French Sykes-Picot agreement, which arbitrarily divided West Asia. In recent decades, Damascus has resolutely favoured a Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement, while withstanding attacks and provocations. It has also granted citizenship to Kurdish communities within its borders. The Syrian political establishment's references to outside influences are likely to anger protesters — and the wider public — who see themselves as acting patriotically. It would be disingenuous to see faceless enemies pulling the strings behind the current protests. Mr. Assad's stated intentions of reform are unexceptionable, but it is to be hoped that he can put through genuine democratic change without recourse to conspiracy theories. Syria is too important regionally, and internationally, to allow itself to be in a state of denial.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Syria-starts-reforming/article14692916.ece
25,4,2011,A disappointing verdict in Pakistan,"Since the day in 2002 when she decided to seek punishment for the men who had gang-raped her, Mukhtaran Mai has been a symbol of Pakistani women's struggle against a feudal and patriarchal society in which brutal crimes against women are condoned in the name of honour and custom. In Mukhtaran's case, a panchayat in her village abetted the rape as “punishment” for her 12-year-old brother's alleged illicit relations with a girl of a higher caste. It was expected that, after the treatment meted out to her, Mukhtaran, in keeping with tradition, would conveniently commit suicide, and no liability would fall on any man. But this extraordinarily brave woman, unlettered at the time of the monstrous crime, decided to defy societal taboos to take her attackers to court. It is disappointing that Pakistan's highest court has ruled against her. On April 21, a three-judge bench upheld, by a majority of two to one, the Lahore High Court's acquittal of five men accused of the rape (while confirming the life sentence to a sixth) on the ground of insufficient evidence. The verdict is unsettling for several reasons. In most of South Asia, for reasons that are well known, it is never easy for a woman to make a formal complaint of rape. This verdict sets the bar for evidence so high — in contrast are the evidentiary requirements in a blasphemy case — that it can only act as further discouragement to rape victims seeking justice. It is also bound to add to the prevailing climate of impunity in which such crimes are committed, and serve as encouragement to parallel, anti-women systems of justice such as jirgas and panchayats. As for Mukhtaran Mai, the verdict has shattered the hopes she had placed in the judiciary all these years. With the men she named as her rapists now free, she apprehends danger to her life.
For the women's movement in Pakistan, the Supreme Court decision is a huge setback, and it is no surprise that, after playing an active role in the 2007-09 lawyers' movement for the restoration of Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary and an independent judiciary, it should feel let down. In the nine years it has taken for the case to be decided, Mukhtaran has been an inspirational example of women's agency, discarding victimhood to fight her own battle and, alongside, help other women in similar situations. It would indeed be a travesty if her name were to become synonymous with justice denied. Thus far, the Pakistan People's Party government has shown little courage on issues that matter. But given its claim to a progressive vision on women's rights in Pakistan, the least it can do is to press for a review of this verdict.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-disappointing-verdict-in-Pakistan/article14698953.ece
25,4,2011,Will Algerians get involved?,"The Algerian predicament shows that the political situations faced by the peoples of North Africa and West Asia cannot all be seen in the same light, despite specific similarities. The current protests in Algeria have indeed been in support of changes similar to those demanded in the rest of the region — democratic reform, freedom from corruption, and civil rights. It also bears recall that the last presidential election — in which President Abdel Aziz Bouteflika took 90.2 per cent of the vote — was boycotted by opposition parties, who alleged widespread fraud. A key difference between Algeria and many of its neighbours, however, is that it has relatively free privately owned media organisations, apart from state-run media. Further, television broadcasts from France are widely watched, and internet access is generally unrestricted. Secondly, revenues from recently discovered oil and natural gas reserves have enabled Mr. Bouteflika to subsidise food and award public service staff huge pay rises.
The Algerian street continues to be wary of political involvement, and the protests have been on a much smaller scale than those in neighbouring countries. This caution is understandable in view of their country's terrible legacy of violence. In the liberation struggle against France, more than a million people died before the colonial power left in 1962. Later, the country went through a decade of civil war that followed the annulment of the 1992 election after the first round, which was won by the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS); about 150,000 were butchered. The military regained its political dominance, imposing an emergency that lasted until February 24, 2011. The armed forces continue to be involved in domestic security, and public protest is banned in the capital, Algiers. The President has acted to mollify public anger over inflation and runaway food prices through concessions. While such measures do not address the structural issues of corruption and unemployment, the evidence is that a substantial proportion of the 35 million population continues to be disengaged from public participation. When protest movements struggle to sustain their momentum, the government can claim they have little or no popular support. All this has international ramifications too: the European Union, for example, can maintain trade and economic relations with Algeria without too much controversy. But the clock is ticking. Algerians must show the courage, the clear-sightedness, and the wisdom needed to usher in democratic political reform without blood-letting. This will benefit not just Africa's second largest country but also the region beyond.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Will-Algerians-get-involved/article14698956.ece
26,4,2011,"Sai Baba, his life and legacy","In a country that has never been short of self-proclaimed godmen peddling spiritual succour with commercial motive, Sri Sathya Sai Baba, who passed away at the age of 84 at Puttaparthi in Andhra Pradesh on April 24, 2011, stands out as a rare phenomenon — a spiritual leader whose mass following transcended linguistic, national, and religious boundaries, who channelised the fervour and quest of millions of devotees into giving and sharing, who steered clear of divisive political and communal activities all his life. In the complex spiritual spectrum of modern-day India, Sai Baba may not have been associated with a metaphysical and transcendent philosophy like Sri Aurobindo, or the fervent devotion to the divine that often sent Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa into a trance, or the self-enquiry and non-dualism that made Sri Ramana Maharishi a silent, yet eloquent preceptor. Yet Sai Baba's simple message of love and harmony — mostly soaked in the language of Hindu philosophy, but often in a universal strain — was enough to draw the masses towards him. Among those who sought his guidance were the harried and the content businessperson, the troubled and the sated householder, politicians in search of peace, and the more humble seekers of solace from the rigours of life. His early reputation was built on a series of miracles such as producing vibhuthi (holy ash) or rings or miniature shivalings out of thin air, which invited disdain from rationalists who saw these as nothing more than sleight of hand; there were other controversies as well. His ardent devotees, on the other hand, saw the miracles as mere expressions of his divine powers, and his teachings and the manner in which he touched their lives as far more important.
Sai Baba's phenomenal mass appeal lay in his unswerving commitment to communal harmony, his encouragement of charitable activity and public-spiritedness, and his own example in building educational and health care institutions that focussed on meeting basic needs on a large scale. Among the projects executed by his Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust, the drinking water supply projects for Ananthapur district and Chennai city stand out. The latter effort, a Rs.200 crore project to strengthen the Kandaleru-Poondi canal through which waters of the Krishna reached the metropolis, earned the admiration of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, a non-believer who went so far as to describe Sai Baba as “one equivalent to God.” His devotees may or may not be on the lookout for a reincarnation in some remote place but for society at large, his legacy will be the message of love and harmony and the altruistic activities of his cash-rich trust that, without his guiding hand, needs to resist temptation and carry on with integrity, transparency, and imagination.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Sai-Baba-his-life-and-legacy/article14808978.ece
26,4,2011,Get on with the job,"The basic task of the joint drafting committee — to prepare a strong and credible Lokpal Bill — seems in danger of subversion by smear campaigns, loose talk, and backroom machinations. It is imperative that the principal objective is not lost sight of in this climate of conspiracy and intrigue: to reach an agreement on a draft legislation that will put in place an effective anti-corruption and grievance redressal mechanism. It is a relief that Justice Santosh Hegde, dismayed by the relentless attacks on himself and other civil society members of the committee, has been persuaded to stay on; had the Karnataka Lokayuta resigned as he threatened to, it would have weakened civil society representation as well as the general resolve to draw up a robust Lokpal Bill. Anna Hazare won a huge victory when his stunningly successful protest movement forced the Centre to agree not only to draft a fresh Bill but to do so with civil society activists as a part of the consultative process. It would be a shame if character assassination and other forms of pressure were allowed to sabotage this spirited initiative.
At the same time, it is important that the civil society activists on the panel do not strike recalcitrant postures and that they show the open-mindedness required for such a consultative process. The Centre's aborted draft Bill defeated its own purpose by severely restricting the Lokpal's discretion to probe corruption complaints received from the general public. But certain features of civil society's proposed alternative, the so-called Jan Lokpal Bill, have been rightly criticised as being unworkable, unnecessary, and excessive. For instance, the Lokpal was originally envisaged as an Ombudsman on the lines of those in the Scandinavian countries, and not — as the civil society draft bill does — as a kind of Supercop who lords it over the Central Bureau of Investigation. Moreover, if the Lokpal is allowed to probe allegations of misconduct against High Court and Supreme Court judges, what becomes of the Judicial Standards and Accountability Bill that seeks to achieve this very purpose and is to be presented in Parliament shortly? The Lokpal Bill cannot alter the very structure of the criminal justice system or be allowed to compromise institutions that are integral to our democratic and constitutional order. What India badly needs is a Lokpal Bill with teeth, which fixes the glaring weaknesses in the government draft while staying clear of the eccentricities in the civil society version.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Get-on-with-the-job/article13642483.ece
27,4,2011,Small but significant step,"The supplementary charge sheet in the 2G spectrum allocation case is a small but significant step for the Central Bureau of Investigation in what is clearly a difficult journey in pursuit of truth and justice. The first charge sheet kept out some sensitive names for reasons of political expediency. The second deals mostly with one money trail, involving about Rs.200 crore, from Swan Telecom to Kalaignar TV, which is but a small part of the Rs.22,000 crore that the CBI estimates to be the loss to the government in the spectrum scam. However, in the context of the criminal investigation of the case, this money trail plays a crucial role by laying bare an intricate web of financial transactions which, decoded, could establish a quid pro quo between politicians in power and businessmen who benefited from the manipulation of the ‘first-come, first-served' policy in spectrum allocation. True, Kalaignar TV paid back the amount with interest, but this was only between December 2010 and February 2011 after the CBI registered the case, which seemed more like a cover-up attempt. Moreover, during the period of the transaction between December 2008 and August 2009, the paid-up equity of Kalaignar TV was merely Rs.10.01 crore, and its entire income for the year ending March 31, 2009 Rs.47.54 crore. Not surprisingly, the judge of the Special Court, taking cognisance of the charge sheet, said he was satisfied that there was “enough incriminating material on record to proceed against the accused persons.”
While questions have been raised about the non-inclusion of Dayalu Ammal, wife of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, who owns 60 per cent of the shares in Kalaignar TV, the CBI's reasoning is that the octogenarian had informed the board of directors as far back as July 27, 2007 of her inability to “give any attention to the company's affairs.” Because of her “age and non-understanding of any language other than Tamil,” she had told the board of directors, she would attend its meetings “only to suffice the legal requirement to have quorum.” In the case of Ms Kanimozhi, although she was not a director, the charge sheet names her as a co-conspirator alleging a strong association with A. Raja in “official/political matters.” It was important for the CBI to demonstrate to the Supreme Court of India, which is monitoring this investigation, and the public that there would be no let-up in the investigation under political pressure. But given the nature and size of the scam and the time lost, the agency will need to discover and pursue other money trails to carry the investigation through to its logical end. The question on everyone's lips, ‘where did the rest of the money go?', needs some quick and decisive answers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Small-but-significant-step/article14698955.ece
27,4,2011,"Don't doom these temples, please","The border row between Thailand and Cambodia troublingly shows no sign of ending. The two countries have once again traded gunfire, this time near two 12th century temples in an area that is claimed by both sides. It is unclear who fired the first shot, but in three days of fighting 11 soldiers — five on the Thai side, and six on the Cambodian — were killed, and more than 40 wounded. Thousands of civilians have been displaced. This is the second flare-up on the border this year. In February, there was fighting near Preah Vihear, another temple 200 km from the site of the latest confrontation. ASEAN managed to douse the tension the last time, with Indonesia, currently in the chair, playing the mediator. An informal ceasefire came into place, but a peace agreement to post unarmed Indonesian military observers along the border remained on paper because of Thailand's resistance to outside intervention in what it considers a bilateral matter. On the other hand, Cambodia clearly wants to internationalise the issue beyond ASEAN: during the February clashes, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen complained to the United Nations Security Council that Thai forces had invaded his country. In the circumstances, the door appears closed to ASEAN's mediatory initiatives. The cancellation of the Indonesian Foreign Minister's April 25 visit to Bangkok as well as Phnom Penh was the clearest indication of this.
While sizable portions of the Thai-Cambodian border are undemarcated, the main dispute is centred on their rival claims to the Preah Vihear temple. A 1962 International Court of Justice ruling that the 900-year-old Siva temple belonged to Cambodia failed to resolve the problem as it did not address the rival claims to the territory around the temple. In 2008, the temple's listing as a UNESCO World Heritage site further angered Thais, and led to the first military face-off on this issue. In both countries, the issue is handy for politicians to whip up nationalist sentiments and make allegations that sovereignty has been ceded to the other side. While rhetoric is one thing, a military confrontation can hardly provide a solution. The two countries must also keep in mind the risks to the temples. Preah Vihear is held to be one of the finest examples of Khmer architecture outside Angkor; any damage to it would be tragic and self-defeating. As responsible members of the international community, Thailand and Cambodia must both muster the political will to resolve this long-standing row peacefully, soon.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Dont-doom-these-temples-please/article14698954.ece
28,4,2011,America's shameful secret WikiLeaked,"Guantánamo is an insult to human civilisation — and American values — but it has survived as a prison for nearly a decade largely because successive U.S. administrations have peddled the myth that its cell blocks are a vital frontline in the global war against terror. So dangerous are the men ‘Gitmo' holds, it is claimed, that they can never be safely released from captivity or even afforded the protections of an open and transparent judicial process. This myth has now been exploded by the release and publication of more than 700 official Pentagon documents by WikiLeaks. The documents lay bare what U.S. military interrogators knew about the men they were holding. And though they do not tell us much about the interrogation techniques used at Guantánamo or the other prisons to which many were initially “rendered,” the files provide a damning insight into a chaotic and dysfunctional system that swept up individuals with no connection to al-Qaeda or terrorism and held them for months and even years at a stretch despite their innocence being apparent after a few weeks of detention. Of the 600-odd prisoners released since 2002, some turned out to have been press-ganged by the Taliban or al-Qaeda in the chaotic days following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, while others were framed by unreliable bounty-hunters.
Above all, the documents establish the ineffectiveness of the Guantánamo method as a means of fighting terror. Terrorism may be a special crime that requires special investigative tools but what the latest files reveal is the ad hoc and even experimental nature of the interrogation enterprise in which U.S. military personnel simply made up the rules as they went along. And the inefficiencies cut both ways: innocent men — including one Afghan as old as 89 — and children as young as 14 languished for long periods while potentially dangerous individuals, such as Abu Sufian Qumu of the al-Qaeda, were released. Qumu is now said to be leading a section of the Nato-backed rebels fighting against the Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi. Another interesting aspect of the documents is the place accorded to Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) directorate in the 2007 Joint Task Force Guantánamo Matrix of Threat Indicators for Enemy Combatants. Any link to the ISI or al-Qaida, Hamas, or Hizbollah, the document notes, should be considered an indication of terrorist or insurgent activity. This assessment points to the single biggest flaw in the U.S. approach to terrorism. When it is clear at the operational level that the problem lies in Pakistan and its ISI, facilities such as Guantánamo are, at best, a lawless, witch-doctorish attempt to treat the symptom without going after the root cause of the disease. In reality, we know Gitmo doesn't even treat the symptom. It corrodes the very attributes of human civilisation that the terrorists wish to destroy. There can be no substitute for due process and the rule of law, even for men accused of monstrous crimes. That is why Barack Obama once promised to shut the place down. The latest documents are a reminder of that unfulfilled promise. Bravo WikiLeaks.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Americas-shameful-secret-WikiLeaked/article14698958.ece
28,4,2011,Caveats to an upbeat outlook,"The International Monetary Fund's twice-yearly publication, the World Economic Outlook, has been tracking the progress of the global economy in its recovery phase. During the early days of recovery, world economic growth was sustained by the large developing economies, especially China and India. Recently, recovery has become more broad-based, if still uneven. According to the latest WEO, the advanced economies will continue to recover from the global financial crisis while many developing economies are above pre-crisis trend levels. The ‘two-speed' recovery carries with it risks. It has resulted in a situation where the world's major economic powers are either unwilling or unable to agree on a common approach to solving global problems. Global financial imbalances cannot be tackled because deficit and surplus countries differ sharply on the policies to be adopted. Virtually every country professes faith in multilateral trade, yet the Doha round is in danger of collapse. G20 countries have found it more difficult to co-ordinate their strategies during the recovery phase than they were able to during the crisis.
The IMF forecasts world gross domestic product to expand by 4.4 per cent this year and by 4.5 per cent in 2012. The advanced economies will grow at 2.4 per cent in 2011 and 2.6 per cent in 2012 and the emerging and developing countries at 6.5 per cent in both years. Many old challenges remain unaddressed even as new ones have emerged. Weak sovereign balance sheets and still moribund real estate markets remain major concerns, especially in some euro area countries. Strengthening the recovery in the developed economies requires that ultra-soft monetary policies continue but these fuel potentially destabilising capital flows to India, Brazil, and other emerging economies. Financial conditions remain fragile in some countries. Rising food and commodity prices impose harsh burdens on people. For India and many emerging economies, the challenge is to ensure that boom-like conditions do not yield to overheating in the coming year. Inflation is likely to intensify as capacity constraints accentuate supply side pressures. The IMF has marked down India's growth estimate to 8.2 per cent this year, from 10.4 per cent in 2010.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Caveats-to-an-upbeat-outlook/article14698957.ece
29,4,2011,Jaitapur and nuclear safety,"The announcement by the Prime Minister's Office that the government will soon create, through appropriate legislation, an independent and autonomous Nuclear Regulatory Authority that subsumes the existing Atomic Energy Regulatory Board will be widely welcomed. Those concerned with India's nuclear safety and regulatory issues have long been of the conviction that what needs to be done cannot be directed and implemented by a body that is under the authority of the very system it is mandated to oversee. The official assurances of complete transparency in the nuclear power domain, the promise to put the post-Fukushima reviews of nuclear safety in the public domain, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's call to the atomic energy establishment to continuously engage with public opinion on safety are not without significance. Further, Minister of Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh has taken the lead in this ‘new thinking' with his willingness to engage in public debate on a difficult issue and with his concrete proposals to assuage serious concerns. However, the government will be fooling itself if it does not recognise that public opinion remains apprehensive in light of what has happened at Fukushima. Reassuring words need to be backed with actions that demonstrate that the independence and the autonomy of the new authority as well as the promises of transparency will be real and substantive.
Against this background, what causes concern is the government's dogmatic insistence that it is not willing to take a fresh look at the Jaitapur power project. Reiterating its determination to go ahead, it has insensitively added that a comprehensive environmental review will be undertaken after the project's first phase of two 1650 MW reactors is completed by 2019. At stake is not merely compensation for those whose assets and livelihood will be affected by the project, though that is important. The crux of the disputation is related to fears regarding the long-term environmental impact of the project and the long-term safety of the reactor complex. The government would do well to address these issues directly and transparently, abandoning any fear that pressing the pause button would result in anti-nuclear-power groups running away with the agenda. Its assurance that it takes strengthening domestic nuclear capabilities seriously lacks credibility, considering that it has virtually ruled out the possibility of modifying the Jaitapur project in overall scale as well as the size, design, and make of the individual reactors. If the new policy outlook on nuclear safety is to win credibility among the people, the government must halt the work in progress at Jaitapur and talk sincerely with the protesters and the sceptics, keeping an open mind on the future of the project.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Jaitapur-and-nuclear-safety/article14741410.ece
29,4,2011,Address the crisis at its roots,"Air India has managed to remain in the news for the wrong reasons. After years of being in the red and repeatedly asking the Government of India to bale the airline out of its financial mess, it has been unable to sort out its labour issues and long-standing problems with its pilots. Normally, the passengers, who are at the receiving end of such strikes, have no sympathy for the pilots because they may be the highest paid class of employees in an airline. But the present case is somewhat different — at the very least, it has to be understood from a different perspective. Although the passengers are put to hardship, and hundreds of families are losing out on their summer holidays for no fault of theirs, the striking pilots, affiliated to the Indian Commercial Pilots' Association (ICPA), have some legitimate demands that need to be addressed. From 2007, the process of merging the two national carriers — Indian Airlines and Air India — has been going on endlessly at the management and the government levels. Even the muddling-through has not been completed and glaring inequalities between the staff of the two merged entities remain.
The pilots who were originally with Indian Airlines have been demanding parity in pay with their counterparts in Air India. A pilot's monthly pay package depends on the number of hours he flies. For a variety of reasons, the Indian Airlines segment that takes care of the domestic sector has not been able to operate as many flights as it used to. So the take-home salaries of those pilots have dipped. Since pay parity has also not been achieved and the pilots borne on Air India cadre fly on the foreign routes, the differences seem striking. Without addressing this basic issue, arising out of an ill-planned and perhaps even unwise merger, the airline management and the Union Civil Aviation Ministry are dealing with it as an industrial relations exercise — derecognising ICPA and sacking at least eight of the striking pilots. With over 50 flights cancelled each day, the passengers have been left in the lurch. Those who need to fly have been placed at the mercy of private airlines which have silently raised the fares, given the dynamic pricing policy in place. Political interference in the running of the national carrier has also affected Air India over the years, denying it a level-playing field with the private airlines. Good sense demands that the Air India management initiate talks with the pilots to first end the strike, and then resolve the long-standing issue urgently.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Address-the-crisis-at-its-roots/article14741409.ece
30,4,2011,Avoiding debate,"That the Public Accounts Committee, which is examining the loss to the exchequer in the 2G spectrum allocation scandal, would split along party lines was expected. But the attempts by members of the ruling United Progressive Alliance to discredit and dump the entire draft PAC report have gone beyond tolerable levels of political partisanship — and now threaten parliamentary procedures and established norms. While some of the concerns about “factual discrepancies” in the report merited consideration, nothing could possibly justify the desperate methods adopted by the ruling coalition members at the PAC meeting. After committee chairman Murli Manohar Joshi had ‘adjourned' the meeting, the UPA members elected Congressman Saifuddin Soz to the Chair and organised a ‘vote' to reject the draft wholesale. The UPA just about had numbers, after winning over the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party, which support the government from outside. The ‘vote' rejecting the report was carried 11 to none, after Dr. Joshi and other opposition Members of Parliament walked out. But the appropriateness of the vote itself is in question, as Dr. Joshi says he adjourned the meeting seeking time to examine the allegations of discrepancies in the report. The proper course would have been to thoroughly debate the draft report, rectify discrepancies and errors, and then decide on submitting it to the Lok Sabha Speaker. Instead, chaos was engineered at the PAC meeting to avoid any discussion on the inconvenient issues raised by the draft report on the acts of commission and omission by the former Communications Minister A. Raja, and on the failure of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Prime Minister's Office to prevent the defrauding of the exchequer through the manipulation of an already-flawed ‘first-come first-served' policy.
Questions about the leak of the draft should not be allowed to divert attention from the work of the PAC, which succeeded in raising key issues in the 2G scam. It is just as well that the document is in the public domain, enabling people to read it and make up their mind on the contentious issues. The UPA, which shamelessly stonewalled demands for a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe by pointing to the PAC's work on the same issue, cannot be allowed to undermine the PAC in the name of an ongoing JPC probe. If the 21-member PAC is unable to agree on the report, Dr. Joshi might feel compelled to submit it directly to the Speaker, who will have the final call on its adoption. The ruling coalition members would be well-advised to discuss all the facts and issues brought up by the draft report, rather than seek to use its thin majority in the PAC to politically shield those involved in, or accountable for, India's biggest corruption scandal.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Avoiding-debate/article14905444.ece
30,4,2011,From kompa to political stage,"The former kompa musician Michel Martelly has decisively won the Haitian presidential election in a runoff that was delayed after his supporters took to the streets alleging extensive fraud and intimidation in the December 2010 first round. Mr. Martelly apparently came third, but the Organization of American States (OAS) confirmed the allegations, and the purported front-runner, Jude Célestin of the ruling Unity party, was eliminated from the race. In the runoff, preliminary results show that Mr. Martelly has taken close to 68 per cent of the vote to trounce his rival Mirlande Manigat, a law professor. Distancing himself from his provocative stage persona, the new President has started off with a restrained statement of the tasks facing his country, one of the poorest in the world. He has called for political parties to work in harmony. He can expect strong support from the poor, who voted overwhelmingly for him. Haiti's problems are enormous. Nearly 700,000 people displaced by the colossal earthquake in January 2009 still live in camps; large amounts of rubble are yet to be cleared; and people living in rural areas are at risk of contracting cholera, a powerful strain of which has been brought in by U.N. Stabilisation Mission troops.
President Martelly also faces big political challenges. He may have to work with a Unity Prime Minister, as that party is likely to win both the 99-seat Chamber of Deputies and the 30-seat Senate. Even the composition of parliament is uncertain following a disputed Provisional Electoral Council move, which gave 17 seats to Unity by reversing several results. Secondly, Washington has stopped supporting brutal Caribbean dictators, but finds itself unable to stop intervening in the affairs of the region. U.S. government money for Haitian reconstruction has gone overwhelmingly to U.S. contractors — to the tune of 97.5 per cent of nearly $200 million allocated. In addition, Washington put pressure on Haiti and South Africa, where the ex-President Jean-Bertrande Aristide was in exile, to delay his return until after the election. Mr. Aristide, Haiti's first elected President and the victim of a Washington-aided coup in 2004, is now back in Port-au-Prince. He cannot contest the presidency again, but will probably have considerable influence; that could be a problem for Mr. Martelly, whose landslide win is based on a turnout reduced to 23 per cent by a ban on Mr. Aristide's Fanmi Lavalas party. It is to be hoped that Mr. Martelly can rise to the challenges and give Haitians the stable democracy they badly need.

2,5,2011,What the end of bin Laden means,"In the nearly 10 years since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, if there was a man who could claim responsibility for single-handedly setting the world's agenda, it was Osama bin Laden. As the smiling face behind the 9/11 attacks, the leader of a global terror network that reared its head in countries from the U.S. to the United Kingdom to Indonesia, bin Laden changed the way we led our lives in more ways than has yet been fully understood. With the attacks on the Twin Towers, the U.S invaded Afghanistan, unleashing a war that has claimed thousands of civilian lives, in which much of the western world is involved to a greater or lesser degree. It did not make the world a safer place as promised but only made people everywhere more vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Al-Qaeda's alleged spread into Saddam Hussein's Iraq was one of the reasons cited by the Bush administration for the 2003 invasion of that country. With an ideology that offered nothing but a pledge to destroy the U.S. and the “enemies of Islam” everywhere, bin Laden and his network of jihadists exploited a welter of real and perceived grievances of populations in the Islamic world, both against their own governments and the outside world, especially the U.S. In the al-Qaeda solution, there was no room for negotiations, bargains, or compromises with the “enemy.” The true path was that of violence, which created a self-fulfilling prophesy of a “clash of civilisations” by drawing the U.S. and other western powers into an ever-spiralling war against “terror” — a war al-Qaeda and its ally, the Taliban, and other groups linked to them by their radical ideologies were able to project as a war against Islam, strengthening bin Laden's hands with every passing day. The U.S. had been pursuing him even before 9/11, in fact from as far back as 1992. After his escape from the fierce assault on his hideout in Afghanistan's Tora Bora caves, he was suspected to be hiding in Pakistan. His killing on the night of May 1, in a targeted operation by U.S. Navy Seals at his hideout 150 km from the Pakistan capital city Islamabad, is a landmark development in the “war against terror.”
Beyond relief, what implications does this development hold for the world? When President Barack Obama announced the death of bin Laden in an address from the White House, he was correct in cautioning that this did not mean the end of al-Qaeda. Over the decade since 9/11, the network has expanded, spread, morphed, and broken off into what have come to be known as “al Qaeda franchises” round the world. These franchises have shown their ability to plan and carry out attacks in their area of operation independently of bin Laden. Only last year, a plot to carry out a bombing in the United States with explosives packed in couriered parcels was uncovered in the nick of time; the plot was claimed by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AIQM). Last month al-Qaeda warned it would unleash “a nuclear hell storm” in Europe, giving rise to fears that it might have a nuclear bomb. There is a real possibility that the killing of bin Laden will turn him into a martyr, inspiring others to take up the battle. Certainly, countries around the world are bracing for reprisal attacks. Much, however, depends on how Washington conducts itself from this point onwards. For starters, President Obama needs to rethink the war in Afghanistan. If the ultimate objective is to talk to “moderate” Taliban in order to negotiate an end to this war, there is no justification for further military operations in that country, and no excuse for delaying the departure of the U.S. and other foreign troops.
Pakistan certainly has some soul-searching to do. Its political leaders and officials always rejected suspicions that the al-Qaeda leader was holed up in their country. It is deeply troubling that the 54-year-old bin Laden, for whom the U.S. had announced a bounty of $50 million, had made a home not in some remote inaccessible corner of Pakistan, but in one of its most pleasant cities, close to the capital, in a house that was so big it could not have escaped notice. That it was located less than a kilometre from the Kakul Military Academy is even more troubling. Is it believable that Pakistan's intelligence agencies did not know about the presence of the world's most wanted terrorist? Did they ignore what was going on under their noses? Or worse, were they involved in maintaining the safe haven? During his 2008 election campaign, President Obama pledged that if there was “actionable intelligence” about bin Laden in Pakistan, he would authorise action with or without Islamabad's help. In his speech, he was careful to highlight Pakistan's counter-terrorism cooperation. But this daring operation, eight months in the planning, had no Pakistanis on board. In the last few months, relations between the two countries have deteriorated over the CIA's covert operations inside the country.
While much blame can be apportioned to the way the U.S. has conducted itself in the region, for Pakistan the killing of bin Laden on its soil is a moment of truth, somewhat similar to the discovery that the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks were launched from its territory, only much bigger in its implications. In India, which has tried to overcome the public's hostility towards Pakistan over the Mumbai attacks through a series of peace moves under the personal initiative of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, it will certainly be hoped that the death of bin Laden strengthens the hands of those forces in Pakistan who want their state to shut the door on militancy, extremism, and terrorism once and for all. While it may be tempting to see bin Laden's killing at Abbottabad as confirmation of India's worst fears, New Delhi must resist the temptation to crow, and must push ahead with the peace process with the civilian government of Pakistan.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/what-the-end-of-bin-laden-means/article1986060.ece
2,5,2011,Widen the investigation,"Given the central government's conspicuous lack of enthusiasm to act against those responsible for the string of financial irregularities related to the Commonwealth Games 2010, the arrest of Suresh Kalmadi is certainly a step forward. The former Chairman of the Organising Committee — who has been arrested on corruption charges in a case relating to a contract for Timing, Scoring and Result (TSR) devices awarded to a Swiss firm at a scandalously high rate — has a lot to answer for. The Central Bureau of Investigation is investigating his role in another case relating to the Queen's Baton Relay, a traditional precursor to the Commonwealth Games (CWG) that was launched in London in October 2009. But there is no ignoring the fact that many of the scandals in CWG 2010 were the result of either the commission or omission of authorities belonging to a clutch of government bodies, which include the Union Sports Ministry, the Delhi government, and the Delhi Development Authority. The V.K. Shunglu Committee, which was set up to probe “the weaknesses in management, alleged misappropriation, irregularities, wasteful expenditure and wrongdoing in the conduct of the Games,” stresses in its report that the extravagance of the Organising Committee of the Games was coupled with a reckless lack of budgetary control on the part of government authorities. The report records the “galactic jump” of the original budget estimate — placed at somewhere between Rs.300 crore and Rs.400 crore — to an actual expenditure of over Rs.28,000 crore, of which Rs.16,560 crore was spent by the Delhi government.
The Shunglu Committee report implies that there were bigger fish than Mr. Kalmadi in the sea of corrupt CWG-related deals and projects. The CBI must keep the findings of the report in mind while broadening its investigation. The fortunes of Mr. Kalmadi, a Lok Sabha MP and former Union Minister, dipped rapidly after the conclusion of the Commonwealth Games. He was dismissed as the chief of the Organising Committee of the CWG, forced to resign as Secretary of the Congress Parliamentary Party and, following his arrest, suspended from the party's primary membership. Now Mr. Kalmadi is fighting to hold on to the position of the President of the Indian Olympic Association, his role having been taken over by the body's senior vice-president as a result of the former's “indisposition.” Rather than allow him unbridled power as chief of the Organising Committee, a firm check should have been put on Mr. Kalmadi once the first suspicions about financial irregularities emerged. The chaos today is a result of the failure of the central government and the Congress to act against him when they should have.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/widen-the-investigation/article1983678.ece
2,5,2011,What ails public health research?,"Why has the incidence of tuberculosis in India remained around 170 per 100,000 people for the last 20 years despite DOTS, the directly observed treatment strategy, being in place? Answer: DOTS is a passive system that kicks in only after a person takes the initiative and gets tested for the disease. Despite the high prevalence and mortality rate, researchers are yet to figure out a system that works proactively, identifying all people with active TB and treating them. The compulsion to identify and treat people with active pulmonary TB as early as possible arises from the fact these patients stop infecting others only at the end of two months of treatment. The reason for the overall failure to identify an efficient and effective system for tracking down people with tuberculosis boils down to a grievous lack of public health research originating from India. India has the greatest total disease burden in the world, and is plagued by both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Yet the total number of research reports and journal papers on public health is small. This, despite the fact that public health research plays a pivotal role in understanding disease distribution in the population and reducing the burden through effective intervention strategies.
A paper recently published online in The Lancet (“Research to achieve health care for all in India,” by Lalit Dandona et al.) reported that though the proportion of health papers published from India increased from 0.4 per cent of the global total in 1988 to 1.8 per cent in 2008, the papers on public health constituted a measly 5 per cent of the total health research papers published. While there has rightly been increasing representation of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in recent times, many of the leading causes of the disease burden such as lower respiratory infections and mental illness continue to be under-represented. The skew in the focus of health research reflects funding priorities. For instance, HIV/AIDS is better covered than chronic diseases and injuries that have much greater weightage in India's disease burden. Of what use are public health programmes and policies if the evaluation research to understand their effectiveness and deficiencies is weak? It is time these shortcomings were addressed by the national health policy, which promises to strengthen public health research. Increasing funding for evaluation research in addition to research on high burden diseases and the health system must be taken up as a life-saving priority. Now is the time for the government to put its money and political will where its mouth is.

10,5,2011,Speeding up government,"The Electronic Service Delivery Bill, 2011, which aims at delivering all public services to citizens in the electronic mode, is a welcome piece of legislation. By eliminating paperwork on a massive scale, the new measure can cut the red tape and corruption that notoriously plague governance in the country. The draft Bill published by the Ministry of Information Technology at its website is similar to the Right to Information Act, 2005 in that it incorporates a complaints mechanism and prescribes penalties for failure to comply with the provisions. Importantly, it sets a five-year deadline for all public services to make the online transition, with a further concession of three years in some cases. What people can expect in the new dispensation is electronic submission of forms and applications, issue or grant of any licence, permit, certificate, sanction or approval, and receipt or payment of money. No time must be lost in enacting the law, given India's poor record of delivery of citizen services. Moreover, services now facing severe bottlenecks, such as passports, should be prioritised for electronic processing. The draft provisions make it incumbent on the central and State governments to publish a list within six months of the date of enactment, and they would do well to pick the worst-performing departments for inclusion first.
India badly needs a major initiative on electronic service delivery and e-governance. That it has done little to use Information and Communications Technology to help citizens is evident from its 119th rank among 192 countries in the United Nations E-Government Development Index 2010. Although there is no standardised measure of e-governance, the indicators used by the U.N. — online service availability, telecom infrastructure, and human capital — suggest that India is below the world average for the composite index. This underscores the need to get the electronic service delivery law in place urgently and to enforce it seriously. The experience with the RTI Act indicates that public support for modernisation will overwhelm any resistance from vested interests. What must be noted, however, is the continued failure of many government departments to disclose information pro-actively on the Internet, as laid down under the RTI Act. Successful e-government requires that citizens get maximum information, and are able to conduct online transactions and participate in decision-making. All this calls for wide access to online services in the form of kiosks and special centres. Rising India must make progress on each of these metrics, if it hopes to leave its colonial baggage of red tape behind.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/speeding-up-government/article2004253.ece
10,5,2011,Threat from chronic diseases,"Cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, and chronic respiratory diseases account for 63 per cent (36 million) of all deaths globally. This is the finding of the World Health Organisation's global status report on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) for 2008, and the situation is unlikely to be very different today. The picture also runs counter to the general perception that such deaths are largely restricted to developed countries. In truth, nearly 80 per cent of deaths from NCDs occur in low- and middle-income countries (if Africa is kept out of the picture). Of the four chronic diseases, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are responsible for 80 per cent of all deaths. High blood pressure turns out to be the biggest risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. It caused an estimated 7.5 million deaths round the world. In India, according to estimates by the Public Health Foundation of India, about two million people die every year from cardiovascular diseases caused directly by high blood pressure. The rate of prevalence of high blood pressure is 24-30 per cent in urban areas and 12-14 per cent in rural areas. But the percentage of people aware of their condition is only 30 per cent in cities/towns and 10-12 per cent in villages. Shockingly, just about 10-12 per cent of those who have high blood pressure in urban areas and a mere 4-5 per cent in rural areas have it adequately controlled for their risks.
The New England Journal of Medicine reported last year that India would lose $237 billion over the next decade owing to non-communicable diseases. Prevention and control of these diseases is achievable, provided the government uses a little imagination to implement some effective low-cost population-wide interventions. Finland reduced the cardiovascular diseases mortality rate by 75 per cent, and Japan achieved a 70 per cent drop in strokes by mandating a reduction in salt content of packaged foods. Many countries have introduced chilling pictorial warnings on cigarette packets and are rotating them annually in keeping with WHO guidelines. But India has taken a retrograde step. Three years after introducing pictorial warnings in India, the warnings continue to be as ineffective as ever. The government recently decided to rotate the pictorial warnings every two years and allow the manufacturers to have the final say in the choice of pictures! As every physician knows, physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and unhealthy diets figure high in the list of causative factors for NCDs. If individuals can be faulted for not adopting healthier lifestyles, the failure of the government to spread awareness is inexcusable.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/threat-from-chronic-diseases/article2004254.ece
11,5,2011,An incomplete answer,"Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani’s statement in the National Assembly in response to the burning questions about Osama bin Laden’s life and death on Pakistani territory was a useful history refresher on the first Afghan war and the role of the United States, particularly the Central Intelligence Agency, in the creation of an army of mujahideen to take on the Soviet forces in Afghanistan. The man who later became the leader of al-Qaeda was undeniably a product of this jihad. As Mr. Gilani noted, there is little about it that is not documented. Even Hollywood has done its bit. But as a reply to why bin Laden was discovered living in relative comfort in the heart of Pakistan, not by the country’s own military or intelligence agencies but by the U.S., Prime Minister Gilani’s account falls far short of an adequate explanation. His characterisation of this failure as that of “all the intelligence agencies in the world” comes across more as an attempt to deflect blame than as a response born out of honest introspection by the Pakistan state. Even as a history lesson, Mr. Gilani’s statement was incomplete. No one pushed Pakistan into the first Afghan war; Pakistan’s military under General Zia ul Haq made a calculated choice to participate in it. Aside from the U.S. support, Saudi Arabia generously poured money into Pakistan to create a culture of jihad. After the war, the same military and its intelligence agencies decided to deploy some of those jihadists to establish a pro-Pakistan regime in Afghanistan, while others were despatched for the task of ‘liberating’ Kashmir from India. No Pakistan army chief has ever made an attempt to institutionally repudiate the Zia legacy. No civilian government has dared to do it. By the time of 9/11, the poison of jihad had gone so deep into Pakistan that any effort to purge it was bound to take generations of cleansing. Whichever way you slice this cake, Pakistan’s paramount institution, its military, cannot escape the blame for l’affaire OBL, notwithstanding Mr. Gilani’s clean chit to it and the Inter-Services Intelligence.
Prime Minister Gilani announced in parliament that an “investigation has been ordered” into the entire episode. He did not specify any terms of reference or a time frame for this. But The Guardian has provided the interesting lead that in 2001, the Bush administration struck a deal with General Pervez Musharraf, then the military ruler of Pakistan, that permitted a unilateral U.S. operation against bin Laden on Pakistani soil. The agreement is said to have been renewed in 2008, when the present Army chief, General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani, was in charge. While the full truth about how OBL managed to hide in Abbottabad may never come out, it is time for the Pakistan military to face up to some truths about itself — and about its role in bringing the country to its present state.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-incomplete-answer/article2006873.ece
11,5,2011,Empowering Asia's women,"Asia may be leading the world in terms of economic recovery from the recent global crisis, but in one critical area it remains a laggard: employment of women. A recent publication by the International Labour Organisation and the Asian Development Bank, “Women and Labour Markets in Asia: Rebalancing for gender equality,” makes out a strong case for effective policy interventions in this important segment of the labour market for two main reasons — the untapped economic potential and the effect on meeting the region's development goals. The finding that the Asia and Pacific region loses up to $47 billion annually because of the limited access given to women for employment and another $16-30 billion as a result of gender gaps in education drives home the magnitude of the social opportunities lost.
But it is not merely the missed growth in incomes that matters. Deeper still lie stubborn differentials that persist between the genders in various attributes of employment — the type of jobs and the regularity of incomes, for instance — reducing women to serve as the “buffer workforce.” South Asia is home to the highest percentage of women in vulnerable employment: 84.5 per cent in 2009, compared with the global average of 52.9 per cent. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the high and rising informalisation of the workforce. The strong link between informal employment and poverty calls for urgent policy interventions to break the vicious cycle. Of the interventions suggested by the ILO and the ADB, two are crucial: better-designed public employment programmes that factor in gender sensitivity and a mechanism to provide for social security. The immediate and long-term effects of these two measures will be highly beneficial. For example, the study provides persuasive evidence that India's Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme has been successful in bringing in unskilled women agricultural workers to this public works programme as private wages for women are lower in the farm sector. Such public works-based solutions, howsoever effective they may be, can only be interim measures. In the long term what matters are coordinated policies that mainstream gender issues in employment. Rising India has everything to gain — economically, socially, and morally — by quickly initiating a process that will empower the women in the workforce.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/empowering-asias-women/article2006875.ece
12,5,2011,Mayawati lands in trouble,"Land acquisition for development entails striking a tough balance between accommodating the galloping demands of urbanisation and assuaging the often acute sense of deprivation that loss of land engenders. Land acquisition has tended to be particularly problematic in States with large tracts of fertile agricultural land — as in the case of Uttar Pradesh where the abundantly yielding Yamuna-Ganga plains have repeatedly erupted in protest. In the vortex of the current storm are two ambitious projects of Chief Minister Mayawati. When completed, the 1,047 km long, access-controlled, eight-lane Ganga Expressway will connect Noida in the National Capital Region with Ballia in the eastern end of U.P. On the other hand, the 165-km, six-lane, Yamuna Expressway between Greater Noida and Agra is a re-incarnation of the Taj Expressway originally conceived as an adjunct to the infamous Taj corridor project. Both projects require the acquisition of tens of thousands of hectares of fertile land along the meandering courses of the two mighty rivers. No government can embark on construction on this gargantuan scale without expecting to encounter opposition. Fair and just compensation is one aspect of the problem. There are also serious environmental concerns arising from the threatened degradation of the ecology of river basins.
The injection of politics compounds issues around land acquisition. The Congress, the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Samajwadi Party, and the Rashtriya Lok Dal have ganged up against the U.P. Chief Minister with a political opportunism that is impossible to miss. Not surprisingly, truth has become the biggest casualty in the war of words between the State government and the opposition. The Mayawati government's case is that acquisition is not an issue at all and that compensation amounting to Rs.300 crore for 450 hectares of land has already been paid and accepted. The all-in opposition insists that land has been forcibly acquired from unwilling farmers. The agitating farmers seem not so much against acquisition as they are against inadequate sums paid as compensation; they point, for example, to the exceptionally high prices at which the acquired land has been sold to builders and developers. That there is a government-builder nexus profiting from such sales has been proven over and over. With just a year left for the Assembly election, the opposition obviously wants to trip up Chief Minister Mayawati on the farmers' issue, denting her image as a champion of social justice. The Chief Minister, who dramatically seized power four years ago, has her job cut out.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mayawati-lands-in-trouble/article2009624.ece
12,5,2011,A problematic verdict is stayed,"The Supreme Court of India's decision to stay the majority judgment of the Allahabad High Court in the Ayodhya dispute will be welcomed widely. The High Court verdict discomfited not just jurists and constitutional experts but also a broad swath of citizenry who had reason to question the prioritisation of faith over fact. Indeed, the Supreme Court has described the September 2010 judgment as “strange” — a term that will resonate widely, given the extra-legal liberties seen to have been taken by the High Court judges. Broadly, there are two problematical aspects to the Ayodhya judgment. First, the three-way division of property among the Hindu litigants, the Sunni Central Wakf Board, and the Nirmohi Akhara. And, more troublingly, the use of faith as a legitimate argument for awarding the space under the central dome of the Babri Masjid (where the idols of Ram Lalla are placed) to the Hindu plaintiffs. As Justice R.M. Lodha tellingly observed: “A new dimension has been given by the High Court as the decree of partition was not sought by the parties. It [the judgment] has to be stayed.”
It was admittedly a difficult judgment to pronounce for High Court judges S.U. Khan, Sudhir Agarwal, and D.V. Sharma. They had to decide the title suit in a volatile case with an antiquity dating back to 1885 and marked by do-or-die conflicts between two highly emotive religious groups. The three judges gave separate judgments, with Justice Sharma entirely upholding the Hindu claim and the other two striving to be more even-handed. The partition ordered by Mr. Khan and Mr. Agarwal appears to have stemmed from a desire to avoid communal ill-feelings and tensions should the award be seen as one-sided — and indeed the judgment seemed to have a fortuitous calming effect. Unfortunately, the two judges achieved the balance not by resort to reason and constitutional law but by placing “faith” and “belief” over and above the constitutional principle. This ignored the overtly political, and at times the incendiary, nature of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. The 1949 placement of idols of Ram Lalla under the central dome and the 1992 demolition of the Babri structure were both diabolical political acts. The majority judgment accepted that the idols had been placed by human hands. Nonetheless, Justice Agarwal held this fact to be of no material significance, ruling that Lord Ram's birthplace was itself a deity with all juridical rights. To be fair, the judge did take note of the “abominable manner” of the 1992 demolition. Yet in an unbeatable irony, he delivered a judgment that had the effect of legitimising the cataclysmic climax.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-problematic-verdict-is-stayed/article2009625.ece
13,5,2011,Will finance get the message?,"The conviction of Raj Rajaratnam, a billionaire financier and founder of the Galleon Group, one of the world's largest hedge fund management firms, by a New York federal court jury on five counts of securities fraud and nine of conspiracy to commit fraud between 2003 and 2009 sends a clear message to the financial markets. It is that they are not above the law and that white-collar crime is still crime. The New York jury, which deliberated for 12 days, rejected Mr. Rajaratnam's defence that the detailed “mosaic” of information given him by high-level contacts within companies amounted to a legitimate strategy. Mr. Rajaratnam faces a minimum of 15 years and a half in prison; he will appeal, but under a $100 million bail arrangement he is electronically tagged and remains under house arrest until his sentencing on July 29. Out of 47 people charged with insider trading in the last 18 months, he is the 35th to be convicted. In Galleon-related cases, 21 out of 26 defendants have pleaded guilty, including Danielle Chiesi, formerly of Bear Stearns, Intel's ex-staffer Rajiv Goel, and IBM's former executive Robert Moffat. The question is whether prosecutors will now go after other big fish who went to the edge of the law in dealing with Mr. Rajaratnam.
As for insider trading, it is significant that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has used anti-mafia techniques like wiretaps to good effect. Corporate lawyers may be right that the biggest successful Wall Street prosecution since the Milken and Boesky scandals of the 1980s will have a “chilling” effect on the way financial trading is done but that by itself will not address the wider issues. The fact that many of those convicted were, at the time of their crimes, working in some of the world's most powerful financial companies will only serve to deepen public distrust of the financial sector. Suspicion is already widespread as a result of the 2007-08 global crash and the failure of the massive state-funded bank bailouts to deliver the promised economic revival. Furthermore, criminal investigation, by its very nature, takes place ex post facto, and its deterrent effects are uncertain, depending on the perceptions of risk under the circumstances. That, together with the complexity of the financial sector, means that the moral effects of high-profile convictions may fade under the relentless pressure to make big bucks quickly. Criminal prosecutions in this area cannot replace well-designed and resolutely implemented regulatory legislation. That, however, will require political will of a kind few countries seem to have in the current climate, however much the public supports such action.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/will-finance-get-the-message/article2012926.ece
13,5,2011,The Bhopal buck stops here,"The Supreme Court's decision to reject as “wrong and fallacious” the curative plea filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation in the Bhopal case has led to a lot of unnecessary hand-wringing by NGOs and activists. The government sought to enhance the culpability of those responsible for the December 1984 gas disaster from mere “criminal negligence” — for which they were convicted last year — to “culpable homicide not amounting to murder.” In dismissing the government's petition, the Supreme Court concluded that its 1996 verdict, which threw out the culpable homicide accusation, was the product of evidence presented at the time charges were framed. But it also told the CBI that if there were additional facts to conclude that a more serious offence had been committed, nothing would stand in the way of the sessions court framing graver charges. Should the sessions judge have reservations, especially given the passage of time, the Supreme Court has indicated that its 1996 verdict would not be a “fetter” against delivering justice to the victims of the calamitous gas leak. If the Chief Judicial Magistrate misread its earlier judgment as constraining, the revisional court “can certainly correct” that error, the highest court in the land has noted.
The CBI's inability to credibly explain why it moved the Supreme Court so many years after 1996 – or after 2002, when the instrumentality of curative petitions was created – hides an open secret that continues to shock all partisans of justice round the world. The truth is that successive administrations at the Centre, whether headed by the Congress, the Bharatiya Janata Party or the United Front, have not been interested in the guilty being punished. Equally damningly, they have cared little about justice being done to the victims. Once again, the ball is back in the government's hands. It is too early to say whether the beginning of the end to a long wait for justice has been set in motion for the victims of the Bhopal tragedy through the Supreme Court's verdict. All eyes will now be on the CBI: will it push for enhanced charges at the sessions court now that the legal picture has become clearer? It is up to the Madhya Pradesh and central governments to ensure that this matter is argued expeditiously and that any appeals which follow are fast-tracked. Later this summer, the petition seeking enhancement of compensation for the victims will be heard. Although the Supreme Court cannot easily conjure up a remedy for the manifest failure of the executive to protect the rights of the gas victims, it needs to remain engaged with the case until justice is finally delivered.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-bhopal-buck-stops-here/article2012929.ece
14,5,2011,Decidedly mixed results,"No one explanatory framework could have held together the 2011 Assembly elections in four States and one Union Territory. The issues were different, as were the personalities, in West Bengal and Assam in the east of the country, and Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the Union Territory of Puducherry in the south. For West Bengal, this was a watershed election, marking the end of the 34-year-rule of the Left Front headed by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). A government led by Trinamool Congress, with the mercurial Mamata Banerjee as Chief Minister, will be of a very different persuasion from the ones headed by Jyoti Basu and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Having drawn on the support of sections and classes with conflicting interests, Ms Banerjee could steer the State in new, even if unpredictable, directions. In Tamil Nadu, the return to power of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, with the charismatic Ms Jayalalithaa at the helm, holds long-term import for the socio-economic development and governance of the State. As for Kerala, the 2011 contest will be best remembered for the performance of the loser, not for the victory of the Congress-led United Democratic Front. In a State known for bringing about a regime change every five years, the CPI (M)-led Left Democratic Front, riding a late surge created by the campaign of the octogenarian Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan, almost nullified the anti-incumbency sentiment to make this the closest election since 1965, when the contest produced a hung Assembly. Assam gave the Congress and Tarun Gogoi a hat-trick of wins, something of a rarity in recent years. In Puducherry, the Congress lost to its breakaway group, the N.R. Congress led by former Congress Chief Minister N. Rangaswamy, which had fought the election in the company of the AIADMK.
In Andhra Pradesh, another breakaway group of the Congress, the YSR Congress formed by Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, has jolted the ruling party by the enormous margins of its victory in the by-elections to the Kadapa Lok Sabha and Pulivendula Assembly constituencies. The rise of the YSR Congress threatens to destabilise the demoralised Congress regime in South India's largest State, as many YSR loyalists might see political advantage in switching sides early. The overall consequences of the April-May 2011 elections are hard to predict. While the Congress can take some comfort from its victories in Assam, West Bengal, and Kerala, it will have to deal with increased pressures and changing equations within the United Progressive Alliance. While managing relations with a strengthened TMC will be a challenge, its alliance with the DMK is likely to face an existential crisis sooner than later, given the comprehensiveness of the Tamil Nadu rout and the increasing heat of the 2-G corruption cases.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/decidedly-mixed-results/article2016304.ece
14,5,2011,Just desserts in Tamil Nadu,"Power corrupts. That may be broadly true but it does not follow in the least that corruption can be the basis and guarantor of power. That is the main message from the Tamil Nadu Assembly election of 2011. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam badly underestimated the political sagacity of the electorate and sought once again to buy up its loyalty. Defying predictions of a close contest, the voters turned out in unprecedented numbers in town and country and vented their accumulated anger against unrestrained corruption, against what was perceived as the inexorable movement towards one-family rule through the appropriation of the State's wealth, power, and resources by various members of the ruling family, against the failure of the government to manage a major power crisis and contain the price spiral, and against flagrant contempt for the rule of law. Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi seems to have laboured under the belief that his regime's welfare schemes and wide social safety net were enough to offset the negative perceptions about these issues. Its positive record in delivering welfare and health services and implementing infrastructure projects was besmirched by its incompetence in dealing with the State's electricity shortage. Incidents such as the tragic killing of three employees of a Tamil newspaper in Madurai as a result of a feud within the DMK leader's family, and the virtual immunity that accompanied the crime, contributed in no small measure to the perception that the rule of law was undermined by political interference and that power flowed from extra-constitutional sources.
But that is only one part of the story. The alliance with a faction-ridden and demoralised Congress, which fought above its weight and has been reduced to a single digit presence in the Tamil Nadu Assembly, proved to be a fatal weakness for the DMK. Voters realised during the campaign that the 2G spectrum allocation scam was a co-production, where the venality of the DMK actors — who had planned, executed, and benefitted from India's biggest corruption scandal – was enabled by the amoral attitude and actions of the Congress leadership of the central government. Alliance arithmetic has always been a factor in Tamil Nadu elections. Ms Jayalalithaa — a strong leader who returns to power for a third substantive term as Chief Minister backed by a four-fifths majority in the Legislative Assembly — got the alliance arithmetic absolutely right. But this election was essentially not about arithmetic. It was a powerful rejection of a regime that, unable to distinguish right from wrong, went down in an akratic haze.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/just-desserts-in-tamil-nadu/article2016306.ece
15,5,2011,For a politics of consensus,"A bare legislative majority based on an expedient coalition of parties can hardly be the basis for a new government undertaking any radical restructuring of a State's political economy. In the 2011 Assembly election, Kerala voters clearly wanted an improvement in the creation of infrastructure and in the delivery of services — but not a complete change of course after five years under the government of the Left Democratic Front headed by the Communist Party of India(Marxist). The Congress-led United Democratic Front needs to try and build on the achievements of the outgoing V.S. Achuthanandan government, bridging the shortfalls in social welfare measures and hastening the completion of development projects. The UDF owed its narrow 72-68 victory in the 140-seat Assembly to the strong showing of the Muslim League, which won 20 seats, and the Kerala Congress (M), a party seeking to represent Christians, which took nine seats. The consolidation of Muslim and Christian votes, and the consequent pressures these two sectional parties could bring to bear on the Congress, are likely to pose difficulties in governance for the UDF. Like the CPI(M) in Kerala, the State Congress is faction-ridden. This UDF dispensation will, of necessity, be a balancing act, accommodating the demands of competing sections and, to an extent, conflicting interests. The danger is that in such circumstances political survival can become an end in itself.
The long-term challenge in Kerala — way and ahead India's socially most advanced State, the one State where programmes of mass employment can draw on the talents of an educated and skilled workforce — is to develop the material forces of production. This means diversifying and bringing value addition to agriculture, discovering new sources for knowledge-based, high-tech, and sustainable industrialisation, and creating suitable employment opportunities. In the social sector, the immediate need is to restore the State's famous universal Public Distribution System — which succeeded in raising the nutritional status of a whole generation but has been unfortunately replaced by a targeted system — and to find the resources to finance this re-universalisation. Building a system of universal health care will be another challenge. The UDF would do well to be modest in victory, and reach out to an opposition that is strong, active, and in good spirit as a result of the remarkable late surge created by Chief Minister Achuthanandan's anti-corruption campaign. In keeping with the character of its mandate, the UDF government must strive for a political consensus on how to move Kerala on to a higher growth trajectory while retaining and strengthening its advanced social sector.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/for-a-politics-of-consensus/article2021656.ece
15,5,2011,A shockingly unethical trial,"The question whether all human clinical trials undertaken in India are conducted ethically has been answered. The final report of the three-member committee appointed by the central government to go into the alleged irregularities in the conduct of the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine trial reveals gross ethical violations. The trial, suspended since March 2010, was carried out by the Program for Appropriate Technology and Health (PATH), an NGO, in collaboration with the Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat governments and the Indian Council of Medical Research. It was conducted on nearly 23,500 girls in the 10-14 years age group in Khammam district (Andhra Pradesh) and Vadodra (Gujarat). The “casual approach,” which saw the informed consent forms, the most sacrosanct trial documents, being filled “very carelessly” with “incomplete and probably inaccurate” information is shocking. In Andhra Pradesh, nearly 2,800 consent forms were signed by a hostel warden or headmaster, as the ‘guardian'. The justification: the parents were not easily reachable! That being the case, and since it was a research study and not an emergency, should such children have been enrolled at all? What ethical justification can there be for the warden or headmaster acting as a “legally acceptable representative” to meet the requirements of the 1945 Schedule Y of Drugs and Cosmetics Rules? Since students have “reduced autonomy,” the fact that teachers played a “primary role” in explaining and “obtaining consent” meant that the consent was obtained under duress, in a legally untenable way.
The trial came under scrutiny following a public outcry over the death of seven children. Although the cause of the deaths was found to be unrelated to vaccination, the incident revealed a total failure of the mechanism to monitor the ‘volunteers' for both serious and non-serious adverse events following vaccination. There was a five-month delay in reporting a death, while two deaths in Khammam district went unreported. Ironically, while measuring and reporting the adverse events after vaccination were the “primary end points of the study,” the Principal and Co-Principal investigators failed to report all such events to the sponsor within a day, as required under the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules. That widespread transgressions of prescribed procedures and norms have been detected in conducting the trial, despite the apex medical body being a part of it, and that the investigating committee has done little by way of fixing responsibility, sends out a highly damaging message.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-shockingly-unethical-trial/article2021657.ece
16,5,2011,Big Brother rules,"Whatever the intention behind them, the new rules framed last month under the Information Technology Act, 2000 are likely to have a chilling effect on the development of the Internet as a medium of communication and information in India. Apart from the unreasonable restrictions on free speech they envisage, the rules raise serious concerns about the privacy of a citizen's personal information, including medical profile, financial position, and sexual orientation. The problem lies with three sets of rules that create guidelines on “intermediaries” and cyber cafes and on the manner in which “sensitive personal data or information” can be shared, especially with government agencies. Intermediaries, defined as those who store, transmit, or provide services related to electronic messages, will henceforth be obligated to block content or information that “threatens the unity, integrity, defence, security or sovereignty of India, friendly relations with foreign states, or public order or causes incitement to the commission of any cognisable offence or prevents investigation of any offence…” This description is so vague and open-ended that it is likely to lead Internet Service Providers, webmasters, and others to play it safe and shut off access to views and opinions that they consider controversial. The rules specify a mechanism for appeal but the permissible time frame of one month is far too long to offer any meaningful redressal of grievances.
The rules on privacy represent an advance in one respect: they prohibit companies with whom an individual has shared her or his sensitive personal information from disclosing it to any third party without prior permission from that individual. But an exception is made for government agencies; they will be entitled to access that information without a court warrant simply on the basis of a written request that states that the information is required for the investigation of a crime. Although these agencies are, in turn, obligated not to share that information with anyone else, this ‘safeguard' is of little value to citizens who value their privacy vis-à-vis the state. The fact that officially sanctioned telephone intercepts have made their way into the public domain points to the danger of giving officials access to personal information. Nor is it clear how crime can be fought by police officers gathering details about a potential suspect's “physical, physiological and mental health condition; sexual orientation; and medical records and history,” as the rules partially define “sensitive personal data or information.” Such rules have no place on the statute book of a democracy that values the rights of its citizens. Parliament should insist that the government take another look.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/big-brother-rules/article2024018.ece
16,5,2011,A dark day for Europe,"France and Italy are revealing the contradictions in the attitudes of European Union countries towards the popular rebellions in North Africa. In the latest episode, 61 out of 72 mainly Libyan citizens who fled Tripoli died of hunger and thirst after 16 days adrift in one of busiest areas of the Mediterranean. According to credible reports, a military helicopter dropped water and biscuits, presumably in response to a phone call they made to Eritrean priest Moses Zerai's refugee-rights NGO in Rome; and the helicopter crew gestured to the passengers to hold their position and await help — which never came. The survivors say that at one point they were very close to a French aircraft carrier, from which two jets flew low over the boat; the refugees held babies overhead for the pilots to see but were ignored. International maritime law requires all vessels to answer distress calls and offer help. With phones dead and without food or fuel, the survivors drifted back to Libya, where they were arrested and then released. This is one of many such incidents; the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Italy cites those who reached Italian territory as saying they watched ships sinking in front of them.
In the last month alone, some 800 people fleeing the region have perished, but the two national leaders involved are showing limitless cynicism and political self-interest. President Nicolas Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) has taken a drubbing from the left in the recent cantonal elections; Mr. Sarkozy's own ratings are at a dismal 21 per cent, and his hawkish advocacy of the U.N.-Nato intervention in Libya was widely criticised for being a re-election gambit. Italy's President Silvio Berlusconi, who faces sex-related criminal charges, was equally hawkish; but his complaints about taking 25,000 refugees are histrionic gestures in comparison with the actions of Sweden, which took 80,000 Iraqis, and Germany, which in the 1990s took 400,000 Bosnians. Sweden's population is nine million and Italy's is 60 million. The EU itself, however, has longstanding repatriation deals with despots and dictators in North Africa and West Asia; now some of its major members are trying to evade the consequences of pro-democracy uprisings they themselves have aided. The entirely separate Council of Europe, which predates the EU and is the custodian of the European Convention on Human Rights, is right in calling the abandonment of Libya's boat people a “dark day” for its own continent.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-dark-day-for-europe/article2024017.ece
17,5,2011,Bhardwaj has to go,"Unabashedly partisan in his motives and actions, Karnataka Governor H.R. Bhardwaj has been, for a long time now, a disgrace to the constitutional office he holds. At every available opportunity, he has been abusing the authority of his office to unseat the Bharatiya Janata Party government of B.S. Yeddyurappa. However, by recommending the imposition of President's Rule in Karnataka, using as a pretext the order of the Supreme Court setting aside the disqualification of 11 BJP rebel Members of the Legislative Assembly, he has taken the office of Governor to a new low. When Chief Minister Yeddyurappa was ready for another confidence vote, and the rebel MLAs had already taken back their letter withdrawing support to the government, the situation certainly did not warrant Mr. Bhardwaj sending a report to the Centre recommending President's Rule. That Mr. Bhardwaj did so after meeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and other leaders in New Delhi raises the question whether he was acting at the behest of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre. The S.R. Bommai vs Union of India judgment delivered by the Supreme Court in March 1994 clearly states that “in all cases where the support of the Ministry is claimed to have been withdrawn by some legislators, the proper course for testing the strength of the Ministry is holding the test on the floor of the House.” The assessment of the strength of the Ministry, the judgment made it clear, was “not a matter of private opinion of any individual, be he the Governor or the President.” In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling against the disqualification of the BJP MLAs, the Governor had no proper constitutional role to play other than acting in conformity with the Bommai judgment and leaving the matter to be settled in the Assembly.
Mr. Bhardwaj, through his actions, has again brought to the fore the issue of Governors acting as political agents of the Centre in States ruled by opposition parties. Although the Bommai judgment has limited the partisan use of Article 356 of the Constitution impossible, the case of Mr. Bhardwaj highlights the dangers of possible misuse of the powers vested in the office of Governor. Despite their clearly defined constitutional role, Governors, with the backing of the Centre, have from time to time played the super-Chief Minister, threatening the very federal structure of the polity. If this situation is not to continue indefinitely, Mr. Bhardwaj must be made an example of. His continuance in the Raj Bhavan in Bangalore is no longer tenable. Gubernatorial posts are not for trigger-happy political adventurers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bhardwaj-has-to-go/article2026883.ece
17,5,2011,Clinton contradictions,"Within a space of six weeks, the position of the United States on Syria has hardened to the point where Washington's support for military intervention cannot be discounted. In a television interview on March 27, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said it was “unlikely” that the U.S. would attempt to assemble support for an intervention, and contrasted Syria with Libya. What she called the indiscriminate use of the military by the Libyan regime against its own citizens was not the same as the excessive force used by the Syrian police. In contrast, on May 12, during a visit to Greenland, Ms Clinton accused Damascus of “gross human rights abuses” such as killings, torture, arbitrary detention, and the refusal of medical care for the wounded. She added that the U.S. and “other colleagues” would try to put greater pressure on Syria's President Bashar al-Assad so as to render his government “accountable.” Other Obama officials talked of sanctions on more Syrian officials besides the three already targeted, who include Mr. Assad's brother Maher, a military officer with a reputation for brutal crackdowns.
There is no doubting the violence being inflicted on Syrians and this must be condemned. Washington's entire position, however, is riddled with contradictions. To start with, the U.S. has arrogated to itself the right to hold the regime to account; nothing is said about the Syrian government's accountability to Syrians. Secondly, high Syrian officials keep overseas accounts in European and West Asian banks, and U.S. sanctions against them will have little impact. Thirdly, threatening Mr. Assad on account of the violence against protesters ignores major questions of Syrian politics. The Syrian President has struggled to assert himself over powerful factions within his own family, and over the military and internal security agencies. Furthermore, Ms Clinton revealed another agenda by attacking Syria for its good relations with Iran — while Washington and influential sections of the international media avoid the matter of violent repression elsewhere in the region. For example, little is said about Bahrain, where the regime has reacted to protest as viciously as the Syrian authorities have done. Washington's Fifth Fleet is still Bahrain-based. Another topic avoided is the effect of Saudi Arabia's nervousness about Shia Islam and democracy on U.S. West Asia policy. Noam Chomsky has called attention to the truth that Washington and its allies strive to prevent the emergence of democracy in the region. On the evidence, the U.S. support for democracy in West Asia is nothing if not disingenuous.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/clinton-contradictions/article2026881.ece
18,5,2011,Terror and error,"Were it not for our security establishment's love of schadenfreude, the public embarrassment of including in a list of 50 ‘most wanted' terrorists supposedly hiding in Pakistan the name of a man who is very much in India could have been avoided. Despite living in Thane and making regular court appearances, Wazhul Kamar Khan, an accused in the 2003 Mulund train blast, figured as Number 41 in the fugitives list India handed over to Pakistani Interior Ministry officials in March. The Pakistanis took away the list and there the matter might well have ended. But it was the desire to add to Islamabad's discomfiture in the days after U.S. special forces killed Osama bin Laden deep inside Pakistan that led Indian officials to rake up the list and plant a story about it in the media. Their aim, presumably, was to remind the world that Pakistan continues to harbour terrorists of all sorts, a completely unnecessary move given the prevailing international perceptions post-Abbottabad. If anything, the leaking of the list was a petty ‘bilateral' gambit that detracted from the ‘global' dimension of the Pakistani military's dalliance with terrorism. That it also contained a serious error which Pakistan is likely to use to question India's facts is unforgivable.
Truth to tell, the goof-up over Mr. Khan's whereabouts is part of a wider pathology afflicting the Indian system: the lack of professionalism in the conduct of security and foreign policy. When it comes to India's relations with Pakistan, or any country for that matter, the sole window for public pronouncements and even unofficial briefings ought to be the Ministry of External Affairs or the Prime Minister's Office. What we have instead is a free-for-all in which top generals, bureaucrats, and even defence scientists feel free to make statements — or plant stories — that have a crucial bearing on foreign policy. Army chief V.K. Singh and DRDO head V.K. Saraswat have both publicly boasted about India's ability to mount an Abbottabad-type operation. The Pakistani military, under fire at home for the OBL fiasco, latched on to General Singh's statement and used it to stoke nationalist fears about the threat posed by India. Last week, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wisely noted he could not be expected to discuss military matters in front of the media. But it is not clear the message has gone down. As far as the ‘50 most wanted' list is concerned, the error should also serve as a reminder to our intelligence agencies and internal security bureaucracy that their time is best spent getting their house in order rather than hamming it on a diplomatic stage for which they have neither talent nor aptitude.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/terror-and-error/article2029711.ece
18,5,2011,Need for a coherent policy,"True to form, the Government of India has been caught on the back foot over the pricing of petroleum products. Earlier this year, it formally delinked petrol from the administered pricing mechanism while retaining the more sensitive diesel, kerosene, and LPG under its control. The Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) was expected to meet last week to decide on an across-the-board revision of prices. But, for some reason, it let the Oil Marketing Companies to go ahead with the price revision for petrol, while putting off its decision on the rest by another week. The OMCs promptly announced a hike of Rs.5 per litre of petrol — the fourth since June 2010, and the steepest till date. With this increase, petrol price has jumped from around Rs.47 in early 2010 to well above the Rs.63 level in most cities now. Apparently the OMCs wanted to increase the price by Rs.10 per litre but, at the instance of government, decided to limit the rise to Rs.5. Consumers may well be in for another mark up before long.
What has become abundantly clear is that the government has no coherent fuel policy. The steep rise in price notwithstanding, there has been a 12 per cent increase in petrol consumption over the past year. The off-take of diesel also is bound to swell as a consequence of petrol becoming dearer and this, in turn, will push up the subsidy burden of the government. For its part, the automobile industry, which has been recording a consistently high growth in sales over the past 18 months, has changed gear, turning the focus on the production of diesel vehicles. Over a period, the sale of diesel as fuel could rise from the present 30 per cent to 50 per cent. The oil companies incur a revenue loss of Rs.18.19 on a litre of diesel, Rs.29.69 on kerosene, and Rs.329.73 on an LPG cylinder (14.2 kg). They reported a loss of Rs.78,000 crore for 2010-11, which could go up to Rs.180,208 crore this year. The government is supposed to make good the subsidy on these three products, while the oil companies are expected to adjust the price of petrol in keeping with the global crude market trends. In the long run, there has to be a clear policy to promote alternative fuel and electric cars, and also to popularise and promote the use of CNG and LPG in the automobile sector. The explosion in the vehicle population has ensured that, despite the rising prices, the consumption of petrol and diesel has not slowed down. More needs to be done by the Centre and the States to encourage the use of public transport by putting together a convenient and affordable multi-modal transport system in all major towns and cities.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/need-for-a-coherent-policy/article2029709.ece
19,5,2011,Rahul in Blunderland,"Rahul Gandhi's predilection to shoot from the hip is proving to be a challenge for his party managers who have found themselves picking up repeatedly after the First Family heir. Yet in Uttar Pradesh recently, the gaffe-prone Congress general secretary — famously described by an American official as a “neophyte” without the chutzpah to become Prime Minister — outdid himself. The agitation by farmers protesting over land acquisition along the Yamuna Expressway was already into its second week, when Mr. Gandhi grandly entered the scene and appropriated what till then had been a united Opposition show. With television cameras obliging, Mr. Gandhi threw off his security and courted arrest — all of which might have passed off as engaging theatrics had he also not proceeded to make the most incredible charge against the Mayawati government: that there were burnt bodies beneath the mounds of ash found in the twin Greater Noida villages of Bhatta and Parsaul! Although Mr. Gandhi said he had photographic evidence to prove his claim, no villager has come forward to substantiate the story that the administration had killed and burnt farmers in full public view. Unsurprisingly, it was once again left to party managers to find a way out of the mess. The new line, endorsed by Mr. Gandhi himself, is that he was merely repeating a charge made by the villagers.
During the 2007 Assembly election campaign in U.P., Mr. Gandhi claimed that the Babri Masjid would have been saved had his family been in power. But an even bigger blooper was when he spoke of the division of Pakistan as a glowing deed accomplished by his family; while nobody can take away from Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's masterly handling of the constellation of events leading to the creation of Bangladesh, to present it as the division of Pakistan and as a family accomplishment was doubly shocking. Tragically for the farmers of U.P., Mr. Gandhi's egregious brinkmanship has deflected attention from their genuine problems. Ground reports clearly point to excesses by the U.P. government in the two affected villages. Even if it was a fact that the agitation had been infiltrated by anti-social elements, as claimed by the Chief Minister, there was absolutely no justification for the police to act brutally against the villagers. The Mayawati government would do well to realise that farmers cannot be arm-twisted anymore into accepting meagre compensation for fertile agricultural land acquired, among other things, for creating luxury villas and townships. For its part, the central government must realise that it must move quickly to put in place comprehensive Land Acquisition legislation that is fair, just, and primarily protective of the interests of millions of vulnerable farmers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rahul-in-blunderland/article2032541.ece
19,5,2011,International law traduced,"Those members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation who are involved in what is now a war on Libya in all but name are starting to face multiple embarrassments. Militarily, their decision not to send in ground troops requires them to intensify their air attacks far beyond the protection of civilians. For example, the British military are now bombing not only President Muammar Qadhafi's troops and artillery but also buildings and infrastructure, including police stations and government offices. Secondly, the presence on the ground of Nato's so-called special forces has not prevented civilian deaths in aerial bombardment. As the British analyst Simon Jenkins points out in the Guardian, the escalation is reminiscent of the U.S. General Curtis LeMay's vow to bomb Vietnam back into the Stone Age. In political terms, the European wing of Nato is increasingly isolated. Washington is keeping strangely quiet about Libya; the Arab League, whose support was actively sought for the United Nations Security Council Resolution that enabled the original intervention, has disappeared from the picture.
Nato may find it extremely difficult to get out of the political and military quagmire into which it has launched itself, but even greater embarrassment lies in the extent of Western financial involvement with Libya over many years. About $32 billion that the Qadhafi regime holds in the U.S. is not in bank accounts but in legitimate business holdings like shares and real estate. Appropriating even $150 million, as mentioned by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, would require legislation, which could take months. Tripoli also has about $20 billion in the United Kingdom, $9 billion in Germany, and $1.7 billion in Austria, again as a result of legitimate business activity. Western institutions such as leading colleges and universities have willingly accepted Libyan money. As for the expropriation of Mr. Qadhafi's own accounts, it will probably contravene international law as long as he is in power; in addition, Russia and China have both stated that they would veto any more anti-Qadhafi resolutions in the Security Council. Nato's major member-states can no longer hide the fact that they have long records of lucrative dealings — including trade in oil, weapons, and other commodities — with a dictator they have demonised for decades. It has now become clear that the western project is regime change and little else — and the intensification of the war against Libya has stretched international law to breaking-point.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/international-law-traduced/article2032538.ece
20,5,2011,The fall of Strauss-Kahn,"If power is the ultimate aphrodisiac, as Henry Kissinger famously quipped, then it boggles the mind why so many men in positions of great authority ruin themselves on account of sexual transgression. The latest casualty of overweening sexual hubris is the International Monetary Fund's charismatic chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who was compelled to resign following charges of attempting to rape and sexually abuse a maid in a Manhattan hotel room. It is no secret that Mr. Strauss-Kahn, whose first two marriages ended after accusations of infidelity, has had a sordid history of sexual misbehaviour. Soon after he was sent to a New York prison, a French writer, who is a goddaughter of Strauss-Kahn's second wife, announced she would be filing a complaint about being sexually assaulted by him almost a decade ago. Three years ago, an affair he was having with a subordinate member of staff resulted in an internal IMF investigation, which concluded that the relationship had not led Mr. Strauss-Kahn to abuse his position but he had shown poor judgment. The woman maintained that although their relationship was consensual, she felt coerced; she also warned investigators that he was “a man with a problem that may make him ill-equipped to lead an institution where women work under his command.”
In his native France, which has a laissez-faire attitude towards the private lives of public figures, the arrest of Mr. Strauss-Kahn has caused tremendous shock. A country that hardly raised an eyebrow over President Francois Mitterrand's love child or his successor Jacques Chirac's wandering eye has been forced to interrogate the multi-layered ramifications of the link between sex and power. A small but vociferous section of the French has blindly rushed to Mr. Strauss-Kahn's defence and, in the process, glossed over the fact that there is a vast gulf between sexual peccadillo and sexual crime, between a relationship and rape. To treat this as a mere sex scandal is to be blind to the nature of the charges pressed against him. Only a court of law can pronounce Mr. Strauss-Kahn guilty or innocent, but the serious charges against him puts paid to his hopes of securing the Socialist Party's nomination and then going on to challenge Nicolas Sarkozy in the 2012 presidential election — a battle that seemed tilted in the challenger's favour. While it was well known that he would resign from the IMF, his sudden exit leaves the Fund without a strong leader with the requisite diplomatic skills, at a time when the organisation is in the midst of conducting sensitive negotiations with European governments about overhauling debt packages to some countries, including Greece.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-fall-of-strausskahn/article2035598.ece
20,5,2011,Recognising tribal rights,"A bright future for conservation in India depends on providing improved protection for flora and fauna in different habitats. At the same time, the imperative is to safeguard the livelihoods of millions of people who traditionally rely on forests. In a major step towards reconciliation of these key goals, the Ministry of Environment and Forests has come up with a new draft implementation protocol for the determination and notification of Critical Wildlife Habitats (CWH). The guidelines in the protocol will help the MoEF meet its obligations under the Forest Rights Act, 2006 (FRA). What makes the protocol important is the due process it proposes to institute for resettling forest dwellers. Significantly, it provides for participation of gram sabhas, social scientists, and ecologists in the panel responsible for identifying critical habitat in a national park or sanctuary. This decision is consistent with the provisions of the FRA that require prior recognition and vesting of forest rights. The Act also requires the States to prove the likelihood of irreversible damage to species and habitat from the exercise of forest rights, and to demonstrate availability of a resettlement package. Finally, those who are to be resettled must give free and informed consent. The MoEF protocol will create a tangible, transparent legal framework to implement these provisions.
In the new draft of the protocol, the MoEF has done well to address the issues raised by conservation experts and social activists, primarily the need for better protection of forest communities. These concerns will now be handled by a National Steering Committee and State-level Expert Committees, giving all stakeholders a say in the process. What needs to be emphasised is that creation of Critical Wildlife Habitats is an achievable goal. For only a small part of the land is to be notified as off-limit to people. A flagship species such as the tiger can be expected to survive in only about one per cent of the country's land which is effectively protected. It is eminently feasible, therefore, to handsomely compensate forest dwellers who are ready to be resettled elsewhere. The Nagarahole tiger reserve in Karnataka convinced tribals that they would benefit from voluntary relocation, and they have. The package of land and incentives provided to them, including education opportunities, could serve as a model for other States. Finally, States need to gear up administratively, and the Union Ministry of Tribal Affairs needs to develop its infrastructure rapidly, to implement the Forest Rights Act in a way that harmonises the goals of conservation and livelihood support.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/recognising-tribal-rights/article2035596.ece
22,5,2011,GSAT-8 takes to the skies,"India's GSAT-8 satellite has been lofted into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket that lifted off from the European launch facility in French Guiana in equatorial South America. It is the 20th satellite designed and built indigenously by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to meet this country's requirements for space capacity in communications and broadcasting. The 3,100-kg spacecraft's 24 transponders will relay signals in radio frequencies known as the Ku-band. These transponders will be used for Direct-To-Home television broadcasts as well as to support communications using small satellite dishes known as Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSATs). Other Indian communication satellites that are currently operational have about 150 transponders working in various frequency bands. That capacity needs to be augmented, given that a power glitch on the INSAT-4B knocked out half its transponders last July. Two satellites, GSAT-4 and GSAT-5P, were lost in consecutive failures of the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) last year. Besides, the INSAT-2E, launched 12 years ago, is nearing the end of its life. ISRO plans to launch the GSAT-12, weighing 1,400 kg, on the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle this July. The GSAT-10, with 36 transponders and weighing 3,400 kg, is to be put into orbit by another Ariane 5 rocket next year. Another communication satellite will go up when the GSLV is flown again, which is expected to take place in the first quarter of 2012.
The GSAT-8 is also carrying a payload that will broadcast data to increase the accuracy and ensure the integrity of navigation based on signals from orbiting satellites of the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS). The resulting improvement in accuracy and reliability will allow aircraft, equipped with suitable receivers, to make precision approaches for landing at all runways in the country. Aircraft will also be able to fly more direct routes to their destination, saving time and fuel. Such space-based augmentation systems have begun functioning in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Ground stations for the Indian system, known as GAGAN (GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation), a joint effort by ISRO and the Airports Authority of India, have been put in place. After the GSAT-8's GAGAN payload becomes operational, further steps for testing the system as a whole and securing the necessary certification can start. All of India's remote sensing satellites are now launched domestically. This should be achieved in the case of communication satellites too. For that, the GSLV must be made as reliable as the PSLV and the next generation GSLV Mark-III got ready as soon as possible.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/gsat8-takes-to-the-skies/article2040477.ece
22,5,2011,Greece and eurozone woes,"The Greek economic crisis exposes the fact that even the most economistic of the European Union's policies, namely monetary union, is inextricably political and must be addressed by political measures. Athens, for its part, has made strenuous efforts to respond. Within a year, it has cut the budget deficit from 15.4 per cent of GDP to 10.5 per cent, mainly by slashing public spending, and tightened up on tax evasion. As a result of the cuts, however, the economy shrank by 4.5 per cent in 2010. It looks set to continue shrinking. The overall debt burden is now 142 per cent of GDP, and is still rising. The slide means the country cannot service its main current loan, the €110 billion jointly provided in 2010 by the International Monetary Fund and Greece's 16 eurozone partners. More bailouts are under discussion in the eurozone, as is a possible restructuring of the debt on easier terms. Even discussion of such matters affects national standing; and in what the researcher Paul de Grauwe calls self-fulfilling market expectations, the credit rating body Standard & Poor's has cut Greece's rating.
The other eurozone countries have handled the situation badly. Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker convened a secret meeting and then denied that the event had occurred. The exposure of that falsehood caused the euro to fall 2 per cent against the dollar. Secondly, focussing solely on the fiscal issues has made it harder for German Chancellor Angela Merkel to get her coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party, to back more loans for Greece; her government is now at risk. Thirdly, Greece's Prime Minister George Papandreou is under pressure. His 2010 cuts had broad support from a public who wanted to reform an economy they themselves saw as rotten. Now, well aware that the crisis was caused by the bankers and politicians, ordinary Greeks, hit hardest by austerity measures, are resisting fresh attempts to raise revenues and demanding that those who caused the problems solve them. Furthermore, the financial institutions' punitive policies threaten the social and political understandings on which the EU itself is founded; they remove the automatic stabilisers (to use Dr. de Grauwe's phrase) of unemployment benefit and counter-cyclical public spending. Finally, the narrow financial view precludes investments that would be far more likely to revive the economy; those would aim at areas like shipbuilding, solar or other renewable energy, and services. Greece, in effect, needs a new Marshall Plan; but the eurozone looks politically incapable of even imagining one.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/greece-and-eurozone-woes/article2040568.ece
23,5,2011,Pakistan's enemy within,"In many ways the 17-hour siege of Pakistan Navy's air base, PNS Mehran, in Karachi is reminiscent of the attack on the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi in October 2009. It would be tragic for Pakistan if the latest of wake-up calls to snap out of its Janus-faced attitude towards terrorism is ignored — as it was after the GHQ attack or the discovery of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden from the “armpit of the Pakistan Military Academy” in Abbottabad. As always, the first official remarks on the attack had the stock phrase, ‘Pakistan-is-a-victim-of-terror.' Nobody is denying that. But what will it take Islamabad to understand that terrorists cannot be assets, strategic or otherwise? If the events following bin Laden's killing are any indication, the chances of the PNS Mehran attack forcing a course correction look bleak. At the in-camera briefing by the military and intelligence establishment's top brass on the Abbottabad incident, India was again identified as “enemy number one,” clearly indicating that this remains the defining factor of Pakistan's strategic policy. As though this were not enough of a signal, the in-camera briefing for Parliament and the subsequent resolution reposing confidence in the armed forces were a telling reminder of how the security establishment can orchestrate even adverse events to its advantage.
While the civilian government can distance itself from ownership of the strategic policy, it has no excuse for not even trying to change the mindset that has allowed such policies to continue three years after a democratically elected dispensation was voted in. The school curriculum packed with hate towards all things Indian and eulogies to ‘jihad' is a problem that remains unaddressed though it is critical to the country's existence as a nation of multiple ethnicities and religious diversities. These are issues that are coming to haunt Pakistan almost on a daily basis and the armed services too are not insulated from such divisive tendencies. In fact, Chief of Army Staff Ashfaq Parvez Kayani is reported to have admitted as much after Punjab Governor Salman Taseer's assassination — going to the extent of fearing a revolt within if he condoled the death. From all indications, the PNS Mehran attack could not have been carried out without some inside help. How could the terrorists, armed to the teeth with even rocket-propelled grenades, have entered the high-security area undetected? Weeding out this kind of mindset created over 30 years of systematic indoctrination is not a task that can be undertaken overnight but Pakistan must cut its losses now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pakistans-enemy-within/article2042984.ece
23,5,2011,Killer roads,"The tragic death of Tamil Nadu Minister N. Mariyam Pichai in an accident on a National Highway in the State should serve as a reminder that safety on our roads needs to be given the highest priority by governments as well as the public at an all-India level. The latest data for fatal accidents presented to Parliament by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways are for 2008, and they are frightening. A staggering 1,19,860 people perished in mishaps that year. The Law Commission of India has pointed out that the national and state highways account for nearly half of all road accidents. In spite of the shocking levels of death and disability, the central government has only been inching forward with reform. It is nothing short of a scandal that in a country witnessing 10 per cent annual growth in vehicles, and boasting a network of 3.3 million km of roads, the Bill for creation of a statutory National Road Safety and Traffic Management Board has been meandering through Parliament. Such an agency is vital to set standards for road design, inspect existing roads, and investigate accidents scientifically. If the death toll is to be brought down, its formation cannot be delayed any longer.
That India's Motor Vehicles Act lags far behind the needs of a fast-motorising society is painfully evident from its road safety record. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture recognised this and suggested several modifications in the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2007 to strengthen enforcement and reduce the trauma of making a compensation claim. The proposed amendments are important and need to be brought in quickly — but the stark reality is that even the existing law is not uniformly implemented by the police. It will take a ‘zero tolerance' policy towards the most common transgressions — dangerous and reckless driving; disregard for traffic rules; jumping red lights; driving under the influence of liquor; failing to use seatbelts; and driving without a helmet — to bring about a visible change. It is also true that disregard for labour welfare leads to accidents. Many professional drivers are forced to work longer hours than desirable from a safety standpoint. This can result in their being asleep at the wheel, with horrific consequences for passengers and for themselves. On the other hand, some drivers cause accidents through sheer recklessness. The response to this has to be the unsparing enforcement of rules. In the case of errant drivers, the Supreme Court has endorsed a deterrent approach in Dalbir Singh vs. State of Haryana. Enforcement, good engineering, and education are the need of the hour.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/killer-roads/article2042983.ece
25,5,2011,Rana trial and beyond,"In just a few weeks, a court in Chicago will decide the fate of Tahawwur Rana — the first of the men who guided Muhammad Ajmal Kasab and nine other Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists to Mumbai on November 26, 2008. The trial has provided dramatic new insights into just how those men came to kill 164 children, women, and men. Based on the testimony of the Pakistani-American jihadist David Headley, and a mass of evidence, prosecutors have charged that serving officers of Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence Directorate financed and directed the attack on Mumbai. In days to come, we will hear Mr. Rana's version of the story; his lawyers are expected to argue that he acted in good faith to help a childhood friend. The problem, however, is that Mr. Rana was at worst a bit-part actor in the Mumbai conspiracy. The men he is alleged to have answered to — commanders in the Lashkar, and their ISI mentors — are not in court, and there are no signs so far that Pakistan intends to bring them to justice.
The consequences the verdict will have for Mr. Rana's life, therefore, are likely to be dwarfed by those it will have for Pakistan's increasingly fraught relationship with India and the world. Pakistani investigators had conducted a separate investigation and claimed to have arrested key conspirators. Their account of events, however, made no mention of the intelligence officers who helped the Lashkar to strike. Nor did it indict key Lashkar figures. E-mail correspondence and testimony presented by the prosecution in Chicago shows that Sajid Mir, the Lashkar's commander for transnational operations, guided Mr. Headley through each stage of the operation. He figures nowhere in the charge sheet presented before a Rawalpindi court by Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA). Muzammil Bhat, the Lashkar's chief military tactician and the man who trained the assault team, is also conspicuous by his absence. Pakistani investigators do not seem to have made any great effort, either, to pursue the 20 low-level fugitives wanted for their role in the attack, mainly crew members of the boats used to sail to Mumbai. The sole Lashkar fugitive to figure in the FIA's most-wanted list is Muhammad Amjad Khan, a Karachi-based operative who played a somewhat nebulous logistical role in putting together the operation. The trial in Rawalpindi itself has been deadlocked over procedural issues; there is no word on when, or even if, Pakistan will send a judicial commission to record evidence in India. Pakistan has long said it is committed to eradicating terrorism from its soil. Its conduct of the Mumbai prosecution shows just how little these promises are worth. The trial in Chicago marks one step forward in securing justice for the victims of the Mumbai attacks. But the path that must still be travelled will be long and hard.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rana-trial-and-beyond/article2048711.ece
25,5,2011,Privatising war,"The United Arab Emirates has exposed huge loopholes in international criminal law by announcing a $529 million contract with the Reflex Responses company for an 800-strong force of foreign mercenaries, which could be expanded to several thousand men. The firm was founded by Erik Prince, former owner of the notorious U.S. mercenary firm Blackwater. Within the Emirates, the mercenaries will defend oil installations and important buildings, and quell internal rebellions. They could also be used to repress dissent by foreign workers who form the bulk of the UAE's workforce. Nearly all of them work in conditions that have been widely criticised. As for the involvement of the mercenaries outside UAE territory, the relevant documents reportedly name one task as the destruction of “enemy personnel and equipment.” No enemy is specified, and neither are any rules of engagement.
The deal raises major problems for regional relations. Mr. Prince moved to the Emirates after five Blackwater executives were indicted in the U.S. on charges that include bribery, lying to federal officials, and weapons offences. His earlier businesses got 90 per cent of their income from government contracts; his new venture is no different, and will operate in the tax-free Emirates. In April, U.S. federal prosecutors reopened a case against four Blackwater agents accused of killing 17 civilians in Baghdad's Nisoor Square in 2007. Colombian staff left Blackwater as they were paid less and treated worse than their Bulgarian colleagues; once home, they killed the recruiting agent. Colombians now working for Mr. Prince are reported to be virtual captives in their compound. His firm operates entirely in a legal grey area. Based in the Emirates, it is free of U.S. legal requirements for a licence to train foreign troops, and as a company it is not covered by the 1989 United Nations International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries. The real agenda seems to be driven by the fear of Iran, which Washington, the Gulf rulers, and Mr. Prince share. The UAE may intend to retake Gulf islands that are disputed with Iran, and the Obama administration has said it would “make sense” for the Emirates to look for outside help. In a highly volatile region, both the U.S. and the UAE are using a crusader with an appalling record to outsource not security but war itself. International law and the related institutions seem powerless in the face of this outrage.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/privatising-war/article2048708.ece
25,5,2011,On the return of caste in the Census,"In a country living with the reality of caste and striving constantly to offset disadvantages created on the basis of social hierarchy, the central government's decision to hold a caste census does have wide appeal. The enumeration of castes is to be undertaken along with a ‘Below Poverty Line' census in such a way that there is a simultaneous mapping of the economic, caste, and religious backgrounds of the entire population. A mere caste census may have meant just a headcount of diverse communities, but with the plan to integrate socio-economic data with the caste count, there is hope that the country might at last have a set of quantifiable data that would justify key administrative measures predicated on caste identity. Over the years, the debate over the use of caste as the basis for ensuring social justice in education and public employment has been resolved in favour of caste-based reservation for ‘socially and educationally backward classes.' Once caste was accepted as the main parameter on which social justice would be measured, it was only a matter of time before the country came round to the view that a restoration of the pre-Independence system of including caste in the decennial Census was necessary. The continuance of existing levels of caste-based reservation also hinges on collection of caste-wise data. For the judicially imposed limit of 50 per cent on the quantum of reservation — flowing from a constitutional scheme that says the extent of reservation, being the exception, cannot exceed equal treatment, the norm — can be overcome only by providing hard data to the court.
However, a caste census will be much more challenging than a lay view suggests. For one thing, a precise headcount of a particular caste may ultimately prove elusive, given the number of sub-castes and sects that the Indian caste system has spawned, and the inevitable scope for confusion over the inclusion or exclusion of a sect from a larger caste umbrella. The nomenclature used by a caste group to refer to itself may vary from region to region, while there could be confounding similarities in name between different sects. And even more scientifically challenging would be the exercise of integrating the headcount of a caste with the socio-economic profile of the population falling under it and coming to a reasonable conclusion about its precise state of backwardness. There are other questions, too, such as whether the final caste-wise breakdown of the population would be used to parcel out all opportunities under the state solely in proportion to the strength of the communities or whether there would be some exiguous space for open competition so that the longer-term goal of a caste-free society is not lost sight of.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/on-the-return-of-caste-in-the-census/article2045905.ece
25,5,2011,Dual message from Spain,"As young — and not-so-young — people continued to occupy the centres of over 50 Spanish cities in defiance of a ban on such gatherings immediately before elections, the Spanish socialist party (PSOE) of Prime Minister José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero suffered a crushing defeat in Spain's local and regional polls on May 22. The main opposition, the conservative Popular Party (PP), won in 11 of the 13 regions where elections took place, including Castilla-La Mancha, which the PSOE had held since the first post-Franco elections in 1978. The socialists' municipal results were as bad as their regional ones, and saw them lose Barcelona, the country's second city and PSOE stronghold, to Catalan nationalists; the conservatives also gained control of Seville, and the ruling party's municipal vote share of 27.79 per cent left it nearly 10 percentage points behind the PP. Mr. Zapatero has taken responsibility for the debacle, recognising that many Spaniards face grave difficulties and that the young are deeply anxious about their future; but he has ruled out an early general election and will hold on until his second term ends early in 2012.
That Spanish voters have been motivated to express their anger with the PSOE government is not in doubt; the 66.23 per cent turnout was nearly 2.3 percentage points higher than that for the 2007 municipal polls. Spain has faced a severe economic crisis since the financial and property bubble burst in 2008, and its current unemployment rate of over 21 per cent is the highest in the eurozone. It would, however, be premature to conclude that the results signify an endorsement of the conservative ideology. Blank and spoilt ballot papers added up to 4.2 per cent of the total, and the protesters camping in city squares seemed almost indifferent to the outcome. Secondly, young Spanish adults are in a particularly dire position, with unemployment rate approaching 45 per cent in the 18-25 age cohort. It is also highly unlikely that the new PP administrations at regional or municipal level can do much about the national economic condition. Furthermore, the PP's social conservatism, manifested in a confrontational attitude to many of Mr. Zapatero's first-term reforms — such as the legalisation of same-sex marriages — is likely to invite great hostility among the kinds of young people who use social networks to communicate and who have likened their occupation of Madrid's Puerta del Sol to the protests in Cairo's Tahrir Square. The results of these elections, in effect, conceal much deeper fissures in the Spanish body politic; those are probably the last things the PP wants to address.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dual-message-from-spain/article2045906.ece
26,5,2011,India in Africa,"The second India-Africa summit at Addis Ababa has set the stage for a comprehensive re-engagement between the world's largest democracy and an emerging continent. The Africa-India Framework for Enhanced Cooperation and the Addis Ababa Declaration adopted at the summit envisage economic and political cooperation, and also cooperation in a host of other areas including science and technology, social and infrastructure development, tourism, culture, and sports. Africa and India recognise the opportunities they bring to the table for each other; both are now better positioned to use these opportunities in ways that can give substance to the old political slogan of ‘South-South cooperation.' As a leading player in the global economy, it is natural for India to seek participation in a resource-rich continent that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has described as the “new economic growth story.” His announcement of a $5 billion credit line over the next three years was the eye-catcher of the summit, but clearly, African nations are interested in enhancing their own skills and capabilities. India, with its substantial technology knowledge pool, is well placed to contribute to such capacity-building. This will also help in better utilisation of Indian financial assistance — of the committed credit line, unused funds from a previous financial package comprise $3.4 billion.
Following the first summit in 2008, India initiated several such efforts, including the Pan-African e-Network Project across 43 countries, which drew appreciation from the beneficiary countries. That new proposals for capacity-building discussed at this summit cover fields as diverse as information technology, textiles, food processing, and weather forecasting underscores the needs of a continent seeking to stabilise itself economically and politically. As important, it highlights Africa's recognition of rising India's capabilities to assist other developing countries. The India-Africa relationship is not new; it draws on a long, shared history of struggle against European colonialism, and a determination to ensure equality in the post-colonial world order. Africa has played host to a large Indian diaspora, and independent India was among the first to take a firm stand against apartheid in South Africa. Reducing India's ties with Africa to a ‘rivalry' with China is to take a narrow view of history. Given the realities, it is also meaningless — China's $126 billion trade with Africa is way ahead of India's $ 46 billion. It is best for New Delhi to use the present momentum to build its relationship with Africa in ways that will be of optimal benefit to both sides.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/india-in-africa/article2051821.ece
26,5,2011,Figuring out the textile crisis,"By downing shutters for a day this week, cotton spinning mill units may not have reduced the huge glut that has built up in yarn stocks. But they have succeeded in turning the spotlight on the complex web of public policy the central government has woven in the years since Independence. Few will quarrel with the objective of securing for cotton growers a remunerative price. Where the government has gone wrong is in simultaneously taking upon itself the burden of ensuring that high cotton prices do not result in high yarn prices for handloom weavers or for power looms. In this effort at squaring the circle, it has ended up creating a tangle of quantitative and tariff controls on cotton as well as yarn interspersed with duty drawback incentives, concessional lending to units engaged in the value chain of the textiles industry, and so on — in short, a bureaucratic process of Kafkaesque proportions. Much of this was supposed to be calibrated in real time in line with changes in global and domestic demand and supply. What is clear is that this policy framework is badly in need of a reality check in many crucial respects.
For instance, the continuous capacity addition in yarn manufacture ought to have tempered official fears of yarn shortage for weavers and knitted garment manufacturers while formulating policy. That has not been the case. Similarly, it is well recognised that as an approach to cloth-making hand weaving is now more expensive than mass manufacturing. It is no surprise that the poor of the land have found cheaper alternatives in fabrics woven by machine. Another anomaly is that while the law reserves several varieties for the handloom sector, these mass consumption fabrics whose parity depends on yarn prices are actually made by power looms. Yet official policy maintains the pretence that this mandated reservation is for the benefit of millions of handloom weavers — who are the poorest members of the value chain after farmers. Indeed, so out of tune with reality is official policy that the proportion of the total output a yarn manufacturer must compulsorily wind in a coil form (hank) so as to be amenable for use by handloom weavers has remained the same despite the substantial changes in mass clothing habits. Nothing in the track record of governance witnessed over the last six decades gives room for any optimism that the government can handle this complexity and deliver on desirable policy outcomes. It is time a comprehensive nation-wide enquiry was conducted into the economics of the cotton textile sector, covering all its constituents and seeing how they have fared. Appropriate policy changes can follow.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/figuring-out-the-textile-crisis/article2051820.ece
27,5,2011,Missing daughters,"The Census of 2011 revealed that the sex ratio in the 0-6 age group is worse now than in any decade since Independence. It is indisputable that this distressing trend is the result of more people having easier access to medical technologies that reveal the sex of the foetus, and opting for sex-selective abortions. New research published by The Lancet provides further insights into the phenomenon of ‘missing women': as family size in India declines over time, there is a bias against having a second female child when the first is a girl. Based on data drawn from the National Family Health Survey between 1990 and 2005 and the Census of 1991, 2001, and 2011, the paper estimates that for second-order births where the first is a female, the conditional sex ratio fell to an abysmal 836 girls per 1,000 boys in 2005. It is equally a matter of concern that most of India's population now lives in States where selective abortion of girls is common. What stands out in the findings is the positive correlation that education and affluence seem to have with a decline in the sex ratio; the decline was higher in the case of women with ten years or more of education than for mothers with no education. Such a trend calls for closer study of the factors that reinforce the son preference, especially in States and districts with a worsening ratio.
What is fundamentally underscored by the research is the failure of the Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act even in its amended form, and the need for a multi-pronged strategy to remove the prejudice against the girl child. Any serious review of the law in the States with the worst child sex ratios should begin with the quarterly reports they are required to file on diagnostic centres, laboratories, and clinics, the action taken against unregistered bodies, search and seizure, and the outcomes of awareness campaigns. Not all States have been filing such reports regularly. The level of involvement of laggard States in implementing the PNDT Act can be gauged from the fact that in Haryana, a crucial notification on setting up Appropriate Authorities was not published in the gazette for 12 years from 1997, and it had to be reissued as an ordinance with retrospective effect. But then, while enforcement measures may have a salutary effect, the more challenging task is to make India a less male-dominated society. The place to start for that mission would be Parliament and the State Legislative Assemblies. Political parties must lead by enabling 33 per cent representation for women in legislatures and raise their visibility. Liberal scholarships for all levels of study and improved economic security may tilt the balance for the less affluent sections.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/missing-daughters/article2054922.ece
27,5,2011,A troubadour of our times,"In 1959, Robert Allen Zimmerman, an introverted teenager with an acoustic guitar and a harmonica, renamed himself Bob Dylan after the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas. Although he would reveal much later that Arthur Rimbaud and John Keats were major influences on his song writing, it was evident within a couple of years that this young man had melded poetry, protest, and song to create a unique style that rewrote the existing conventions of popular music. He was a modern day troubadour. At a time when pop was marked by cutesy love songs and catchy clear-cut rhythms, the deceptive irregular cadences of Dylan's folksy approach, the pinched and nasal tonality of his voice, and the elegiac lyrics that created anthemic songs of socio-political protest gave his music a stamp of astonishing power and originality. Now that he is 70, it seems apposite to recall how much he defined the music of the Sixties — that musically tumultuous decade, which fashioned the trajectory of popular music like no other since and which created music that lives with us even today. Most musicians and groups in that era — including The Beatles — were influenced by him in one way or another.
Over the years, there has been of course more than one Dylan. The acoustic folk of Blowin' In The Wind and A Hard Day's Rain a-Gonna Fall gave way in the mid-Sixties to a fusion of blues and rock, a period that produced two of his finest albums ( Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde) and saw him reach the heights of his creativity. In 1975, he reminded his fans that his genius was very much intact with his dark and brooding Blood On The Tracks, after which his music took on a new and soulful character in his so-called Christianity phase. By the early Nineties, it was widely believed that Dylan had exhausted his creative genius, but he surprised everyone with his 30th Grammy-winning Time Out Of Mind, which found a place in Rolling Stone magazine's list of 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time. Of course, his place is music history owes principally to the audacious originality of his earlier work, that period in the first half of the Sixties in which he inspired an entire generation of musicians and charted a new direction for rock and rhythm and blues. Elvis Presley was the world's first true rock and roll star and The Beatles enjoyed the greatest fan following, but it was Dylan, contemporary bard and thinking person's musician, who persuaded us with his nasal twang and sparse instrumentation that pop could be a challenging, thought-provoking, and serious musical genre.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-troubadour-of-our-times/article2054921.ece
29,5,2011,IPL's continuing lure,"The fourth edition of the Indian Premier League faced several challenges. Coming so close on the heels of ICC ODI World Cup, the competition had to grapple with viewer fatigue. The addition of two more franchises, Kochi Tuskers and Pune Warriors, increased the number of matches from 60 to 74. Despite a lukewarm beginning, the IPL came back well in the subsequent phases. The competition ended on a night of triumph for the Chennai Super Kings at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium. CSK, led by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, among the most successful captains in international cricket, became the only team to win the competition twice. The Chennai side, which has reached the IPL final thrice and also won the Champions League title, has firepower in batting, variety in bowling, and cool when it matters most. When the team appeared heading for a defeat in the first qualifier against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in Mumbai, strokeful left-hander Suresh Raina conjured a 50-ball unbeaten 73 to clinch a thriller. In the summit clash in Chennai, opener Murali Vijay displayed a wonderful sense of occasion by producing an explosive near-century. The solidity of ‘Mr. Cricket,' Michael Hussey (492 runs in 14 matches at 41.00), the pace and thrust of Doug Bollinger (17 wickets in 13 games at an economy rate or ER of 7.00), the masterful wielding of the bludgeon by Dhoni whenever needed, and the control and craft of off-spinner R. Ashwin (20 wickets in 16 matches at an ER of 6.15) served CSK splendidly.
Fittingly in the finale, CSK came up against the game changer of this IPL. Chris Gayle, signed up by RCB after he was left out of the West Indies squad for the ODIs against Pakistan, had batted right through like Superman, blowing away attacks at will. Ashwin's prising him out with a delicious piece of deception in the first over was a rare moment of sporting drama. Gayle, who was adjudged Player of the Tournament, made a sensational 608 runs in 12 matches at an average of 67.55 and a strike rate of 183.13. Slinger Lasith Malinga of the Mumbai Indians was the outstanding bowler with 28 wickets from 16 games at an ER of 5.95. The Sri Lankan's toe-crushers were on target. The IPL provides a platform for emerging players to showcase their skills, and aggressive opener Paul Valthaty (Kings XI Punjab), promising leg-spinner Rahul Sharma (Pune Warriors), and combative left-arm spinner Iqbal Abdulla (Kolkata Knight Riders) made headlines. The cash-rich IPL has reopened the club versus country debate. While there are no easy answers, the BCCI should make a sincere effort to ensure that the India cricketers do not play too much cricket at least 15 days before and after the popular Twenty20 competition to combat player fatigue and reduce the risk of injury.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ipls-continuing-lure/article2059825.ece
29,5,2011,An arrest in Serbia,"Another long manhunt has ended with the arrest of Ratko Mladic, the “butcher of Bosnia.” Unlike Osama bin Laden, the former chief of the Bosnian Serb army was not behind incidents of global scale. But he is held responsible for an incident known as the worst single atrocity in Europe since World War II — the slaughter of 7,500 Bosnian Muslim men and boys at Srebernica in 1995. For this, he has been indicted by The Hague tribunal, an international court set up in 1993 to prosecute crimes committed during the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s. A key member of the Serbian leadership during those years, Mladic had evaded arrest since 1995, apparently with ease, especially after slipping into Serbia during the reign of his friend, President Slobodan Milosevic. The 2000 ouster of Milosevic and his subsequent extradition to The Hague laid the ground for Serbia’s agreement with the tribunal to hand over war crimes suspects. But the real game-changer in its co-operation with the tribunal was the country’s growing desire to join the European Union. Of the constituents of the former Yugoslavia, Slovenia was admitted in 2004, while Croatia, Macedonia, and Montenegro are on the road to membership. A year after the 2008 arrest of the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, Serbia applied for EU membership in 2009. But its failure to hand over Mladic was a stumbling block. Even though the unresolved Kosovo question could still trip up its European dream, and one last Serbian fugitive still remains at large, the Mladic arrest will incline the EU to take a positive view of Serbia’s candidacy when it meets to discuss the membership later this year.
The elements of Serbia’s struggle to transform itself from an outlier in order to be accepted as part of the modern European community have striking parallels with another country — an entrenched military; a powerful intelligence agency; a network of officials with delusions of ethnic supremacy; an economic crisis; ultra-nationalist public attitudes dominated by the sentiment that the country is being made a whipping boy by the West; and, to top it all, a weak political class. A Prime Minister was assassinated in 2003 for promising to hand over war crimes suspects. The difference between Serbia and Pakistan — aside from the smallness of one and the global implications of the crisis in the other, not to mention its nuclear arsenal — is that since 2008, one of them has had a leader unafraid to challenge the military and the nationalist forces, and is credited with thus bringing a change in public opinion. Were it that it was Pakistan.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-arrest-in-serbia/article2059827.ece
30,5,2011,Another chance in Nepal,"The last minute deal struck by Nepal's political parties on Sunday will extend the life of the Constituent Assembly (CA) by another three months but whether this will be enough to finalise a new constitution depends on the extent to which the young republic's political parties are willing to show flexibility. Under the terms of the five-point deal, the parties have agreed to conclude the major tasks of the peace process and prepare a first draft of the new constitution within the CA's extended tenure. They have also decided to effectively implement past agreements, including with the Madhesi front, to make the Nepali Army inclusive. Finally, Prime Minister Jhalanath Khanal of the Unified Marxists-Leninists (UML) has undertaken to clear the way for the formation of a national unity government by tendering his resignation. A dispute of sorts has already arisen over the last point, with the Nepali Congress (NC) contesting Mr. Khanal's reasonable stand that he can only resign when a viable alternative is ready. At the heart of the continuing stalemate, of course, is the unresolved question of when and how to integrate former combatants from the United Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) in the Nepal Army. The parties have made some progress since the last time the CA was extended, in May 2010, but a final settlement seems to be proving elusive. There are also major differences among the UCPN(M), the UML, and the NC on key constitutional questions such as the form of government and federalism.
The fundamental problem in Nepal is two-fold. The NC and, to a lesser extent, the UML continue to act as if the Maoists still pose a military threat — which they do not — and have made forward movement on constitution-drafting conditional on the formal disbanding of the Peoples' Liberation Army. The Maoists, on the other hand, play on this fear by trying to use the PLA's interim existence as a lever to extract concessions from the NC and UML on the constitutional front. In doing so, the Maoists underestimate their actual strength, which springs from their impressive electoral support. The PLA is no longer a fighting force and the longer its former combatants languish in limbo, the greater is the likelihood that they will become undisciplined and even lumpenised. With Maoist leader Prachanda broadly endorsing the Nepal Army's proposal for integration, a serious push should be made by all sides to take the peace process to its logical conclusion. India can help by abandoning its negativism and sending a clear signal to all parties that it supports the speedy integration of the PLA as part of the wider process of making the NA more professional and inclusive.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/another-chance-in-nepal/article2063175.ece
30,5,2011,Drugs need new thinking,"The Global Commission on Drug Policy, a group that includes former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and several former Latin American presidents, is expected to announce soon that the “war on drugs” has been a failure. The Mexican government states that since President Felipe Calderón took office in 2006 and implemented a crackdown, trafficking has been a factor in 35,000 deaths, and drug-related corruption is out of control. In the United States, which has the world's highest levels of use, the NGO Drug Policy Alliance estimates that official bodies spend $51 billion a year fighting drugs. The political context is also significant. In India, regions like the Northeast reveal connections between conflict and opportunities for trafficking, as also between injected drugs and HIV/AIDS transmission. Furthermore, law and policy are no deterrents; research on cannabis use has found that the most important factor is the social context. With illegal drugs now a major source of income for organised crime, governments cannot curb the trade and often resort to torture and extra-judicial killings. State agencies also seem to deal in deadly drugs. The crashes in Latin America of two aircraft used by the CIA for the rendition of terrorism suspects for torture elsewhere revealed cargoes totalling four tonnes of cocaine.
The human cost of the failed war on drugs is incalculable, and the need for radical new approaches can no longer be denied. The main international instrument, the 1961 U.N. Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, has no enforcement mechanism and is almost toothless. Legalisation is controversial, with few politicians ready to support it publicly. Fortunately, a broad consensus across ideological lines is emerging in the form of decriminalisation, which makes drug use an administrative violation but treats trafficking as a criminal offence. In Portugal, the only European Union state to legislate to this effect, it has been assessed as an undisputed success. Drug use and drug-related deaths and diseases have declined over the last decade, and the use of harm-reduction services has increased greatly. Several Latin American countries — which have been ravaged by the drug trade — as well as some EU states and a few regional governments elsewhere have got good results from de facto decriminalisation. The strategy may, however, encounter resistance from powerful vested interests, including police and other security forces, politicians fearful of public disapproval, and drug cartels. The Global Commission's statement will be awaited with interest, as it could signal an overdue change in the world's attitude to drugs.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/drugs-need-new-thinking/article2063114.ece
31,5,2011,Beauty and dominance,"Only the rarest of sporting performances leaves a spectator with the feeling that it isn't merely high art, it's also the most just outcome. Barcelona's 3-1 victory over Manchester United in the Champions League final at Wembley will resonate for a long time with every lover of football. It showcased everything that's great about the Spanish club, and, in so doing, drew attention to the relationship between form and function. Football Club Barcelona doesn't endeavour to just win; victory must be achieved by playing attractive football. It's the most difficult objective to attain in sport, the marriage of beauty and dominance. Barcelona has achieved just that. What's more, it has done it with home-grown talent, avoiding for the most part the transfer-market spending top European clubs undertake as a matter of course. Lionel Messi, Xavi, and Andres Iniesta, three of the world's finest, are graduates of La Masia, Barcelona's youth academy, as are first-team players Pedro, Sergio Busquets, Gerard Pique, Carlos Puyol, and Victor Valdes. Coach Pep Guardiola is another alumnus. Is it any wonder that the slick, imaginative one-touch game Barcelona plays — ‘tikki takka,' as it's affectionately known — appears natural and intuitive?
The ease of Barcelona's style, which was shaped by the great Johan Cruyff, belies the effort expended to produce it. Not only is the possession-based play physically demanding, requiring persistent pressing so the ball may be swiftly won back; it is also mentally exhausting, for space has constantly to be found. The only team that has had any degree of success against Guardiola's Barcelona — Jose Mourinho's Internazionale Milan, last year's European champion — did so by manipulating space expertly. Knowing it had little chance if it attacked the ball, Inter willingly gave it up and ‘parked the bus,' which is to say it compressed the last one-third of the pitch defensively so Barcelona wouldn't find a way through. Mourinho attempted a similar strategy with Real Madrid this year, but Guardiola and Barcelona had learnt well. When a team attempted to engage Barcelona as an equal, as English champion Manchester United did, it was hopelessly outplayed. United's manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, not prone to easy praise, said Barcelona, which had also beaten his side in the 2009 Champions League final, was the best he had seen. This final will also be remembered for Messi's luminosity, which far from outshining the rest of Barcelona actually showed it in its best light. But the defining image of the Spanish club's spirit will be that of Eric Abidal, the defender who had recovered from a tumour to start the final, accepting the trophy for his teammates.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/beauty-and-dominance/article2066152.ece
31,5,2011,Questions over Yemeni democracy,"The truce announced on May 27 by the opposition leader Sadiq al-Ahmar highlights the strength of the forces ranged against supporters of democracy in Yemen. The immediate cause of the five days of fighting, in which over 100 died in the capital, Sanaa, was President Ali Abdullah Saleh's third refusal to sign a deal brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The deal required Mr. Saleh to step down in return for immunity from prosecution by a unity government. The Yemeni President has a reputation for breaking agreements, and is yet to show any indication of acting even on his earlier promise of a “constitutional” transfer of power at the end of this year. There are several complicating factors in the political situation. The current truce may appear to be based on popular feeling, but it is actually the result of a decision taken by Mr. al-Ahmar, who heads the country's most powerful tribal grouping, the Hashed confederation. Another bloc has been formed by General Mohsen al-Ahmar (no relation of the opposition leader), who claims to support the public protests but has long been a member of the political elite and defected from the government only in March 2011. Further, Sadiq al-Ahmar's brother Hameed runs the mobile phone network that the protesters use, and helps fund the opposition coalition.
Ordinary Yemenis, who number 24 million in one of the world's poorest countries, are therefore at serious risk of exclusion from the very movement they had the courage to initiate in January. The issues they face are not solely of domestic origin. Other Gulf countries, which have shown no inclination to share their oil wealth with their southern neighbour, are very nervous about the presence in Yemen of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), and about its potential expansion during any instability that might follow a change of state. That anxiety is shared by the United States and the United Kingdom even though the AQAP is not, as of now, a major force in Yemen, the land of origin of the bin Ladens. The G8 has been persuaded to provide $40 billion in support of those West Asian and North African states that have undertaken reforms in response to the continuing pro-democracy protests, but there too nothing is as it seems. Most of the money had been allocated earlier, mainly to Tunisia and Egypt. In effect, what domestic Yemeni factions, the GCC, and the G8 are revealing is a desire for a handover of power between existing groups. If that takes place, it will expose the hollowness of western talk of support for democracy in West Asia. It will also amount to a betrayal of the people of Yemen.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/questions-over-yemeni-democracy/article2066150.ece
1,6,2011,The habit of covering up,"Two years into UPA-II, Sonia Gandhi made the brave statement at a celebratory event that the Congress-led coalition would “take corruption head on” and “demonstrate through actions, not words, that we mean what we say.” She went so far as to claim that “transparency, accountability and probity are the very heart of our governance.” Prime Minister Manmohan Singh sounded similar sentiments in lower key, acknowledging that public concern over the “pervasiveness of corruption” was legitimate and pledging that his government would take “corrective action” and would not hesitate to act against “misuse of public office.” Considering how low the credibility of the UPA government has sunk on the issues of corruption and abuse of power — notwithstanding the Prime Minister's undisputed personal financial integrity — the task is uphill all the way. The 2-G spectrum allocation scam is India's biggest ever corruption scandal. Conducted right under the Prime Minister's nose and in defiance of the caution he advised, the scam progressed, enjoying immunity from serious investigation for an inordinately long time. But thanks to a rare combination of factors — the most important of which are public pressure, in part generated by the news media, and judicial intervention — some progress has been made by the Central Bureau of Investigation in bringing some of the corrupt to justice. Mr. A. Raja, ex-Telecom Minister, has been locked up in Tihar Jail and l'affaire Kalaignar TV has been exposed but the two questions on everyone's lips are: What about the role of other Ministers and bigwigs in the telecom mega scandal, which clearly goes back some years before 2007-08? And where has the rest of the money gone?
A Cabinet Minister now in the eye of the storm is Textiles Minister Dayanidhi Maran, also of the DMK. Relying on material thrown up by independent media investigations, first by The Economic Times (May 21, 2011) and then, in much greater detail, by Tehelka magazine (issue of June 4, 2011) — publications that have not been deterred by legal threats — the main opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, has aggressively posed questions to Mr. Maran and the UPA government that can no longer be ignored. The questions relate to specific actions, policy changes, and transactions that took place during Mr. Maran's tenure as Telecom Minister (2004-07) or soon after. They focus on the sudden change of FDI norms in the telecom sector, which raised the FDI limit to 74 per cent; the consequences of this big policy change; the taking of the authority of determining the pricing of spectrum out of the purview of the Group of Ministers on the written insistence of Telecom Minister Maran; the allocation in November 2006 of 14 2-G Unified Access Services Licences for a throwaway price of Rs.1,399 crore to Aircel after the Malaysian business conglomerate, the Maxis Group, acquired a 74 per cent stake in the telecom operator; and subsequent investments by a Maxis subsidiary in Sun Direct TV Pvt Ltd and other Maran family-owned companies. The Congress spokesman's response to the effect that it is up to Mr. Maran to answer these questions, and that the Joint Parliamentary Committee could perhaps go into the issues, is the latest example of what WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Julian Assange characterised, in an interview to The Hindu, as “a habit of covering up allegations of corruption.” The questions raised by the media investigations, and by the BJP, must be answered immediately by the UPA government and the Prime Minister — and the whole matter must be speedily investigated, without fear or favour.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-habit-of-covering-up/article2068660.ece
1,6,2011,Nuclear exit,"Germany's decision to shut down its nuclear power plants latest by 2022 is a historic response to rising public opinion after the Fukushima disaster. It is momentous because it comes from a conservative, business-oriented coalition that earlier viewed nuclear power as vital for competitiveness. It is worth recalling that Chancellor Angela Merkel's government legislated last year to overturn a similar commitment on closure made by its centre-left predecessor. But the nuclear accident in Japan and the swelling tide of public protests led to the dropping of the plan to extend the lifespan of 17 nuclear power stations until 2033. What is more, seven old reactors were retired. Chancellor Merkel's bold move clearly derives much confidence from a forward-looking energy plan that emphasises cleaner and better power from natural gas and coal, and an expanded role for renewable energy sources such as solar and wind.
The prospect of doing away with nuclear power has world-wide appeal although the imperatives are not the same in every country. The German story is one of an industrialised society that has no compulsion to meet the energy needs of robust economic growth and rapidly rising living standards. In fact, nuclear energy meets 29 per cent of its needs and now requires alternatives. India, on the other hand, needs a safe and efficient mix of sources to cater to massively expanding demand. It must, in parallel, reduce the energy intensity of growth. The way to go would be to actively cooperate with countries like Germany on building efficient coal-fired power plants, tapping newer technologies such as river turbines, and aggressively expanding solar-based technologies. Multiple options are necessary also to stay aligned to carbon emission goals.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/nuclear-exit/article2068662.ece
2,6,2011,The FIFA family,"A fourth four-year term for 75-year-old Sepp Blatter as president of FIFA, Federation Internationale de Football Association, was not only a vote for continuity. It was also a mandate for reform of world football's governing body. The election at the 61st congress of FIFA in Zurich took place in difficult, unpleasant circumstances with the only other candidate, Asian Football Confederation president Mohamed bin Hammam of Qatar, withdrawing from the race after he was suspended on charges of attempting to bribe member associations to back him. But with Mr. Blatter overcoming an inane bid by the English Football Association to postpone the election on the ground it was a one-horse race, and obtaining the support of an overwhelming majority for his re-election, the focus is now again on the tasks and challenges ahead. England's FA found support back home among British politicians, the media, and the fans — but not in Zurich where it mattered. The seasoned Mr. Blatter knew better than to gloat over his victory. After the election, he spoke of cleaning up administration and promised to steer the ship “back onto the right course in clear, transparent waters.” He pushed for a strengthened FIFA Ethics Committee whose members will now be chosen by the whole congress. With allegations over the bribery bid being met with counter-allegations, the revamped Ethics Committee could infuse greater confidence in the world body's efforts to deal with corruption and malpractice. Mr. Blatter also announced the formation of a high-powered corporate governance and compliance committee, which will be headed by no less than Henry Kissinger. If necessary, an extraordinary congress will be convened to review the findings of the committee and “restore FIFA's credibility.”
One of Mr. Blatter's stand-out achievements, after he took over from Joao Havelange in 1998, is the successful hosting of the World Cup outside of Europe and the Americas. After the first World Cup in Asia (co-hosted by South Korea and Japan in 2002), South Africa 2010 under his presidency was a huge success, not only in terms of the football on display, but also in terms of the organisation of the event. To Mr. Blatter goes the credit of expanding the World Cup to include 32 teams (from 24), and giving a chance to more teams from different continents to compete in the premier event. Thus it was hardly surprising that among the first proposals he got adopted by the congress on his re-election was a radical change in rules, which now give each of the organisation's 208 members a vote in choosing the World Cup host. Mr. Blatter deserves and needs all the support he can get in the efforts to reform FIFA and lead the world's best-loved game to new heights.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-fifa-family/article2071555.ece
2,6,2011,A journalist is silenced,"The killing of Syed Saleem Shahzad is brutal confirmation that Pakistan is the world's most hazardous place for journalists. According to the United States-based Committee to Protect Journalists, in the nine years since the abduction and murder of the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, 32 media professionals have met a violent end, 17 of them in targeted attacks for clear work-related motives. International pressure on Pakistan forced the pace in the investigation of the Pearl case in 2002. But in none of the other murders has anyone been brought to book. It was in this atmosphere of impunity that Shahzad went missing from a well-secured neighbourhood of Islamabad. Two days later, his body, bearing torture marks, surfaced 150 km away. In any conflict, the main threat to journalists is from armed actors, state and non-state. The situation in Pakistan is all the more dangerous given the blurred lines, and linkages, between the two. If the Inter-Services Intelligence is being seen as Suspect No. 1 in this case, it is not without reason. Eight months ago, the journalist who wrote about al-Qaeda and Taliban was summoned to the ISI headquarters for an interview — after he reported that Pakistan had released the Afghan Taliban commander Mullah Baradar, arrested earlier in 2010, to take part in talks. Shahzad notified friends about that meeting, detailing it in an email that he wanted publicised if anything untoward happened to him; he also confided that he had received death threats from ISI officials thrice in the last five years. It is significant that he went missing days after he reported that the Mehran Base attack was carried out in retaliation for a Pakistan Navy crackdown on al-Qaeda sympathisers in its ranks. There have been suggestions that Shahzad, the author of a new book on al-Qaeda, knew details of the Pakistani network that supported Osama bin Laden while he sheltered in Abbottabad.
Pakistan's news media naturally see the Shahzad killing as an unambiguous attempt to intimidate them and silence dissent. The May 1 stealth attack by the U.S. to eliminate bin Laden, and the Mehran attack in which the Navy was savaged by home-grown terrorists, have seen the media shed their usual reluctance to challenge the military and the ISI. It should be natural for an investigation into Shahzad's killing to start with the ISI officials who interviewed him in October 2010. The Pakistani media community must insist on this in order to fix accountability for the journalist's killing. Else the enquiry ordered by Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani will go the way of other such investigations, and the impunity will continue unchecked.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-journalist-is-silenced/article2071554.ece
3,6,2011,Is there a brain cancer risk?,"The World Health Organisation's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has recently classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as “possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B).” The classification is based on increased risk for glioma from increased wireless phone use over a period of time. Glioma is a type of brain cancer that begins in the glial cells that surround and support the nerve cells. The grouping under 2B puts mobile phone use alongside 240 other agents, including low-level magnetic fields, for which evidence of harm is uncertain. IARC has stated that the evidence of carcinogenicity among mobile phone users is “limited.” Though it has found a positive association between mobile phone use and cancer to be “credible,” it notes that the possibility of chance, bias, or other factors playing a role “cannot be ruled out.” Interestingly, the carcinogenic labelling comes a year after the largest case-control study of the problem — WHO's Interphone study, undertaken in 13 countries, involving users with at least ten years' exposure, and published in the International Journal of Epidemiology — found “no increase in risk of glioma with mobile phone use.” Some large-scale studies undertaken in the past have come up with mixed findings. While a 2001 and 2006 follow-up Danish study found no relationship between risk of cancer and long-term mobile phone use among more than 400,000 people, a 2009 Swedish study found increased risk of brain cancer among those who used mobile phones for at least ten years, especially those below 20 years of age.
Unlike gamma rays and X-rays, cell phone radiation is non-ionizing in nature. Radiowaves are not energetic enough to remove electrons or ionize atoms or molecules and hence cannot directly damage cellular DNA. No mechanism has so far been found that can possibly explain the manner in which non-ionizing radiation can cause cumulative effect or DNA damage due to exposure over a period of time. Yet a precautionary approach needs to be adopted, considering the growing number of people, especially very young children, using the phone repeatedly and for long durations. Though countries have already set the upper limit to radiation from mobile phones to reduce the amount of non-ionizing radiation and heat absorbed by tissues, a further lowering of permissible levels may be required. Until such time definite answers are available, it is best that older children are encouraged to restrict mobile phone use and very young children asked to avoid its use. Adults can rely more on texting options and resort to hands-free modes of using mobile phones.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/is-there-a-brain-cancer-risk/article2074464.ece
3,6,2011,Hands off Libya,"It does not portend well that member countries of NATO have given a unanimous extension to its mission in Libya by another 90 days beyond the initial deadline of June 27. This means the air-strikes, which began in March following Resolution 1973 of the United Nations Security Council, will continue. The resolution authorised “all necessary measures” to protect civilians in Libya from a crackdown by Muammar Qadhafi's regime on an anti-government uprising. Air strikes are a strange way to go about protecting civilians — despite all their precision equipment, bombardment by fast-moving aircraft will result in indiscriminate casualties. The Libyan regime claims that 718 civilians have so far been killed and over 4,000 injured in the bombings that began on March 18. If these deaths are proved, the participating powers — the U.S. and its allies in Europe — will have to answer for what amounts to no less than the war crimes a United Nations-ordered investigation has recently accused the Qadhafi government of committing. From the extended timeline, it is clear that the west's real intention in Libya is to use the U.N. resolution to effect a regime change in an oil-rich country. This conclusion is bolstered by the Obama administration's invitation to the Libyan rebel National Transitional Council to set up a representative office in Washington even as the conflict in Libya remains stalemated. The only lesson western powers seem to have learnt from the U.S. folly in Iraq is that invading a country to topple its leader is all right as long as you stick to bombing it from the air.
There is undoubtedly a strong movement against the Libyan strongman within his country, carried by the winds of democracy blowing throughout the West Asia-North Africa region. But it is crucially important that any regime change is brought about by forces within Libya. The Tunisian revolt would not have inspired similar movements in other countries in the region had it been the result of western intervention. Outside intervention, with its own agenda, is sure to rob the movement of its momentum and indeed legitimacy. That self-interest, not democracy, is at the top of this agenda is evident, else why would the U.S. be so unabashedly non-supportive of a similar movement in Bahrain? Colonel Qadhafi is no longer in complete control of the country; defections are depleting his coterie; diplomatically he is at a dead-end even on his home turf after the failure of a mediation effort by the African Union. But for this to move towards a positive conclusion, the west must take its hands off Libya. The air strikes must end, and the people of Libya must be left to determine their own destiny.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/hands-off-libya/article2074462.ece
6,6,2011,The UPA's political bankruptcy,"The midnight police swoop on yoga exponent and telestar ‘Baba' Ramdev and his supporters was arbitrary, brutal, and anti-democratic. A peaceful assembly had suddenly been set upon and tens of innocent people injured for no fault of their own. “No government has reached out as much as ours,” negotiating Minister Kapil Sibal had boasted on the eve of the action. “But if we can reach out, we can also rein in.” Mr. Sibal mis-spoke: what he meant perhaps was ‘No government has the capacity to lurch from one extreme to the other as our government.' First, it reached out to Shri Ramdev in a way that was indistinguishable from obsequiousness, with four Ministers led by the second-ranking Cabinet Minister, Pranab Mukherjee, abandoning all semblance of dignity by going to the airport to receive a man who has since been denounced as a ‘cheat' and a ‘thug' by a senior Congress leader, Digvijay Singh. The message that immediately went out was that given the anti-corruption mood in the country, the Manmohan Singh government was desperate to fend off further political trouble. It then negotiated in secret with Shri Ramdev, supposedly to get on top of the huge and complex issue of India's black or dirty money — which is parked in tax havens, exploits the offshore system that is analysed powerfully in Nicholas Shaxson's book, Treasure Islands: Tax Havens and the Men Who Stole the World (The Bodley Head, London, 2011), and has figured in global reports and in releases of secret banking records by WikiLeaks that provide a foretaste of what is to come. The message sent out by the midnight police action at New Delhi's Ramlila Maidan was profoundly anti-democratic: for those who won't ‘reach out' to the government by doing a backroom deal, the ‘reining in' will be by teargas and police lathis, fists, and boots.
A quick look at Shri Ramdev's charter of demands reveals that many of them are bizarre or over-the-top or don't fit into India's constitutional scheme. His mobilisation has brought in large numbers of people who are sincere in their detestation of corruption — and also communal elements and reactionaries. But every Act and Scene of the tragicomedy, L'affaire Ramdev, has exposed the political bankruptcy of the United Progressive Alliance government when it comes to dealing with the issues of corruption, ministerial misconduct, and abuse of power. Beleaguered by a multitude of corruption scandals dominated by the 2G-spectrum allocation scam, it has earned the reputation for being the most corrupt dispensation independent India has seen. On top of this, by lurching from one extreme to another in unprincipled and anti-democratic fashion, it has miscalculated badly and landed in a deeper mess.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-upas-political-bankruptcy/article2079404.ece
6,6,2011,Ridding the world of a terrible virus,"In 1977, a 23-year-old cook at a hospital in Somalia who caught smallpox and survived became the last naturally occurring case of the disease. Three years later, in May 1980, the World Health Assembly, the supreme decision-making body of the World Health Organisation, declared that “the world and all its people have won freedom from smallpox.” No disease has ever been so instantly recognised or so widely known and feared, wrote D.A. Henderson, the man who led the worldwide eradication effort, in his book about the arduous campaign to immunise people in every part of the globe and its ultimate success. Thirty smallpox-free years later, we need to remember that even in the early 1950s this highly contagious disease was infecting 50 million people worldwide annually, killing up to a third of them in a horrible fashion.
Although smallpox is now seen as a scourge of yesteryear, the terrible virus that caused it is still very much around. The last stocks of the virus, running to hundreds of strains collected worldwide, are now held in only two high-security laboratories, one in the United States, the other in Russia. While many developing countries where the disease was once endemic want those stocks destroyed, the U.S., in particular, has been dragging its feet. It argues that those viruses are needed for research to develop better vaccines and anti-viral drugs. Such research, it says, is necessary in case rogue states or terrorists use undeclared stocks of the virus as bioweapons. In a letter published in the journal Science in 1994, Nobel laureate David Baltimore observed: “I doubt that we so desperately need to study smallpox that it would be worth the risk inherent in experimentation.” Much the same research could be achieved by studying related viruses. A WHO-appointed group of independent experts, who submitted their comments in December 2010, pointed out that closely related viruses could be used on surrogate animal models to study disease-causing mechanisms as well as drug and vaccine efficacy. If there is indeed a threat of smallpox being reintroduced, what the world needs is not more research with the actual virus but a sufficient global stockpile of vaccine that can be deployed in such an emergency. The WHO currently possesses a grossly inadequate 32 million doses of vaccine. The just-concluded World Health Assembly, while reaffirming the commitment to destroying all remaining stocks of the smallpox virus after crucial research had been completed, has kicked the can down the road. The issue is to be looked at again three years hence. Will this be the last reprieve granted to a virus that has caused so much havoc in the world?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ridding-the-world-of-a-terrible-virus/article2079405.ece
7,6,2011,Sound policy shift,"The Uttar Pradesh government's new land acquisition policy, announced in the face of farmers' protests and impending elections, is a significant improvement over existing practices. It is sounder than the amendments to the central Act proposed by the UPA government, which have been awaiting enactment since 2007. Poor compensation calculated on rates based on the pre-development phase, a lack of consultation, and cumbersome procedures have marred the whole business of land acquisition across India. Unlike land acquired for public projects such as construction of roads, the state-enabled forcible takeover of farmland to promote private development has been strongly and rightfully challenged. The Mayawati government has commendably attempted to address some of these issues. First, the government will henceforth not directly involve itself in acquiring land for private developers. Secondly, the acquisition will not proceed without 70 per cent of the farmers consenting to the project. Thirdly, on top of the cash compensation, 16 per cent of the developed land will be given to them. In the case of land acquired for roads and canals, each affected family will be provided with a job, along with shares in the development company. These new measures are to be implemented prospectively. This means, the farmers of Bhatta-Parsaul villages who started the agitation will, unfortunately, not benefit from them.
The new policy, which sensitively integrates compensation with rehabilitation, paves the way for consensus-building. However, there is scope for improvement. For instance, the percentage of allotment of developed land need not be a fixed figure; it can be related to the extent of the impact of a project and the scale of acquisition involved. Small farmers may find it difficult to handle complicated share transactions, so simplified procedures must be put in place. Alternatives to land acquisition also need to be encouraged. For example, a study of international land acquisition practices has shown that land readjustment followed in countries such as Japan and South Korea is an alternative worth considering. This system encourages landowners to collectively negotiate land transfers and seek either land-for-land exchange or other forms of stake-holding and compensation. In India, land and development are State subjects but acquisition of land falls under the Concurrent List. The central Land Acquisition Act, 1894 is the legal instrument that is widely used by many State governments. The Mayawati government's change of course is a reminder to the UPA that the central Act needs comprehensive and urgent change — placing equity and justice at the centre of the process.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sound-policy-shift/article2082410.ece
7,6,2011,The Emperor of Clay,"Considered by many to be the greatest clay-court tennis player of all time, Rafael Nadal strengthened his case after winning his sixth French Open and tying Bjorn Borg, his only rival for the title. The two champions share several traits. Much like Borg did during his aborted career (he played his last major at 25), Nadal has dominated the red dirt utilising a style based on incredible athleticism and furious topspin. But while Borg's and Nadal's formidable physical prowess cannot be understated — clay, like grass but in a different way, rewards the superior athlete — it's their tremendous mental resolve that set them apart. It's this attribute that was most discernible at Paris this year. The 25-year-old's sixth Roland Garros title didn't feature the overwhelming form that characterised his previous successes. He even admitted to not feeling his best, which the locker-room immediately picked up on. But though he played more cautiously, trying to compensate for the sort of inconsistency he hasn't had to overcome in the past, he found a way to win. Roger Federer did him a favour in stopping Novak Djokovic, who during an astonishing 41-match streak in 2011 had defeated Nadal in two clay-court finals. Djokovic would have known, however, that beating Nadal in a best-of-three-sets match is markedly different from conquering him over five sets.
Federer's renaissance was the other story of the men's event. The Swiss master produced passages of transcendental brilliance in making the final, his victory over Djokovic an exhibition of judicious, sparkling attack. Federer began similarly against Nadal, getting to within a point of winning the first set; his fight-back to win the third set had even Rafa admitting that when Roger was in that touch, no one had a chance. But Federer couldn't sustain those levels, and the contest broke down into the familiar pattern of clay-court matches between the two great champions. The Spaniard's victory was his sixth in eight Grand Slam finals against Federer. It took Nadal's record at Roland Garros to 45-1 and his winning percentage on clay to 92.65. The corresponding numbers for Borg are 49-2 and 86.27. There isn't much between the two. But the world number one has the opportunity to settle the debate if he can stay fit over the next five years. While Rafa's triumph was an occurrence the French crowd has grown accustomed to, they had the delight of a surprise winner the previous day. China's Li Na became the first Asian player to win a Grand Slam singles title. Breaking through demands both independent thought and indomitable spirit, and 29-year-old Li proved she has reserves of both.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-emperor-of-clay/article2082412.ece
8,6,2011,Greening India,"The National Mission for a Green India with a planned investment of $10.3 billion over the next 10 years can have a major developmental impact in more ways than one. Such a massive exercise can raise fresh natural capital that is so vital for the tens of millions of people who depend on degraded forests. It can meet the twin objectives of assigning forest land to tribal and other forest-dwelling communities to enable livelihoods, and relieving extractive pressures on core dense forests to aid conservation of wildlife and biodiversity. The overarching benefit to the environment will be in the form of carbon sequestration to combat climate change. The Ministry of Environment and Forests, which has grasped the imperative to balance these concerns, aims to add an impressive five million hectares of forest cover, and also improve the quality of forests over a similar area. The experience gained from the Joint Forest Management (JFM) programmes of the past will be invaluable. The JFM measures did not live up to their promise in most States and, in some cases, existed only on paper. In the main, they left forest communities feeling alienated. That nearly 40 per cent of open forest remains degraded today reinforces the need for a vastly improved management system.
A central role for local communities in forest restoration and expansion is envisaged under the new plan. This can help correct the historical imbalance in their role in managing the commons. It must be emphasised, however, that the whole exercise needs to be rooted in scientific practices. Several dedicated young scientists have been working in degraded areas of the Western Ghats to re-introduce endemic plants. These conservation groves, often sitting cheek-by-jowl with plantations and habitations, shelter a lot of endangered animals and birds. This shows that many more eroded ecosystems can harbour the biodiversity that is under pressure. The potential to expand horticulture in these sites, including disused mines, through fruit tree cultivation is worth exploring. Local communities can also be involved in the campaign to control invasive plant species that have been unthinkingly introduced into the environment. These plants suppress indigenous varieties and have overrun vast tracts of forests, reducing their productivity. Overall, the Green India plan, which is expected to provide a higher forest-based livelihood income to three million households, is significant for its attempt to give people a central role in restoring forest health. The legacy of mistrust between the Forest departments and tribal communities must give way to a joint management framework that is grounded in good conservation science.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/greening-india/article2085376.ece
8,6,2011,Inconclusive exit in Yemen,"After months of dodging promises to step down, President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen has exited — in a somewhat unexpected manner — after being wounded in rocket fire by opposition forces targeting the presidential palace in Sana'a. While his departure has led to rejoicing in Yemen, the next steps in a volatile country where al- Qaeda is feared to have a significant presence are far from clear. From January 2011, anti-government street protests put increasing pressure on Mr. Saleh to remit office. It is unlikely that the Yemen strongman, who ruled for 33 years beginning as the President of North Yemen in 1978, will return to his country from Saudi Arabia where he was flown for treatment of his wounds. Even if he overcomes his injuries, Saudi Arabia, which shares a border with Yemen and is nervous that the protests in its neighbourhood may spread to its soil if not ended swiftly, will do everything to prevent his return. An indication of this came with the Saudi regime joining the United States in the call for the swift implementation of a Gulf Cooperation Council plan for a transition in Yemen. The GCC plan envisages Mr. Saleh's resignation in return for immunity for himself and his family members, and a caretaker government that will hold parliamentary elections within 90 days. Three times he accepted the plan only to change his mind at the last minute, setting his forces on the protesters, raising the spectre of a civil war as Yemen's fractious tribes joined the fighting on both sides. It may be easier now to persuade him to sign on the dotted line. Indeed, the first step in the plan, handing over the reins of government to the Vice-President, has already been accomplished with his exit. But Mr. Saleh's family members remain in charge, with control of the intelligence service and the Army. Making them cede power peacefully may not be easy.
In these circumstances, a democratic election is hardly in sight. Unlike in other countries touched by the “jasmine revolution,” the mass protests in Yemen do seem to have an identifiable leadership. Initially propelled by youth and ordinary people, the movement could not have survived six months but for the backing of an important opposition leader from a rival tribe, Hamid Al Ahmar, a telecom tycoon who is said to have funded the protests. His brothers are also key figures in the movement. An important military general also defected and has claimed to support the protests. What is of concern here is that their opposition to the Saleh regime is based more on tribal and personal rivalries than on any commitment to democratic values. If Yemen is at the cusp of real change, it is as yet hard to see.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/inconclusive-exit-in-yemen/article2085373.ece
9,6,2011,From Ram to Ramdev,"For much of the past year, the Bharatiya Janata Party gave the appearance of being in deep slumber — this even as the world all but crashed around the scam and scandal-hit United Progressive Alliance. With the principal Opposition party seemingly unable or unwilling to take on its chief adversary, the vacuum was being filled by a host of non-political actors. However, last week saw the BJP hit the political tarmac in a burst of iridescent energy. With Baba Ramdev's Ramlila maidan protest blowing up in the face of the Manmohan Singh government, Sushma Swaraj jived to celebratory music on the lawns of the Rajghat. Simultaneously, BJP spokespersons hauled the Congress over the coals and yesteryear's poster woman Uma Bharti returned with the mandate to re-ignite Uttar Pradesh. It is anybody's guess, however, if all of this adds up to a refurbished, battle-ready BJP. Indeed, there is a desperation evident in the way it has latched on to the yoga guru, hoping no doubt that when the time comes, Baba Ramdev will walk into the sunset, bequeathing his vast constituency of supporters to the BJP.
This is a serious miscalculation because what Baba Ramdev has done is to seize the oppositional space that, as matters stand in Parliament, rightfully belongs to the BJP. It was Lal Krishna Advani who first made a case for the repatriation of overseas black money. Yet in an unbeatable irony, the BJP allowed the issue to be hijacked by Ramdev. The party's national executive meeting in Lucknow did not throw up a single fresh or innovative idea; instead the party showcased Atal Bihari Vajpayee and recycled many of the old shibboleths. Surely, the BJP does not expect Ms Bharti to wrest U.P. by rabble-rousing on Ayodhya, an issue that no longer resonates with voters, young or old. Consider the BJP's electoral performance. It won only a total of five seats in the recent Assembly elections. It has had only one good showing in the two years since the UPA returned to power — in Bihar. But then, the party owed its phenomenal success there more to the political stock and charisma of Nitish Kumar than to any achievement of its own. The BJP has currently only three dependable allies — the Shiv Sena, the Shiromani Akali Dal, and the Janata Dal (United). The immediate challenge before the party is to expand its own base while striving to bring on board estranged alliance partners. None of this will be possible if it hitches its wagons to Baba Ramdev, who admittedly touched a chord when he spoke on black money. Yet he also thought nothing of inviting the infamous Sadhvi Rithambara to share the stage with him. The BJP has one of two options: either it reinvents itself to meet the aspirations of the new generation or it speaks in a bygone idiom and plods a lonely path.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/from-ram-to-ramdev/article2088173.ece
9,6,2011,The ethanol imperative,"India's ethanol blending programme (EBP) for petrol has remained in limbo for too long. The government mandated 5 per cent blending in September 2006; raised the level to 10 per cent in October 2007; and made such blending compulsory in October 2008. Further, in 2008, the Cabinet approved the National Policy on Biofuel, which envisaged blending of biofuels with petrol and diesel to a level of 20 per cent by 2017. Yet, owing to conflicting views among the Ministries of Chemicals and Fertilizers, Agriculture, and Petroleum and Natural Gas, and the reluctance of some State governments to require sugar units to make available adequate quantities of ethanol for the fuel industry — given the more lucrative options offered by the liquor industry — the oil marketing companies have failed to achieve even 5 per cent blending countrywide. Now, adding to the haze, the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council has reportedly questioned the rationale behind mandatory blending. Reopening the debate on ethanol blending will amount to undermining a progressive policy decision that conforms to the way much of the world is going as fossil fuel options shrink. That the EBP can improve the country's energy security and reduce its carbon footprint needs no restating. That there is enough ethanol to go round is also clear. The challenge is to manage and change the sectoral allocations of ethanol. The sugar industry should be encouraged to balance the needs of the fuel industry with those of the potable alcohol and chemical sectors.
The Economic Advisory Council seems to have concluded that the main advantage derived from the EBP would be to the sugar industry, and this could not be a credible objective for the government to push through the blending programme. In India, a large proportion of available ethanol comes as a byproduct from cane molasses during sugar production. But over the longer term, if ethanol derived from a cash crop such as sugarcane does not seem a viable option in terms of price and availability, other sources should be tapped. India's agri-diversity and wasteland availability offer several options. There have been worthwhile initiatives, including processes using jatropha, seaweed, and cellulose waste from agri-forestry; these should be supported by investment in R&D. If feedstock rationalisation is made possible, the blending programme will be a success. Rejecting retrogressive counsel from no-changers, the government must push ahead with a programme that has been found to be virtuous wherever it has been tried earnestly.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-ethanol-imperative/article2088170.ece
10,6,2011,A terrorism turning point?,"Ever since Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in Islamabad with a check-list of counter-terrorism actions the United States expects in return for shoring up Pakistan's flailing state, the strife-torn country's army seems to have made a significant turn in the war on terror. Muhammad Ilyas Kashmiri, an al-Qaeda linked jihadist commander who is alleged to have planned a series of terror plots targeting India and the west, was reported killed in a drone strike soon after Ms Clinton's visit. Pakistani media have since reported that the army would soon launch operations targeting jihadist bases in North Waziristan, from where Kashmiri and other jihadists have launched a string of attacks targeting the country and the west. Humanitarian agencies, in turn, are said to be preparing for the inevitable exodus of refugees. Less than a month ago, Pakistan was demanding a cessation of drone strikes, following the death of 44 tribal elders in a bombing in March. Although their lethal operations have steadily increased over the past few weeks, Islamabad has been silent. Osama bin-Laden's killing in Abottabad and the suspicions of the Pakistani state's complicity in his presence there appear to have radically limited the military's ability to resist U.S. pressure.
The Pakistan-U.S. pas de deux, however, remains a fraught one: each partner fears, not without reason, that the other has a knife held to their back. First, there is the matter of Kashmiri's fate. The Brigade 313 commander has emerged from the grave before — in 2009 — mocking at reports of his death. Rehman Malik, Pakistan's Interior Minister, has said he is “98 per cent” certain that Kashmiri was dead; he did not explain the source of his arithmetic exactitude. Maulvi Nazir, a jihadist commander, has also confirmed his death — but it bears mention that he has been fighting alongside Pakistan's armed forces to expel the Uzbek, Chechen, and Arab jihadists Kashmiri cultivated. Local residents of the Ghwa Khwa area, where Kashmiri is said to have been killed, are reported to have no knowledge of his presence in the area; Brigade 313 itself has been silent. Even if Kashmiri's death is confirmed, and proves a precursor to a full-scale assault in North Waziristan, the results are uncertain. Islamabad's public declaration of intent has given time for jihadist cadre to melt into villages, and across the Afghan border. Insurgents linked to Jalaluddin Haqqani, an Afghan warlord with close links to Pakistan's intelligence services, have vacated the area in anticipation of the offensive. Pakistan's military establishment, for its part, fears that acceding to the U.S.'s calls will accelerate armed conflict between Islamist insurgents and the state. Like so many other purported turning points in the war against terror, this one too could prove to lead nowhere.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-terrorism-turning-point/article2091316.ece
10,6,2011,Gajah in panic,"The episode of a young wild elephant straying into Mysore and killing a man is a tragic instance of rising conflict between the large free-ranging animals and people. Although the elephant is a beloved symbol of India's heritage, inspiring love, reverence, and fear, about 400 people and a hundred elephants lose their lives in these incidents annually. Just as people are terrified at the sight of a powerful mammal running wild, an elephant separated from its herd panics when it faces aggressive crowds. The unfortunate outcome should stir States out of their complacency, and they need not look far. In its report titled “Gajah: Securing the Future for Elephants in India” released last year, the Elephant Task Force of the Ministry of Environment and Forests, offers some clear ideas on how elephant-human conflict can be mitigated. The Karnataka government has done well to alleviate the financial distress of the family of the man killed. The long-term strategy must address several well-recognised issues that pit humans against elephants.
Female elephants live in highly cohesive clans and, research shows, the clans adopt distinct home ranges. The available knowledge on the ecology of these long-ranging animals makes it clear that any good strategy to avoid conflict must start with reduction of habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation. Often, new settlements or encroachments in the movement corridors of elephants result in violent confrontation. Lost habitat compels the animals to deviate from traditional pathways, in search of water and food. It is vital to use advanced technologies such as high-resolution satellite imagery to monitor and protect the habitat of elephants in all landscapes, particularly in corridors. Guarding crops against raiding will help in bringing down human-elephant encounters that provoke retaliatory killing. In Mysore, the panic escalated after live television coverage brought more crowds to the streets, creating greater fear in the animal. It is precisely such contingencies that an area-specific Conflict Management Task Force, an agency recommended by experts, should focus on. The MoEF has got off to a good start by committing itself to the creation of a National Elephant Conservation Authority. The central government must act to provide sufficient funding for it under the Twelfth Plan, taking into account that elephant protection could not advance much during the previous Plan for want of resources.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/gajah-in-panic/article2091315.ece
11,6,2011,A small step towards justice,"Pakistani-Canadian businessman Tahawwur Husain Rana's conviction this week on charges of providing material support for the Lashkar-e-Taiba marks a small step towards justice for the 164 men, women, and children whose lives were taken in Mumbai on November 26, 2008. Instead of taking what satisfaction can be had from the fact that a small cog in the jihadist machine that delivered death to the city is now likely to live out the rest of his life in prison, Indians across the political spectrum have been outraged by the decision of the twelve-member jury to acquit Rana of having played a direct role in facilitating the attack. Even before sentencing has been pronounced, the government voiced “disappointment,” while Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi proclaimed that the Chicago verdict “disgraced India's sovereignty.” India's anger that Rana was acquitted of charges related to the Mumbai attack is understandable: the wounds the country suffered in the tragedy will take a long, long time to heal. The outrage and anger are also misplaced.
Evidence directly connecting Rana to the massacre in Mumbai, as this newspaper repeatedly pointed out in its coverage of the trial, fell some distance short of the exacting standards needed to establish guilt in a criminal trial. Pakistani-American jihadist David Headley, who carried out reconnaissance in Mumbai for the Lashkar under the cover of Rana's immigration business, said he had informed his associate of his plans in advance. Little corroboration could be found, however, for this claim. Indeed, Rana's lawyers plausibly argued that a man with foreknowledge of that terrorist operation was extremely unlikely to have put his children, his wife, and himself in harm's way by visiting Mumbai just when the attack was about to take place. Prosecutors were able to demonstrate that Rana was aware of Headley's mission in Mumbai, and acted to facilitate it — part of the larger body of evidence that led to the businessman's conviction for providing material support to the Lashkar and plotting to stage fresh attacks in Europe and India. They could not, however, establish beyond reasonable doubt that Rana actually had a hands-on role in the carnage. U. K. Bansal, the Secretary responsible for internal security at the Ministry of Home Affairs, has said the National Investigation Agency would now consider filing charges against Rana. New Delhi has also said it might consider seeking Rana's extradition. Precisely what this course of action would achieve is unclear: unless compelling new evidence is found, an Indian court will probably arrive at the same conclusions. It would be wise, instead, to focus on the real challenge: pushing Pakistan to complete the prosecution of the suspects it has arrested, and to act against the key perpetrators it has so far shown no willingness to act against.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-small-step-towards-justice/article2094014.ece
11,6,2011,Husain and the idea of India,"The death of 97-year-old Maqbool Fida Husain represents the passing of many things – of the country's most celebrated artist, of a genius who created a unique visual language by combining the grammar of European modernism with the idiom of India's cultural syncretism, of a man of the world who was as comfortable in his red Ferrari as he was walking barefoot through a city's streets, of a free spirit whose humility and generosity never failed to touch anyone who knew him. His remarkable journey from humble origins to become a name virtually synonymous with Indian contemporary art has only added to the legend that he was. Although he was tutored briefly by N. S. Bendre in Indore and mentored by Francis Newton Souza as a co-founder of the Progressive Artists' Group in Mumbai, his real apprenticeship was with poverty. He was largely self-taught and his success as an artist owed in no small measure to his determination to find the free time to pursue his passion while making ends meet as a cinema billboard painter in Mumbai. He had a natural flair as well as an instinctive liking for the country's folk and mythological traditions, for the patterns of its everyday life, and for the varied manifestations of its syncretism – all of which found expression in a dizzying range of canvases. He lived in and for his art, which he repeatedly showed would not bow down before the dictates of narrow-minded, petty men.
It is a tragedy that someone so rooted to this land, who at the time of his death was working on a major project on the history of Indian civilisation, was hounded out of this country. It is a national shame that he was subject to an orchestrated and mischievous controversy over some of his paintings, violent and communally inspired attacks on his residence, exhibitions and museum, and harassed by a string of vexatious criminal court cases; and that the legal and political system failed to protect him. It is doubtful that those who vilified him for certain paintings of Hindu goddesses knew or cared half as much about Hindu mythology, iconography, and folklore as Husain did. Their bigoted campaign was not merely an attack against a great artist; it was an assault, to use Sunil Khilnani's evocative phrase, on the idea of India. Although Husain was obliged to make Dubai and London his home during the last five years of his life and died in London as a Qatar national, nobody could take his Indianness away from him. He was a citizen of the world who was proud of his roots – of the land and people he loved best.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/husain-and-the-idea-of-india/article2094015.ece
13,6,2011,Radiation and thyroid cancer,"The frequency of papillary thyroid carcinoma occurrence in young people is about 1.5 per million a year. But following the 1986 Chernobyl calamity a sudden 100-fold increase was seen in its occurrence in Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. In all, nearly 6,000 people developed thyroid cancer; about 4,000 of them had been children or adolescents at the time of the accident. But how does one distinguish naturally occurring thyroid cancer from that caused by radiation? A paper published recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (“Gain of chromosome band 7q11 in papillary thyroid carcinomas of young patients is associated with exposure to low-dose radiation,” by Julia Heb et al.) provides the answer. Radiation-specific signature in a particular region of chromosome 7 was found in people who were exposed to radioactive Iodine-131 due to the Chernobyl accident. Changes in the number or structure of chromosome 7 were found to be associated with human cancers. While five genes have been identified as tumour-associated candidates, over-expression of one gene serves as a signature of radiation-induced tumour. While none of the patients from the control groups showed any change in the specific region on chromosome 7, 39 per cent of those exposed to radiation carried the signature. The study, which used samples obtained from the Chernobyl Tissue Bank, covered a cohort of 52 radiation-exposed patients and a validation cohort of 28 radiation-exposed patients. The age-matched control groups had no exposure to radiation. Since only a subgroup of those exposed to radiation carried the signature, the scientists postulate the existence of other typical genetic markers.
Unlike other cancers, radiation-induced papillary thyroid carcinoma is easily preventable. Radioisotope Iodine-131, which has a half-life of eight days and the same physical properties as stable iodine, competes with it, and the thyroid gland has no way of telling them apart. Saturating the gland with stable iodine drugs taken as a prophylactic and avoiding the consumption of milk can prevent Iodine-131 from entering the gland. Such preventive steps are extremely important in the case of children. These measures, which were unfortunately not taken after the Chernobyl accident, have been adopted post-Fukushima. The new study should serve as a warning to people running nuclear plants that in the light of what we now know about radiation exposure and thyroid cancer, any delay in taking preventive steps will be extremely costly in terms of human lives and well-being.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Radiation-and-thyroid-cancer/article13832945.ece
13,6,2011,Syria on the boil,"In a January 2011 interview to The Wall Street Journal, Bashar al Assad declared that the “jasmine revolution” was the result of stagnation in the region — “if you have stagnant water, you will have pollution and microbes.” Countries in the region had failed to bring changes in keeping with the world, he argued. But the Syrian President put his own country outside of that stagnation, asserting that while political reforms and economic growth were both necessary to keep people contended, one reason for the stability in his country was that it stood firmly against the United States — “it is about the ideology, the beliefs and the cause that you have.” Clearly, he was out of touch. Since March, the country has been in the grip of a people's uprising in which, unsurprisingly in this prolonged “Arab spring,” the main demands are democracy and freedom from four decades of rule by the Assad family. Syrians are questioning why they cannot have reform and be part of the “resistance” in the region against the U.S. and Israel. The regime in Syria responded initially by offering carrots. Twice, Mr. Assad, who inherited his position after the death of his father Hafez Al Assad in 2000, promised political reforms; the country's Emergency laws were lifted. But the promises were belied with the Syrian regime unleashing a series of repressive measures. Over 1,000 people are believed to have been killed in these counter-measures; thousands more are said to be in jail. Though it seemed at times that the Ba'athist regime had managed to suppress the movement, the 150 deaths reported between June 3 and 6 might prove to be the turning point in this uprising. Especially so if reports are true that the Army massacred 120 soldiers in Jisr al Shoghour to prevent them from defecting; this suggests serious disaffection in the armed forces, contrary to claims by the regime that the soldiers were killed by “armed gangs.”
Mr. Assad has lost important friends in the last few days. Within the region, only Iran stands by him, while others have been critical, albeit for their own reasons, for his high-handedness in handling the protests. France, which, earlier this year, helped end Syria's international isolation, has declared that the Assad regime has lost its legitimacy. It is now the main force, along with the United Kingdom, behind a proposed United Nations Security Council resolution criticising Syria for using force against civilians. But the idea of a resolution itself is questionable, although, unlike the resolution on Libya, this does not call for a military intervention. Any attempt to meddle in the happenings in Syria can only undermine the legitimacy of the protesters' demands.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/syria-on-the-boil/article2099126.ece
14,6,2011,Opec dynamics and India,"Microeconomic theory has long predicted the demise of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the 12-nation cartel that attempts to regulate the output of its members in the hope of meeting a higher target price than would otherwise prevail if each produced as much as it wanted. Economists say cartels are inherently unstable because their members have a tendency to “chisel,” increasing output by a little to make windfall revenue gains at the artificially high price. As each country chisels, hoping it is the only one, the market is flooded with extra supply and the cartel ends up collapsing. However, since its founding in 1960, Opec has always managed to confound the textbooks. This is because oil is not any old widget or commodity. It is the world's most important source of tradable energy. That is why politics and geopolitics drive global oil markets as much as crude economics. At its most recent meeting in Vienna, Opec's largest member, Saudi Arabia, in tandem with “price doves” Kuwait, the UAE, and Qatar asked for an expansion of global oil supplies so that the rise in oil prices caused by the western war against Libya could be moderated. This push was resisted by Iran, Iraq, Venezuela, and others. Defeated, the Saudis later said this was Opec's worst meeting ever.
In the textbook case, a cartel can survive if the largest member cuts back its own output to accommodate the increased sales of the chiselers. But in the real world, where “unreasonably high” oil prices end up making alternative energy sources more attractive, the largest member has to increase its output if it wants to save the club. This is precisely what Saudi Arabia has done. By announcing a 10-million-barrel-a-day increase in output, Riyadh has managed to rein in the benchmark Brent price, which was headed towards $125 a barrel. But Saudi benevolence has its limits, especially given the popular ferment now under way in West Asia and North Africa. If oil prices fall by too much, that may undermine the ability of the sheikhs to buy peace with their restive subjects. For India, the dynamics inside Opec are at best a sideshow. Its own quest for energy security must continue with equal priority to pushing the three Es: Exploration of oil and gas at home, the purchase of Equity oil abroad, and maximum Efficiency in domestic consumption. The Libya war is also a reminder of the need to speed up the creation of our own strategic petroleum reserve to tide over short-term market disruptions. In addition, India can learn a lesson or two from countries that pursue a more independent course than it does in international relations so that they can maximise their strengths and special advantages.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/opec-dynamics-and-india/article2101863.ece
14,6,2011,Silencing the media,"Jyotirmoy Dey, Editor, Special Investigation, Mid-Day, was not the first journalist to be shot dead this year in India. Umesh Rajput from the Hindi daily, Nai Duniya, was killed near Raipur in Chhattisgarh on January 23, and earlier on December 20, 2010 Sushil Pathak of Dainik Bhaskar in Bilaspur. In 2011 alone, there have been 14 instances of attacks on journalists according to a report from ‘The Free Speech Hub' of thehoot.org. On May 19, Dey's colleague Tarakant Dwivedi was arrested under the Official Secrets Act by the Government Railway Police (GRP) for an article written over a year ago in another newspaper on the poor storage conditions of hi-tech weapons bought after the 26/11 attack. However, the gunning down of Dey in broad daylight by four unidentified men has rattled a media inured to gangland killings. The police believe it was ‘the work of professionals,' presumably hired guns connected to the underworld. But the big question is who was behind the killing and so far no one has been arrested. Journalists and media-houses have been attacked with impunity and since the 1990s cases have dragged on forever without any convictions. Coming to Mr. Dwivedi's aid after his arrest, Dey had met Maharashtra Home Minister R.R. Patil and called attention to a rather sensitive Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) report on the mafia-police nexus. The incident underscores the need for some kind of special protection for journalists covering the mafia and conducting investigations on their own. Dey had reported on diesel adulteration in a big way and on alleged links between the mafia and the police.
The Maharashtra government has been promising a law that makes attacks on journalists a non-bailable offence. That may not be the solution. It is crucial to implement existing laws and make sure the guilty are punished. Dey was no stranger to threats and took them head on. His death last Saturday comes soon after a gruesome murder of four men, turning the spotlight back on the pathetic law enforcement in Mumbai. The underworld in the city now is complemented by a powerful builders' lobby, which allegedly has a measure of political and official patronage. Dey's murder can have a chilling effect on the media and to ensure that journalists truly have space and freedom of expression, the government needs to be much more attentive to crime, the factors behind it, and its links, if any, with sections of the official establishment. The state should conduct a transparent and speedy investigation into Dey's murder and, belying its dismal track record, demonstrate that at least now it means business.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/silencing-the-media/article2101861.ece
15,6,2011,The Erdogan effect,"It was fully expected that Turkey's voters would return Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) for a third consecutive term. This success owes to the AKP's achievements in its nearly decade-long rule. With Mr. Erdogan at the helm, the country has undergone a successful economic transformation. At 9 per cent, it boasts the world's second highest growth after China. The 74 million-strong nation has a new confidence, an outcome of its political and economic stability. Turkey's foreign policy now has a mind of its own, giving it a higher profile on the international stage; while the Erdogan government remains committed to integration with Europe, the long wait for admission into the European Union has led Turkey into creating a place for itself in the West Asian region through vigorous engagement with its immediate neighbours. The result of the June 12 parliamentary election indicates national appreciation for many of AKP's policies. But not all of them. While the AKP took nearly 50 per cent of the vote, the result falls far short of the two-thirds it was seeking in order to be empowered to make unilateral amendments to the Constitution. Indeed, the party has won 15 fewer seats in the 550-seat Parliament than in 2007, this time's tally of 326 falling four short of the number required for putting proposed constitutional changes to a vote in a national referendum.
Prime Minister Erdogan must now seek political consensus for the reforms he has in mind. Considering the implications, this is just as well. From the time it first came to power in 2002, the conservative AKP, with a vision rooted in political Islam, made clear it did not embrace the strict secularism bequeathed by Turkey's founder Attaturk Mustapha Kemal. Much of the debate since then has revolved around the headscarf; in the last few years, the cloth, once strictly barred from the public sphere, has made a comeback. Last year, backed by a referendum, the government succeeded in changing the Constitution to make the military — a stern guardian of the Kemalist vision — more accountable to the government. Marginalising the military was a move that won wide backing and praise. But Turkey remains deeply divided on the role of religion in nation-building, as it is about switching to a French-style executive Presidency, which could perpetuate Mr. Erdogan's rule after his last term as Prime Minister. His enthusiasm for constitutional change is bound to be tempered by the results. Rather, with as many as 35 pro-Kurdish representatives in the new parliament, the Erdogan government will need to pay more attention to the longstanding demands of the Kurdish ethnic group.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-Erdogan-effect/article13835200.ece
15,6,2011,Believe it or not,"If our knowledge of the number of unicellular and multicellular organisms found in the soil and in water bodies is incomplete, what we know about organisms thriving in subsurface environment is sketchy. The discovery of living multicellular nematodes or roundworms belonging to three different species, and the DNA of a fourth species, at depths ranging from 0.9 km to 3.6 km from the Earth's surface, has extended the known boundaries of Earth's biosphere. Before this discovery, scientists had harvested only unicellular bacteria from similar depths. One of the nematodes is a new species. It has been named Halicephalobus mephisto by the authors of a paper published recently in Nature (“Nematoda from the terrestrial deep subsurface of South Africa,” by G. Borgonie et al.) The half-a-millimetre-long worms were recovered from the fracture water in three deep gold mines in the Witwatersrand basin near Johannesburg. The fracture water, which is different from mining water, flows from deep cracks in the Earth's crust and so is free from any contamination. According to carbon-14 dating, the facture water is 3,000 to 12,000 years old.
Unicellular and multicellular extremophiles have been found from unexpected and highly inhospitable conditions, including volcanic vents in mid-oceanic ridges, and below Antarctic ice sheets at a depth of about 180 metres. Although roundworms are well known for their physiological tolerance — surviving in a state of suspended animation or anabiosis for prolonged periods of time and metabolising aerobically even in low-oxygen conditions — their subsurface presence has still taken scientists by surprise. In fact, researchers have difficulty in understanding how unicellular organisms thrive at such depths. The presence of nematodes at such depths demonstrates their ability to tolerate and survive in highly hostile conditions like reduced oxygen levels, high temperature, and scarce food supply. For instance, the hypoxic condition in the fracture water is as low as 1 per cent of the oxygen levels found in most oceans, and temperatures are as high as 41°C — much higher than what their terrestrial counterparts can tolerate. A fully functional ecosystem appears to have been in place in the fracture water. Sequencing the worms can provide answers to whether the worms had migrated to the fracture waters and adapted themselves to the harsh conditions. Science once again highlights the truth that the presence of unicellular as well as multicellular life in unthinkable environments is limited only by our imagination to explore — not by their ability to survive.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/believe-it-or-not/article2104556.ece
16,6,2011,All's not well with gas and oil,"To the list of acronyms and alphabets — 2G, CWG, ISRO — that have given the United Progressive Alliance government such an unsavoury image in recent times must now be added another: KG. According to the draft report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India on hydrocarbon production sharing contracts (PSCs), the public exchequer has suffered an as yet unquantifiable loss thanks to the “undue benefit” provided by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to Reliance Industries Ltd., the operator of the gas-rich Krishna-Godavari basin fields. The CAG also found that Cairn India Ltd., the United Kingdom-based company which operates oilfields in Rajasthan, was the beneficiary of unwarranted official largesse. Broadly speaking, the CAG identified two major irregularities in the KG basin case. First, the government allowed RIL to inflate its capital expenditure (capex) claims for the D6 gas field without adequate scrutiny. The financial implications of this are obvious: given the nature of the PSC, the higher RIL's claimed capex, the lower the government's share of the revenues accruing from the production of gas. Secondly, the company was allowed to retain the entire field despite being required to surrender those parts of it where no hydrocarbon discoveries had been made. In the case of Cairn, the CAG says the Ministry allowed the company to expand the contract area by more than 1,600 square kilometres when the PSC did not allow for this. The CAG report also covers the joint venture between ONGC and the private sector BGEPIL and RIL in the Panna-Mukta-Tapti (PMT) offshore oil fields in Bombay High, but the failure of the JV to provide relevant records meant the audit remained inconclusive.
The CAG's hydrocarbon report is a reminder of the unhealthy relationship that exists between UPA government Ministers, bureaucrats, and big business. The constitutionally sanctioned body believes the flaw lies with the structure of PSC, which gives private operators an incentive to inflate their capex. But the Oil Ministry and its officials are faulted for failing to exercise their powers of oversight and also for actively favouring RIL on KG-related matters. That all was not well at KG was known as early as 2008 and 2009, when the fight between the two Ambani brothers over gas pricing brought various internal aspects of the project into the public domain. The CBI opened a probe into the role of the then Director General of Hydrocarbons but neither the Prime Minister's Office nor Murli Deora, who headed the Ministry at the time, saw any need to conduct an urgent, real-time investigation into all the financial aspects of the project. Thanks to the CAG, the people of India have a small hole they can peer into. But the government has a duty to drill deeper, far deeper into the irregularities the auditors have found.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/alls-not-well-with-gas-and-oil/article2107402.ece
16,6,2011,Empowering slum dwellers,"Two years after Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee promised in his budget speech that India would become slum-free in five years, the United Progressive Alliance government has come up with legislation that might enable progress towards this goal. The model Property Rights to Slum Dwellers Act circulated recently by the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation aims to improve the conditions of an estimated 93 million slum dwellers. The legislation would entitle every “eligible” slum dweller living in a slum to receive a dwelling place of 25 square metres of carpet area or its equivalent land area at “affordable” cost. It would confer property rights in the name of the female head of the household or in the joint name of the male head and his wife. This is a progressive course correction meant to check the prevalent male bias in determining housing rights. The proposed Act lays down a seven-year lock-in period to prevent the sale or lease of the allotted property but sensibly makes provision for mortgaging the dwelling units to raise loans for improving them.
There are some serious shortcomings in the model Act. The proposal to fix a cut-off date to identify “eligible” slum dwellers and provide the “ineligible” ones only with an “all weather” space for rent and not a proper dwelling needs to be rethought. Arbitrary cut-off dates and a rigid quota system are impractical to implement. Lessons should be learnt from the failed government schemes to regulate urban street vendors. If the social objective is to create slum-free cities, an inclusive definition that maximises the number of beneficiaries is an imperative. It is ironical that this model legislation, which is meant to stop forced evictions, has provisions to imprison and fine people who have constructed “illegal” structures on government land. Securing government property is a separate issue. Housing is a State subject and the success of the recommended legislation will depend on how well it is implemented by the various State governments. In 2007, the Union Ministry through its national housing policy recommended that 20-25 per cent of the built-up area should be reserved for low-income groups in all housing projects, including those built by private developers. This is yet to be implemented in many cities. What is critical is adequate supply of housing for the poor. If the vision of slum-free cities is to be realised, the stock of social housing must be vastly increased.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/empowering-slum-dwellers/article2107401.ece
17,6,2011,India's agenda at the SCO,"Since its formation in 2001, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation has slowly begun to establish itself as an important forum for the Eurasian region. As a club that has China and Russia and most Central Asian states as members, there is an obvious strategic dimension to the SCO. In the initial years, Moscow and, to a lesser extent, Beijing used the forum to re-inject a dose of Cold War politics into the region. At its 2005 summit, for example, the SCO asked the United States to set a date for the eventual withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan. A lot of water has flowed down the Oxus since then. Now that the U.S. has said it hopes to end all offensive operations in that country by 2014, the Shanghai grouping realises it needs to step up to the plate to ensure Kabul has the capacity to deal with those who challenge its authority. Terrorism and Islamist extremism pose a critical challenge to Russia and China and both know the consequences of instability in their wider region. This is where the SCO has an important role to play. The regional format allows its members to involve themselves in economic and even security-oriented initiatives without reviving uncomfortable memories, as in the case of Russia, or triggering unnecessary rivalries, as in the case of China, India, and Pakistan.
If the SCO can be faulted, it is on its excessively cautious approach to membership. Most groupings go through three stages: a rush of recruits, followed by brief consolidation, and then further expansion. But the Shanghai club closed its doors too soon, holding India, Pakistan, Iran and Mongolia as observers for the better part of a decade. India's attitude, of course, did not help matters. Whether for fear of offending the U.S. or out of a misplaced sense of grandeur, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh preferred to keep his distance from the SCO. The Yekaterinburg summit of 2009, which he attended personally, marked a change. This was also the time South Block realised it needed to get serious about the organisation. Last year, a formal expression of interest was made and now that the SCO, in its summit this week in Astana, has reached agreement on the criteria for membership, India is likely to join soon. It is crucial, though, that New Delhi takes a constructive and long-sighted view of the opportunities the SCO provides for integration of South and Central Asia rather than looking forward to pushing an agenda narrowly focussed on terrorism. SCO members do not need to be reminded at every meeting about the safe haven Pakistan provides to extremism. India's agenda for the grouping must be broader than that.

17,6,2011,A digital ESIC,"The Panchdeep project of the Employees' State Insurance Corporation to provide health and social security services to millions of contributor-members through a national digital network from July 1 is a laudable initiative. Workers have been waiting for some measure that ensures they do not lose their welfare benefits simply because they have to relocate. Happily, they will now be able to use their identity cards to access the services in any networked institution. Achieving such scale is no easy task, considering that the membership base of the ESIC stands at 56 million, and the number of hospitals, dispensaries, and offices is 2,220. Networking will also bring about another significant advance: the families of the insured can get health care without the insured member having to accompany them. These are overdue measures, and they lend belated impetus to India's efforts to provide low-cost health insurance and welfare support to workers. Over the decades, the agenda has made only fitful progress. Often, the huge cash reserves with the ESIC have contrasted sadly with the less-than-average quality of its services. Against this backdrop, the 2010 amendment to the Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948 to widen its reach was welcome. The new provisions enabled extension of coverage to any institution with a manufacturing process, and employing 10 or more people, irrespective of the use of power.
Impressive as the networking achievement is, the ESI system now has to turn its focus on strengthening its core purpose — to safeguard employee health. There are acknowledged problems starting with the sheer demand for facilities, inefficiency, official indifference, corruption, and a lack of accountability. Improving medical infrastructure is a key priority, as is an administrative revamp. A legitimate question is whether the Hospital Development Committees constituted by the ESIC have brought about any perceptible change. Policy concerns at the State level also remain. For example, a liberal approach would facilitate the inclusion of more shops and establishments. The Centre has been appealing to the States to invoke the powers under the Act and lower the threshold for coverage from 20 employees to 10. But not all States have acted. Labour Minister Mallikarjun Kharge told Parliament recently that only Bihar, Punjab, Rajasthan, and West Bengal had issued the necessary notifications. The decision of the ESIC to start 18 medical colleges “in phases” to provide the human resources for its expanding hospital operations is a step forward. At a time of rising costs and debilitating out-of-pocket health expenditure, it is vital that governments widen social security.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-digital-esic/article2110435.ece
18,6,2011,Friends like these,"The reported arrests by Pakistan of at least five people who are said to have helped the Central Intelligence Agency locate Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad are a sign that the Pakistan Army is now furiously engaged in repairing the dents to its power and authority since the killing of the al-Qaeda leader in a secret operation by the U.S. military. Since the May 1 operation, the Pakistan military has been accused at home, even by its own ranks, of allowing national sovereignty to be brazenly violated by the Americans and of gross incompetence in not being able to prevent it. The attack by militants on the Mehran Base was yet another blow to its image. After a mensis horribilis, the military is eager to demonstrate control. Arresting CIA “collaborators” is a good way to do that, particularly as it taps into the anti-American mood in the country. Tellingly, the Pakistan military has denied only that the arrests include an Army major. It can be assumed a similar crackdown on those who helped bin Laden is unlikely, as is any anti-Haqqani group operation in North Waziristan. The Pakistan military is also said to be considering restrictions on U.S. drone operations. There are renewed suspicions of an intelligence breach by the Pakistanis after the CIA shared information about two militant compounds in the tribal areas, only to find its quarry had cleared out soon after. This was possibly one incident a senior CIA official had in mind when, asked recently by a Senate committee to rate Pakistan's cooperation in U.S. counter-terrorism efforts on a scale of 1 to 10, he declared it to be a dismal 3. But if all this places more tensions on its already fraught relations with the U.S., this is a risk the Pakistan Army is apparently prepared to take. Its priority now is to regain lost ground at home.
Perhaps it is confident that its decades-old marriage of convenience with the U.S., which has weathered other storms, is not about to break down. Indications abound that such confidence is not misplaced. Answering angry questions about Pakistan's conduct at a Senate Committee hearing, U.S Defense Secretary Robert Gates said countries — even allies — routinely lie to each other, spy on each other, arrest each other's spies, “and that's the way business gets done…that's the real world that we deal with.” Meanwhile, the New York Times has raised fears of a coup by disgruntled junior officers against Pakistan Army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, who is viewed as pro-American. A top U.S. military official has jumped to his defence, declaring that the Pakistan Army needs “time and space to introspect”. Mr. Gates too has urged patience with Pakistan, saying “we need each other” in the interests of “regional stability.” That really sums it up for this relationship — it's not that complicated after all.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/friends-like-these/article2113389.ece
18,6,2011,On expected lines,"A day before the scheduled unveiling of the Reserve Bank of India's mid-quarter policy review the May figures for headline inflation were released, and they showed the rate had crossed the psychologically important 9 per cent mark. For a fairly long time, the central bank has focussed its policy initiatives on containing inflation even if that meant forsaking growth. The spurt in inflation was not unexpected, but its unrelenting nature made certain that the RBI would mark up the policy interest rates. The question really was by how much. In the event, the 0.25 percentage point increase in the repo rate to 7.5 per cent has been at the lower end of market expectations. In its annual statement, the central bank had introduced major changes in the operating procedure of monetary policy, making the repo rate the single independent varying policy rate. The reverse repo rate has remained operative but has been pegged at one percentage point below the repo rate. Consequently, following the mid-quarter review the reverse repo is now fixed at 6.5 per cent.
Far greater interest, however, lies in the RBI's assessment of inflation and growth. In its annual policy statement, the RBI had forecast inflation hovering around 9 per cent during the first half before moderating to 6 per cent by March 2012. That inflation is already at the higher end of the forecast is ominous and it suggests further monetary tightening in the days to come. The widespread expectation that fuel prices will be raised has definitely boosted the already high inflationary expectations. The challenge of containing inflation and anchoring inflationary expectations persists. The RBI has in its recent policy statements clearly underlined the role of global factors — not just high commodity prices — in influencing the domestic economy. On the growth front, the mid-quarter review is slightly more upbeat. Although it has lowered the GDP growth forecast for 2011-12 to between 7.5 per cent and 8 per cent, the latest policy review claims that, despite some signs of moderation in certain sectors, broad indicators of economic activity (based on recent figures for the last quarter of 2010-11 and credit expansion) do not suggest any sharp or broad-based deceleration. That statement can evoke two different reactions. On the one hand, there would be scepticism: recent data on industrial growth, for instance, are far from robust. On the other hand, the RBI might be moderating unreasonable expectations by suggesting that a growth rate of around 8 per cent will still be very creditable.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/on-expected-lines/article2113387.ece
20,6,2011,Al-Qaeda alive,"Ten years after 9/11, al-Qaeda has been destroyed by the hideous violence it unleashed. Key leaders have been killed, the organisation's fighting capabilities degraded, its financial infrastructure demolished. In western Asia, democratic movements have succeeded in challenging despotic regimes, undermining al-Qaeda's claims that violence alone could catalyse change. Few experts believe Ayman al-Zawahiri, the organisation's new chief, has the charisma, the resources, or the legitimacy needed to raise al-Qaeda from the ruins. Yet the ideas that drove 9/11 exert more influence than ever before. From the Indian Ocean to the deserts surrounding Timbuktu, its message has been taken up by a new generation of jihadist leaders. Last week, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb battled Niger's military near the uranium mines of Arlit, where it has kidnapped several French and African nationals; in Indonesia, the al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyya plotted to poison police personnel. Islamists linked to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, another regional affiliate, are resurgent in Yemen; large parts of Pakistan are inching ever closer to the abyss because of the depredations of jihadists; Somalia's descent into chaos is complete. Each of these regions has served as a launch pad for transnational mass-casualty plots; sooner or later, one will succeed.
How has this come about — and what does it portend? Al-Qaeda emerged from a movement, not the imagination of one man. It represented a flowering, at a particular point in history, of a strain of Islamist thought that was enabled, among other things, by Saudi cash, and empowered by the United States' war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Though al-Qaeda itself has been destroyed by its decision to turn on its historic patrons, no real challenge exists to the ideological tide that it rode. This, in turn, is a consequence of the west's propping-up of authoritarian regimes in many of the regions where al-Qaeda affiliates have flourished. These regimes stamped out democratic political opposition and used competitive religious chauvinism to shore up legitimacy. Each of al-Qaeda's new affiliates thus is underpinned by a complex welter of political conflicts and conflicts of class and identity that no military will ever resolve. The bottom line: al-Qaeda might be on its knees, but there's no reason to believe the jihadist movement, of which it was even at its peak a small part, is anywhere near defeat. “History,” wrote Abdullah Azzam, Osama bin Laden's mentor, “does not write its lines except with blood. Glory does not build its lofty edifice except with skulls; honour and respect cannot be established except on a foundation of cripples and corpses.” Despite bin Laden's death, and the uncertain future of the jihadist project over which al-Zawahiri now presides, that foundation seems set to grow.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/alqaeda-alive/article2118276.ece
20,6,2011,Shed DRS-phobia,"The position of the Board for Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) on the Decision Review System (DRS) is not merely untenable; it's arrogant and autocratic. The timing of its rejection of the use of DRS for the series in England shows as much. The first Test starts on July 21, more than three weeks after a meeting of the International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executives in Hong Kong to consider the cricket committee's recommendation that DRS be incorporated in all forms of the game. The BCCI — in not waiting till the end of June for the meeting, in which evidence of the improvement in technology will be presented — acted with the high-handedness it has often been criticised of. Its resistance to DRS has been particularly striking, marked by a desire to control the discourse: when Duncan Fletcher, unveiled as the coach of India, was asked about the system, a senior BCCI official intervened, ensuring the question wasn't answered. It was Fletcher, incidentally, who first presented the idea of a player referral system to the ICC in 1999, an idea that was at that time dismissed by the game's governing body.
The BCCI's resistance stems from its view that ball-tracking technology isn't error-free. The board reportedly also has misgivings about the expenses involved, and about who should bear them. Both excuses are easily countered. First, it's perplexing that the BCCI, which is so vehemently opposed to Hawk Eye, a ball-tracking system, has no problems with the accuracy of Hot Spot, which uses infra-red imaging, and Snickometer, which works on audio data. Hot Spot may appear convincing, but it has run into trouble on very hot days; Snickometer is instructive but rarely clinching. The premise of the BCCI's stand that a system must be 100 per cent accurate if it is to be used is fatally flawed. Umpiring decisions, especially those pertaining to leg before appeals and thin edges, are estimates. The goals must be to achieve the most precise approximation and ensure that ‘howlers,' the most egregious of errors, are reduced. DRS achieves both aims — empirical evidence suggests as much. Crucially, a large majority of umpires and players support it. The ICC, which can be faulted for piecemeal implementation of the system, must commit itself to greater research and development, and to evolving a formula that makes DRS commercially viable. But it's the BCCI that has the bigger commitment to make — to stop acting like a bully and act responsibly as the most influential entity in the world game.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/shed-drsphobia/article2118277.ece
21,6,2011,You go girls,"As an ‘Arab spring' sweeps through West Asia, one country has managed to remain insulated from the unrest. Early on, the Saudi monarch, King Abdullah, bought peace with a hefty $137 billion largesse for his subjects in unemployment, housing, and other benefits. It included a $200 million package for the religious establishment that had obligingly decreed that street protests were forbidden in Islam. The move paid off. Still, a slight whiff of jasmine over the kingdom was unmistakable when a handful of Saudi women took the wheels of their cars on June 17 in protest against an official ban on women driving. Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world with such a ban. Driving was prohibited after a similar protest in 1990 by a group of women who decided it was time to challenge the unofficial ban that had existed until then. The prohibition was based on the dubious ground that it led to ikhtilat or ‘gender mixing,' ruled by Saudi clerics as not permitted in Islam. Paradoxically, women can own cars. In some rural areas, and inside compounds such as a university or an office layout, they drive them too. But the ban is strictly followed in most places, with women dependent on men to chauffeur them around. Manal al-Sharif was doubtless emboldened by the democracy movements in the neighbourhood when she used social media networks to launch Women2Drive, a campaign urging Saudi women to break the ban, starting from the third Friday of June. The call evidently rattled the Saudi government, as seen from its swift moves to snuff out the campaign by arresting the 32-year-old Aramco engineer for over a week and taking her pages off the Internet. But the idea had already found resonance.
Mobility empowers women, and Saudi women see driving as the first step to win more freedoms from a brazenly anti-women regime. But Saudi women want to drive for some practical reasons also: it makes more economic sense than employing a driver and allows better time management. Many even argue it means less ‘gender-mixing,' as it reduces dependence on non-family male drivers. That the Saudi authorities decided, after the initial reaction, not to use a heavy hand against the women who participated in the protest is a sign of its caution in the present regional environment. Two decades ago, it sacked the protesting women from their jobs, and penalised their male relatives. The regime's maximum response this time — a traffic ticket to one woman for driving without a Saudi licence — may mean one of two things: hope that ignoring the protest will make it go away; or a possibility of relaxation of the ban in the belief that such limited ‘reform' will act as a safety valve, keeping the lid on demands for more far-reaching political reform. Either way, it is a small step forward for women.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/you-go-girls/article2120921.ece
21,6,2011,Will Tiger roar again?,"Thanks to a lingering knee injury, Tiger Woods was absent — for the first time since 1995 — from last weekend's U.S. Open. But has his game been wounded in a much more debilitating and lasting way? Ever since the sex scandal destroyed his marriage and family life in late 2009, Woods has not won even one tournament; he has lost the last 22 in which he played. Notwithstanding his promises to return to his earlier form, rivals such as Luke Donald, Lee Westwood, and Martin Kaymer have climbed to the top of the rankings ladder as he has slipped to a lowly 13th. Before the stories about his infidelities broke in rapid succession, it seemed only a matter of time before Woods, with 14 titles in golf's four major tournaments — the U.S. Open, the U.S. PGA, the British Open and the Masters — would surpass Jack Nicklaus' record of 18 victories. Now the chances of his doing so, and establishing his place as the greatest golfer ever beyond a smidgeon of doubt, have virtually vanished. He seemed to have it for the asking and he blew it. This is what makes the Tiger Woods story so painful for the legion of fans, who marvelled at his genius, celebrated his victories, and believed they were witnessing history in the making.
Of course, it is too early to write Tiger off. At 35, he may no longer be young, but golf is a sport where champions often blossom in their thirties (the current number one Luke Donald is 33) and, on occasion, remain in bloom until much later (Jack Nicklaus won his last major when he was 46). Recently, he has made radical alterations to his golf swing. While these have been fiercely criticised by some experts, the new swing probably needs more time to settle in and more time before a proper assessment is made of its merits. Golf is very much a mental game and it is possible that Woods may return to form with the return of some focus and equanimity in his personal life. But one thing seems certain. It will be impossible for Woods to recapture those glory days in the early 2000s when he routinely won tournaments by huge margins, when he rewrote golfing record after golfing record, when he alone was on Mount Olympus while the others seemed to merely labour in the foothills. In fact, Tiger had lost that kind of supremacy well before he was scandal-scarred; to hope to regain it now is simply unfeasible. What he can do, however, is to show he has the talent and the appetite to win tournaments again and re-establish himself as one of the world's top-ranking golfers. It would be a personal triumph and an emotional catharsis if he does this. For his many fans, it would be a fitting end to a shining, if chequered, golfing career.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/will-tiger-roar-again/article2120922.ece
22,6,2011,Another task for the PSLV,"In its forthcoming mission, scheduled for the second week of July, the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) will, for the first time, be carrying a communications satellite, the 1,425-kg GSAT-12. The PSLV was originally developed to carry India's remote sensing satellites, which are typically placed in a polar orbit. In 2002, on its seventh mission, the rocket was used to launch the country's first dedicated meteorological satellite, Metsat, later renamed Kalpana-1 in memory of Kalpana Chawla, the Indian-born U.S. astronaut who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003. Like communication satellites, this meteorological satellite was put into geostationary orbit. In this orbit, some 36,000 km above the equator, the spacecraft matches the earth's rotation and therefore appears stationary from the ground. From its vantage point in space over India, Kalpana-1 keeps constant watch over evolving weather systems. For communications satellites like the GSAT-12, it is good perch to relay telephone conversations, data, and televisions broadcasts.
Satellites headed for geostationary orbit are put by rockets that launch them into an elliptical temporary orbit. From there, rocket engines on the spacecraft are fired periodically to manoeuvre them into the final position over the equator. In 2008, the most powerful version of the PSLV, the PSLV-XL, was used to place the lunar probe Chandrayaan-1, weighing 1,380 kg into an elliptical orbit 255 km at its closest to earth and nearly 23,000 km at its farthest; the spacecraft's own engines then took it, in stages, to orbit around the Moon. Next month, another PSLV-XL will leave the GSAT-12 in an elliptical orbit similar to that of the Chandrayaan-1. Both equatorial and polar launches from Sriharikota are challenging because of the need to drop the rocket's spent stages with considerable precision in international waters. In the case of an equatorial launch of the sort that will be done with the GSAT-12, the PSLV's six strap-on motors as well its first and second stages, when their propellant is exhausted, will have to be safely discarded before the rocket crosses the Malay peninsula; the third stage is dropped into the Pacific Ocean, while the fourth stage goes on to take the spacecraft into orbit. For polar launches, the rocket first flies south-east and then turns southwards in mid-flight to avoid dropping spent stages near Sri Lanka. Without this complicated dog-leg manoeuvre, its payload capability for polar launches would go up by about 50 per cent. These are hurdles the PSLV takes in its stride to fulfil a wide range of missions with sturdy reliability, a tribute indeed to all those who designed and now operate this remarkable launch vehicle.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/another-task-for-the-pslv/article2123861.ece
22,6,2011,Greek drama all over again,"A highly unpalatable austerity package that is being thrust on Greece has spawned political turmoil in that country. Even a major cabinet reshuffle is not expected to temper the opposition to the austerity measures that prospective lenders insist Greece must adopt to qualify for a bailout package. If it eventually goes through, the reprieve will be the second in just over a year. Last year, when the debt crisis flared up, European lenders, hoping to contain it at the Greek border, provided a bailout worth $158 billion over three years, a significant portion coming from other euro area countries and the balance from the International Monetary Fund. However, since then the debt crisis has spread relentlessly across the southern and western periphery of the euro area. Today the crisis is viewed not just as the problem of a few laggard countries in the euro area but one that can threaten the foundations of the European Monetary Union and even have a negative impact on the global economy. Along with high levels of public debt in the advanced countries and escalating oil prices, it ranks among the significant threats to global economic revival. The IMF has estimated a one per cent drop in global output if the crisis in Europe persists. Even assuming that the Greek Parliament accepts the austerity package, there would still be daunting challenges in its implementation.
A very large portion of the Greek government debt is held by private investors. European banks are said to be holding around $150 billion of Greek government bonds. A bailout package will necessarily result in a steep reduction in the value of such holdings. These banks may have to be recapitalised. The extraordinary dependence on private capital will almost certainly exacerbate worries over the state of public finance in many countries. Other European countries considered weak by the markets will now come under pressure. As large global banks take a hit, the contagion will spread to other countries to which these banks have exposures. The rather tentative moves by Europe's politicians have not helped, but there is reason for their prevarication: in many countries, notably Germany and Finland, voters have generally been reluctant to share the cost of rescuing other countries. The crisis in Greece has brought into sharp focus the weakness of a stand-alone monetary union that does not have the usual fiscal and political foundations. A view is gaining ground that it will be in the best interests of everybody for Greece to exit the euro at least temporarily and then take measures that are in harmony with its own national interests.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/greek-drama-all-over-again/article2123859.ece
23,6,2011,Predicting the monsoon,"How will the monsoon turn out? Not as well as previously thought appeared to be the answer when the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued its updated seasonal forecast on Tuesday. Nevertheless, the data in the IMD's press release indicate that the most likely outcome is a ‘normal' monsoon, but one where nationwide rainfall during the season occurs at the lower end of the spectrum. Atmospheric scientists define a normal monsoon as one where the rain the country receives is between 90 per cent and 110 per cent of the long-period average. Rainfall data for over a century show that there is a 70 per cent chance that a monsoon will fall in this category. In the IMD's latest forecast based on a statistical model, the probability for that sort of normal monsoon works out to 80 per cent. So, although the probability for such an outcome has come down from the 93 per cent given in the forecast issued in April, the odds still favour another normal monsoon this year. However, the normal in the scientists' parlance is sub-divided into three in the IMD's classification: below normal (from 90 per cent to 96 per cent of the long-period average); normal (from 96 per cent to 104 per cent); and above normal (from 104 per cent to 110 per cent). The chances of a ‘below normal' monsoon have gone up from 30 per cent in the April forecast to 37 per cent in the latest prediction. The odds of a normal monsoon as defined by the IMD have fallen from 53 per cent to 37 per cent.
The possibility of a deficient monsoon — where rainfall is less than 90 per cent of the long-period average — has risen from 6 per cent in the April forecast to 19 per cent. Records of past years, however, show that a monsoon has an 18 per cent chance of falling in this category. There is, therefore, no significantly increased risk of this monsoon turning deficient. Nor are there warning signs from groups that use powerful dynamical models to simulate what happens in the oceans and the atmosphere that the current rainy season will fare badly. Although the La Nina, the cooling of the equatorial waters of the Pacific Ocean that aided last year's monsoon, has subsided, forecasters put a low probability on a warming that would lead to an El Nino, which could be detrimental to the monsoon. Unfavourable conditions in the Indian Ocean too have not been forecast. However, it is not enough for the monsoon to turn out to be normal; the distribution of rainfall too matters. The IMD's latest prediction indicates that rainfall in both July and August, which are important for agriculture, could be below par. Prolonged spells of little or no rain in those months would affect crops badly. Let us hope there won't be such breaks in the monsoon.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/predicting-the-monsoon/article2126529.ece
23,6,2011,Parrots or crows?,"The impressive cognitive capability of parrots and corvids (crows, jays, ravens, and jackdaws) has been extensively documented in scientific literature. These two have a large brain relative to body size. Apparently, this is true of all mammals that exhibit greater cognitive development. In the case of crows, which generally rank very low in human esteem, the relative size of the brain is the same as that of chimpanzees. But the size of the brain alone does not translate to higher cognitive capability. A study of all cognitively advanced animals, including some species of corvids and parrots, shows that they share a unique characteristic — a larger forebrain. The cerebrum that is associated with higher brain function such as memory, thought, and action is located in the forebrain. It is therefore not surprising that these birds — which have forebrains that are relatively the same size as that of apes — often demonstrate ape-like intelligence.
With the higher level of intelligence established, scientists have tried to compare the levels of cognition of parrots and corvids. Unfortunately, most of the experiments have used single tasks (either tool use or non-tool use) to arrive at a conclusion. Such an approach is not ideal as the tests tend to favour the natural ability of one species, and hence will not necessarily shed light on problem-solving capabilities. A paper published recently in the PLoS One journal (“Flexibility in problem solving and tool use of kea and New Caledonian crows in a multi access box paradigm” by Alice M. I. Auersperg et al.) assessed the problem-solving skills of six kea parrots and five New Caledonian crows by using a combination of four tests, two of which involved tool-use. Overall, the kea performed much better than the crows. While none of the crows employed more than one solution, the kea parrots were quicker in discovering multiple solutions. While the naturally stick-tool using crows scored over their competitors, they were slower than the parrots in the second tool-use test involving a ball. The kea is not known to use sticks in the wild and this may be due to its beak curvature. Yet one managed to insert a stick into the opening by employing a sophisticated technique. That the study brought out the innate characteristics — the neophobia of the crows, which hampered their performance, and the neophilia of the parrots, which allowed them to act even on novel objects — highlights the compelling need to use a combination of tests to compare relative cognitive capabilities and development.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/parrots-or-crows/article2126527.ece
24,6,2011,Inflation expectations,"Highlighting the crucial connection between the current high levels of inflation and the expectation among consumers that prices will continue to rise as sharply in the future, the Reserve Bank of India has pointed out that since headline and core inflation have overshot even the most pessimistic projections, there is a concern that inflation expectations might become unhinged. Indeed, anchoring inflation expectations at a low level has become one of the most daunting challenges of monetary policy. Reeling under high food inflation many households do not see any respite even in the year ahead. The same despair permeates the outlook on fuel prices as well, probably with an even greater justification. While global oil prices have been ascendant, they are not fully reflected in the domestic fuel prices. Both inflation and inflation expectations are conditioned by certain well known instruments of public policy. There should be a clearly stated inflation objective for macroeconomic policy and management, and also for monetary policy. Secondly, central banks must deploy a credible range of monetary instruments which they must be able to refine as and when necessary. Thirdly, conditions ought to be created for the proper transmission of the policy action. In India the RBI is responsible for controlling inflation, but the government has an important role in influencing supply-side factors.
Sound inflation management demands that the central bank and the government work in tandem even if, at a particular juncture, inflation is attributable to a factor over which only one of them has influence. Thus, even when on many a recent occasion inflation was being pumped up chiefly by food prices, the RBI expressed its resolve to back government action with monetary measures even if those were not clearly indicated. The major measures announced in the recent RBI monetary policy statements are noteworthy. For instance, the 0.75 percentage point increase in the repo rate over six weeks, making the repo rate the sole policy rate, and the creation of the new Marginal Standing Facility from which banks can borrow at one percentage point above the repo rate are all decisive steps in the context of inflation management. It is highly significant that even when the RBI lowered the growth estimates and increased those of inflation thereby differing sharply from the official position, the government has backed the central bank. More realistic growth and inflation estimates, and greater cohesion between the government and the RBI are all vital ingredients in a well thought out strategy of controlling inflation and anchoring inflation expectations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/inflation-expectations/article2132338.ece
24,6,2011,Lessons from Japan quake,"The 9 magnitude Tohoku-Oki earthquake that struck Japan on March 11, 2011, and triggered the deadly tsunami, was more powerful than expected. The magnitude of quakes in this region has been around 7-8 in recent centuries. Papers published recently in Nature and Science journals reveal why the quake off the Sendai coast turned out to be deadly. Though the fault north of Tokyo was assumed to be fairly simple and uniform in nature, the March 11 event showed how complicated it was. In the Japan Trench, the subduction (diving) of the Pacific Plate under the Okhotsk Plate occurs at an average rate of 8-8.5 cm a year. The subduction, it now turns out, has not been smooth. The plates had apparently got stuck (locked) at certain portions along the fault. Since the plates are converging, any locking of the plate interface produces an enormous build up of strain. Seismologists had presumed that the relatively soft material of the seafloor near the Japan Trench could not support a large accumulation of strain. Hence any failure of the fault and the resulting strain release was expected to produce only large earthquakes, not a 9 magnitude killer quake. However, enormous energy was released on March 11 owing to the sudden slip of a compact area (400 km in length and 200 km in width) of the plate interface. The epicentre had moved seaward by as much as 24 metres and lifted upward by about 3 metres.
Only two of the five ruptured segments had experienced an extreme slip. But this increases the possibility of very high magnitude quakes striking the southern portion of the fault due to stress transfer. The consequences could be severe if this portion of the fault has also been locked. If predicting quakes with a high degree of confidence is not possible in the case of land-based faults, scientists are far worse off when it comes to subduction zones located in the deep ocean. The lack of sea-based instruments to measure strain build-up is a huge limitation. Though Japan had a handful of sonar transponders located on the seafloor near the Trench, measurements were not taken frequently, notes a paper published recently in Nature (“Hidden depths,” by Andrew V. Newman). Vital information collected at regular intervals before the deadly quake could have minimised the loss of human life. Unfortunately, this was not done as collecting data from the sonar transponders is prohibitively expensive. The March 11 event should prompt the scientific community and governments to find cheaper and more efficient ways of obtaining critical information.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lessons-from-japan-quake/article2132336.ece
24,6,2011,Drop the pretence on Myanmar,"External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna has returned from a three-day official visit to Myanmar without meeting Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader and international democracy icon who was freed in late 2010 by that country's military regime after several years under house arrest. He left that chore to Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao. The Minister's visit was billed as India's first high-level interaction with the “new civilian government.” It would be best to drop the pretence. The Myanmar government is not civilian by any standards. It is run by the Union Solidarity and Development Party, a military proxy that unsurprisingly won a sham election in October 2010. Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy boycotted the election as the junta introduced new rules to keep the Nobel Laureate out of the process. The newly elected Parliament, dominated by the military and its proxies, chose USDP leader Thein Sein as the new “civilian” President in March 2011 after he was handpicked by Senior General Than Shwe, the head of the junta's outgoing State Peace and Development Council. President Sein was a serving general until last year and the Prime Minister in the SPDC regime. A junta loyalist, he is expected to maintain continuity with the junta's policies. Thanks to WikiLeaks, we know that the Indian foreign policy establishment thinks Ms Suu Kyi's “day has come and gone,” and that India's engagement with the Myanmarese military is based on security considerations in the North-East and its fears of losing influence to China. But if this is India's state policy, it should say this openly instead of projecting its dance with the generals as “engagement” with civilians.
India and Myanmar have come a long way in their bilateral ties since New Delhi's barely remembered conferment of the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding on Ms Suu Kyi in 1991. Engagement with the generals has paid India dividends: Myanmar is no longer soft on militant groups that operate in India's North-East; New Delhi is involved in a dozen ventures in the energy, agriculture, power, telecommunications, and infrastructure sectors. The construction of a $110 million “multi-nodal” Kaladan transport project linking the landlocked North-East with Sittwe seaport in Myanmar is well under way, and Mr. Krishna's visit has netted more MoUs. But while New Delhi furthers its ties with Myanmar's men in uniform, it will live on India's conscience that it quietly abandoned the Gandhian Ms Suu Kyi. Only last week, on the occasion of her 66th birthday, she reiterated a plea to India to live up to its democratic credentials by “engaging more” with Myanmar's democracy activists.

24,6,2011,Renewing e-waste,"The e-waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2011, notified by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, have the potential to turn a growing problem into a development opportunity. With almost a year to go before the rules take effect, there is enough time to create the necessary infrastructure for collection, dismantling, and recycling of electronic waste. The focus must be on sincere and efficient implementation. Only decisive action can eliminate the scandalous pollution and health costs associated with India's hazardous waste recycling industry. If India can achieve a transformation, it will be creating a whole new employment sector that provides good wages and working conditions for tens of thousands. The legacy response of the States to even the basic law on urban waste, the Municipal Solid Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, has been one of indifference; many cities continue to simply burn the garbage or dump it in lakes. With the emphasis now on segregation of waste at source and recovery of materials, it should be feasible to implement both sets of rules efficiently. A welcome feature of the new e-waste rules is the emphasis on extended producer responsibility. In other words, producers must take responsibility for the disposal of end-of-life products. For this provision to work, they must ensure that consumers who sell scrap get some form of financial incentive.
The e-waste rules, which derive from those pertaining to hazardous waste, are scheduled to come into force on May 1, 2012. Sound as they are, the task of scientifically disposing of a few hundred thousand tonnes of trash electronics annually depends heavily on a system of oversight by State Pollution Control Boards. Unfortunately, most PCBs remain unaccountable and often lack the resources for active enforcement. It must be pointed out that, although agencies handling e-waste must obtain environmental clearances and be authorised and registered by the PCBs even under the Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008, there has been little practical impact. Over 95 per cent of electronic waste is collected and recycled by the informal sector. The way forward is for the PCBs to be made accountable for enforcement of the e-waste rules, and the levy of penalties under environmental laws. Clearly, the first order priority is to create a system that will absorb the 80,000-strong workforce in the informal sector into the proposed scheme for scientific recycling. Facilities must be created to upgrade the skills of these workers through training and their occupational health must be ensured.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/renewing-ewaste/article2129505.ece
26,6,2011,The best CBM yet,"India and Pakistan have taken their re-engagement another commendable step forward with the meeting between the two Foreign Secretaries. Considering the difficulties in relations since the Mumbai 2008 attacks, each official interaction must be seen as an important incremental step in the rebuilding of bilateral relations, to which there is no alternative. As Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao rightly said, it is time that “a vocabulary of peace,” rather than an ideology of military conflict, determined the way the two countries view each other. These talks capped a series of meetings between officials held since March, following the pattern of the Composite Dialogue process but without calling it that. That these discussions were able to pick up threads abandoned after the Mumbai attacks, including those on relaxing the visa regime and concessions to improve bilateral trade, is encouraging. The Foreign Secretaries discussed the possibilities of more Kashmir-specific confidence-building measures, or CBMs, and the scope for improving those in existence now. Also taken up were CBMs to mitigate the nuclear shadow over the subcontinent and the excessive military build-up on both sides, as was the issue of terrorism. That both sides had to agree through a joint statement to the “cessation of hostile propaganda” is telling about how far this had gone and should be cause for introspection in the news media, which often provides a platform for such propaganda. But what was uplifting was the acknowledgment that “the people of the two countries are at the heart of the relationship.”
Last week, one Pakistani demonstrated that nothing is truer when it comes to India-Pakistan relations. Ansar Burney's act of mobilising funds to free not just the Pakistani sailors held by pirates on the m.v. Suez, but also the Indian ones, has provided exemplary substance to that phrase ‘people-to people contact.' The subsequent mid-sea scuffle between the Indian and Pakistani navies as the rescued ship was being escorted to Karachi only reiterated the truth that the peoples are more capable of civilised engagement than the two states. The human rights activist's decision to help the Indian hostages is all the more heart-warming, considering the hostility he faced from the Pakistani media the last time he assisted an Indian in March 2008, when his efforts led to the release of the death-row prisoner Kashmir Singh from a Pakistani jail after a 30-year-long incarceration. Worse was the shabby treatment meted out to him by India, which deported him from the New Delhi airport in June 2008 on the unexplained ground of “inadequate documentation.” Evidently, Mr. Burney carried no grudge about this. He has shown by deed that humanism is the best CBM.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-best-cbm-yet/article2137112.ece
26,6,2011,Impact will be harsh and wide,"It is easy to guess why the central government waited so long before increasing the retail price of diesel, LPG, and kerosene. These petroleum products are far more politically sensitive than petrol, the price of which was allowed to rise last month. When New Delhi finally squared up with the substantial and sustained rise in global oil prices, the revision in prices announced on Friday was sharp and painful to consumers: diesel up by Rs.3 a litre, kerosene by Rs.2, and cooking gas by Rs.50 a cylinder. The repercussions will be harsh and wide: an increase in the price of diesel, the economy's main transportation fuel, will push up the cost of food items, including fruits and vegetables, eggs, and many other perishables that are moved largely by truck. A hike in transportation costs usually has a cascading effect on food prices. In the context of high inflation, especially food inflation, this is extremely bad news for consumers. The calculation may be that LPG is the fuel of choice of the middle classes rather than of poorer sections but it is clear the Rs.50 price increase is deeply resented. As for the increase in the price of kerosene — the poor woman's fuel — there have been reports that a significant proportion of the fuel obtained from the public distribution system is being diverted for adulterating diesel and other more expensive fuels. But how does this make the price hike any less burdensome for the poor families that rely on kerosene for their daily cooking?
Faced with increases in global oil prices three years ago, the United Progressive Alliance government claimed it strove for equity, apportioning the burden among the stakeholders: the consumer, the government, which levies and collects taxes, and the public sector oil companies. This time too it claims to have softened the blow on consumers by scrapping or reducing customs and excise duties on petroleum and its derivatives, in the process forgoing some Rs.49,000 crore of tax revenue. The oil marketing companies say their “under recoveries” will come down by Rs.21,000 crore. Restructuring petroleum product prices may be an acceptable longer-term objective but any sharp increase in the retail prices will be hugely unpopular in a country where the basic needs of hundreds of millions of people are nowhere close to being met, notwithstanding the high economic growth rate. The government ought to take a major share of the blame for failing to meet this challenge from the standpoint of the people and with a longer-term policy perspective.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/impact-will-be-harsh-and-wide/article2137111.ece
27,6,2011,The NSG challenge,"The Nuclear Suppliers Group may well have been trying to tighten the general rules for the international transfer of enrichment and reprocessing equipment and technology (ENR) but its insistence on membership of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty as a condition of supply has effectively punched a hole in the historic waiver India negotiated with the cartel in 2008. This reversal will, of course, politically damage Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who promised Parliament in 2006 that his government would start placing Indian civil nuclear facilities under international safeguards only after all international restrictions in the nuclear field had been lifted. But a bigger challenge confronts our diplomatic establishment, which now faces the task of ensuring that the mutual commitments undertaken by India and its nuclear partners are implemented in full. Ever since the July 2005 joint statement with the United States, official India has asserted that all the promises and commitments it was making — the separation of its military and civilian nuclear sectors, the acceptance of international safeguards over its civilian facilities, the placing of huge commercial orders, etc. — were in exchange for full civil nuclear cooperation. The bilateral agreements signed with the U.S., France, and Russia, and the NSG statement on India that emerged after two bruising rounds of negotiations in 2008, were all drafted accordingly. If one side now insists on making unilateral changes, this will be a breach of trust.
India's initial response to last week's setback at the NSG has been guarded. It has indicated to the three major reactor-supplying nations that they must stand by their earlier commitments. But if they baulk or prevaricate, New Delhi will have to exercise the leverage it has. The U.S., France, and Russia are not doing India a favour by agreeing to sell nuclear reactors. The bill for this equipment will run eventually into tens of billions of dollars. India has promised to buy 10,000 MW worth of reactors from the U.S. alone. Then there are the defence purchases the country is slated to make. Smart diplomacy would have meant leveraging these assets in advance. The ENR writing has been on the wall since November 2008, when a ‘clean text' of the new restrictions first emerged in draft form. Unfortunately, the United Progressive Alliance regime soft-pedalled the issue, preferring to demarche its partners in private rather than making a big deal out of the fact that the terms of the nuclear deal were being arbitrarily redrawn. Even today, the ENR issue is not a lost cause: like the nuclear embargo itself, this latest unjust restriction on India can be reversed. But only if the government has the political stomach to play hardball.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-nsg-challenge/article2139549.ece
27,6,2011,"Finally, a breakthrough","Under tremendous pressure to crack senior crime journalist Jyotirmoy Dey's murder on June 11, the Mumbai police have come up with an underworld shooter from the Chhota Rajan gang as the main culprit. Satish Kaliya and six others are to be booked under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) and their gang leader Chhota Rajan made an absconding accused in the case. The arrest comes a day after another gang leader, Chhota Shakeel, called up a leading newspaper and denied he had anything to do with the killing of Dey. Rajan too had reportedly denied his involvement. The Mumbai police took their time with the case and were reluctant to hand it over to the CBI. Investigations are still under way and the 3,000 emails in Dey's inbox have to be examined for crucial evidence. Importantly no motive, whether professional or personal, has been ascribed to the killing as yet. From police accounts, the murder was planned meticulously over 20 days. However, it is rather strange that the shooter was, according to the police, unaware of the identity of Dey as a leading crime reporter and he realised it only subsequently while watching television. The investigation covered a wide ambit since Dey was writing on the oil mafia, underworld links with policemen, and other issues. Admittedly, the police had a difficult task but pressure from the press, the court, and the government forced it into speeding up the investigation and zeroing in on the alleged killers unlike in other States where nothing has happened in similar cases.
For the beleaguered Mumbai police, the arrests have come as a respite after some red herrings were thrown in the path of the investigation. Its reputation has been under the scanner for a while and, even during its moment of triumph, the State Home Minister had to suspend a police inspector who was involved in organising a rave party outside Mumbai. Having caught the suspects, the police have an even bigger challenge — unravelling the motive behind this brazen killing. Most crime reporters have excellent contacts with the underworld and a network of informers. Dey did not speak to anyone of a threat to his life or demand protection. It is an unwritten rule that the underworld rarely killed members of the media, though there were two cases in early 1980s in and outside Mumbai in the heyday of Dawood Ibrahim. The police have indicated that the emails could lay bare the reasons for Dey's tragic death. The investigators cannot rest easy having caught the alleged culprits, though that is a major breakthrough. The reasons for the crime are just as important.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/finally-a-breakthrough/article2139550.ece
28,6,2011,The CAG's mandate,"As auditor to a nation whose institutions of oversight are weak and underdeveloped, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India is more than just the keeper of our national accounts. It is, in many ways, a conscience-keeper and a watchdog, which may not bite but can bark and warn ordinary citizens that something is amiss in the wider affairs of state. Like the Election Commission and the Supreme Court, the CAG has managed to protect its integrity and independence despite pressure from various arms of the state. If conducted freely and fairly, a robust audit can serve as a catalyst for corrective action. The CAG's report on Bofors in 1989 had major political consequences. Its explosive 2010 report on the allocation of 2G spectrum led to the filing of criminal charges against politicians, bureaucrats, and businessmen. Other reports may have had a less dramatic political impact but they have been equally useful. The CAG's observations may be politically embarrassing to the government but they clearly contribute to the public good. Democratic India must ensure that the government takes the work of this constitutionally sanctioned institution very seriously and removes the obstacles placed in the path of a more effective and efficient audit process.
Aware of the limitations of its mandate, the CAG has asked the United Progressive Alliance government to make three broad amendments in the 1971 Audit Act, which governs the functioning of the audit authorities. The first amendment is intended to ensure that government departments reply to audit enquiries in 30 days rather than in the open-ended manner as now. Secondly, the CAG wants the statute to stipulate a clear timeframe for the tabling of completed audit reports on the floor of the relevant legislature. The Act, as it stands today, gives the Central and State governments wide latitude in this regard and it is hardly surprising that this freedom has been abused to delay making public the audit reports that contain embarrassing observations. The third set of proposed amendments is aimed at bringing the CAG's legal mandate up to speed with the changes that have taken place in the way public money is spent. Since the 1971 Act was passed, the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Constitution have been adopted, adding a layer of decentralised governance — and hence expenditure management — to the institutions of the state. Liberalisation has meant public money is increasingly utilised in joint ventures and public-private partnerships. Because of ambiguities in its mandate, the CAG feels unable adequately to audit this vast area of public economic activity. The government should deal with the call for a modernised Audit Act proactively.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-cags-mandate/article2142587.ece
28,6,2011,Give Palestine its due,"Palestinians have yet again been denied their due. The recently concluded session of UNESCO's World Heritage Committee rejected the first-ever Palestinian nomination. While it considered proposals from six West Asian countries, it overlooked Palestine's proposal to include the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, one the oldest functioning churches, in the world heritage list. The proposal was rejected not on merits, but because UNESCO did not consider Palestine a sovereign state. Getting world heritage status has been critical to improving the protection of heritage sites. In 2002, the Israeli forces besieged and damaged parts of the Church of the Nativity, which is more than 1500 years old and a site of importance for Muslims as well. In 2005, experts listed many more instances of wanton destruction. For example, the Israeli Military Command destroyed 22 historic structures in the old city of Hebron, and permanent structures were built atop the archaeological site of Tell Rumeida. As recently as in 2010, instances of illegitimate appropriation of Palestinian monuments were reported. The hope was that a formal international recognition would serve as an additional deterrent and help Palestinians in nation-building.
Realising the urgent need to protect the cultural sites, UNESCO started training Palestinians to identify important heritage structures and implement the World Heritage Convention. In 2005, a list of 17 monuments located in historic cities such as Bethlehem and Nablus was published. Unfortunately, when it came to the critical phase of nomination, UNESCO, which might plead its hands are tied by convention and the limitations of international law, failed to demonstrate the innovativeness and progressive spirit expected of it. It needs to revisit the founding moments of the World Heritage movement. About 50 years ago, the world came together to save Abu Simbel. Collective concern and gravity of the situation compelled the international community to act creatively and boldly. UNESCO demonstrated some of these traits in 1981, when it overruled Israel's objection and accepted Jordan's proposal to nominate the old city of Jerusalem and its walls for the world heritage list. The reality is that many of the identified heritage sites are in areas administered by the Palestinian National Authority, which is an internationally accepted representative of the Palestinians, and the formation of Palestine State is inevitable. There is no convincing reason to further deny Palestine heritage sites the protection and recognition they deserve and urgently need.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/give-palestine-its-due/article2142584.ece
29,6,2011,A clean chit for now,"The Reserve Bank of India's latest Financial Stability Report attempts to assess the health of India's financial sector in a holistic manner and pinpoint the incipient risks to stability that may arise in a systemic sense. Like its counterparts in the advanced economies, the RBI seeks to draw the right lessons from the interplay of the macroeconomic setting, policies, markets and institutions, for which it claims to rely on up-to-date techniques and methodology. The report declares that India's financial system remains “stable in the face of some fragilities being observed in the global macro-financial environment.” Growth has been slackening in most parts of the world and the risks arising from global imbalances and the European debt crisis show no signs of abating. The truth is that the causes for some of these persistent problems have never been fully addressed. India's growth momentum has moderated slightly on account of both domestic and global factors, but its economic fundamentals continue to remain strong despite concerns over inflation and the fiscal situation. The widening current account deficit also is not a matter of serious concern for now, although a slowdown in capital inflows could occur as the advanced economies exit from their accommodative policies. However, government expenditure needs to be more tightly managed as part of a well thought-out process of fiscal consolidation.
The domestic financial markets remain stress-free and are expected to be so in the near future. There has been a strong demand for credit and, consequently, liquidity has tightened recently. One subject of concern has been the currency mismatches that have arisen in the wake of domestic companies relying more extensively than before on external commercial borrowings. A related problem is that many domestic corporate issuers of foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) might face refunding risks by March 2013, when it would be time for redemption. The conversion prices on many of these bonds are much higher than the current prices of the linked equity shares, and it is unlikely that the gap will narrow. The Indian banking system remains well capitalised, with both core capital adequacy and leverage ratios ruling at comfortable levels. Even as credit off-take has rebounded recently, asset quality has improved although certain specific sectors of the economy could pose problems. For now, a rise in net interest income has boosted the profitability of banks, but over the near-term rising costs may weigh in. Banks need to be vigilant in facing up to interest rate risks in the prevailing inflation scenario.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-clean-chit-for-now/article2145130.ece
29,6,2011,Old fears in Thai election,"The July 3 parliamentary election in Thailand is the culmination of a bitter five-year-political battle that haunted the country, leading to constant unrest and uncertainty. In December 2007, a year after the Thai Army removed the billionaire Prime Minister Thakshin Shinawatra in a coup and banned his political party, its proxy, the People Power Party, managed to win the parliamentary elections impressively. However, within a year, it found itself outmanoeuvred, and the opposition Democrat Party led by Abhisit Vejjajiva put together a coalition and took office. Since then, there has been a rash of protests resulting in bouts of political paralysis. Last year, security forces put down anti-government protesters with bullets, leaving some 90 people dead. Clearly, in the coming election, Mr. Thaksin, who lives in self-exile abroad after fleeing Thailand to escape prosecution on corruption charges, is eager to avenge his 2006 removal. His party, now called the Pheu Thai, has fielded his sister Yingluck Shinawatra as the prime ministerial candidate. Evidently, the former Prime Minister hopes to run the country through her. There are fears that the election itself will not remove the tensions between the colour-coded political camps — Red Shirts, comprising mainly the rural and urban poor, for the Shinawatra clan; and Yellow Shirts, made up of the prosperous old ruling elites, for Mr. Abhisit and his Democrat Party — until Thailand addresses the deeper malaise of the military's role in politics.
The Royal Thai Army — which has carried out a total of 18 coups, and like the Pakistan Army, has played a backroom role supported by the monarchy during times of civilian rule — is a powerful player in this election. Army chief Prayuth Chan-Ocha declared recently that as a neutral entity, it had no intention of meddling in the election. But his warning that the monarchy was under threat and his demand that voters must elect “good people” have left no one in doubt that the Army has already made its choice. General Prayuth led the 2006 coup, and his televised speech came as polls predicted Mr. Thaksin's PTP in the lead. With the Army having helped put together the 2008 Democrat Party-led coalition, there is concern that if the Pheu Thai Party wins this election it will not be allowed to remain in office for long. On the other hand, it is certain too that the political roiling will continue should voters choose the Democrats — Mr. Thaksin has enough money and street power to ensure that the government will never have it easy. Either way, it appears that political peace in Thailand is still a distant prospect.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/old-fears-in-thai-election/article2145128.ece
30,6,2011,Flawed medium and message,"If regular elections and a constitutionally mandated separation of powers have been the traditional hallmarks of democracy, frequent and effective communication between leaders and citizens is surely a key ingredient of a modern republic. In India, however, our principal political leaders seldom speak without the prop of a prepared text. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh fields questions when he travels abroad but has held only two press conferences and two interactions with editors in Delhi in the past seven years. As for interviews, he has allowed himself to be questioned by an Indian newspaper only once and never by an Indian news channel. Congress president Sonia Gandhi, too, has not really been heard from at close quarters except for the briefest of triumphal soundbites just after the Rajya Sabha passed the Women's Reservation Bill. These are extraordinary facts by any yardstick. They speak either of our leaders' lack of confidence or their lack of concern for addressing the sort of questions a democratic polity throws up from time to time. This absence of communication is made worse by the dissonance generated by disparate voices from the ruling party and government. If Dr. Singh bemoans the media helping to create an “atmosphere of cynicism” all around, he and the government and the Congress have only themselves to blame.
The Prime Minister's interaction with a small group of editors was intended to clear the air on issues like corruption but his answers will likely have the opposite effect. Dr. Singh sought refuge in the claim that the decisions for which his government is being pilloried now “post facto” were taken under conditions of “uncertainty” and that the accusations of wrongdoing and corruption would paralyse the government and discourage “entrepreneurial impulses.” Nothing could be further from the truth. There was no uncertainty about true prices, for example, when bloated contracts were awarded to companies during the Commonwealth Games. And the CBI's charge sheet makes it clear that 2G spectrum was not distributed by the Telecom ministry under uncertain conditions at all: Former minister A. Raja and his associates and the companies that allegedly colluded with them knew very well what the true value of the licences were. Dr. Singh's biggest blunder, however, was to upbraid the Comptroller and Auditor General, one of the few state institutions that the public at large still has faith in. Since it is thanks to the CAG report on 2G that the criminal investigation into the telecom scam really got moving, ordinary Indians are likely to view the Prime Minister's remarks as further evidence of the unwillingness of this government to seriously tackle the problem of graft.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/flawed-medium-and-message/article2148075.ece
30,6,2011,Rowling & the future of reading,"For years J.K. Rowling refused to release e-book editions of the hugely successful Harry Potter series, citing piracy concerns. Of course, this had the opposite effect; the traffic in illegal e-copies of her seven HP novels reached record proportions. Now the author has done a complete turnaround by announcing the launch of Pottermore.com, a website that will carry digital editions of her books. While Ms Rowling's hand may have been forced, her plan is revolutionary in some critical respects and has implications for the future of digital publishing. Since Pottermore.com will be the single legal source for the HP e-books, it is likely to demonstrate that successful authors can find a way around major e-book sellers, who take a share of the profit; predictably, some have reacted with alarm to the author's initiative. The books will not be under the restrictive Digital Rights Management (DRM) regime, which means they will not be locked on one platform but can be accessed on a variety of electronic book reading devices; the piracy problem will be tackled by means of a digital watermark that can assist in tracking those who illegally share a purchased e-book.
Pottermore.com, which will be up and running in October 2011, has been conceived as much more than a website selling e-book editions of the HP series. Yes of course, there will be new material about the characters and places. But the real attraction of the website, on which Ms Rowling has worked for about a year in close collaboration with web developers, will be its interactivity. Expect to find illustrations, quizzes, gaming, video streaming, and meet other HP fans online. The digital revolution has already had a huge impact on the book trade, and the e-book sales have seen an explosive growth worldwide. Recently, Amazon.com, which describes itself as the “world's biggest bookstore,” announced that it now sells more electronic books than print editions. But the way we read and learn in the future is also likely to be transformed, given the potential the web holds for interactivity. Last month, in a presentation that outlined his company's vision for the future, the CEO of Penguin Books, John Makinson, talked of embedding interactive content such as audio and video streaming into its e-books. Apart from providing a new kind of reading experience, such interactivity has enormous potential as a teaching and learning aid. So while Ms Rowling's new experiment may be viewed as a business venture by a phenomenally successful writer, at another level she may be a step ahead of others in foreseeing the evolution of reading.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rowling-the-future-of-reading/article2148074.ece
1,7,2011,The tide of war in Afghanistan,"“The tide of war,” President Barack Obama said of Afghanistan earlier this month, “is receding.” The storming on Wednesday of the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul, which claimed the lives of 12 civilians, was a sharp riposte. Believed to have been carried out by a suicide squad despatched by the Taliban-affiliated warlord Jalaluddin Haqqani, the assault isn't the most lethal the country has seen this summer: suicide attacks, bombings, and ambushes continue reaping the lives of Afghans in ever greater numbers. In a report released this week, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said violence in Afghanistan caused 2,950 civilian casualties, including 1,090 deaths, in the last three months — up a dramatic 20 per cent from the number for the same period in 2010. It said anti-government forces were responsible for eight in ten of the killings; one-tenth were caused by Afghan and allied forces; and a tenth could not be attributed to either side. Noting that “suicide attacks have increased significantly since March,” the report observes that “abductions and assassinations of Afghan citizens also rose.” Fighting has escalated in the country's east, and jihadist groups like the Islamist Movement of Uzbekistan are reported to have an increasing operational capability in the north, an area long considered relatively peaceful.
Earlier this month, Mr. Obama announced a schedule for the withdrawal of 33,000 troops from Afghanistan by the end of next summer, a precursor to a final pullout. His claims notwithstanding, Afghanistan is being left to its fate: none of the strategies intended to lay stable foundations for the future has worked. Last year's surge of troops did cause heavy attrition among the Taliban, but failed to contain violence. The United States and its allies, which have now held three rounds of meetings with interlocutors for the Taliban in Europe and the United Arab Emirates, also hoped the surge would push the jihadists into agreeing to a peace deal. However, secure in the knowledge that its superpower adversary is leaving, the Taliban have good reason to escalate violence — suffering attrition in the hope of demonstrating to its supporters that it drove the U.S. out, and to its enemies, that its rise is inexorable. Islamabad, in turn, continues to shelter and fund the Jalaluddin Haqqani network as well as other Taliban elements, in return for their help in battling jihadists seeking to overthrow the Pakistani state. In the months to come, more blood will be spilt as both Afghan jihadists and their adversaries compete to secure their positions in anticipation of the final U.S. pullout. Barring a miracle, Afghanistan has little to look forward to other than a rising tide of blood.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-tide-of-war-in-afghanistan/article2151118.ece
1,7,2011,Removing barriers,"Creating an enabling environment for people with disability should be among the foremost policy concerns for India, as it makes large investments in infrastructure. The national approach to the question of improved accessibility and opportunity for the disabled has — barring a few exceptions such as access to polling booths — been one of half-measures. Last year, the Centre took the welcome step of constituting a committee to draft a new law to replace the ineffective Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 but failed to press ahead. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment should hasten the framing of this law with emphasis on removing barriers that affect people with disabilities of different kinds. This is no doubt a demanding task but the World Report on Disability by the World Health Organisation offers comprehensive resources for policy-making. The overarching goal must be to help the disabled achieve physical mobility, social interaction, and gainful employment.
Universal design is the core principle guiding accessibility. For that to become the norm, India must adopt a culture of accessibility at all levels of government. It must also set mandatory standards. The benefits of changes produced by such measures as friendly footpaths, properly designed toilets, ramp-equipped public buildings, and easy-to-use transport will not be confined to the disabled but will cover a broader range of citizens, including parents with small children and the elderly. Transport access brings new opportunity, and in the case of people with disability the entire travel chain has to be considered for modification. Mainstreaming these goals would require a robust law and a regime of audits and certification. For existing public facilities, an active retrofitting programme will be necessary. Information and Communication Technology has immense potential to assist the disabled, and legal standards would make many more gadgets accessible; the United States has laws that lay down such requirements for telephones, television, and information kiosks. Beyond physical and systemic barriers, though, there is the attitudinal. A glaring example of prejudice is discrimination in employment, which the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities prohibits. These are major challenges, but there is no reason why they cannot be addressed with sufficient political will, given the assertive national mood seeking measures to benefit different classes of citizens.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/removing-barriers/article2151117.ece
3,7,2011,Scrubbing out criticism,"The Google Transparency Report for July to December 2010 makes this unflattering revelation: the number of requests from Indian authorities for disclosure of data about Internet users and for removal of content from websites has risen sharply. As a measure of intolerance and attempts at censorship, the Transparency Report now provides more data for analysis than in the past. The role played by governments in the deletion of content is among the additional features. On the face of it, India's requests may appear to be unexceptional. After all, several democracies, not to speak of countries with less tolerant regimes, have made similar demands on Google. What does set India apart from genuinely liberal countries is the nature of the content sought to be scrubbed out and the agencies involved. Most of the removal requests pertain to allegedly defamatory postings on websites such as YouTube and Blogger, and specific web search results. That they have been made by executive agencies and the police without recourse to due process is bad enough. What makes them ridiculous is that the authorities targeted online content critical of Chief Ministers and senior officials of different States. Google has done well to mostly reject these blatant attempts at censorship, complying with only 22 per cent of the cases. It is noteworthythat this is a low acceptance rate compared with other robust democracies.
The resort to non-judicial processes to curb Internet freedom in the majority of cases pertaining to India is part of a disturbing trend. It is of a piece with the new rules framed under the Information Technology Act 2000, diluting fundamental freedoms and ushering in a culture of suffocating surveillance. On content removal, it needs to be pointed out that in the United States, Google acted on court orders to remove material deemed defamatory. In Britain, fraudulent advertising linked to scams was removed. Naturally, the compliance rate for both countries is high, unlike the Indian experience. These pointers must convince India that its heavy-handed approach to scrub inconvenient speech off the Internet is earning it worldwide notoriety. It is also time the central government changed its Orwellian course on the question of privacy. Too much emphasis is placed on creating comprehensive, inter-linked databases citing security, without giving sufficient thought to data protection. Moreover, the new rules under the IT Act require intermediaries such as cyber-cafes and Internet Service Providers to retain personal data for long periods, increasing the likelihood of misuse. Correcting these aberrations, which do not sit well with tenets of democracy, is the right thing to do.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/scrubbing-out-criticism/article2156223.ece
3,7,2011,The twist in the Strauss-Kahn tale,"The bottom seems all but knocked out of the sexual assault case against Dominique Strauss-Kahn. The dramatic change in the fortunes of the former chief of the International Monetary Fund, who has been released from house arrest, is a result of the discovery that the Guinean hotel maid who accused him had told a string of lies about her background as well as her actions on the day of the alleged sexual assault. The ground-shifting revelations include her falsifying details in her application for political asylum, including fabricating a story about being raped and beaten up in Guinea; her telling an incarcerated drug dealer — the day after she levelled rape charges — that she could make money off the case; and her puzzling behaviour of entering another room after the alleged assault and returning to clean Mr. Strauss-Kahn's suite before reporting the incident. All of this may fall short of proving there was no attempted rape. Although called into question time and again, strictly speaking the reputation of a woman — including such things as her sexual or criminal history — is irrelevant in determining whether she was a victim of rape. However, given the nature of the heinous crime alleged, corroborative evidence is difficult to come by; as a result, courts depend a great deal on the credibility of the victim and her testimony.
In the Strauss-Kahn case, the forensic evidence establishes that a sexual encounter did take place in his Manhattan hotel suite. The issue was always whether this was consensual or forced. If the case does come up for trial, which seems unlikely at this juncture, the new revelations about the maid and her actions would leave any jury extremely sceptical that she was being truthful about what took place. Mr. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers are bound to portray him as a victim of an extortionist trap. If the case is given the burial that many now expect, the focus of attention will turn to Mr. Strauss-Kahn's political future. If he is cleared of all charges, his supporters will hope he will reclaim his position as the Socialist Party's front-runner for next year's French Presidential election. However, with the prosecution deciding to push on with the investigation, Mr. Strauss-Kahn could be running out of time. His party's primary for selecting its candidate to contest against President Nicolas Sarkozy is to take place in October. It also remains to be seen whether the slew of reports about his extra-marital affairs and his habit of making unwelcome advances, which appeared in the media soon after he was charged with attempted rape, will retard a quick and complete political rehabilitation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-twist-in-the-strausskahn-tale/article2156225.ece
4,7,2011,The making of the new champ,"Novak Djokovic's most impressive achievement isn't his victory at Wimbledon or his ascent to top of men's tennis; it's that he managed both these accomplishments, a childhood dream and a long-term goal as he later described them, in an era that Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal have made their own. For a while Djokovic appeared to be no more than a warm-up act to the enthralling, storied rivalry between two of the greatest players of all time. Between them, Federer and Nadal won 24 of the 28 Grand Slam tournaments that were played in the seven years preceding 2011. Dominance in sport affects the rest of the field in two ways: most can't stand the pressure and settle for mediocrity; a few refuse to yield and are forced to heights perhaps even they mightn't have imagined. Djokovic never doubted which group he belonged to. Although the Serb's progress after his breakthrough win — at the 2008 Australian Open — wasn't as he would have wished, his drive didn't suffer. He committed to getting better, knowing the results mightn't show immediately. Winning the Davis Cup late last year was a turnaround: he later said that the fear of losing didn't grip him as severely any longer.
The liberation from fear led to Djokovic becoming the best tennis player of 2011. His only defeat in 49 matches was to an inspired Federer at the French Open. With every victory, his belief strengthened. The 24-year-old's singular year has been driven by significant advancements in technique and fitness. His forehand, which often broke down, became more solid and better balanced; his serve gained from a minor adjustment, helping him set up points better. With these enhancements, his piercing two-handed backhand, always a weapon, grew more potent. Excellent at defensive play, he could now dictate the tempo as well. Djokovic's improved physical conditioning, which was aided in part by a gluten-free diet, was just as vital. The knowledge that he could stay with Nadal in the long rally — not only could he cover court as well, he could also hit with similar intensity in the later stages of the point — protected him against the pressure to do too much too soon. In short, he could do to Nadal what the Spaniard usually did to others. As Nadal graciously admitted after the Wimbledon final, his fifth defeat to Djokovic this year, his play no longer seems to bother his rival; he has to find solutions against Djokovic. From being coerced by Federer and Nadal to raise his game to compelling the great champions to lift theirs, Djokovic has come a long way. Tennis is extraordinarily fortunate that the careers of these three men have coincided.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-making-of-the-new-champ/article2159074.ece
4,7,2011,Don't squander the mandate,"Guided by her brother from his exile in Dubai, Yingluck Shinawatra, current head of his party, Pheu Thai, has won a massive mandate from the people of Thailand, who gave her an absolute majority in parliament and the country its first woman Prime Minister. Demonstrating level-headedness, she has opted for a coalition government with four smaller parties. Thaksin Shinawatra, the telecom-king-turned-politician, was thrown out of power in 2006 in a military coup, and convicted in a corruption case two years later. Although there are apprehensions that he has a remote control in hand, it would be unfair to pre-judge the political course Ms Yingluck is going to take. During her election campaign, she promised to put an end to the economic woes of the country and bring about reconciliation in a divided society. The question now is whether she will stick to her poll promises or, emboldened by the scale of her party's victory, overstep her mandate and try and bring back her brother from exile by offering him some kind of amnesty.
While the vote for Pheu Thai and Ms Yingluck could very well be described as a decisive endorsement of Mr. Thaksin himself, it will need a lot of tact and diplomacy from the incoming Prime Minister to deal with the meddlesome military, the opposition, the judiciary, and the monarch to stabilise the national situation. Political adventurism is the last thing Thailand needs at this moment. Its economy is in poor shape. The price of Thai rice, a major export commodity, has fallen sharply in recent months, and the currency, the Baht, remains weak. The new government needs to concentrate on these bread-and-butter issues instead of working on legislation or political diplomacy to bring Mr. Thaksin back from exile. For his part, the former Prime Minister needs to restrain his overweening ambition and content himself with playing a mentor's role for now, wishing his sister and her political career well. The military must accept the people's verdict and work with the new administration to restore credibility and law and order across the kingdom. Outgoing Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva did the right thing by resigning as leader of the Democrat Party and promising to play a constructive role in opposition. An element of uncertainty has been introduced by the election commission's announcement that it would investigate complaints of electoral fraud and come up with the final tally within a month. Thailand has suffered enough for want of political stability and from the incessant military coups. It is time its government, the various political parties, the military, and other institutions of state gave democracy a real chance to do well.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dont-squander-the-mandate/article2159076.ece
6,7,2011,The property of black money,"Since the time of Dadabhai Naoroji, Indians have always been captivated by the idea that our national wealth is slowly being drained abroad. That is why the Supreme Court's decision to set up a Special Investigation Team to ensure the return of money stashed abroad will be widely welcomed. What happens to the ill-gotten gains stashed at home, however, is anybody's guess. Black money is generated by the desire to evade taxes and hide assets disproportionate to known sources of income but populist political discourse on the subject has paid scant attention to this dynamic. Understandably, the focus is on the more emotional — but hard to quantify — problem of illegal bank deposits abroad. Upset by the slow progress made by the government's High Level Committee on the return of black money, the Supreme Court has now justly decided that its work must be supervised. To the extent political considerations are undermining the fight against black money, the SIT could act as a welcome antidote. But the court may also wish to frame the problem more comprehensively. Black money, after all, refers to the sum total of unaccounted income, and not just the funds spirited away to Switzerland, Lichtenstein, or some other foreign safe haven. The SIT must identify the legal and diplomatic tools the government can use to pierce this veil of secrecy. But unless it comes to grips with the overall pathology of black money, the political economy of India is likely to remain vulnerable to corruption.
In proceeding against unaccounted money, the judiciary — which scores high in public esteem — must push for urgent and far-reaching reforms in the way the Indian property market functions. Corruption in government contracts and licensing may generate large individual chunks of black money but for sheer overall volume, the top culprit is property. Every day, property transactions up and down the country add to the national stock of unaccounted money. Simply put, buyers and sellers collude in under-reporting the true value of the transaction. Usually, more than half the true sale price is paid in cash, depriving the state of capital gains tax and stamp duty. The cash received is often recycled back into the property market, where the returns are extremely high. What this means is that the focus of public activism, political outrage, and judicial concern on black money ought to be as much inward as it is westward. Seizing the moment, the SIT can and must devise a way to bring our wealth back from abroad. But if it can also push for simple reforms in the property market to clean up transactions, it could make a huge contribution towards ending the problem of black money.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-property-of-black-money/article2201457.ece
6,7,2011,Murder most foul,"What do you do with a 13-year-old who on a Sunday afternoon sneaks into your compound and plucks a fruit? Whatever else you may do, you don't shoot him dead. The brutal July 3 murder of Dilson inside the Old Fort Glacis Officers' Enclave near Island Grounds in Chennai has justly caused public outrage and nothing short of the early arrest of the killer will assuage the ruffled sentiments of the community, especially the family and neighbours of the victim. Dilson, son of a poor couple living nearby, and one of his friends reportedly trespassed into the residential enclave in search of badam nut. Details of the investigation available so far indicate that he was fired upon from inside the compound. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa has voiced her severe condemnation and sternly demanded that the suspect be handed over to the State police for investigation. On record, the Army authorities have claimed that they are providing full assistance to the Crime Branch-CID of the State police, which has taken over the investigation, and that all those in the vicinity, including Army personnel and a civilian security guard on duty at that time in the compound, have been made available for investigation. However, one cannot but note with dismay that the defence authorities were reluctant to acknowledge the victim's family's version that the boy was shot — until the autopsy report confirmed that he died of a bullet wound on his head. This does carry the scent of an attempted cover-up.
If the killer turns out to be one from the military — and especially an officer of some seniority, as is suspected — it will be a blot on the Army's reputation. After all, Chennai is far from any zone of conflict, and the scene of the crime was hardly close to any sensitive installation to provide the slightest excuse for opening fire at the first sight of an intruder. Any attempt to justify the killing on the ground that the boy's presence posed any imminent security threat will be highly specious. Instead, it would be in the interest of justice as well as the Army's reputation if its top officers stepped in and helped nail the culprit. The investigation is no easy task as the Army maintains that there was no armed guard present in the vicinity. Expert reports based on forensic and ballistic examination may hold the key to cracking the case. While there is little reason to doubt that the CB-CID will ultimately zero in on the suspect with judicially acceptable evidence, one hopes that the delay in apprehending the killer does not prove costly by affording enough time for the weapon involved being disposed of without a trace.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/murder-most-foul/article2201458.ece
6,7,2011,End this drift on Telangana,"When a government in drift mode adopts delay as a political tactic, the end result often is a crisis that becomes intractable. In the six months after the B.N. Srikrishna Committee submitted its report on the Telangana tangle, the United Progressive Alliance government did virtually nothing — not so much in the hope that the problem would go away as in the fear that any forward movement could trigger another round of violent agitations. This course of events was anticipated, and indeed cautioned against, by Mr. Srikrishna, whose report concluded with a quote from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel: “It will be a folly to ignore realities; facts take their revenge if they are not faced squarely and well.” The report provided the basis for the government to push for a consensus on the strength of some viable proposals, which included the creation of an empowered Regional Council within the State. But instead of completing this process as expeditiously as possible, the government took the soft option of waiting for things to happen rather than making them happen. Keeping Andhra Pradesh united with “constitutional/statutory measures to address the core socioeconomic concerns about the development of the Telangana region” (as suggested in the report) is workable, but it will need a consensus that can be achieved only through broad-based and amicable consultations.
Quite astonishingly, the Centre practically abdicated its role and let Congress party managers try and clinch backroom deals with the Telangana Rashtra Samiti, which spearheads the separate statehood movement. Such political manipulations to counteract the effect of what clearly is a movement with huge popular support in the Telangana region were bound to fail. The Congress now faces a situation where its own Members of Parliament and Members of the Legislative Assembly have submitted their resignation in an attempt to pressure the central government to concede the demand for a Telangana State. But just as there is support in Telangana for a separate State, a majority of the people in Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema favour a united Andhra Pradesh. Even in Hyderabad, envisaged as the capital of Telangana, many of the elected representatives have not joined the resignation drama, an indication that statehood does not have the same resonance in the cosmopolitan capital as it does in the rest of the region. A political consensus is therefore a must, and the central government should pro-actively work towards creating such a consensus instead of letting matters drift. So far as the people of India are concerned, what is at stake is the future of Andhra Pradesh, not the survival of the UPA or the Congress regime in the State.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/end-this-drift-on-telangana/article2162180.ece
6,7,2011,A powerful concept,"""Archean to Anthropocene, the past is the key to the future” is the theme of the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America to be held in Minnesota in October 2011. Anthropocene is not part of the geological timescale; it's the name of a new epoch and is yet to be formally adopted by the International Commission on Stratigraphy. The concept of Anthropocene, proposed in 2000 by Nobel Laureate Paul J. Crutzen, brings into focus the several human activities that have adversely impacted and caused irreversible damage to more than half of the earth's ice-free landmass. It also stands to represent the indelible imprint left behind by man on many natural systems. The global concentration of carbon dioxide, coinciding with the advent of the industrial revolution, marks the beginning of the new epoch. Large-scale conversion of forests into cropland and the lethal combination of industrial revolution and fossil fuel use have led to a sudden increase in carbon dioxide and other environmentally harmful gases in the atmosphere. The increase in CO{-2} has happened despite the presence of many natural buffering systems — and in an extraordinarily brief geological time frame. The increased levels of the greenhouse gas have caused a cascading effect: the global mean temperature has gone up by 1°C during the last century, and will probably keep rising. The oceans, which act as carbon sinks, have turned acidic by absorbing more carbon. But the expected rise in acidity by 0.3-0.4 pH by the end of this century may affect corals and dissolve the carbonated shells of many marine organisms. Nearly 20 per cent of the species found in large areas are invasive, and the disappearance of many species has certain markings of large-scale extinction.
The current epoch — Holocene — is just about 11,500 years old. Epochs typically extend for many million years, and the beginning is defined as changes preserved in the rocks. Since the epoch-changing events by humans have taken place at an astonishingly accelerated rate, the rocks may not have registered them. But the chemical and biological changes unleashed by humans are set to have a long-lasting effect on the environment and ecology. They are bound to leave their footprints on the rocks even if the man's destructive activities were to end tomorrow. Anthropocene, if it is formally accepted, will probably be called an ‘age,' a subunit of an epoch. But the concept is powerful: it can bring about radical changes in the mindset of scientists and policymakers in understanding the effects of human-nature interactions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-powerful-concept/article2162182.ece
7,7,2011,"Exit Maran, and beyond","The resignation of Textiles Minister Dayanidhi Maran from the Union Cabinet on account of his actions as Telecom Minister between May 2004 and May 2007 has clearly been brought about by the pressure of circumstances rather than by any inclination on the part of the United Progressive Alliance government to do right. This belated exit has come a day after the Central Bureau of Investigation told the Supreme Court of India that there was “prima facie material to suggest that there was an element of coercion by the former Telecom Minister in Aircel selling its shares to a Malaysian telecom company.” The CBI has also submitted that Mr. Maran sat on Aircel's licence application for months until the company came under the control of a new and favoured owner. That this exit from the Cabinet could be delayed until the country's premier investigative agency formally informed the Supreme Court that Mr. Maran was under investigation proves yet again that the UPA government has fallen into the habit of covering up allegations of corruption — as WikiLeaks Editor-in-Chief Julian Assange commented in an interview to The Hindu. Controversy after controversy, scandal after scandal, scam after scam has demonstrated that the government maintains an amoral silence or sticks to convenient inaction or argument in the face of material or circumstantial evidence of wrongdoing for as long as it is legally possible and politically expedient.
The onus is now on the investigative agency to act speedily in uncovering the whole sequence of events relating to Aircel's purchase by the Maxis Group, including the rationale and timing of policy changes such as raising the FDI limit in the telecom sector to 74 per cent; Mr. Maran's insistence on spectrum pricing remaining with his Ministry rather than being brought under a Group of Ministers; and his allocation of mobile phone licences for a throwaway price to Aircel after its promoter C. Sivasankaran was coerced into selling it to the Maxis group. The agency is also reported to be investigating whether this involved a quid pro quo, as the same Malaysian group invested substantially in the direct-to-home and FM radio businesses of the Sun TV group owned by Mr. Maran's elder brother, Kalanithi Maran. All these aspects, and not just the role of Mr. Maran as Telecom Minister, must be thoroughly investigated. It is now clear that 2G spectrum allocation is India's biggest ever corruption scandal not only in terms of the mind-boggling sums involved — but also in the devious ways in which policy and personal interests coalesced. Elementary issues signalling a conflict of interest were deliberately ignored. Can there be the slightest doubt that this government, which is headed by a Prime Minister whose personal financial probity is undisputed but which has earned a reputation for unrivalled corruption, has much to answer for?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/exit-maran-and-beyond/article2208333.ece
7,7,2011,Delicately poised,"Economic data from across the globe strongly suggest that the world economy has been slowing down recently. Factory output has declined perceptibly. In the advanced economies, the financial markets have been sliding and there is a distinct loss of confidence among investors. Consumer spending in the developed world has not picked up to the extent expected. Crude oil prices have been rising on supply uncertainties and the trend is likely to continue. High petroleum prices result in a transfer of wealth from cash-strapped consumers to producers who generally sit on their windfall earnings and do not contribute to global economic recovery. The twin natural disasters in Japan not only caused its GDP to fall sharply but seriously disrupted supply chains across the world, halting assembly lines in many countries. In the emerging economies such as India, inflation has been high and, as the authorities hike interest rates, the growth in output has slowed from its heady pace. On the other hand, recovery in the advanced economies has been anaemic, ominously so at a time when there is a serious talk of their governments withdrawing the stimulus packages. Taken together, global economic growth is seen to be at its weakest since recovery began two years ago.
Yet while these are genuine concerns, there are good reasons to be optimistic. Previous fears of a “double dip” recession in the developed world did not materialise, and this time too, despite some hiccups, the world economy should recover in the latter part of the year. As the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook points out, the global economy has continued to grow at 4.3 per cent, the rate indicated in its earlier forecast for 2011-12. Although downside risks have increased significantly — notably from the greater than anticipated weakness in the U.S. economy and the European debt crisis — they have been compensated substantially by certain “off-setting” factors. If Japan's twin natural disasters were an unpleasant surprise, the strong performance of France and Germany has been hugely positive. As Japan's reconstruction gets under way, the rebound of its economy is forecast to offset any weaker growth in the U.S. Much will depend upon how the European debt crisis is resolved. The way the developed countries confront their major fiscal challenges will determine the course of recovery. Sadly, one of the fundamental tasks — repairing the financial sector — has so far not been fully addressed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/delicately-poised/article2208335.ece
9,7,2011,A landmark verdict,"“Laws cannot remain silent when the cannons roar,” the Supreme Court of India declared earlier this week, upturning Cicero's dictum to pronounce a historic judgment on the violent darkness that has enveloped the heart of India in Chhattisgarh. While the State and Union governments have predictably announced their intention to seek a review, the court's decision to disarm and disband the forces of mostly young, barely literate, and poorly trained Special Police Officers (SPOs) deployed by the state in the fight against Maoist insurgents is a blow for constitutional order. “Modern constitutionalism,” the court noted, “posits that no wielder of power should be allowed to claim the right to perpetrate ... violence against anyone, much less its own citizens, unchecked by law and notions of innate human dignity of every individual.” The burden of the judgment is simple: the country does face a threat from the Maoist insurgency but any attempt by the state to use “lawless violence” as a counter will only perpetuate and intensify the cycle of violence, as “the death toll revealed by the Government of Chhattisgarh” itself indicates. By default as well as design, the SPOs — whether organised under the name of ‘Salwa Judum' or ‘Koya Commandos' — have become the chief instrument of this lawless and failed counter-insurgency strategy. Innocent tribals have been the primary victims, either as targets of the SPOs or as poorly trained foot soldiers in a bloody war the government is not even prepared to properly finance.
In demanding an end to the SPO system, the Supreme Court has acted as much out of concern for the hapless tribal population of Dantewada as for the tribal youth who were press-ganged by their individual circumstances into becoming “cannon fodder” for the state. Chhattisgarh as well as the Union of India were guilty of violating the fundamental rights of citizens at large and the SPOs themselves. The court has also made the link between Chhattisgarh's illegal counter-insurgency strategy and the wider “neoliberal” approach being followed by the government at the Central and State levels. This approach is spawning disaffection among the poor and giving a boost to insurgency. The Salwa Judum is the illegitimate product of a system that sees nothing wrong in giving tax breaks to the rich and guns to the poor to fight each other, the court said. But the Constitution “is most certainly not a ‘pact for national suicide',” it concluded in ordering an end to this state of affairs. These are profound words. Both the Union of India and Chhattisgarh must immediately implement this splendid expression of judicial wisdom, not waste time in seeking a review.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-landmark-verdict/article2211596.ece
9,7,2011,"Truth to power, Sangakkara style","Kumar Sangakkara is regarded in cricket circles as an intelligent man unafraid to say it as he sees it, an original thinker whose thoughts extend beyond the game. At the MCC Spirit of Cricket lecture, which the former Sri Lankan captain delivered on July 4 at Lord's, he trapped lightning in a bottle: never were his ideas more forceful; never was his articulation as lucid and felicitous. In an hour-long speech that earned a standing ovation, he told the evocative story of cricket's transformative power in his strife-torn land. While his discourse was centred on Sri Lankan cricket, its evolution and its uniqueness, it wasn't confined to it. One of the speech's many virtues was that — through the example of Sri Lankan cricket — it addressed the larger problems the world game faces. In confronting the issues of cricket in his country, Sangakkara spoke truth to power. He challenged those in charge to hold themselves to higher standards, indeed to “adopt the values enshrined by the [Sri Lankan] team over the years: integrity, transparency, commitment and discipline.” The universality of the message and the courage of its expression will have shaken administrators around the world.
This wonderfully gifted cricketer traced the problems in administration to 1996, when his country won the World Cup. While the underdog saga inspired several young Sri Lankans to dedicate their best efforts to playing the game, the attendant financial success resulted in “the transformation of our cricket administration from a volunteer-led organisation run by well-meaning men of integrity into a multi-million dollar organisation that has been in turmoil ever since.” Sangakkara detailed the detrimental effect the power games had on the cricket team: corruption, lobbying, and manipulation for political gains created ill-feeling and distrust in the side, and the world champion crashed out of the 1999 World Cup after the first phase. The debacle acted as a catalyst for change. The cricketers got together to insulate themselves from the machinations of the board and commit themselves to winning. But there was no change in the system — with the problems of greed and narrow-mindedness persisting. Unsurprisingly, the administration has responded with the sort of truculence common to those who have interests to protect. The Sri Lankan Sports Minster's assertion that Sangakkara had to “get permission” to talk about cricket administration isn't merely high-handed; it's also against the principles of free speech. Instead of reacting defensively, those in power in Sri Lanka must introspect and reform themselves. Other governing bodies must act likewise, for, as recent incidents across the world have shown, this is a turbulent time for cricket.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/truth-to-power-sangakkara-style/article2211595.ece
11,7,2011,"Close of a story, end of an era","Looking at pictures of Emma Watson at the London premiere of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, in a pixie haircut and a tiered Oscar de la Renta dress, it was hard to believe this was Hermione Granger, the girl who 10 years ago looked like she could fit into your back pocket. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was released in 1997 and its massive success ensured a film version in 2001, when Daniel Radcliffe was just a moon-faced child. Since then, six novels have followed, engendering a Potter-mania to rival Beatle-mania, along with a film franchise that has become the highest grossing of all time (not adjusted for inflation). If there's a bigger story, it's the rags-to-riches journey of the author, J.K. Rowling, who was living on benefits while she dreamed up, on a train from Manchester to London, the saga of a boy wizard. She has since become the first author to earn over a billion dollars through her writing. And now, anticipating the last on-screen adventure, millions of moviegoers around the world might emulate Emma Watson on the red carpet and dissolve into tears that it has all finally come to an end.
What made the series so successful that you heard of people buying multiple copies of the books so that they could read alongside their children? It was the escape into a richly imagined fantasy, no doubt, but there was something more. The series eschewed the moral, philosophical, and religious undercurrents of C.S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia books, and the densely mystical allegories of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings novels. It also made no pretence of aspiring to the literary greatness of these books. Rowling borrowed from both Tolkien and Lewis but she chose to address the here and the now. The death of loved ones. Rowdy friendships. Gamesmanship. The terror of stigmatisation. And a prospect far more intriguing to the adolescent: dating. Rowling may have filled her novels with flying broomsticks and magical spells, but readers responded because these fantastical elements were woven into a life that could just as easily unfold in a non-magical world. As the series progressed, Rowling became more ambitious. The novels became bigger, with more political subplots like the one about the liberation of enslaved house elves. The films responded by employing the services of renowned directors such as Alfonso Cuarón — not just to transfer plot to screen but also to impart a vision. The last of these visions is less than a week away, but in Rowling's universe there is always hope. She said recently: “It is my baby and if I want to bring it out to play again, I will.” Fans everywhere are hoping it's an Unbreakable Vow.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Close-of-a-story-end-of-an-era/article13738436.ece
11,7,2011,Spruce up the data,"Reserve Bank of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao's recent critical observations on the authenticity and quality of key economic data will be widely endorsed by those who rely on the data for myriad purposes both official and non-official. Coming from the head of an institution, which is the most significant user of such data for policymaking, the observations are particularly noteworthy. No doubt the quality and timeliness of economic statistics have been improving of late, thanks to the good work by the National Statistical Commission. Official efforts to comply with the International Monetary Fund's Special Data Dissemination Standards have also contributed to the improvement. Yet they are no where near the standards required for a modern, fast-growing economy. And this, 10 years after a committee headed by C. Rangarajan had given a blueprint on what needs to be done. India's GDP statistics are widely watched across the globe. It is understandable that the data will need to be adjusted along the way at different stages. But the extent of revisions seen recently calls into question the dependability of the data. For instance, the advanced estimate made in February 2010 pegged GDP growth for 2009-10 at 6.8 per cent. Three months later, it was revised to 7.7 per cent and again, in February 2011, to 9.1 per cent, a staggering 40 per cent variation in what is the most important number on the economy.
Policymaking based on such inaccurate, provisional data can lead to “sub-optimal results”. Another key indicator, the index of industrial production (IIP), which tracks the manufacturing sector, was extremely volatile last year. The RBI says it was misled by such ephemeral statistics, for instance, into underestimating its inflation projections. The RBI's initial forecast made at the end of March 2011 placed inflation at 5.5 per cent, which proved to be wide off the mark, and the figure had to be marked up by two to three percentage points. The data on inflation have suffered from certain well-known limitations. The Wholesale Price Index, which is now being released every month, is more like a producer price index. It is persisted with as a reference for policymaking only because attempts to evolve a harmonious and representative consumer price index have not succeeded. Interestingly, both the IIP and the WPI have undergone major makeovers recently. The base year for calculating them has been brought forward and their coverage widened to make them more representative. But in the case of the IIP the new base year itself is six years behind, and the index might be already obsolete.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Spruce-up-the-data/article13738435.ece
12,7,2011,Dealing with the doping menace,"Since the 2002 Commonwealth Games, India has faced major embarrassment in international sports because of doping by leading sportspersons. If the malady used to be deep in weightlifting, it has now spread alarmingly across Indian athletics. The news that eight athletes, including three members of the 2010 Commonwealth Games and Asian Games gold-medal winning 4x400 relay quartet, Mandeep Kaur, Ashwini Akkunji and Sin Jose, have tested positive is a matter of shame. Predictably, all have pleaded innocence, triggering a blame game. The suspicion points to coaches and administrators. In a quick response to the public outrage, the Sports Ministry has sacked the coach of the relay team from Ukraine, Yuriy Ogorodonik. Indian coaches who were assisting him have also been placed under suspension. Measures aimed at cleansing the system have been initiated, with Mukul Mudgal, former Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court and an expert in sports law, being appointed to enquire into the modus operandi of doping in Indian athletics.
Where the lure of money, privilege, and fame becomes irresistible, many athletes turn to doping as a short cut to success. Several coaches and doctors aid the racket. Sports administrators, if they are not directly complicit, often turn a Nelson's eye to the goings-on in the camps so long as success is ensured to enlarge their own influence. The logic of sending teams for training to Ukraine and other countries, with the same set of coaches who have been assisting them in India, is difficult to understand. This policy needs to be reviewed. The current scourge appears to be a calculated fraud by coaches, doctors, misguided athletes, and unscrupulous officials. Union Sports Minister Ajay Maken must be commended for making a tough stand against doping and stepping in boldly to make it clear that there will be zero tolerance of such practices. He surely knows that the malaise is deep-seated and that dismissing the foreign coach, who denies any wrongdoing, touches only the fringe. A thorough probe and stiff penalties for those abusing the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) code will help curb this menace. The public mood favours withdrawing the rewards and awards from the offending athletes. Since 2006, Indian athletes have remained prominently on the international dope-testing radar — without actually getting caught. Now, with the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) playing a leading role in catching the culprits, there is new hope that the dope cheats will be weeded out. Mr. Maken's insistence that punishment should be meted out to coaches and officials, apart from the athletes, reflects the mood of the sports fraternity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dealing-with-the-doping-menace/article2219202.ece
12,7,2011,Making railways safer,"Three accidents in less than a week and a toll of well over a hundred deaths seem to speak to the state of safety in Indian Railways. Each of these tragedies may be different but they convey the same grim message. Last week, a snag-hit vehicle stranded on the tracks of an unmanned level crossing in Kanshiramnagar in Uttar Pradesh was pulverised by a speeding Mathura-Shhapra express, killing all 38 members of a marriage party. The Railways always holds vehicles crossing the track at unmanned level crossings responsible for their safety, as trains have the right of way. Around noon on Sunday, 15 bogies of the Howrah-Delhi Kalka Mail derailed near Malwan, claiming 68 lives, with several passengers still missing. Pictures from the accident site speak volumes of the deadly tragedy. The Army and the disaster relief teams had to be called in for rescue work and to cut open the mangled sleeper coaches. In the third instance, an IED blast on the track near the Rangiya station in Assam resulted in the derailment of eight bogies of the Puri Express. Fortunately, there were no deaths in this case.
While the Indian Railways seems to have perfected rescue and relief operations following accidents, it has not met with much success when it comes to accident prevention. The safety drive, for which the Indian Railways secured massive funding in the 10th and 11th Plans, needs a review to identify the grey areas — be it signalling, track replacement, or the status of the rolling stock. In the Kalka Mail derailment, for instance, preliminary reports indicate that the driver had suddenly braked for some reason, which led to the derailment. Why did this happen, and why should it result in 15 bogies being thrown off the rails? The Railways needs to step up its maintenance record, track patrolling, and also review the role of both the Railway Protection Force and the Government Railway Police to make them more effective. Finally, there is the question of political stewardship for this Ministry. The fact that no Railway Minister of Cabinet rank has been appointed since May, when Mamata Banerjee resigned to become Chief Minister of West Bengal, does not send out a reassuring message on the importance the government attaches to this key portfolio. It might be too much to expect today's politicians to emulate Lal Bahadur Shastri who, in 1956, resigned accepting moral and constitutional responsibility for a railway accident at Ariyalur in Tamil Nadu that claimed 144 lives. But at least one hopes the impending Cabinet reshuffle will see the Railways placed in experienced and capable hands.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/making-railways-safer/article2219203.ece
13,7,2011,The wrong message,"If the long-awaited Union Cabinet reshuffle was intended to refurbish the scams-tainted image, and boost the declining political stock, of the Congress-led government, it has conspicuously failed to do so. The principal message sent out is one of political drift: that this United Progressive Alliance regime is stuck in a course that has taken a heavy toll on its reputation and that it is not willing to act boldly, taking well-calculated risks, to cleanse the system and raise the performance bar for policy-making and governance. As in most such exercises, there are welcome changes: some Ministers judged to be non-performers or underperformers being dropped, a few competent administrators raised to Cabinet rank, a couple of promising young faces inducted. But what stands out is the stickiness and indeed the apparent immovability of the heavyweights in the Cabinet irrespective of their performance, good or bad, and the measurable results of their tenure in office.
The change that raises deep concern over its motivation is the shifting of Jairam Ramesh out of the Ministry of Environment and Forests. He is one Minister who has distinguished himself in a vital and challenging area of governance — by studying environmental and climate change questions seriously, interacting with experts as well as the wider public, standing up to pressure from special interests, corporate as well as political, acting boldly and transparently, and doing valuable agenda-building. The government can argue that Mr. Ramesh's contribution has been rewarded by his elevation from Minister of State (with independent charge) to Cabinet rank and by his being entrusted with the big responsibility of Rural Development. But that argument would be ingenuous. One hopes that Jayanthi Natarajan, Mr. Ramesh's successor, will emulate his example and not allow the momentum he has built on key environmental and climate change issues to dissipate. It is disappointing that at a time when India's massive infrastructural deficits are under the spotlight, the crucial infrastructure ministries whose leadership can at best be described as lacklustre have been left in the same old hands, with Beni Prasad Verma being rewarded with Cabinet rank (for Steel) on account of the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections rather than for his performance. Particularly distressing is the manner in which Water Resources, a crucial Ministry, has been dealt with under UPA-II. It is a political football that has now been kicked back, as ‘additional charge,' to Pawan Kumar Bansal, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs. Finally, the door has been left half-open to the DMK so that it can send, should it so decide, replacements for the two Ministers who were compelled to resign. Textiles, which has been placed in the ‘additional charge' of Commerce Minister Anand Sharma, is surely a portfolio reserved for the aggrieved ally. If this is not a story of drift, what is?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-wrong-message/article2221945.ece
13,7,2011,Regulating microfinance,"The Microfinance Institutions (Development and Regulation) Bill, unveiled recently, envisions a larger regulatory role for the Reserve Bank of India and proposes that all microfinance institutions with net-owned funds of over Rs.5 lakh register with it. The RBI will define and fix what the Bill calls “an annual percentage rate”, to be charged by private MFIs, and also set the range within which it can operate. That rate will include interest, processing fees, service charges and any other charges or fees that are payable by the borrowers. Although these stipulations seek to remove a serious lacuna in the regulation of microfinance, they are extremely cumbersome and will be difficult to enforce. In mainline financial sector regulation, the accent has been on laying down broad rules for banks and others to follow. Moreover, given the low threshold for registration envisaged under the Bill, the number of MFIs that will come under the regulatory scanner will be too large for any meaningful supervision. Neither self-regulation nor regulation by Nabard, which also lends to the MFIs, has been found viable. Hence the onus has fallen squarely on the RBI.
Evidently, the context in which the new legislation is proposed is as important as its substantive provisions. About a year ago, the government of Andhra Pradesh — the State that accounts for nearly a third of microfinance business in the country — introduced tough rules to clamp down on such practices as overcharging customers and employing coercive methods to recover loans. These stringent rules came in the wake of allegations that some MFIs were indulging in such wrongful and high-handed practices. As a consequence of the government's action, some high-profile MFIs were badly hit because banks pulled out their loans and this, in turn, snapped those institutions' loan recovery circle. If enacted, the new Bill, which empowers the central government to override existing laws, might give the MFIs some relief, but there is very little chance they will be allowed to go back to their old ways. For its part, the Andhra Pradesh government has voiced its opposition to several of the provisions and pointed out that, even if the RBI became the principal regulator, it would be well within the State government's jurisdiction to exercise control over money lenders and check usurious practices.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/regulating-microfinance/article2221942.ece
14,7,2011,A new country is born,"The birth of the Republic of South Sudan has suffused a conflict-ridden part of the world with euphoria. South Sudan, whose eight million people comprise Christians and followers of other African religions, voted in a referendum in January 2011 to separate from the Arab-Muslim dominated north Sudan. The referendum itself was the culmination of a 2005 peace treaty that came after a four-decade long armed struggle by the south Sudanese, backed by the United States and other western powers, in which more than a million people are estimated to have been killed. At the independence celebrations in the new country's capital Juba, the attendance of Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir signalled that the Sudanese leadership had come to terms with a separation it long tried to prevent through the use of force and repression. President al-Bashir's participation in the celebrations was crucial. Even the U.S., which is in the forefront of efforts to bring him to trial for alleged genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in Darfur, seemed thankful for his presence alongside other international leaders — India, among the first to recognise the new country, was represented by Vice-President Hamid Ansari — for the swearing-in of the first President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit. The reason: ironical as it seems, having achieved a hard-fought liberation from Sudan, Africa's 54th nation is now almost entirely dependent on the good wishes of the parent country for its well-being.
This is the big challenge facing the new country. South Sudan has inherited the bulk of the undivided Sudan's oil wealth, with which it hopes to transform its present poor economic conditions. It has already generated investment from the world's major economic powers. But the oil refineries are located in Sudan, as is the seaport from which the oil is exported. The pipelines that take the oil to the port are laid across the length of the north. Key to how the two countries divide their oil wealth is whether they can resolve their rival claims over the border area of Abeyi. As recently as May, the Sudanese Army occupied the area in an operation in which 100 people died and over 45,000 were displaced. There has also been fighting in South Kordofan — Sudan has sent its forces there to retain a region whose people fought on the side of the south Sudanese but now find themselves north of the international border. Much will depend on how President al-Bashir views the west's considerable influence in South Sudan, given the troubles in Darfur and the ICC charges against him. Fortunately, since Sudan too needs the money from the oil, it should be as interested in a peaceful resolution of its disputes with its newest neighbour.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-new-country-is-born/article2224632.ece
14,7,2011,Funding folly compounded,"The government has succumbed to collective pressure from Members of Parliament — barring those from the Left — and agreed to a generous increase in the annual allocation under the Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme. In place of Rs.2 crore, each MP will now get Rs.5 crore. This marks a tenfold increase of the sum allocated when the scheme was launched in 1993. The annual bill will now be Rs.3,950 crore. This decision flies in the face of criticism expressed over time by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, the National Advisory Council, the Administrative Reforms Commission, and the Planning Commission as well as public-spirited individuals, among them Bhim Singh, Era Sezhiyan, and J.M. Lyngdoh. Allegations of diversion of funds came to the fore first in 2003, and again in 2005 through a sting operation by a television channel.
Last year, a constitution bench of the Supreme Court of India dismissed a batch of petitions against MPLADS. Upholding its constitutional validity, the judgment noted that there were “sufficient checks and balances” to prevent misuse. But it added that “this court does not sit in judgment of the veracity of a scheme, but only its legality … The court can strike down a law or scheme only on the basis of its vires or unconstitutionality but not on the basis of its viability.” The court also called for “efforts…to make the [accountability] regime more robust.” It is clear then that the judgment fell short of an unconditional endorsement of the wisdom and practical logic behind MPLADS. Moreover, at least a couple of points the judgment held in favour of the scheme have been modified by the government. Under the revised guidelines, up to 75 per cent (instead of 50 per cent) of the project cost can be released as the first instalment, and a Lok Sabha member can spend up to Rs.10 lakh a year anywhere in India — this, it is claimed, is to “promote national unity and fraternity among the people.” The basket of works that can be taken up has been widened. If anything, the new guidelines have only loosened the purse-strings. The changes seem tailor-made to speed up the outflow of funds and expand outflow routes. The government ought to appoint a high-level national commission to examine this inherently wasteful and conceptually flawed scheme. What concerned citizens can do here and now is this: they can use the provisions of the Right to Information Act to seek data on money drawn and spent under the scheme in every parliamentary constituency, identify the purposes it serves, and see whom it reaches.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/funding-folly-compounded/article2224634.ece
15,7,2011,Little learned from 26/11,"Believe it or not, in the hours since the murderous terrorist bombings in Mumbai, the ruling dispensation has been busy congratulating itself on the robustness of its counter-terrorism policies. Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi told journalists in Bhubaneswar that the United Progressive Alliance's police and intelligence reforms had succeeded in stopping “99 per cent of terrorist attacks” — a claim startling for its arithmetical precision as much as its empirical innocence. Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram underlined the fact that there had been no terrorist strike on Mumbai since November 2008 — even though there is no evidence that policing deterred a single planned attack. He explained the absence of intelligence this time by noting that the perpetrators of this carnage had “worked in a very clandestine manner.” Responses like this are of a piece with a longstanding official tradition: after each tragedy, cities are promised that gaps in policing will be filled, and lavishly praised for their spirit of resilience. The same resilience marks the lives of peoples in Karachi or Beirut, surely not models we should emulate.
The unpleasant truth is that the much-vaunted police modernisation effort the government began after 26/11 has just not delivered. Not one of the five urban terrorist attacks that preceded the latest Mumbai bombings has been solved. India's intelligence services believe all these attacks are linked — and probably carried out by different modules of the Indian Mujahideen, the Lashkar-e-Taiba-affiliated group responsible for bombings that claimed hundreds of lives between 2005 and 2008. Key leaders of the Indian Mujahideen escaped a successful police crackdown in 2008; the testimony of the Pakistani-American jihadist David Headley has corroborated earlier suspicions that several remain active in Pakistan, harboured by elements of its intelligence services. Indian intelligence operations targeting these networks remain deficient. Emergency response capabilities have not improved significantly since November 2008. In Mumbai on Wednesday, the injured were evacuated, like cattle, on trucks and other readily-available transport; hospitals ran short of blood; traffic snarled and rumours proliferated. Mr. Chidambaram has correctly pointed out that India is located in one of the most dangerous regions in the world. That makes it all the more imperative to develop the capacities our police and intelligence services desperately need: better training, better skills, better working conditions. Instead, the focus of the post-26/11 effort has been on raising special forces and acquiring cutting-edge technology, assets which the existing system simply does not have the foundations to use to good effect. It is disturbing that two years after 26/11, India does not have a national centre of excellence for education in investigation and intelligence-gathering, a world class centre that can produce trainers for State police forces. The nation's counter-terrorism establishment needs to stop focussing on appearing impressive on television, and buckle down to the task of serious, system-wide reform.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/little-learned-from-2611/article2227440.ece
15,7,2011,Advantage Chennai,"That Chennai is bidding for next year's FIDE World Chess Championship title match between defending champion Viswanathan Anand and challenger Boris Gelfand of Israel assumes thrilling significance. It was at home that Anand played his maiden World Championship match in January 1991 and came out a resounding winner against Russian Alexey Dreev. Should the Indian bid, backed by the strong and decisive support extended by Tamil Nadu's Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa, outweigh the offer of the Russian Chess Federation, the chess-loving people of Chennai will get a rare chance to watch their beloved superstar play again for the crown. Anand, a four-time world champion, has already expressed his delight over the prospect of defending the title in his backyard. Much of the credit for this strong opening should go to Tamil Nadu's sport-minded Chief Minister. She was the moving spirit when Chennai hosted the 1995 SAF Games and she continued to support sportspersons from Tamil Nadu with liberal cash awards whenever they won medals at multi-discipline games.
Chief Minister Jayalalithaa's initiative came to the fore when All India Chess Federation officials, in the company of the World Chess Federation President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, met her on Wednesday and mooted the idea of Chennai hosting the prestigious tie in April 2012. Her spontaneous commitment to spend $4.5 million has suddenly made India the favourite to win the bid that opens in the first week of August. Anand has always been eager to play in Chennai but the quality of field he deserves has not assembled in the country for nearly two decades. A winning bid will bring him back into action in India after October 2002, when he retained the World Cup at Hyderabad. If chess is believed to have originated in India, then Chennai must be recognised as the nation's chess capital. From providing the country's first International Master to Grandmaster, the city has kept alive the rich tradition of producing young champions at regular intervals. Despite its relatively low profile as a spectator sport, chess has traditionally enjoyed strong public support in Tamil Nadu. It is important that Chennai wins this bid.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/advantage-chennai/article2227439.ece
16,7,2011,Murdoch's Watergate?,"As each new day brings ever more damaging revelations, the full scale and implications of the phone-hacking scandal that has engulfed Rupert Murdoch's British newspapers are still unfolding. The wreckage is piling up. The News of the World (NoW), where it all started, has been shut down and public and political pressure has forced its former editor Rabekah Brooks, who was also chief executive of Mr. Murdoch's British media group News International (NI), to resign. Mr. Murdoch has abandoned his £8 billion bid for the BSkyB television network that he intensely pursued to complete his media dominance in Britain. The ripples are being felt across the Atlantic: the Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened a preliminary inquiry into allegations that News Corporation journalists sought to gain access to the phone records of 9/11 victims, and U.S. Senators have called for investigations into Mr. Murdoch's business practices. Hundreds of incriminating emails are alleged to have been destroyed by NI executives. Senior Scotland Yard officers have complained that the company attempted to “thwart” and “obstruct” their investigation. But police have not come through smelling good either. The affair has revealed a cosy relationship between the police, politicians, and the Murdoch press. Prime Minister David Cameron, a personal friend of the Murdochs, insisted on appointing a former NoW editor, Andy Coulson, as his communications chief despite being warned about his role in phone hacking. A judicial inquiry into the scandal will look into the relationship between the press, the police, and the politicians. A separate inquiry by the House of Commons media committee will see Rupert and his son James grilled by MPs next week.
Revelations point to a culture of systematic, massive abuse of law and media ethics. Up to 4,000 people may have had their phones hacked. What has caused intense outrage is that families of the victims of the 2005 London bombings and soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan were targeted in a fishing expedition for stories. Even little children were not spared. The nation was scandalised when it emerged that the phone of Milly Dowler, a murdered teenaged schoolgirl, was hacked by a NoW investigator. The claim that the practice was confined to a few rogue reporters is becoming increasingly untenable. Nor was it restricted to NoW. The Sun and The Sunday Times, it has emerged, used indefensible methods to obtain personal information about former Prime Minister Gordon Brown. The past week has dramatically transformed attitudes towards Mr. Murdoch, prompting questions whether it could be the beginning of the end of his British media empire.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Murdochs-Watergate/article13745792.ece
16,7,2011,An assassination in Afghanistan,"The killing of Ahmed Wali Karzai has created more uncertainties in Afghanistan. The controversial half-brother of the Afghan President Hamid Karzai, shot dead at his home by a man identified as a trusted family aide, was the leader of the provincial council of Kandahar, which is often described as the country's strategic centre. It is here that the Taliban was born and is most powerful. Since the beginning of 2010, Kandahar has been the focus, along with neighbouring Helmand, of NATO and U.S. military efforts to contain the Taliban before the planned withdrawal of troops. Ahmed Wali was seen as crucial to these efforts. He ran Kandahar like a potentate, with his seemingly unlimited supply of money and guns, and he was known as an artful manipulator of Pashtun tribal politics, bolstering his brother's fragile presidency in a hostile region. He maintained contacts with the Taliban, and was considered pivotal to efforts at negotiating with them. At one time, it seemed that U.S. officials in Afghanistan were trying their best to oust Ahmed Wali. They were worried that his reputation for being corrupt and ruthless — he was alleged to have siphoned off chunks of international aid money and to have a role in the lucrative narcotics trade — would hurt their efforts to win the hearts and minds of Afghans. President Karzai and his brother staunchly denied the allegations. Finally, Washington decided it was wiser to co-opt him, and he became a trusted asset in southern Afghanistan. In any case, as The New York Times revealed in October 2009, he was on the CIA's payroll for helping it raise a secret paramilitary for anti-Taliban operations.
It is unclear if the man who killed Ahmed Wali did so out of personal motives or on the orders of the Taliban, even though the Taliban have claimed the assassination. Since 2010, they have carried out a number of high-profile killings in Kandahar — their victims include the provincial police chief, the deputy governor, and the deputy mayor. The elimination of Ahmed Wali, who seemed at times to wield more influence than his brother, has left the government in Kandahar in disarray. It has certainly weakened President Karzai, even though another brother has taken over as head of the Populzai tribe to which the Karzais belong. The assassination complicates the international military effort in Kandahar; it has removed a link to the Taliban and could prove a setback to drawing them into negotiations. That the death of one man with a reputation beyond notorious can have such far-reaching consequences is the tragic reality of Afghanistan today — and of the brutal war imposed on its people by the United States.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-assassination-in-afghanistan/article2230729.ece
17,7,2011,No. 1 must assert itself,"That India would win the Test series in West Indies wasn't in much doubt — given the relative strengths of the sides and the nature of the five-day format, which allows these strengths to play out — but the manner of victory left a little to be desired. To be fair to M.S. Dhoni's team, it lacked its first choice openers, its best batsman, and its bowling leader, all of whom have contributed immensely to India's rise to the top of Test cricket. And in the normal course of things, any series win, especially one abroad, is an event to be celebrated. But considering the thinness of the West Indies batting and the bowler-friendly character of at least two of the three pitches played on, the 1-0 result was less than satisfying. An old vulnerability, not pressing more intensely for victory, showed itself again. India has achieved many creditable successes in becoming the No.1 team — the most worthy of them being the cultivation of the ability to bounce back from adversity — but it hasn't always made full use of the opportunities that presented themselves. There has been a tendency at times to ease up after gaining a position of advantage. It is true that India hasn't lost a series since August 2008 but the best Test side in the world is judged against higher standards.
India will have to lift its level of play against England. The return of Virender Sehwag (two weeks into the tour), Gautam Gambhir, Sachin Tendulkar, and Zaheer Khan will aid this endeavour. Not only are they world-class cricketers, they are also first-rate influences in the dressing room. Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman, who again proved their value in the Caribbean, have the benefit of entering a tour having spent time in the middle against challenging bowling. It's difficult even for batsmen as skilled as them to find rhythm after a break — something they have had to contend with, not being part of the limited-overs side. The two significant gains of the Caribbean tour were Suresh Raina and Ishant Sharma. Raina's Test career seemed in danger after his troubles in South Africa. But he worked on his problem against the short ball, and was consequently able to shine in West Indies. Another test, against the moving ball, awaits him in England. Ishant seems to have discovered the harmony, in mind and body, that deserted him after such a promising beginning. He led the bowling superbly, operating with hostility and penetration. On his and Zaheer's shoulders rests the responsibility of subjugating England's top order. But each of Dhoni's men will have to step up — the captain himself will have to shed the strange defensiveness that sometimes hinders him — if India is to repeat its series-winning performance of 2007.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-1-must-assert-itself/article2236128.ece
17,7,2011,The long road ahead,"It was exactly 31 years ago that India emerged as a nation with an independent launch capability. On that occasion, the Indian Space Research Organisation's SLV-3 rocket, which stood just 23 metres high, succeeded in putting a 35-kg Rohini satellite into orbit. Since then, the country's spaceport at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota has seen 32 more launches of satellite-carrying rockets, six of which ended in failure. On Friday, a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), which was nearly twice the length and 18 times heavier than the SLV-3, took a 1,400-kg communications satellite into space. With 18 successful launches to its credit, the PSLV has matured into a versatile and reliable launcher. Although this is the first time the rocket carried a communications satellite, the PSLV had flawlessly executed similar missions with the country's first dedicated meteorological satellite, Kalpana-1, and subsequently the Chandrayaan-1 lunar probe. However, the PSLV is a less powerful rocket than its trouble-prone sibling, the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), which has seen three of its seven flights turn into failure. The latter, equipped with a cryogenic engine, is capable of carrying communication satellites that are about one tonne heavier.
For communication satellites, size matters. The bigger and heavier the satellite, the more communication capacity it is able to pack and the more economical the cost of such capacity works out to be. Globally such satellites have grown bulkier over the years and these days can often be in the six-tonne class. Launching small communication satellites on the PSLV is not an attractive proposition. Therefore, as a first step, it is essential that problems with the GSLV, which is expected to fly again next year with the indigenous cryogenic stage, are sorted out expeditiously. But even that rocket will not be able to launch a three-tonne satellite like the GSAT-8 that was put into orbit by Europe's Ariane 5 in May 2011. So ISRO also needs to get its next-generation launcher, the GSLV Mark-III, which will be able to carry four-tonne communication satellites, operational as soon as possible. That may be easier said than done. Both the giant solid-propellant booster for the rocket and its liquid-propellant core stage were successfully tested last year. But its new cryogenic engine and stage must also be similarly tested and proven flight-worthy. Development of a semi-cryogenic engine, which will run on liquid oxygen and kerosene, has started; this engine will be used for a more powerful launch vehicle. ISRO's launch vehicle programme has come a long way but faces many difficult challenges in the years ahead.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-long-road-ahead/article2236129.ece
18,7,2011,The thinking company,"What keeps a company going for a hundred years and helps set its sights on the next hundred? For the IT giant IBM, it could be the motto that problems are solved by thinking. Also, that it must be ready to change everything about itself, except its beliefs. Big Blue's fortunes over the long haul are an interesting case study in the culture of innovation. It is a knowledge-focussed enterprise that invests heavily in research, even during economic downturns and, by its own account, has had its hits and fair share of misses. What stands out is its big innovations in the century gone by, such as the Alphabet Accounting Machine of 1934, the first magnetic hard disk for data storage (1956), FORTRAN, the programming language (1957), the Selectric typewriter (1961), one-transistor DRAM memory cells (1966), the floppy disk (1971), the IBM Personal Computer (1981), the Deep Blue supercomputer that trounced chess champion Garry Kasparov (1997) and, most recently, the Watson supercomputer that won a high-profile quiz programme. One insight from the company has universal value. Like the alphabet T, there must be broad horizontal knowledge but, equally, deep vertical learning in a chosen subject.
Commercial success depends heavily on aggregation of talent. IBM has a demonstrable record of attracting people with high skills (five were recognised with the Nobel Prize). Its model of rewards since 1963 has partly consisted of nomination as in-house Fellows who are free to pursue their own projects without constraints. The result has been a growing crop of patents. This is an approach that merits close study. What it shows is that a multi-billion dollar annual research budget and collaborations with universities and governments can produce impressive intellectual property. A record 5,896 patents granted to the company in 2010 should convince the university system and governments in India that investing in research is of paramount importance. Another area of knowledge that companies such as IBM are building on is cloud computing and analytics. Cities and countries have a lot to learn from analytics about the efficient use of energy and precious resources such as water, building high performance transport systems and interconnected health infrastructure, and reducing the carbon footprint. What remains to be seen, however, is the life expectancy of even the best-run companies. Management literature measured that index to be of the order of 75 years in the 20th century; for the present century, marked by commoditisation of technology and rapid obsolescence, one index puts that figure at less than 15 years. Any company with a long-term view must evolve continuously in a world guided by short-term thinking.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-thinking-company/article2248137.ece
18,7,2011,Impact of industrial slowdown,"The drift in industrial activity since December 2010 is further confirmed by the recently released data on the index of industrial production (IIP) for May. Industrial output increased by 5.6 per cent the lowest rate of growth in nine months — it was 8.5 per cent a year ago. Growth rates have declined in the two key sectors of manufacturing and mining, the former from 8.9 per cent to 5.6 per cent and the latter from 7.9 per cent to just 1.40 per cent. Electricity has been the one bright spot — it recorded a growth of 10.3 per cent in May 2011, compared to 6.3 per cent last year. Within manufacturing, the lower figures for both capital and intermediate goods suggest declining investment and industrial activity. Higher interest rates might have moderated consumer demand, but it is also likely that many private sector players have deferred investment decisions in the face of large and growing uncertainties in policymaking. The sharp drop in the mining index is explained by the lacklustre performance of the coal and gas sectors. Many new mining projects have been delayed for environmental reasons. The absence of clear land acquisition and utilisation policies has also not helped either. On the other side, there are many instances of companies not exploiting the coal beds allotted to them for captive purposes.
It is unrealistic to expect policy imbroglios such as those over environmental clearances of sensitive projects or over land acquisitions and utilisation to be resolved soon. Nor is it likely that the Reserve Bank of India will heed the call of industry and desist from hiking interest rates further. The inflation figures for June, unveiled few days after the release of the May IIP data, showed a rise in the rate from 9.06 per cent in May to 9.44 per cent. Even before that it seemed certain that the RBI would persist with its strong anti-inflation stance to contain expectations. Over the recent past, the central bank has come out strongly in favour of price stability, even if it meant a slowdown in growth. Perhaps it is time to moderate expectations from the manufacturing sector. It cannot be expected to grow at the same scorching pace it has, of around 15 per cent annually, over the recent past. Consequently, overall GDP growth forecasts, beginning with those for the current year, will have to be pruned. The government expects agriculture to grow by 4 per cent and services by 10 per cent in the current year. Even with the slower industrial growth, GDP growth should well be between 7.5 per cent and 8 per cent, and that will still be commendable.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/impact-of-industrial-slowdown/article2248141.ece
19,7,2011,The expanding Euro-debt crisis,"There has been no respite for Europe's policymakers from the debt crisis. For a little over a year they have tried unsuccessfully to contain the crisis within the smaller economies in the continent. A major reason for the failure lies with the policymakers themselves especially those from the bigger European countries that have a substantial stake and responsibility for the monetary union. Each time the crisis struck — first in Greece, then in Ireland and Portugal, and again in Greece — the policymakers, after much dithering, came out with solutions that were no more than fire-fighting exercises. Such short-sightedness has extracted a high price. Last week, Italy, the third largest economy in the euro zone, came under intense stress from the financial markets. Yields on Italian bonds jumped alarmingly. Milan stock exchange's index fell to its lowest levels in two years. Although the markets' initial reactions were exaggerated, it is clear that the debt crisis is entering a new, dangerous phase. By no means a pushover, Italy has a very high level of indebtedness. With an estimated $2.6 trillion outstanding, which is 120 per cent of its GDP, it has the largest amount of sovereign debt for any European country and the third largest in the world. If bond yields were to go up again, Italy's cost of borrowing will climb to unacceptably high levels.
Default by a major European country is simply unthinkable for now but even if, for whatever reason, Italy remains under stress, there will be huge, negative consequences, for the euro and the global economy. For a start, investors would flee European assets, making recovery that much harder. With the United States having major problems of its own, cross-border capital flows do not have the ready-made “safe haven” that they have been used to in times of great uncertainty. Consequently, flows will become extremely volatile. That will not be good news for countries such as India where capital flows pose major challenges to external sector management. The escalating debt crisis has once again called into question the sustainability of Europe's common currency mechanism without an accompanying fiscal integration. The euro, notwithstanding its present troubles, has eased trade and currency barriers and created a huge common market. Perhaps the most important lesson from the crisis is that any dependence on private capital for financing public expenditure — a course Italy and many other countries have chosen — can create stresses and strains on the national economy when they are least expected. Fortunately for India, policymakers learnt that lesson long ago.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-expanding-eurodebt-crisis/article2260149.ece
19,7,2011,Open access is here to stay,"Arecent announcement by three major biomedical funding agencies has given a booster dose to the open access (OA) model that provides free access to scientific literature. A freely accessible online journal, which will rival top-tier subscription-based journals like Nature, will be launched next summer by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Wellcome Trust, and the Max Planck Society. This news comes close on the heels of the Nature Publishing Group's launch of a fully open access journal — Scientific Reports, a direct competitor to the well established PLoS ONE journal. In April 2010, the Group launched Nature Communications, an online-only, partly OA journal which published 300 papers in the first year of its existence and plans to publish more than 400 articles this calendar year. Importantly, authors can, for a fee, choose to make their papers freely accessible in more than 25 traditional subscription journals published by NPG, including all 15 journals owned by it. But why should the top-notch scientific publishing house take open access so seriously? The commendable 2008 mandate of the U.S. National Institutes of Health that all papers arising from research carried out using its fund should be made freely available could be one factor. But the most important driver has been the steady growth of the revolutionary model.
According to a paper published recently in PLoS ONE journal (“The development of open access journal publishing from 1993 to 2009,” by Mikael Laakso et al.,), since 2000, the number of open access journals has risen by 18 per cent a year and the number of freely accessible articles by 30 per cent. Contrast this with the meagre 3.5 per cent increase in the volume of journal publishing. In 2009 alone, 4,769 journals carried an estimated 191,000 OA articles, constituting 7.7 per cent of all peer-reviewed journal papers. Hence the authors' observation that the new model has “shifted the landscape of scientific publishing considerably” within a short span of time is clearly no exaggeration. That the period 2005-09 witnessed such a healthy growth in OA publishing settles the much-debated issue of the model's sustainability. It validates the money authors are required to pay towards publication. In fact, the author-charge concept has found wider acceptance, with many reputed subscription journals collecting a separate fee from authors for opening up their papers. But the biggest contribution to the sustainability of dedicated OA journals has come from the funding agencies — their exemplary willingness to include publishing costs in the research budget.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/open-access-is-here-to-stay/article2260150.ece
21,7,2011,A farce of a probe,"To describe the Delhi police's investigation into the 2008 cash-for-votes scandal as a tardy probe is much too flattering. The sorry truth is that the police have done next to nothing to show they are serious about making progress in the case, a level of inaction that smacks of the bad old political cover-up. If they seem to have been finally pressed into some action, it is thanks to the stinging rebuke delivered by the Supreme Court about the “inefficient and directionless probe” in this case. The scandal revolves round the charge that the United Progressive Alliance government, in its previous term, bribed opposition MPs to vote in its favour in a floor test that followed the withdrawal of Left support. But it will need a lot more than the arrest of Sanjeev Saxena, a close aide of former Samajwadi MP Amar Singh, and Suhail Hindustani, who allegedly liaised the attempt to buy the votes of three BJP MPs, and the move to question Mr. Amar Singh to convince the public that justice is sought to be done.
The status report filed by the Delhi police, which prompted the Supreme Court to characterise it as a “bunch of stories,” showed there was no investigation worth the name beyond a narration of facts and an examination of some witnesses. This is inexcusable in a case where much of the evidence is already in the public domain and in which what is required is a serious effort to flesh out and verify what is already known. The three BJP MPs who alleged they were bribed had waved wads of currency notes and placed them on the table of the House; a television channel had conducted a sting operation on the bribery attempt, the recordings of which were submitted to the Lok Sabha Speaker; and a parliamentary committee that went into the scam recommended a probe into the roles of some players even as it declared unconvincingly that there was insufficient evidence to proceed against some senior politicians. In March 2011, The Hindu's dramatic expose of a U.S. diplomatic cable, accessed through WikiLeaks, provided strong corroboration of dirty money being used to buy votes. In fact, this report forms the basis of the petition filed in the Supreme Court by former Chief Election Commissioner J.M. Lyngdoh and 13 others, seeking the constitution of a special team to investigate the scam. Following the expose, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh flatly denied that his party was involved in any unlawful act in connection with the confidence vote. That denial has a farcical ring to it with the Supreme Court expressing anger at the lack of progress in the case and the Delhi police claiming they are still awaiting the Union Home Ministry's clearance to interrogate a couple of MPs.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-farce-of-a-probe/article2282380.ece
21,7,2011,No wiggle room on liability,"Like other U.S. officials who have been raising the issue in public and private, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used her recent visit to India to deliver a tough message on the alleged inadequacy of the country's nuclear liability law. Although the July 2005 Indo-U.S. joint statement makes no mention of the liability issue, U.S. companies managed successfully to bring it on to the bilateral agenda three years later when India promised to accede to the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC). Joining the CSC involves passing a compatible domestic nuclear liability law, something the Manmohan Singh government finally did last year. The CSC is intended to give a free pass to the supplier of nuclear equipment in the event of a disaster, which is why the U.S. is so keen for India to ratify it. However, Parliament, and ultimately the government, were unwilling to waive the normal operation of tort law and accordingly incorporated two provisions that might expose suppliers to damage claims if a nuclear accident is traced to defective equipment. Against the backdrop of public outrage over the scandalous denouement of the Bhopal gas disaster cases, it is a miracle that the law is not tougher.
The U.S. believes these provisions are incompatible with the CSC and hopes the implementation rules being drawn up will firmly shut the door on supplier liability. Even if such a thing were legally possible — which it isn't, since rules cannot upend the basic intent of a law — Dr. Singh can ill afford the political firestorm that any dilution of the liability Act would set off. During her visit, Ms Clinton also encouraged India to consult the International Atomic Energy Agency on the compatibility of its law with the CSC — an absurd suggestion since the IAEA has no locus. At a time when the whole world is still digesting the environmental and financial consequences of the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear calamity, Washington must reconcile itself to the fact that the Indian body politic will not accept any dilution in existing liability provisions. Rather than exerting political pressure, U.S. vendors should bite the bullet and accept this as the price they will have to pay to win a share of the lucrative Indian nuclear power industry. If insurance costs lead to higher reactor prices, so be it. It is better to know the true cost of nuclear energy before buying thousands of megawatts worth of reactor equipment than pay for a multi-billion dollar cleanup the way Japanese taxpayers are now being forced to do.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-wiggle-room-on-liability/article2282378.ece
21,7,2011,Double act in denial & defiance,"For the first time since the phone-hacking scandal broke more than two weeks ago, the Murdochs — Rupert and son James, head of his British media group, News International — appeared in public on Tuesday when they gave evidence before the House of Commons media committee. They were dragged to it, under threat of arrest, after initially saying no. In the light of their evasive and unconvincing performance, it is clear why they had been so reluctant. It was an extraordinary double act in denial, defiance, and faux contrition, which (according to their own newspaper The Times) left “a number of questions unanswered.” For nearly three hours, James and Rupert stonewalled questions with a well-rehearsed script that sought to portray them as innocent victims of their own journalists and executives. Rupert refused to take personal responsibility. “Who then was responsible?” he was asked. “The people I trusted to run it and maybe the people they trusted,” Mr. Murdoch answered. Although he called it “the most humble day of my life,” there was nothing humble either about his or his son's unashamedly self-serving testimony.
MPs on the panel scratched their heads in frustration as the Murdochs insisted they had no knowledge of hacking at the now dead News of the World or attempts by News International to cover up the scandal when they failed to give the police hundreds of incriminating documents. A senior police officer told another parliamentary committee that, when the documents were finally disclosed, it took him just “three to five minutes” to conclude that there had been massive “criminality.” James admitted authorising payment to a victim of hacking but claimed he did not know at the time what the payment was for. Rupert's extraordinary explanation for why he “lost sight” of what went on at NoW was that it was “just 1 per cent” of his global business. He was “absolutely shocked and appalled,” he affirmed, when he learned that NoW had hacked the phone of Milly Dowler, a murdered schoolgirl. Incredibly, Rebekah Brooks, who was NoW's Editor when Dowler's phone was hacked and now faces criminal prosecution on serious charges, claimed that she got to know about it only “two weeks ago.” She defended hiring private detectives to dig up stories and payments to the police arguing that this was “common practice in Fleet Street” at the time. Pawns will be sacrificed but owning up is something top people in the Murdoch empire simply do not do. This is best summed up in a Guardian cartoon in which Rupert insists: “I know nothing! I just did what I was told!! And I'll slap anyone who says different!!!” James, beside him, applauds.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/double-act-in-denial-defiance/article2277391.ece
21,7,2011,Marvellous rodent,"Increase in human life expectancy produces a concomitant increase in the number of harmful mutations and accumulation of different forms of damages, which in turn enhances the risk of cancer and old-age diseases. But the genome of the naked mole-rats ( Heterocephalus glaber) sequenced recently may hold the key to reducing the risk of these diseases and perhaps even to preventing them. The genome is expected to have about 20,000 genes (as in the case of other rodents) and nearly three billion base pairs (in line with other mammalian genomes). The four-inch-long rodents that live in burrows in the east African desert have intrigued scientists for a variety of reasons. The foremost among them is their exceptional longevity — exceeding 28 years. To provide a ready measure, a house mouse of the same size has a maximum lifespan of four years. One would expect naked mole-rats to incur the greatest risk of developing cancer owing to this long lifespan but, actually, not a single case of cancer has been seen in them so far. According to a study published in November 2009 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) journal, the H. glaber species has a unique two-level mechanism that renders it tumour-resistant. Two proteins stop the cells from dividing the moment they make contact with each other. Contact inhibition is a key anti-cancer mechanism. Although humans and mice also produce these proteins, only one of them serves as a checkpoint for stopping cell growth.
However, contact inhibition may not be the only mechanism that protects the tiny rodents from cancer. In an experiment carried out by the PNAS authors, the rodent cells grew to become only small colonies; they never reached the size of a tumour even when contact inhibition was completely eliminated. The online availability of the genome at the ‘Naked Mole-Rat Genome Resource' (http://www.naked-mole-rat.org/) will prove to be of immense value to scientists in investigating the unknown factors. Short-lived, cancer-prone animals like mice that have fewer anti-cancer adaptations have long been used for cancer research. While mice studies have been useful in finding ways of treating cancer, the arsenals for preventing the disease may come up only by studying animals like the naked mole-rats. The genome sequence should also help scientists investigate how the rodents successfully slow down the damage accumulation process, and thereby delay aging. This marvelous species does not show any age-related changes in body composition, physiology, and molecular function from the age of two to more than 20 years.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/marvellous-rodent/article2277388.ece
23,7,2011,The pact in Darjeeling,"Whether the tripartite agreement signed for setting up an autonomous administrative body for the Darjeeling Hills will pave the way for settling the ‘Gorkhaland' question — the cause of much bloodshed and agitation in northern West Bengal — is uncertain. The Gorkhaland Territorial Administration pact was the culmination of nearly three years of painstaking talks between the Gorkha Janamukti Morcha, the central government, and the Left Front government of West Bengal. Following a forward-looking decision to set up an alternative to the defunct Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC), the breakthrough came in December 2010 with the GJM accepting the State government's condition that the proposed set-up must comprise elected members, and not nominated ones (as the GJM had until then demanded). The sweep to power of the Trinamool Congress in the State gave the process a push — the party's partnership in the UPA coalition at the centre and its friendly ties with the GJM helped the three sides overcome some obstacles, such as the name for the proposed body, and the administrative powers that would be devolved to it. The GTA, to be created once the agreement gets the legislative sanction, will have substantive financial, administrative, and executive powers, going far beyond what was devolved to the DGHC; against the 39 departments of the DGHC, the new set up is to have 59. Nevertheless, a discordant note is struck by the text of the agreement acknowledging that the GJM, one of the three signatories, has not given up its demand for a separate State while recording the opposition of the other two signatories — the central and State governments — to that demand.
A committee is to be constituted to go into the GJM's territorial claims in the Dooars and the Terai and in Siliguri, despite the rejection of such claims by the people of these areas. There are apprehensions across West Bengal that the Gorkha leadership will view these concessions as a basis for further agitation. Within a few hours of signing the agreement, Bimal Gurung, the GJM leader, declared that the demand for Gorkhaland had not been given up. This may be posturing to win his constituency's acceptance for the GTA agreement but, on the other hand, it might not be. The hope is that the political leadership of the Gorkha community will focus on working constructively within the scope offered by the GTA. The Centre's promised financial package of Rs.600 crore over three years, aside from the normal Plan assistance to the State, is a huge incentive. The question that nobody can answer at this point is whether this opportunity will be seized to usher in better times for a long-troubled region of the country.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-pact-in-darjeeling/article2285548.ece
23,7,2011,The plain truth,"Australia deserves to be commended for becoming the first country to introduce federal legislation that will make it compulsory for all tobacco products to be sold in plain packaging, devoid of trademarks and other marketing features. The Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 naturally faces opposition from industry on self-serving grounds: that it violates intellectual property and trade rules. Plain packaging for tobacco products is decidedly in the public interest. It is especially welcome because it can enhance the effectiveness of health warnings, discourage people from taking to tobacco by reducing its appeal, and by prohibiting trademarks, remove scope for surrogate advertising. The World Health Organisation underscores the importance of packaging as a key factor in the campaign against tobacco. Further, marketing research shows that as countries move ahead with implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control provisions related to advertising, promotion, and sponsorship, the retail package has become a critical link between products and profits. Governments should, therefore, adopt plain packaging in a big way — as part of their public health strategy.
When India ratified the WHO convention in 2004, it was the eighth and largest country to do so. There is a clear need to strengthen the national initiatives undertaken since then, considering that an estimated 35 per cent of adults use some form of tobacco today. Unfortunately, there is insufficient political will to act. What else can explain the hesitation of the government to introduce new graphical health warnings on retail packaging? In the latest instance, the industry has successfully lobbied for a postponement of a legal requirement to carry stark pictures on the packaging until December 2011. Evidently, carefully designed packaging is vital to this deadly business. Lighter colours on cigarette packs make consumers feel that the product is lighter in strength and therefore less injurious. The Australian law seeks to stop such sharp practices by stipulating that only prescribed colours and finish must be used on all surfaces of the retail package. When this measure goes into force, it will provide insight into the effects of design and packaging on consumer behaviour towards harmful products. Plain packaging should be the goal in India too, but the imperative is to act upon decisions already taken on strengthening pictorial warnings on packages. The central government must not dither on its proposal to introduce similar rules for chewing tobacco, which is indisputably a major killer.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-plain-truth/article2285547.ece
24,7,2011,L'affaire Fai,"Some of the reactions in India to the arrest of Ghulam Nabi Fai, a United States-based Kashmir activist, have been overheated and indeed over the top. Dr. Fai has been charged by the FBI with violating a U.S. domestic law that requires anyone working for or accepting money from foreign governments to disclose this information; the FBI's complaint, filed in a U.S. court, accuses him of acting as an “agent” of the Pakistan government who accepted up to $4 million from the Inter-Services Intelligence to influence the U.S. government on its Kashmir policy. Most intelligence agencies further the interests of their countries in similar ways, even in less important capitals; some agencies are more competent than others at achieving their goals and masking their own involvement. Dr. Fai, a long-time U.S. resident, had been carrying on his lobbying work for nearly two decades and was known to have powerful friends inside the Beltway. It cannot be that the FBI suddenly stumbled on his failure to disclose the source of the funds with which his Kashmiri American Council ( >www.kashmiri.com) organised conferences and seminars on the Kashmir issue, right under the nose of the U.S. establishment. It is more plausible that the Fai arrest, days after the ISI director-general Lt. General Shuja Pasha's visit to the U.S., was a message to the Pakistan military to tone down its high anti-American rhetoric of recent weeks. From the Raymond Davis arrest in Lahore to Dr. Fai's arrest from his home in Virginia, Pakistan and the United States have given a copybook demonstration of how they do business with each other.
The 62-year-old Kashmiri's activities were an irritant for India, and to that extent New Delhi is a beneficiary of the arrest. Allegations have been made in the Indian press for more than a decade that Dr. Fai was channelling funds to Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, although no evidence of this has come to hand. What is totally uncalled for is the vilification of the Indians who attended the KAC conferences. That these scholars, journalists, activists, and prominent public figures accepted hospitality and air-tickets from a lobbyist for Pakistan does not make them ISI agents. After all, these are days ex-ISI and ex-RAW officials discuss peace prospects in Kashmir in Track 2 conferences that are funded by a range of interested parties, from foreign governments to NGOs. It is right for Indians from a range of backgrounds to meet and exchange ideas with those speaking for Pakistan. But l'affaire Fai does send out the message that better discretion must be exercised in accepting such invitations — and that there must be transparency about the sources of funding of the events.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/laffaire-fai/article2290624.ece
24,7,2011,Those magnificent flying machines,"The 30-year-long saga of a truly extraordinary space transportation system, which people around the world know as the space shuttle, has come to an end. True, the shuttle did not make access to space more like air travel, as the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) once promised. Yet it was a marvel of aerospace engineering, the world's first reusable spacecraft that went up like a rocket and was able to glide back to earth, ready to go again. The five space shuttles built have carried 355 people from 16 nations, men as well as women. Seven of every ten of the world's spacefarers travelled on the shuttle. It launched many satellites, including India's U.S.-built Insat-1B communications satellite, and three of NASA's great space observatories. The Hubble space telescope, which was launched by Discovery in 1990, would not today be taking those breath-taking images of the cosmos without the shuttle's unique capabilities. During five later shuttle missions, the last in 2009, astronauts made demanding spacewalks to fix corrective lenses on the Hubble, carry out maintenance tasks, and fix new instruments. Without this space-going truck, the giant International Space Station, which weighs close to 400 tonnes on completion, could not have been assembled piece by piece.
On conventional rockets, known as ‘expendable launch vehicles,' the actual payload, such as a satellite, that goes into orbit constitutes only a small percentage of their weight at launch. The rest of the rocket, much of it propellants, is consumed and jettisoned during the flight. Imagine where air travel would be if a new aircraft was needed for each journey. The space shuttle was intended to change this state of affairs. But being reusable did not translate into lower cost. Indeed, at an estimated $1.5 billion per launch, the shuttles were staggeringly more expensive than expendable launchers. One reason was that, unlike aircraft, each shuttle needed months of careful refurbishment before it could fly again. The care that went into preparing the shuttles for flight had to be greater because there were humans aboard. The death of 14 astronauts when Challenger and Columbia were lost showed all too clearly that manned spaceflight was still a dangerous endeavour, no matter how routine it might appear. But with the end of the shuttle programme, the world, including the U.S., will now rely solely on expendable rockets. That is unquestionably a step backwards. Hopefully, the dreams of a reusable craft that goes beyond the capabilities of the space shuttle and makes access to space both routine and cheap will be pursued again some day.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/those-magnificent-flying-machines/article2290622.ece
26,7,2011,How hate speech kills,"“The men the European public admires most extravagantly are the most daring liars; the men they detest most violently are those who try to tell them the truth.” So begins Anders Behring Brevik's manifesto, the words that explain his decision to set out to slaughter the women and men whose future he believed he was fighting for. No one knows precisely what he had on his mind this weekend past, when he set out with an explosive device and an assault weapon to impress upon the world the truth as he saw it — an act of terrorism that, in per capita terms, ranks high in the list of horrors and atrocities of our age. It is tempting to dismiss Brevik's acts as the work of a deranged man, which in weeks and months to come, psychiatrists may well determine him to be. But while Brevik's violence may have been psychopathic, it was also political. In his rambling manifesto, 2083: a European Declaration of Independence, he exhorts those who might follow in his footsteps to remember that their arrest will give the movement a “living martyr”; each “trial offers you a stage to the world.” Every act of terrorism — as opposed to ordinary crime, or demented rage — is, in this sense, an act of political theatre, a performance intended to reach out to an audience.
What was the message this mass killer intended to send out? Brevik's claims that multiculturalism had rendered Europe effeminate; his hostility to the egalitarian premises of the democratic movements that have shaped Europe since the French revolution of 1789; his invective at Muslim migrants whom he casts as an existential threat — these are well-established motifs of the neoconservative politics that emerged resurgent in Europe after 1978. Brevik's words and ideas are thus rhetorical amplifications of ideas that have become mainstream. His apocalyptic act of violence reflected his loss of faith in organised politics to deliver on its own promises. For India, there are serious lessons. It is not that there is a simple causal connection between jihadi terrorism and the overground Islamist movement; or between Hindutva violence and the mainstream politics of Hindu nationalism; or between Khalistanis and Sikh neo-fundamentalism. Yet each of these competing religious neo-conservatisms built a climate of hate that has spawned agents of horrific violence. Indian political parties, across the spectrum, are quick to attack terrorist violence — but only a few have the integrity and the courage to condemn the systems of thought and language that underpin it. The tragedy in Norway reminds us that words can kill just as surely as bombs and assault rifles. That is good reason to act hard and resourcefully against hate speech in our national political life.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/how-hate-speech-kills/article2293571.ece
26,7,2011,Done with Yeddyurappa,"“You have sat too long for any good you have been doing. Depart, I say; and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!” What Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England, told the Rump Parliament in 1653 applies with comparable moral force and political urgency to Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa. His refusal to leave office in the face of mounting evidence of corruption and misconduct marks a new low for standards of probity in public life. With the Lokayukta scheduled to submit a report detailing his involvement in illegal mining on Wednesday, the Chief Minister is running out of excuses. The question is no longer whether he is a liability or asset to the Bharatiya Janata Party, which while taking on the ruling United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre on issues of corruption and wrongdoing has been thoroughly exposed on the very same issues in the southern State. What is at stake is the right of the people of Karnataka to have a government that inspires confidence, a government that is not hand-in-glove with the corrupt and the greedy, but will act without fear against, for example, those engaged in illegal operations in the mining industry. This is not the first time Mr. Yeddyurappa is in the dock: following the wrongful de-notification of lands and allotment to his family members, Governor H.R. Bhardwaj gave sanction for his prosecution in January 2011. The Karnataka High Court last week upheld the Special Lokayukta Court's order to take cognisance of charges against the Chief Minister in the land scams and allowed the Lokayukta police to inquire into them.
With his extraordinary skills in political manipulation, the Chief Minister has so far managed to ride out the storm each time he found himself in trouble, whether in dealing with dissidents in his own party or in thwarting the designs of a hostile Governor. However, this time he may have run out of luck. His continuance in the job will not be tenable once the report on illegal mining is submitted to the government by the Lokayukta, the retired Supreme Court judge, N. Santosh Hegde. Self-evidently, Mr. Yeddyurappa cannot sit in judgment over a case in which he is among those facing charges. According to Mr. Hegde, the report is a “voluminous study that has thousands of supporting documents” and could be used as “material evidence” in the case on this subject before the Supreme Court. But in the first instance, the Karnataka government must take action on this issue, and it cannot do so with Mr. Yeddyurappa at the helm.

27,7,2011,A warming relationship,"A new energy is evident in the India-Bangladesh relationship — and it is no secret who is the moving force behind this. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's desire to improve relations with New Delhi has seen her go the extra mile, particularly in shutting down the operations of the United Liberation Front of Asom. The Hasina government's decision to honour Indira Gandhi with the Bangladesh Swadhinata Sammanona or Bangladesh Freedom Honour for her historic role in the founding of the nation is a gesture of political and emotional significance. Before this, sections of the Bangladesh polity opposed to the nation's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rehman seemed to be in denial about the crucial roles played by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the Indian Army in the country's liberation. The award is also a sign that Sheikh Mujib's daughter, who led the Awami League to power in the 2008 general election, is surer of her political ground now than in her previous term. What is more, her confidence that relations with India are proceeding in the right direction has been evident in the manner in which Dhaka chose to make light of a remark by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during an interaction with newspaper editors that “25 per cent” of the Bangladeshi people were anti-India and in the “clutches of the ISI.”
The urgency with which External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna was despatched to Dhaka after this showed a seriousness of intent on the Indian side in keeping the bilateral relationship in good shape. Last week, the two governments inaugurated a market on the Meghalaya border to facilitate trade between the people on both sides; more such trading posts should follow. The two countries have also settled September 6-7 as the dates of Prime Minister Singh's long-awaited visit to Bangladesh; it will be the first by an Indian Prime Minister in 12 years. Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram's visit at the end of this week could pave the way for an agreement on the difficult issue of “enclaves” — the bits of land that both countries have in the territory of the other, stranding Indians as well as Bangladeshis on the wrong side of the border. Complaints that Bangladeshis continue to get killed on the border despite a recent agreement between the BSF and the Bangladesh Border Guards not to use lethal weapons against illegal crossers will surely be raised during Mr. Chidambaram's visit. He, in turn, will try and persuade Dhaka to hand over Anup Chetia, the last of the prominent ULFA leaders known to be in that country. For the long term, India must work to ensure that the state of its relationship with Bangladesh is not dependent on a single political entity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-warming-relationship/article2299842.ece
27,7,2011,Indo-African gene admixture,"India is a classic example of genetic potpourri. Though the Ancestral South Indians (ASIs) found in the four southern States are not related to any group outside India, populations in the north Indian States known as Ancestral North Indians (ANIs) exhibit a close genetic affinity to middle easterners, central Asians, and west Eurasians. The Nyshi and Ao Naga populations from north-east India show genetic affinity to the Chinese. The small Siddi population found in Karnataka, Gujarat and some parts of Andhra Pradesh shows an African affinity. Though the genetically admixtured tribal Siddi group exhibiting Indian and typical African features like dark skin, curly hair, and a broad nose has been around for a few hundred years, no comprehensive study was done to establish its African genetic kinship. This lacuna has been finally addressed by a study published in The American Journal of Human Genetics (“Indian Siddis: African descendants with Indian admixture,” by Anish M. Shah et al.). The study is robust as the authors have analysed genetic markers from non-sex chromosomes (autosomes), and paternally derived Y-chromosomes and maternally derived mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). An analysis of both Y-chromosomes and mtDNA, and autosomes in Siddis and the adjoining Indian tribal populations has helped in tracing the direction of gene flow between the African descendent and Indians. Sixty Siddis and 90 people from the adjoining tribal populations in Junagarh district of Gujarat, and 94 Siddis and 178 people from adjoining tribal populations in Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka were studied.
There is overwhelming evidence of gene flow from Indians to the Siddi population. Nearly 65 per cent of maternally derived mtDNA found in the Siddis represents Indian ancestry (with minor contribution from Europeans). Even in the case of the Y-chromosome, which is transmitted by fathers only to sons, nearly 30 per cent has come from Indians. The evidence is further strengthened by the non-sex chromosomes. Nearly 30 per cent of Indian gene signature is seen in the case of the autosomes, which are equally contributed by mother and father to the offspring. Incidentally, no genetic signature of African ancestry is found in the Indian populations adjoining the Siddis. All these together establish an unequivocal unidirectional gene flow from the local Indian groups to the Siddis. The study has for the first time traced the Siddi's African ancestry to the Bantu-speaking population in the sub-Saharan region, and established that the gene admixture happened only over the past eight generations — about 200 years ago.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/indoafrican-gene-admixture/article2299840.ece
27,7,2011,Against all canons,"Ghulam Mohammad Vastanvi was the outsider who beat the odds to win the post of Vice-Chancellor of the world-renowned Darul Uloom Deoband. But clearly the reformist cleric with an MBA degree had pushed his luck too far. On Sunday, the Islamic seminary's Majlis-e-Shoora (managing committee) sacked the rector without even the fig leaf of due process. The Mohtamim was ousted by a pre-determined script whose first lines were written even before the ink could dry on his appointment. The genesis of Mr. Vastanvi's troubles can be traced back to his election, which he won by defeating Arshad Madani, a member of the Madani clan whose influence over Deoband is part of folklore. The Madanis — Arshad and Mahmood — head a faction each of the politically decisive Jamiat-Ulama-e-Hind. The Jamiat's vision and outlook can be judged from its recent diktat to Muslims against watching television, issued as part of a campaign to instil “Islamic values and rules.” In the event, Mr. Vastanvi, unschooled in the art of public relations, was trapped easily: Asked to comment on the welfare of Muslims in Gujarat, the cleric, himself from Gujarat, made the impolitic remark that they ought to move on.
For Mr. Vastanvi's legion of detractors, it was the slip they were waiting for. Over the following weeks, the rector issued repeated clarifications even as violence escalated on the campus. And with the Urdu press digging up fresh evidence each day — a “secular” memento he presented at a function became another of Mr. Vastanvi's sins — it was not long before the cleric metamorphosed from a Narendra Modi-supporter to an agent of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh! It was inevitable then that the Shoora would show him the door — never mind the little matter of the rector's reported exoneration by a sub-committee of the same Shoora. The decision is bound to impair the image of Deoband, showing it up as a retrogressive institution unequal to its rich history and heritage and unwilling to keep pace with the galloping aspirational changes in the community. The Rajinder Sachar committee demolished several myths about Muslims. Among its findings are: only four per cent Muslim children go to Madrasas, and Muslim parents want the best that education can offer for their wards. Mr. Vastanvi, who runs a clutch of educational institutions in Maharashtra, was seen on the Deoband campus as a harbinger of much-awaited progressive change. The running theme among students was “deen and duniya” (religious education as well as knowledge of science and worldly affairs). Instead of boldly embracing this brave, new blueprint, the Shoora has set the clock back on the campus.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/against-all-canons/article2296550.ece
27,7,2011,Unrelenting focus,"Just a day before its quarterly review, the Reserve Bank of India in its overview of the macroeconomy left no one in doubt that it would continue with its aggressive anti-inflation stance. Since the beginning of 2010, this has seen the policy rate go up by 4.25 percentage points, in 10 instalments. Over May and June, there have been two hikes aggregating 0.75 percentage point. The backdrop to the latest policy review has not been radically different from the recent past. Inflation remains unacceptably high. Growth has been moderating but, by most yardsticks, is still at comfortable levels. In its annual policy statement, the RBI explicitly stated that over the near term it was willing to sacrifice growth for containing inflation. Sustained inflation over long term will definitely derail growth. On the eve of the policy review, there was a near consensus among leading market participants that the RBI would signal “a pause.” In the event, the hike in the policy rate by 0.50 percentage point has come as a surprise. The repo rate is now fixed at 8 per cent and the reverse repo at 7 per cent. Monetary policy's trade-off between growth and inflation continues to be sensibly tilted towards restraining inflation.
The reasons, according to the RBI, are compelling. Actual inflation has been even higher than expected. Non-food manufactured product inflation is significantly higher than the six-year average of 4 per cent. Crude oil prices remain volatile. The recent increase in the administered fuel prices and the minimum support price for certain foodgrains will add to the inflationary pressures. On the other side, the slowdown in the growth momentum has so far been confined to a few interest-rate-sensitive sectors. Several indicators such as exports and imports, indirect tax collections, and the demand for bank credit suggest that the growth rate is moderating, but only gradually. Although the impact of past monetary policy action continues to be transmitted, it is necessary to persevere with the anti-inflation efforts, considering the overall growth-inflation scenario. The RBI has raised its projection for inflation as on March 31, 2012, by one percentage point to 7 per cent. As for growth, it sees no reason to change its earlier projection of 8 per cent, which was based on the assumption of a near-normal monsoon and petroleum prices ruling at around $110 a barrel. There are significant downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation. Not for the first time, the RBI has emphasised the role of the government in easing supply side pressures — especially on the food and infrastructure fronts — and in controlling the fiscal deficit.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unrelenting-focus/article2296552.ece
29,7,2011,BJP faces rocky ride in Karnataka,"That B.S. Yeddyurappa agreed to step down as Chief Minister of Karnataka after a succession of scams and controversies is not on account of some sudden, inexplicable change of heart or personality. What brought this about is the rapid change in the national public mood — from helpless resignation in the face of corruption in high places to active opposition to all forms of political corruption. A string of scams, starting with the biggest of them all, the 2G spectrum allocation scandal, triggered the process of change. The involvement of charismatic sections of civil society in the campaign for an effective Lokpal Bill also captured the public imagination. The principal national opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party, sleepwalked its way into the thick of the action against corruption in the United Progressive Alliance government. Now, as one of the lead campaigners, the party seems to have realised that it cannot afford to lose the plot in this national revolt against sleaze and fraud. Mr. Yeddyurappa, at the head of its government in Karnataka, was the antithesis of everything the BJP spoke up for: accountability, transparency, and good governance. Once the Lokayukta submitted its report indicting Mr. Yeddyurappa and some of his Ministers in the illegal mining scam, the party was left with no choice.
Although Mr. Yeddyurappa has agreed to resign, terms and conditions apply. He not only wants his nominee, D.V. Sadananda Gowda, to succeed him but is also asking to be nominated the president of the BJP State unit. Along with the Reddy brothers, who are at the centre of the mining operations, he claims the support of a majority of the BJP MLAs. Together, they seem determined to thwart the formation of any government that is inclined to act on the Lokayukta report. Understandably, the BJP would want to save its first and only government in south India. But to give in to the key demands of Mr. Yeddyurappa and the Reddy brothers will be to nullify any good that might come of the change at the helm. The Lokayukta report gives a detailed account of the illegal mining in Bellary, the fiefdom of the Reddy brothers, which is described as the ‘Republic of Bellary.' The report specifically recommends the removal of one of the Reddy brothers, Janardhan Reddy, from the Cabinet in view of his “misconduct.” The BJP's national leadership, a section of which is clearly in nexus with the mining lobby, will need to facilitate the formation of a government that will be able to act on the Lokayukta recommendations. Providing protection and political rehabilitation for Mr. Yeddyurappa and the Reddy brothers might prolong the BJP's hold on power for some more time, but it would have adverse consequences for Karnataka and its people in the long term.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bjp-faces-rocky-ride-in-karnataka/article2306059.ece
29,7,2011,A short life in music,"It is in the nature of human beings to draw lines between the public and personal, between what they feel and what they project, between the image they cultivate and the reality that lies beneath. One of the unique things about the short and deeply troubled life of Amy Winehouse — who was found dead in her London home of yet unknown causes — was her capacity to dissolve these lines. She was what she was, displaying a raw and almost childlike honesty that lay at the core of her music and was responsible for much of its appeal. If there has been such a huge outpouring of grief over the 27-year-old singer and songwriter's tragic demise, it was partly because people felt they knew her, the aesthetic of her sultry and wounded music inextricably wrapped with the turmoil of a life marked by drink, drug abuse, and volatile relationships. If she explored the dark reality of her substance abuse in her anthemic hit single Rehab (“They tried to make me go on rehab, I said ‘No no no'.”), she addressed betrayal and relationships in another distressingly touching track, You Know That I'm No Good from her Grammy-award winning Back to Black album (“I told you I was trouble”). She was no purveyor of cute fruity pop, but a reflective musician, whose bluesy jazz-inflected compositions evoked a mood of a time gone by and earned her the title of the “Queen of Modern Retro.”
The tabloid press fed greedily off her disturbed life. It was obsessed with the so-called Amy Winehouse look — the shabby mass of hair that sat like a beehive on her head (which compensated, or so she thought, for her diminutive stature); the showy eyeliner that spread like wings from the corner of her eyes; and her kitschy designer clothesline. But it is her music, searingly intelligent and soul baring, that will survive — her tragic and premature death only adding to the iconic status she had acquired in her brief career. With a repertoire of just two studio albums (a third may be issued posthumously), Winehouse's place in the history of rhythm and blues may not be as firmly etched as some others in the so-called 27s Club, that group of influential musicians who died at the age of 27. This club includes giants such as Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison (of the Doors), and Kurt Cobain (of Nirvana). But Amy was well on the way to superstardom, thanks to her unique ability to pour her life into her music. It is quality that made her compositions speak directly to her vast legions of fans on either side of the Atlantic and pretty much all over the world. It made them love her music because — as one enthusiast declared in that splendid 2007 documentary I Told You I Was Trouble — “she's real, she's the truth.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-short-life-in-music/article2306057.ece
29,7,2011,Staying with the process,"“Re-engagement is better than no engagement,” Pakistan's new Foreign Minister, Hina Rabbani Khar, declared prior to her New Delhi visit for talks with External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna. She could not have been more correct. It is a no-brainer that India and Pakistan have no option but to engage in dialogue to resolve the issues that trouble their relationship. It took New Delhi some two years after the November 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks to realise that the absence of dialogue was only pulling the two countries further apart. Indeed, so far apart had they drifted that the July 2010 Foreign Ministers' meeting in Islamabad was a public fiasco; to recover from that and set up a proper dialogue process, as mandated by the Thimphu declaration, took another eight months. That there are forces actively working to trip up the process again was evident from the triple bombing that claimed 20 lives in India's financial capital earlier this month. Ms Khar and Mr. Krishna were careful to avoid rhetoric and recrimination as they reviewed the official-level meetings that took place between March and June on a range of issues, including India's chief concern — speedy trial and punishment of the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai carnage. Expectedly, the joint statement released after the talks broke no new ground: the main focus of both sides has been to stay engaged and deal with the ‘doables' before moving on to the big issues on the list.
Even by this low threshold, the package of Kashmir-related confidence building measures announced by the two sides is meagre, except for the introduction of multiple entry visas with a six-month validity to ease cross-Line of Control travel for Kashmiris, along with travel for tourism and pilgrimages. Disappointingly, the two governments have postponed consideration of measures to improve cross-LoC trade, such as the introduction of banking facilities. The two sides now use a barter method as there is no other payment system. The weekly trading days have been doubled from two to four, but the list of goods that can be traded stands frozen at 21. An unnecessary sour note was struck by New Delhi's objection to the meeting between Ms Khar and Kashmiri separatist leaders. After facilitating this meeting — by permitting Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani and the other leaders to travel from Srinagar to the Indian capital — it was pointless to complain about it. India would have done better to accept the event for what it was, and left it at that. Foreign Minister Khar clearly meant to tell the military-mullah-media alliance back home that ‘inexperienced' she might be, but she was not straying from Kashmir as the ‘core' issue.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/staying-with-the-process/article2302760.ece
29,7,2011,Say no to TB blood tests,"The World Health Organisation recently issued a recommendation against the use of blood tests based on antibody response for diagnosing active tuberculosis, both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary. India's Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) has endorsed WHO's advice. Unfortunately, with TB, unlike diseases like HIV, the presence or absence of antibodies does not reflect true disease condition. So these blood tests lack the necessary sensitivity or specificity or both to be used as an effective diagnostic tool. When the sensitivity is low, many people with active TB are likely to be wrongly diagnosed and hence will go untreated (false negative); tests with low specificity will result in people with no active TB getting treated with toxic drugs (false positive). That explains why serological testing based on antibody responses has so far not been recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other reputed regulators. However, considering that in high prevalence settings like India, while the specificity of sputum smear microscopy testing is better than 99 per cent, the sensitivity is only 60-70 per cent, finding more reliable and inexpensive diagnostic blood tests for TB is a public health imperative.
The world body's recommendation is based on a body of evidence, including a study by its special programme for research & training in tropical diseases (TDR), which looked at 19 commercially available rapid blood tests. The WHO concluded that patient safety is adversely impacted by “commercial serological tests [which] provide inconsistent and imprecise findings.” Unfortunately, notwithstanding the unreliability and prohibitive cost, the private sector in India uses the blood tests on “at least 1.5 million people every year,” according to a report in The Lancet published in January 2011. These tests appear to have been done mostly at the expense of sputum examination. For example, a 2006 WHO report, “Diagnostics for tuberculosis — global demand and market potential,” found that in Tamil Nadu and Delhi, less than one-third of patients underwent sputum examination despite multiple visits while doctors based in west India relied solely on chest X-rays for diagnosis. That the government has to curb the availability of serological antibody tests and undertake awareness-building campaign among doctors and the public on the benefits of sputum tests cannot be over-emphasised. This is vital to public health — considering that in India the incidence rate of TB is a high 168 per 100,000 population and the disease kills two people every three minutes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/say-no-to-tb-blood-tests/article2302762.ece
31,7,2011,Undemocratic ban,"Since law and order in the capital is handled directly by the Centre, it is obvious that the Manmohan Singh government is fully behind the decision of the Delhi Police to invoke Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in Jantar Mantar. The ban on any protest or even gathering of four or more people in areas under the jurisdiction of the Parliament Street police division is aimed, first and foremost, at Anna Hazare and his supporters whose campaign for a genuinely empowered Lokpal is all set to go into high gear from August 16. According to a formal notice issued by the Delhi Police, Section 144 has been imposed because the “unrestricted holding of public meetings, processions, demonstrations etc. in the area are likely to cause obstruction to traffic, danger to human safety and disturbance of public tranquillity” and that unless urgent measures to prevent such gatherings is not taken, there is “danger to human life or safety and disturbance.” This reasoning is an insult to the intelligence of all citizens and also demonstrates the extent to which the professionalism of the police is being compromised by the political motives of the ruling party and coalition. The last time Mr. Hazare and his supporters occupied Jantar Mantar, which has long been recognised as a legitimate site for public protest, there was no violence or breach of the peace. Indeed, the peaceful nature of that protest was what made it so potent, and unpalatable for the government. That is why the Congress has decided that civil society groups must not be allowed to stage a repeat.
By seeking to deny citizens the right to stage even peaceful, non-violent protests, the Manmohan Singh regime is betraying not just intolerance but also a lack of confidence in the face of growing public anger against political corruption and the cover-up of allegations of corruption. Although the government's own draft of the Lokpal Bill has not yet been made public, the fact that it differs from the proposals of Mr. Hazare and his team on several key issues is well known. If the government is confident about the robustness of its own proposals, it should not worry about the campaign that its critics are waging. Citizens at large have the ability to judge what is valid and what is not, provided an informed debate is held. Indians may be argumentative but they are not unreasonable. Instead of responding democratically to the civil society draft with logic and argument, the government is using its executive powers to stifle dissent. Though Mr. Hazare is free to stage his fast somewhere else, it is time the courts stepped in to put an end to this blatant misuse of Section 144.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/undemocratic-ban/article2311296.ece
31,7,2011,Noise by numbers,"The ambient noise data coming from real-time monitoring systems in India's cities indicate that people are at risk of suffering harmful health consequences. Chronic noise in urban centres has been dangerously increasing mainly because of motorisation. In March, the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests took a significant step forward to quantify the problem by setting up real-time monitoring centres in seven cities — Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Lucknow, Bangalore, Chennai, and Hyderabad. These sites are now putting out data round the clock and what they reveal is worrying. The ambient noise in residential and commercial areas is far in excess not just of a healthy level, but the standards set by law as well. This is unacceptable. There is robust medical evidence linking exposure to chronic noise of a certain level with harm. The effects include loss of hearing sensitivity in specific frequencies and non-auditory effects like hypertension, heart rate disorders, and psychological stress. It is time the Centre and the States took this public health challenge seriously. The remedies are there in the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, which were amended last year to incorporate rising pollution concerns. New sources identified for control included automotive horns, firecrackers, and musical instruments; public places were defined for enforcement purposes.
The major problem so far in enforcing the law on noise has been the absence of reliable data. A dramatic scaling up of the real-time monitoring system, which is a limited project now with a footprint of only 35 locations in seven cities, can reveal the magnitude of the challenge. It is welcome that the number of locations will be doubled in the existing cities and similar facilities extended to 18 others by 2012. But the data generated by the sensors should be in the public domain on the Internet, if the system is to serve any meaningful purpose. Restricting access to those in authority would obviously defeat the objective. According to the rules, any person can make a complaint to the Designated Authority, such as the police, if the ambient noise exceeds the prescribed standard by 10 dB(A) or more. Yet, without the means to measure the noise level, citizen won't be able to make a complaint and the authority won't be able to intervene. In parallel, the government must launch a campaign to highlight the rules and the ill-effects. India's metros are adding hundreds of new vehicles each day to overcrowded roads. In the absence of a driving culture and legal literacy, drivers are trying to honk their way ahead. This harmful cacophony must stop.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/noise-by-numbers/article2311298.ece
1,8,2011,A costly compromise,"President Barack Obama and Congressional leaders, Republicans and Democrats, might have struck a last-minute budget deal that will raise the nation's statutorily fixed borrowing limit and thus avert a calamitous default by the federal government. But the bitter political acrimony in the run-up to the agreement, the intense politicisation by far-Right sections of the Republican party of what ought to have been a routine but necessary enhancement of the government's borrowing powers, and the apparent willingness of sections of the political elite to risk the nation's reputation rather than give up on dogmatic, pro-rich positions speak to the crisis at the heart of the U.S. political economy. When the final details of the deal are released, the Obama administration and the Democratic Party would be seen to have compromised heavily on what they had argued were non-negotiable positions. The Republicans had argued for, and finally succeeded in imposing, large spending cuts in the federal budget in return for raising the debt ceiling. On the other hand, the Democrats' proposals to have new taxes so that the rich would share a burden of social costs, especially of Medicare, seem to have been given the go-by. The deal envisages a reduction of about $2.5 trillion from the federal budget over the next 10 years: the first $900 billion to $1 trillion will come from domestic discretionary programmes that are for the benefit of the poor and the middle class. Almost certainly, the agreement will hinder economic recovery.
For now, the U.S. will manage to escape the consequences of the debt limit showdown, with its credit ratings intact. Various arms of the government will be able to borrow more and honour their commitments. However, it is clear the country's reputation has suffered grievously. The bitterness, division, and dysfunction that resonated around the world in recent weeks as the world's largest economy veered towards default did more than enhance an already existing perception that it was losing its aura. Questions will be asked as to whether it will remain the world's economic haven and the country that is capable of leading the world out of financial crises and recessions. It is now quite uncertain whether the U.S. will be able to cobble together, with other rich countries, stimulus packages to spur the world economy as President Obama did in London two years ago. The desperately crafted budget deal signals a new phase of austerity for the U.S., which might turn more inward-looking. The dollar, for long the world's reserve currency, is already under pressure as investors have turned to gold and strong currencies such as the Swiss franc.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-costly-compromise/article2314037.ece
1,8,2011,Losing sight of the external sector,"The current, and entirely justified, policy focus on reining in inflation has worryingly diverted attention away from other critical areas of the economy, such as the external sector. India's deft external sector management has ensured stability of the macroeconomy during the major global financial crises in recent years. In fact, India's measured approach to capital account convertibility has won all-round praise. The strategic changes introduced in the early 1990s covering trade, foreign investment, and the management of exchange rate and reserves have served the country well. Of late, however, some signs of weakness have shown up, and they need to be addressed. To be sure, there are huge positives. For instance, the recent export performance has been exemplary despite the global slowdown. Exports grew by 38 per cent to touch $246 billion in 2010-11. The momentum has continued into this year. With exports clocking a growth rate of 46 per cent in the first quarter, the government has raised the target to $300 billion for 2011-12. While imports too have been robust, the strong export growth has caused the trade deficit to narrow to $105 billion in 2010-11 from $116 billion in the year before.
On the negative side, the widening current account deficit that has led to greater dependence on riskier capital flows to finance it, and the dwindling foreign direct investment flows pose special challenges. Although the current account deficit has been contained at the prudential limit of 3 per cent of the GDP in 2010-11, invisible receipts have been coming down. From $91.6 billion in 2008-09, they have dropped to $79.99 billion in 2009-10 and the figure for the first nine months of 2010-11 was $63.18 billion. Equally worrying is the sharp fall in the non-debt-creating foreign direct investment from $34.17 billion in 2009-10 to $27 billion in 2010-11. Portfolio flows have declined marginally but the inflows by way of external commercial borrowings and foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCB) have increased dramatically. Official policy has been to encourage non-debt-creating flows since these investors are unlikely to pull out for short-term considerations. According to a recent UNCTAD report, India has fallen behind many countries among the world's top investment destinations. India's forex reserves are yet to return to the pre-crisis levels, while the current account deficit has more than doubled and the capital flows have become more volatile. None of these might pose immediate threats to the macroeconomy but they do reveal incipient weaknesses that cannot be ignored.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/losing-sight-of-the-external-sector/article2314040.ece
2,8,2011,A better Land Acquisition Bill,"The longstanding demand to correct anomalies in the Land Acquisition Act (1894) and check its misuse, and the impending Uttar Pradesh Assembly election have compelled the United Progressive Alliance government to come up with a much-improved piece of legislation. In speedily reshaping the proposed Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill, which has been placed in the public domain as part of a pre-legislative consultative process, Jairam Ramesh, the new Cabinet Minster for Rural Development, has wisely departed from his predecessor's approach by integrating acquisition with rehabilitation and resettlement measures. Following the National Advisory Council's recommendations, the bill has commendably increased the compensation amount and enhanced the solatium to 100 per cent. It rightly prohibits the acquisition of irrigated multi-crop agricultural land. A pre-notification discussion with local bodies is a procedural innovation that should help reduce litigation and speed up the process of just acquisition. By making it mandatory to obtain consent from 80 per cent of the affected people before the acquisition notice is issued, the proposed legislation seeks to ensure that consultations are held with those affected.
An unambiguous definition of public purpose is critical. Unfortunately, the draft bill misses out on this. Of the four categories of public purpose mentioned in the final draft, two — especially the section on acquiring land for private companies — are the most debatable. The bill does not clarify how private and public purpose in a private project will be evaluated. To argue that private projects contribute to economic growth and improve employment is to resort to specious justification. As witnessed in the past, vague definitions tend to be grossly misused. The state can extend its help when small parcels of land, for reasons of legality in property title, hold up a large project, but it must not intervene wholesale. To make up for the rampant undervaluing of land transactions, the bill proposes to triple the value of rural properties identified for acquisition. But it ignores similar problems that plague urban areas and deny fair valuation. On the other hand, the proposal to look at alternative forms of compensation, such as allocation of a share of the developed land, is confined to urban projects. The proposal to return unused land five years after its acquisition is to be welcomed, but allowing the government to transfer the unused land from one public purpose to another, as suggested by the draft, will abet misuse. The shortcomings of the qualitatively improved bill must be removed without delay.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-better-land-acquisition-bill/article2316972.ece
2,8,2011,Turkey's reset,"In his long running battle with Turkey's military, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has gained the decisive upper hand. The resignation of the chief of staff, General Isik Kosaner, along with the three service chiefs was a momentous event in a country that has seen four military coups and periods of civilian rule dominated by the military. The resignations came in the wake of the arrests of as many as 40 generals suspected to have been involved in an attempt to topple the first Erdogan government in 2003. In a previous era, the military would have hit back with another coup. But over the last two years, its wings have been steadily clipped by Mr. Erdogan, whose political standing has soared with his repeated success at elections; on the back of solid achievement, his Justice and Development Party (AKP) won a third term two months ago. With him at the helm, Turkey has seen rapid economic growth. Its confidence has extended to the framing of a foreign policy that seeks to be independent of that of its western allies. Although joining the European Union remains a goal, it now favours more engagement with its West Asian neighbours. It has sought to reshape ties with Israel in keeping with its new friendships in the Arab world, where its democratic credentials are held in admiration. Following the shock resignations of the military brass, the government moved to prevent any instability by quickly appointing a non-ambitious general as acting chief of staff. It has also made clear that when the Supreme Military Council appoints a new command for the three services later this week, it will be with the government's approval.
At the heart of the government's tensions with the military is the perception that Prime Minister Erdogan wants to take the country away from Kemalist secularism that has defined modern Turkey. The military has traditionally seen itself as the guardian of this secular vision, while the AKP has its roots in political Islam. In recent years, the debate on the issue has polarised Turkey, centring on official moves to ease the ban on the headscarf. As the government sets its sights next on changing the 1982 Constitution framed by the military after it took power in a coup in 1980, its main challenge will be to heal rather than exacerbate the divisions in the interests of retaining the civilian upper hand. The Prime Minister has promised a consensual and “inclusive” Constitution that will be “democratic and liberal.” Turkey is in reset mode. It is to be hoped that Mr. Erdogan, who has emerged as a leader with the most influence after founding father Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, will use it wisely.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/turkeys-reset/article2316974.ece
3,8,2011,Tough tasks ahead of Gowda,"With a clear majority in the Bharatiya Janata Party State legislature wing voting for D.V. Sadananda Gowda as leader of the legislature party and chief ministerial candidate, an unedifying phase of factional struggle appears to be behind the party, at least for the present. With a consensus candidate eluding the two factions — the B.S. Yeddyurappa-led faction backed Mr. Gowda, and the H.N. Ananthkumar-led group fielded Rural Development and Panchayati Raj minister Jagadish Shettar — the central party leadership was obliged to accede to the demand for a secret ballot. Its outcome, a victory for Mr. Yeddyurappa, is already causing disquiet in the other faction even though Mr. Shettar has been promised the post of Deputy Chief Minister. A belligerent Mr. Yeddyurappa, who was forced to step down on July 31 following his indictment in the report on illegal mining by the Karnataka Lokayukta, bargained hard for a person of his choice as his successor. He rallied his supporters and let the central party leadership know that he was a force to reckon with. Nevertheless, his problems are far from over with Governor H.R. Bhardwaj, in a well-timed move, giving sanction to the Lokayukta police to prosecute him under the Prevention of Corruption Act.
While the BJP high command will be relieved that its only government in south India has been saved, the political crisis has not gone away. Indeed, it is this crisis that will present both challenges and opportunities for the incoming Chief Minister. The ever-smiling Mr. Gowda, Member of Parliament from Udupi-Chickmagalur in Dakshina Kannada district and a relatively non-controversial and affable figure in the party, has had no administrative experience. More importantly, he must shed the image of being Mr. Yeddyurappa's factotum. Mr. Gowda will be judged by how he confronts the issues of corruption plaguing the party and the government, and whether he allows the legal process in the two sets of cases before the Special Lokayukta Court pertaining to corruption allegations against Mr. Yeddyurappa to proceed unhindered. Illegal mining has cost the state Rs.16,085 crore, according to the Lokayukta report, which has also given a series of recommendations to prosecute the corrupt and cleanse the administrative machinery. It is for Mr. Gowda to implement the recommendations of the report. This may not be easy as, in addition to the outgoing Chief Minister, he will need to take on the powerful Bellary clique of Ministers and the vested interests that depend on illegal mining. For a start, his independence and seriousness of purpose will be seen in who he inducts into his Ministry — in the light of the indictments in the Lokayukta report.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tough-tasks-ahead-of-gowda/article2319688.ece
3,8,2011,Messages from a downgrade,"The economic slowdown is gaining more official acknowledgment. Prime Minister's economic advisory council (PMEAC) now expects the economy to grow by 8.2 per cent during this year, sharply lower than the 9 per cent rate it had forecast first in July 2010 and reaffirmed in January 2011. Neither the timing nor the extent of the downgrade need surprise anyone. In fact, the PMEAC's revision has come some three months after the Reserve Bank of India, in its annual credit policy statement (May 3), estimated growth at 8 per cent. Most private forecasters and international agencies have been projecting even lower growth rates. It is certain that the Finance Ministry will also lower its forecast, of 8.6 per cent, well before its mid-year review of the economy. The advisory council attributes its downward revision to the persisting inflation and investment slowdown. Global factors can spur inflation and diminish growth prospects. Gross domestic fixed capital formation has weakened significantly, with initial estimates for 2010-11 placing it at 29.5 per cent. High rates of domestic inflation, excessive government debt, and political instability have eroded business confidence impacting asset creation adversely. The PMEAC has called for a push to the reform agenda. Conditions will have to be created to raise the fixed investment rate to 33 per cent plus. The domestic savings rate has fallen to 33.7 per cent in 2009-10 and is unlikely to be more than 34 per cent this year.
The projected 8.2 per cent growth, though lower than in the previous year, would still be creditable given the current global situation. This is a point that the RBI too has been making, while continuing its tight money policy even at the cost of some of the growth momentum. According to the PMEAC, India missed an opportunity to speed up infrastructure development and improve efficiency in public expenditure in the social sector. “The combined momentum of a stable government after the May 2009 elections and the successful navigation through the crisis was a good opportunity to take those necessary steps to energetically get back to the imperatives. However we have lost time.” The spate of corruption-related controversies over the past one year has consumed the energies of the government and has led to an unintended slowing down of initiatives to restore confidence in the economy. The clear message from the advisory council is that even the downgraded economic growth rate may not be sustained unless the government arrests the policy drift and gets back to governance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/messages-from-a-downgrade/article2319686.ece
4,8,2011,Deteriorating in Syria,"The situation in Syria has gone from bad to worse with President Basher al Assad prepared to use any amount of force to crush the protests against his regime. The bombardment by security forces of Hama, a town that has been at the centre of the protests, left at least 80 people dead on the first day of Ramzan. An estimated 1,600 people have been killed so far in the protests that first erupted in March, inspired by the ‘Arab spring' in the region. The regime is unrepentant. President Assad prefers to see a foreign conspiracy to “tear Syria into small statelets that compete to satisfy those who worked to slice them up.” If this is true, the regime, which plays the sectarian card to its own advantage, must take the blame for strengthening the hands of the purported conspirators. The genesis of Syria's pro-democracy movement lies in Assad family rule and the concentration of powers in the minority Alawite sect to which it belongs. Unsurprisingly, the majority Sunni form the bulk of the protesters, though by no means all. The sectarian divide does raise concerns of a civil war should there be a power vacuum in Damascus. Thus far, the regime's efforts at offering limited political reform have cut little ice with protesters. Last week, President Assad announced a new law permitting the formation of political parties, aside from the ruling Ba'ath party, to no apparent effect. The two main cities of Damascus and Aleppo have still not seen any protest but most other parts of the country are in ferment.
How far should the world go in influencing the course of events in Syria? Military intervention by outside powers to force President Assad to leave office will be disastrous and must be strongly opposed. Aside from the double-standards involved, (why not Bahrain, then?), the brutal NATO bombing campaign has actually led to the strengthening of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. Moreover, the Syrian regime's ties with Lebanon and Iran and its shared border with Turkey give the problem a wider dimension. After protracted discussion, the U.N. Security Council has issued a statement condemning the Syrian government for using force against civilians and the violations of human rights. Russia, India, and Brazil have taken some flak for blocking a resolution and watering down the statement by calling on “all sides” to act with restraint. But the UNSC call for an “inclusive” Syrian-led process to address the political aspirations of the Syrian people was the right one. While sending an unequivocal message to the Assad regime that the world does not approve of its actions, it has the advantage of keeping a door open for diplomatic negotiations to help resolve the crisis.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/deteriorating-in-syria/article2322661.ece
4,8,2011,Marvels of Machu Picchu,"There are very few monuments in the world that are as inspiring and uplifting as Machu Picchu. This 15th century ensemble of monuments, spectacularly situated at the altitude of 2,430 metres on the Andes Mountains in Peru, recently celebrated the centenary of its discovery — an occasion to recall its significance and to press home the imperative need to vastly improve its conservation. This self-contained city was abandoned by the Incas about 450 years ago and remained unknown to the outside world till Hiram Bingham, a Yale University explorer, spotted it with the help of local people in 1911. His scientific surveys and writings brought world attention to this magnificent site that includes religious structures, urban quarters, plazas, and terraced farms. Archaeologists, handicapped by a lack of written records, have been unable precisely to state the functions of this complex. However, it is widely believed to have been a ceremonial centre and a royal retreat. Machu Picchu is a showpiece of imaginative construction techniques, which ensured the stability of its structures; intelligent hydraulic engineering principles, which effectively drained the site prone to torrential rains; and creative geotechnical engineering ideas, which protected its steep slopes from erosion.
Machu Picchu has of course been designated as a World Heritage site, celebrated as the UNESCO assessment report puts it, as “an outstanding example of man's interaction with his natural environment.” The American Society of Civil Engineers has recognised it as an International Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. Sadly, this cultural landscape, which brings in a revenue of about $40 million a year to Peru, is not among the best protected. Attention has been paid to the historic ruins, but the area surrounding them is beset with problems. An area measuring 32,500 hectares, including the monument zone, has been declared a protected zone; two master plans addressing issues of development and heritage protection have long been ready; and the number of visitors has been restricted to 2,500 a day. However, conservation efforts, reviewed in 2010, have not made sufficient progress. Insensitive development, poor access to the sanctuary, and the absence of environmental impact assessments continue to take a toll on civilisational heritage. The government of Peru has done well in persuading Yale University to repatriate thousands of artefacts taken away by Hiram Bingham from Machu Picchu, but it has not shown the strong and sustained commitment needed to implement a comprehensive conservation plan. The time to act resolutely is now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/marvels-of-machu-picchu/article2322663.ece
5,8,2011,Sinking counter-terror reforms,"Early this week, when the abandoned 1,000-tonne oil tanker Pavit washed up on Mumbai's famous Juhu Beach, India's post-26/11 maritime counter-terrorism preparedness stood exposed: over Rs.600 crore worth of new ships, equipment, and staff, it is clear, have done nothing to make the country's coastline safer. That a massive ship could drift undetected through Indian waters for over 100 hours before ploughing into a crowded beach in a major city speaks ill of the preparedness of the Indian Navy, the Coast Guard, and the Maharashtra Police's marine forces. The Pavit could, after all, have been carrying terrorists, contraband or, even worse, toxic chemicals that could have claimed the lives of thousands. In the wake of investigative reports in this newspaper, Union Defence Minister A.K. Antony has promised a full investigation into the fiasco. It can only be hoped that this, unlike past investigations, will fix responsibility and produce results. A succession of terrorist attacks that have taken place since 26/11 remain unsolved, casting a question mark over the investigative and intelligence capabilities of the country's police forces. A thoroughgoing investigation is needed to reassess the ambitious security modernisation programme hurriedly put in place after 26/11.
From successive annual reports of the Ministry of Home Affairs, it does not seem that there are any metrics to gauge the on-ground effectiveness of the investments it is making. The MHA painstakingly records progress in the realisation of physical security infrastructure — for example, the purchase of equipment and construction of police station. But it does not seem to study whether the resources are serving the purposes for which they are meant. Maharashtra, for example, purchased state-of-the art weapons and set up training facilities with central government funds; but it has never once had to carry out urban terrorism emergency-response drills in which their effectiveness would be tested. This means that the test of success or failure is the expeditious spending of funds — not whether the funds are being put to good use. Part of the blame, of course, lies with the States, which seem only too happy to spend money on security infrastructure without pausing to assess results. New Delhi, however, must share the blame. Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram has been applauded for breathing life into a moribund security establishment since he took office in the wake of 26/11. The Pavit affair has made it clear that the programmes his Ministry put in place are just not good enough. India's badly exposed counter-terrorism effort needs to be injected with introspection and seriousness of purpose, not just big bucks.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sinking-counterterror-reforms/article2328352.ece
5,8,2011,Mayhem in the markets,"The intense selling pressure the Indian stock markets have been experiencing recently is in line with the great sell-off that is rocking the global markets. In eight trading days since July 26, when the Reserve Bank of India hiked the interest rates by a larger than expected margin, the Sensex has lost 1,178 points. But it is the developments in the financial markets of Europe and the United States that have had a far greater influence than the domestic factors. International financial markets have witnessed three sharp shifts in just a few weeks. In the U.S., the S&P 500 has fallen on eight of the past nine trading days losing about a tenth of its value in the process. On Thursday alone, the Dow Jones industrial average and most major stock indices around the world sagged more than 4 per cent. With Thursday's fall, the three major American indices had given up all the gains made so far in 2011. Europe has not fared any better. The FTSE 100 is down by almost 7 per cent and the DAX by 11 per cent since August 1.
Currency markets too have had their share of turmoil. As fearful investors turned to safe-haven currencies, the yen and the Swiss franc, they appreciated sharply, eroding their countries' competitiveness. Central bank intervention to stem their rise has not been wholly successful. After the stock and currency markets, the market for bank funding is sputtering, especially in Europe. Inter-bank credit lines are drying up. This development is a direct consequence of the expanding debt crisis in the eurozone countries. Banks which have lent to the weaker countries are cowering as they wait to take the hit. Consequently, they have become extremely risk averse. In general, the market shift seems plainly driven by a wave of pessimism and fear about the economic outlook. In the U.S., the sense of relief that immediately followed the aversion of a default in the the last minute has given way to deep concerns over the economy and employment prospects. Investors are no longer as optimistic about the strength of corporate profits as they were in the first half of the year. However, even as the near-term economic outlook is anything but bright, fears of a double-dip recession appear to be exaggerated. Unlike in 2008, when its banking system broke, the credit markets are healthy today, and in the U.S., as in Europe, it is a crisis of confidence that finds expression in the financial markets. Yet the perception of weak growth has had a positive outcome for consumers, as the prices of several commodities including petroleum have fallen sharply. Amid the carnage, there are some pillars of hope.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mayhem-in-the-markets/article2328353.ece
7,8,2011,Downgrading the U.S.,"The decision of Standard & Poor's, one of the top three rating agencies, to downgrade, for the first time ever, its rating of U.S. government long-term debt by one notch from ‘AAA' to ‘AA plus' is a historic one and highlights the diminished fiscal stature of the world's number one economy. The rating agency has said the unseemly political controversy and discourse that almost forced the federal government to default has lowered the standing of the U.S. “The gulf between the political parties” has undermined S&P's confidence in the government's ability to manage its finances. Few will question its view that the effectiveness, stability and predictability of American policy-making and political institutions have weakened at a time when fiscal challenges are persisting. Worse, the long-term outlook remains negative: another downgrading is possible within the next two years if the reduction in spending is less than that agreed to recently under the ceiling deal, or if there is a rise in U.S. interest rates or if the debt increases further.
Since the S&P's announcement came after the markets closed on Friday, one has to await their opening on Monday to know the range and intensity of the impact of the downgrading on the stocks at the global level. Given the vulnerability of the U.S. economy, the bond yields are bound to soar immediately. The borrowing costs of the federal government, and many institutions linked to it such as the housing mortgage companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, will go up. That will be bad news especially for the U.S. housing sector, which was at the centre of the last financial crisis and whose revival is a sin quo non for general economic recovery. Since the federal government incurs some $250 billion by way of interest payments every year, even a small hike in rates will inflate the deficit. There will be more clamour for an alternative global reserve currency, although the downgrading by itself does not significantly alter the current situation where the dollar holds sway for want of a real contender. The other two major rating agencies — Moody's and Fitch — are not reviewing their ratings at least for now, and this, the analysts say, may help contain the impact of the S&P decision. The credit rating agencies themselves are trying hard to win back their credibility that took a beating during the global financial crisis which saw highly-rated complex mortgage securities collapse. While it is difficult to anticipate all the consequences of the downgrading of the U.S. government's long term debt, there is little doubt it will add to the existing uncertainty and make recovery that much more difficult.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/downgrading-the-us/article2333827.ece
7,8,2011,Bullying the Commons to death,"The claim by the Leader of the British House of Commons, Sir George Young, that public engagement with the political process will be revived by an e-petition for a parliamentary debate on the death penalty is both meretricious and retrogressive. To start with, the new e-petitions, which were mentioned in the 2010 Conservative Party manifesto, are riddled with problems. They rely on self-selection by those of the public who choose to participate; this makes the results highly unreliable as an index of representativeness, with further problems arising from the way a petition is worded. In addition, the threshold for a petition to be considered by the Commons for debate is 100,000 signatures, merely 0.16 per cent of the British population. Moreover, access is restricted to internet users. Sir George also fails to mention that such petitions bind neither Parliament nor the government; his own Cabinet colleague, Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove, has announced that he will ignore one signed by 140,000 people requesting him not to exclude religious education from an English school-leaving certificate.
As for the substantive issue involved, bringing back the death penalty, the Commons Leader is indulging in calculated and crude populism. In the United Kingdom, the subject of capital punishment arouses strong feelings, to which people have every right, but the last executions occurred in 1964. In 1969, Parliament abolished the death penalty for murder; in 1998 it confirmed the ban by incorporating almost the whole of the European Convention on Human Rights, which proscribes capital punishment in peacetime. The same principle is also laid down by the European Union in its Charter of Fundamental Rights. Were the U.K. to restore capital punishment, it would almost certainly be expelled from the EU and would face suspension from the Council of Europe, the custodian of the European Convention. Such consequences apart, the British Tory-led coalition government is in effect ignoring the inherent dangers and evils of this form of punishment. For example, had the penalty been in force over the last two decades, the U.K. would almost certainly have executed two completely innocent people, Colin Stagg and Christopher Jefferies, for murder after vicious media witch-hunts, which in turn may well have made fair trials impossible for them. Furthermore, recently published evidence of police-media collusion has undermined confidence in the British criminal justice system. It is therefore essential for the House of Commons to resist Sir George's attempt to bully it towards restoring the barbaric and utterly anachronistic death penalty.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bullying-the-commons-to-death/article2333824.ece
8,8,2011,Dirty games,"Corruption and incompetence are two different issues. But in the staging of the Commonwealth Games 2010 in New Delhi, big-ticket corruption appears to have been deliberately disguised as lower level incompetence and inefficiency. The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on CWG, presented in Parliament last Friday, is a step-by-step expose of the acts of omission and commission of the Organising Committee headed by Congress Member of Parliament Suresh Kalmadi, of the Delhi government, and of the Prime Minister's Office. The delays in decision-making listed in the report were intended to put pressure on timelines and thereby obtain waivers in laid-down government procedures while awarding contracts for the creation of Games-related infrastructure. As the CAG report points out, many contracts were given on single bids, and some even on nomination basis: “Eliminating competition led to huge avoidable extra burden on the exchequer.” The findings are an indictment of the Delhi government for irregularities and favouritism in the award of contracts and in the appointment of consultants — and of the PMO for rejecting all objections to the appointment of Mr. Kalmadi as chairman of the OC.
Mr. Kalmadi is now in Tihar jail following a CBI investigation and the willful mismanagement of the OC is already the subject of a criminal case. But Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will have a lot of explaining to do in the light of the CAG revelations. If the Congress were to adopt the standards it demanded of its rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party, in Karnataka, it would have no choice but to show Ms Dikshit the door. After calling for the resignation of B.S. Yeddyurappa as Karnataka Chief Minister following the indictment by the Lokayukta, the party cannot now take refuge in the argument that it is up to the Public Accounts Committee to look into the CAG report. Prime Minister Singh needs to clarify the extraordinary interest shown by the PMO in favouring Mr. Kalmadi. Notwithstanding the current attempts by the Congress to distance itself from the jailed MP, it is evident that he enjoyed the backing of people at the top in the party. Instead of pinning the entire blame on those already caught out, the United Progressive Alliance government should strive to restore the people's confidence in the system. The lesson from CWG 2010 is neatly laid out in the conclusion of the CAG report: “Not only should transparency and fair play be exercised, the public at large should perceive that Government monies have been expended in a fair and transparent manner and officials will be held accountable for lapses.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dirty-games/article2337209.ece
8,8,2011,Prioritise this scheme,"If the Public Bicycle Scheme for 10 cities envisaged by the Ministry of Urban Development can get rolling and achieve critical mass, it can elevate the humble bicycle to a relaxed, mainstream mode of urban transport. Shared bicycles have won attention in many European cities, notably in Spain and France, and have been making inroads in America. There's nothing novel about using a bicycle as a mobility option in India. But what makes the Ministry's plans under the Mission for Sustainable Habitat different is the attempt to move pedal power up the value chain. It will feature modern bicycles, Information Technology-based operations, control and management systems, and high visibility. These qualities can win converts from the users of cars and motorised two-wheelers. The shift is essential because the outcome can reinforce the principle of equity in the use of roads, ease congestion, and reduce pollution. The benefits will be multi-dimensional. The biggest hurdle to greater use of bicycles in India's cities is not lack of popular demand — but a hostile external environment. The National Urban Transport Policy of 2006 addressed the problem of lack of safety for non-motorised transport but bicycle-inclusive city planning has not followed. If this does not get priority, the public bicycle scheme cannot take off in the first tier of cities.
Bicycles are a low-cost, non-polluting means of getting around but the international experience points to challenges that need to be overcome while implementing shared systems. The Velib in Paris encountered high rates of loss and vandalism but London has fared better and Barcelona's four-year-old Bicing programme has measurably cut down carbon dioxide emissions. There is little doubt that attracting more people, including the better-off sections of society, to this mode of transport will make India's roads safer for the thousands of less affluent cyclists who remain virtually invisible to policymakers. A good start can be made by locating shared bicycle stations in school zones. This can help build loyalty for the programme and community support for re-engineering roads around schools. The 2006 policy did emphasise building segregated rights of way for bicycles and pedestrians but most State governments have ignored the advice, favouring car-oriented development instead. The Urban Development Ministry's plan provides the opportunity to review urban development policies. To advance the egalitarian goal of getting more people to take to bicycles in cities, there must be a conscious effort to restrain motorised traffic and reduce speed. This can be done using road design and policy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/prioritise-this-scheme/article2337205.ece
9,8,2011,Clean up in Karnataka,"It took six days and all of the new Karnataka Chief Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda's negotiating skills to break the stalemate between the two factions of the State Bharatiya Janata Party on the constitution of the Council of Ministers. The 21 legislators, including one woman, sworn in by Governor H.R. Bhardwaj were all Ministers holding the very same portfolios under B.S. Yeddyurappa. Mr. Gowda's arrangement appears to have satisfied both groups for the present. Although he has inducted 12 members from the Yeddyurappa faction and nine from the group identified with Jagadish Shettar, he balanced this perceived tilt by dropping two former Ministers who are Yeddyurappa-loyalists. The demand by the pro-Shettar faction for the appointment of two deputy chief ministers from the group was rejected on the grounds that it would further polarise a divided party. The Bellary group, comprising former Tourism Minister G. Janardhan Reddy, former Revenue Minister G. Karunakara Reddy, and former Health Minister B. Sriramulu, who were indicted in the Karnataka Lokayukta report on illegal mining, have been kept out. However, Mr. V. Somanna, whose sons' names figure in the report, has been inducted as Housing Minister. With the maximum number of Ministers in a 225-member Legislative Assembly fixed at 34, Mr. Gowda can expand his Council of Ministers by another 12.
Though initially perceived as a proxy for his powerful predecessor, Mr. Gowda, it would appear, is keen to strike a neutral path, demonstrated in his scheme for resolving the Ministry-formation conflict. Meanwhile, several high profile corruption cases involving BJP leaders before the Lokayukta Special Court are entering a decisive phase, with former Industries Minister Katta Subramanya Naidu and his son remanded in judicial custody in a land-grab case, and Mr. Yeddyurappa himself being issued summons to appear before the court in a land-related case. In the second edition of its tenure and with another two years left, the BJP government, led by Mr. Gowda, can act decisively to rid itself of the taint of corruption, an image ingrained in the popular imagination and reflected in a recent poll that shows 52 per cent of respondents in Karnataka saying the State government is more corrupt than the central government, which is quite a feat in itself. Chief Minister Sadananda Gowda must learn from the mistakes of the past and focus attention on the tasks ahead, namely, to provide an honest and efficient administration that will clean up the mining sector, fulfil the slew of promises the previous administration made to farmers, and improve rural infrastructure, especially power supply.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/clean-up-in-karnataka/article2340525.ece
9,8,2011,"Mirror, mirror on the wall","The United Kingdom may be spending the first few days of its summer holiday season in a state of shock at the speed and scale of rioting and looting in London and other major cities such as Liverpool, Bristol, and Birmingham. Leading politicians have returned early from family holidays, Parliament has been recalled, and more than 16,000 policemen will be out on London streets on Wednesday. The trigger for the current rioting may have been the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan, aged 29, when police stopped the car carrying him in Tottenham area, one of London's poorest neighbourhoods, on the night of August 4. The following day events went out of control at the end of a peaceful gathering by Mr. Duggan's family outside a local police station — and within hours, rioters were on the rampage. Since then, mobile phones and other electronic gadgets have been used to specify meeting points for more violence and looting across London and elsewhere. Chain stores have been targeted, but so have local shops and businesses of long standing and good reputation, in what amount to bouts of consumerist looting. There is growing public anger against the failure of the police to act effectively and in time, and even calls for vigilantism.
What is clear is that the government is doing its best to obscure the serious underlying issues, which have to do with crime on the streets but even more with deprivation, joblessness, and low morale in society. In the current financial climate, the poorest have been hit hardest by public spending cutbacks. The local council, Haringey, has cut its youth budget by 75 per cent at a time when the central government abolished maintenance allowances that have kept young people in education for the crucial two years after compulsory schooling; it has also ended job-related youth funding. Even the police, like all other British public services, face cuts and have to work under target-driven management systems, which load frontline staff with paperwork and leave their seniors remote from life on the beat. Those factors, quite apart from persistent tensions between the police and Britons of Afro-Caribbean descent, may well have been responsible for the police's failure even to meet Mr. Duggan's family and friends in what was to have been a one-hour silent vigil. The protesters were kept waiting for four hours, at the end of which the event was hijacked by outsiders, who may have had their own resentments over being excluded from consumer benefits in an increasingly divided society.

10,8,2011,Somalia's misery,"The famine in Somalia has piled more misery on the people of a country wracked by a civil war for two decades. A famine alert is declared when two out of every 10 people have access to less than 2,100 calories; four out of 10,000 children, or two out of 10,000 people die every day; 30 per cent of the children suffer from acute malnutrition. The United Nations has declared that two regions in southern Somalia — southern Bakool and Lower Shabelle — are in the grip of a famine that is killing six out of every 10,000 children under the age of five every day. Nearly 3.7 million people are directly affected by the crisis, and over 2 million require emergency aid. A severe drought since 2009 in the Horn of Africa has affected three other countries — Kenya, Ethiopia, and Djibouti. But it is only in Somalia that the crisis has escalated to such severe proportions. As the eminent economist and Nobel laureate Amartya Sen has shown, famines are man-made. From 1991, there has been no government in Somalia. The war has destroyed people's livelihoods. The U.N.-backed Transitional Federal Government controls only parts of the capital Mogadishu. Southern Somalia is controlled by al-Shabaab, an al-Qaeda affiliate that contributed to the crisis by driving out international aid agencies two years ago on the suspicion they were western spies. Only in recent weeks has the group permitted these organisations back; some days ago, it also withdrew from parts of Mogadishu it controlled, leaving the capital fully to the TFG. This has allowed the U.N. to begin delivering some aid, but the security situation is still precarious and concerns are high that al-Shabaab might siphon off aid. The U.N. has called on the international community to contribute $300 million by mid-September to facilitate emergency assistance. It wants to raise $2 billion over the long term to pull the country out of the humanitarian disaster.
It is disquieting that New Delhi, which declared a comprehensive engagement with Africa just two months ago at the second India-Africa summit, has not yet responded to the unfolding crisis in Somalia. The silence surprises all the more considering that earlier this year the government appointed an envoy to the country, 20 years after the Indian Embassy closed down. At the May 2011 summit, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh promised $2 million to the African Union Mission for Somalia, which is helping the TGF to maintain control in Mogadishu. But making a significant contribution to the humanitarian effort is a more urgent, life-saving priority. It is time that economically rising India came off the benches on this one.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/somalias-misery/article2344066.ece
10,8,2011,Dangerous nonsense,"There is “no strong evidence” to conclude that cutting down the amount of salt consumed every day reduces the likelihood of normal people or those with hypertension dying or experiencing cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This is the finding of a Cochrane Review published recently in the American Journal of Hypertension (AJH). The study was based on a meta-analysis of seven randomised controlled trials involving 6,250 participants who were followed up for at least six months. The meta-analysis covered people with normal blood pressure, hypertension, and those with heart failure. The finding, which comes in a line of dubious studies published in reputed medical journals, flies in the face of an overwhelming body of evidence showing a clear link between reduced salt intake and health benefits. Unsurprisingly, the results attracted wide publicity in the electronic and print media. But a comment published in The Lancet (“Salt reduction lowers cardiovascular risk: meta-analysis of outcome trials,” by Feng J He and Graham A MacGregor) exposes the limitations of the Cochrane Review study and tries to undo the damage. It shows that the paper by Rod Taylor of the University of Exeter and others in the AJH is scientifically flawed on major counts. The data of normal and hypertensive patients that enabled Taylor to arrive at the conclusion were not statistically powered; in fact, a re-analysis of the combined data by He and MacGregor revealed that there was a significant 20 per cent reduction in cardiovascular events when the daily salt intake was reduced by 2.0-2.3 grams. Another major flaw was the inclusion of the trial involving heart failure patients without undertaking the necessary adjustments.
It is well known that increased salt intake poses a major challenge to the kidneys' ability to flush out the sodium. Greater salt intake leads to increased water retention in the body, which is one of the major factors in the development of hypertension. The evidence of a salt-BP link comes from a variety of sources — animal studies, human genetic, epidemiological, migration, population-based intervention, and treatment studies. According to a 2008 paper in the Journal of Human Hypertension, elevated blood pressure alone is responsible for 62 per cent of strokes and 49 per cent of coronary heart disease worldwide. Denial in the face of all this evidence is dangerous. All efforts should be aimed at following the World Health Organisation's recommendation that people should cut down the daily salt intake to 5 grams, eat more fruits and vegetables, and exercise regularly.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dangerous-nonsense/article2344064.ece
11,8,2011,Tarred again,"Mumbai must feel a sense of deja vu as the tar balls hit its beaches again. A year ago in August, the coastline and its fragile mangrove-rich ecology were affected by an oil spill resulting from a ship collision. Not much seems to have changed, as the city weakly tackles a fresh pollution crisis created by oil that is apparently leaking from the sunken ship m.v. Rak. What emerges from the handling of the incident is the lack of progress in providing an emergency response. Union Environment Minister Jayanthi Natarajan has prioritised containment of the spill, which is the logical thing to do — but what is as important is to follow this up with the Ministry of Defence and State governments and frame a more effective protocol to handle such events. The designated agency under the National Oil Spill Disaster Contingency Plan (NOS-DCP) is the Coast Guard. The CG has been incrementally augmenting its capacity and hardware to handle marine spill contingencies. Unfortunately, this approach is not up to the challenge at a time when regional shipping, including oil tanker traffic, is rising sharply. Moreover, there is the problem of asymmetrical capacities of the Coast Guard and the ports, State Pollution Control Boards and oil industries. In a spill, each of these agencies has distinct responsibilities and a defined area of operation, but not all possess the infrastructure or training to respond.
Under the international contingency planning system, the response to spills is tiered and requires a minimum capability to handle an incident involving less than 700 tonnes of oil. Higher tier standards prescribe capabilities for 10,000 tonnes and more. This is the metric India's ports need to meet quickly. Given the long coastline to be covered, the central government has its task cut out. The priority should be to ensure that all national ports are capable of responding to a crisis with the necessary infrastructure and manpower. State Pollution Boards, which remain poorly staffed and under-funded, must be strengthened and made accountable for their most important function during an oil spill — minimising the impact in inter-tidal zones, beaches, and up to a depth that the CG cannot enter. There is also the question of realising the cost of a clean-up, and the losses suffered. The central government needs to sign up to sound protocols on compensation and civil liability. The Convention on Hazardous and Noxious Substances drafted one last year; when this enters into force, it will enable the payment of major compensation based on the gross tonnage of the ship. India needs to do much better in protecting itself from environmental and economic losses arising from oil spills.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tarred-again/article2347733.ece
11,8,2011,Aiding Egypt's Salafists,"The advance of Egyptian Salafism highlights the country's deepening religious divisions and the dangers posed by powerful external influences. Several violent clashes have occurred in the last year-and-a-half. In one of the worst attacks, 12 people died when a church and other buildings used by Christians, who constitute 10 per cent of Egypt's 85 million population, were set ablaze in May. Christians are not the only targets; there have also been attacks on Sufi shrines. Salafism, a rigid version of Islam modelled solely on the lives led by the first three generations of Muslims, is metamorphosing into a potent form of political fundamentalism in Egypt. Salafist leaders disclaim responsibility for the violence but their increasing influence on the Egyptian public sphere was shown when they took over a “Day of Unity” demonstration in Cairo's Tahrir Square on July 29. The process, aided by lucrative Salafist TV stations, is causing alarm, particularly among the younger protesters who so inspiringly forced the dictator Hosni Mubarak out in February; it is also dividing the Muslim Brotherhood into moderate and extreme factions.
To regard the effects of Salafism purely as an internal matter is to overlook the international interests that exacerbate them. To start with, there has been no significant change in the United States' policy attitude to Egypt, which has received civil assistance totalling $50 billion from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) over the last 40 years, and continues to receive $1.3 billion every year in military aid. Secondly, the military government in Cairo ensures that NGOs which promote democracy are excluded from U.S. civilian aid. Successive administrations in Washington have rejected tying military aid to human rights improvements in Egypt. In effect, U.S. arms manufacturers gain, Egypt rocks no Israeli boats, and the junta is relatively free to intensify its authoritarian tendencies. This means less transparency and more opportunity for corruption and abuse of power — the very factors that rejuvenated the Muslim Brotherhood as a then hard-line form of resistance to Mr. Mubarak in the 1990s. This time the main beneficiaries will be the Salafists. A further complication is the attitude of Saudi Arabia, which denies providing funds but may well regard Egyptian Salafism as a counterweight to any Iranian Shia influence in the region. There could be few better examples of international double standards over West Asia and North Africa; the greatest losers will be those brave Egyptians who have made a principled stand for nothing less than representative democracy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/aiding-egypts-salafists/article2347732.ece
12,8,2011,Lift the ban,"The suspension of screening of the Hindi film Aarakshan, which deals with issues of caste and reservation, by the governments of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Andhra Pradesh is a serious encroachment on the freedom of expression in the guise of upholding public order and respecting the sentiments of a social group or community. The director, Prakash Jha, has done well to challenge the ban before the Supreme Court of India, which will hear the case on Tuesday. Independent of the merits of the film, such a ban is out of place in a democratic society. It militates against the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. Although clause (2) of the Article allows for reasonable restrictions on the freedom, including in the interest of public order, the Supreme Court has clearly laid down, in the 1989 judgment in the case of S. Rangarajan v. Jagjivan Ram involving the film Ore Oru Gramathile (which too dealt with the issue of reservation), that “freedom of expression cannot be suppressed on account of threat of demonstration and processions or threats of violence.” That, the court noted, would be tantamount to “negation of the rule of law and a surrender to blackmail and intimidation.” The competent authority for clearing a film for public release is the Central Board of Film Certification, and politicians and communal or sectarian pressure groups cannot arrogate to themselves the right to decide what films others should watch. Taking the easy or opportunist way out by banning a movie is anathema to any functioning democracy.
While it is in the nature of art to shock or provoke, in the case of Aarakshan the portions objected to do not even constitute the thrust of the movie. To tear out of the dramatic context snatches of dialogue and demand their removal from the film is to take intolerance to new heights. The issue is not whether an articulated argument is valid or not. As the Supreme Court noted in the watershed 1989 judgment, “The producer may project his own message which the others may not approve of. But he has a right to ‘think out' and put the counter-appeals to reason. It is a part of a democratic give-and-take to which no one could complain. The State cannot prevent open discussion and open expression, however hateful to its policies.” The real danger to the public interest springs not from the public screening of the movie, but from state-imposed restrictions on freedom of expression on indefensible grounds. Aarakshan must be allowed a free run as cleared by the CBFC without any cuts — in the interest of keeping India a free and open society. To give in to sectional interests in this case would be to put in jeopardy a cornerstone of the Indian Constitution.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lift-the-ban/article2351412.ece
12,8,2011,Archaeopteryx dethroned,"The discovery of Archaeopteryx, the most primitive bird fossil, in 1861, just two years after the publication of Charles Darwin's great work, On the Origin of Species, could not have been better timed. Exhibiting both dinosaur features and typical bird-like ones such as feathers, wishbone, and three-fingered hands, the 150 million-year-old transitional fossil became the first textbook specimen with the fundamental traits of evolution in progress. The discovery, which played a vital role in our understanding of bird origin, provided the much-needed boost to palaeontologists for unearthing other vital links in the dinosaur-bird evolution chain, and other transitional forms. But even as scientists are celebrating the sesquicentennial anniversary of its discovery, the iconic specimen has been robbed of glory by a paper published recently in Nature (“An Archaeopteryx-like theropod from China and the origin of Avialae,” by Xing Xu et al.). The Xiaotingia zhengi species reported in the paper, which has morphological features similar to Archaeopteryx and other confirmed deinonychosaurs — bird-like dinosaurs that are outside the avian lineage — has dethroned the iconic fossil from its high pedestal and clubbed it along with other non-avian dinosaurs. Indeed, the discovery of a few non-avian dinosaur fossils during the last decade served as a harbinger of things to come. These fossils, exhibiting the same avian morphological features seen in Archaeopteryx, raised serious doubts about the basal fossil's very presence in the evolutionary tree of birds. Clinching evidence from the latest find has only confirmed these doubts.
While the dethroning will be hotly debated in scientific circles, the real battle will be fought between creationism and evolution. Creationists, who still claim there are no true transitional forms, are sure to exploit the latest development to propagate their unscientific and obscurantist views. The presence or absence of transitional fossils that show the intermediate stages of evolution from the ancestral form to its descendants has been a bone of contention between the two camps. It is true that all the intermediate varieties have not been preserved in the rocks. Still, scientists have found an abundance of important transitional evidence. The latest is the 2004 discovery of Tiktaalik — the transitional fossil between aquatic and land animals. These finds disarm the creationists from using, in Darwin's own words, “the most obvious and gravest objection” to rubbish his theory. To think that the theory of evolution is on shaky ground due to the removal of Archaeopteryx as a basal bird is nothing but absurdity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/archaeopteryx-dethroned/article2351410.ece
15,8,2011,England deserves to rule,"England's ascent to the top of Test cricket is richly deserved: nowhere is the game's grandest format treated with such reverence — Australia and South Africa come close — and nowhere do the cricketers commit so much of themselves to it. It's ironic that Duncan Fletcher, the man currently in charge of the deposed No.1, was the prime mover in England's progress. The last time an English side could justly claim to be the best in the world was in the early 1970s. But barring occasional displays of brilliance, England had been a middling team ever since. Fletcher, first with Nasser Hussain and then with Michael Vaughan, began the process of adding steel and skill to English cricket. The process was continued and improved upon by Andrew Strauss and Andy Flower, a pair of quiet over-achievers. England's greatest accomplishment has been the gathering of a group of diversely skilled bowlers; any team aiming to be No.1 needs bowling ammunition. They aren't treated as well as batsmen, but bowlers are the most important part of cricket: their health directly affects the health of the game, for batting evolves in reaction. England's recent success in winning and regaining the Ashes, and building a strong record at home, has been driven by the bowlers. In James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Chris Tremlett, Tim Bresnan, and Graeme Swann, Strauss has real quality to call upon.
England's batsmen have also done their job: not only does the team have a reliable, almost old-fashioned top three in Strauss, Alastair Cook, and Jonathan Trott, it also has men all the way down to number nine who can score swiftly and swing the momentum. The batting unit is perfectly designed to set a platform and make capital of it; the depth and balance of the line-up allow the likes of Kevin Pietersen and Ian Bell to play as naturally as they please. Although they haven't caught particularly well in the current series against India, the Englishmen usually set high standards in the field. Matt Prior's batting might have helped win a lot of matches, but his improvement behind the stumps has been vital in setting the tone for the fielding. Most important of all is the sense of togetherness that has been in evidence: past England teams have pulled in different directions, but members of the current squad are directed towards a common goal: they seem to enjoy their time together. India did well to stay at the top for as long (nearly two years) as it did. Despite the latest debacle, it must be recognised that this Indian Test team has achieved fine things and busted several stereotypes in doing so. But now is the moment of truth: will India prioritise Test cricket, as England so clearly has done, or will it have to continue to find a way of succeeding despite the system?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/england-deserves-to-rule/article2357000.ece
15,8,2011,The dollar and its special position,"It might be early days yet, but there are indications that the ratings downgrade of the United States sovereign debt has done nothing to erase the dollar's special position as the numeraire of international transactions, the currency of choice in international trade, the currency most favoured by governments for keeping their reserves, and the instinctive home for money in troubled times. However, the downgrade might be the most forceful reminder ever that the dollar's special status might be lost at some point in time. That view is based on a better understanding of what the lowered rating signifies as well as on the stock market behaviour in the days following the downgrade. A reflection of the weakened fiscal stature of the world's largest economy, the downgrade is attributed to “the political discourse that has diminished the credit standing of the U.S.” The long-term outlook for the U.S. remains negative: further downgrade has not been ruled out if the fiscal position does not improve.
Those are strong words under any circumstances, enough to sink the financial markets. However, even as the stock markets across the world turned extremely volatile, skittish investors sought the sanctuary of U.S. government treasury instruments. Ironically, treasuries are still considered a haven although the U.S. government itself is seen to have precipitated — or is at the centre? — of a crisis. The day after the S&P downgrade, the 10-year yield, instead of rising, fell by 25 basis points and hit an all-time low last Tuesday. Various studies have shown that in times of great global uncertainty the demand for U.S. government paper goes up. That has enabled the U.S. to lower its cost of debt. Governments around the world continue to keep a large part of their reserves in dollars. According to the IMF, the dollar's share of global reserves was as high as 60 per cent as on March 31, followed by the euro (26.6 per cent). The dollar is therefore unlikely to lose its safe-haven status any time soon. Nor will its share of global reserves come down dramatically. The argument that there are no viable alternatives to the dollar is valid but the status of ‘reserve currency' is won on its strength, and not on its being the best among poor choices. The rating downgrade has, of course, jolted treasury managers round the world out of their smugness and forced them to consider looking apart from the dollar. By risking a default, the U.S. political establishment has all but compromised the dollar's once-unassailable position.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-dollar-and-its-special-position/article2356999.ece
16,8,2011,A brother out of control,"Two years after defeating the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and eliminating it as a military entity, Sri Lanka is still struggling to emerge from the woods on some important fronts. Two issues are predominant. One is the nature of the peace, and the efforts by the Sri Lankan government towards a political reconciliation between the Sinhalese majority and the Tamil minority. The military victory over the LTTE, and President Mahinda Rajapaksa's strength in parliament, gave the government an unprecedented opportunity to put in place a progressive political framework to heal the wounds of a 30-year war, and address Tamil grievances that predate the war. That it has taken only nominal steps in this direction is a matter of concern even to friends of Sri Lanka, such as India, which stood by its military efforts against the LTTE. The second issue, which has found strong voice in a recent documentary by a British television station, Channel 4, and in a United Nations report, has to do with the nature of the military operations in the final stages of the war in 2009. Both make allegations of war crimes against the Sri Lankan Army, accusing it of knowingly aiming fire at civilians such that thousands lost their lives, of killing captives in cold blood, and of possible sexual assault. It is shocking that instead of addressing these issues in the right spirit, a high-ranking official of the Sri Lankan government, Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, a brother of the Sri Lankan President, has chosen to vitiate the atmosphere even more with his intemperate remarks against Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, and by attributing motives to the adoption of resolutions on Sri Lanka by the State Assembly.
Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa's comments, made in the course of an interview to Headlines Today television, reveal a troubling contempt for the Tamil minority. He has trashed “the political solution talk,” asserting, among other things, that it was “simply irrelevant” because “we have ended this terrorism in Sri Lanka,” making the egregious assertion that when the 13th Amendment was being drafted, “the government of Sri Lanka was not involved,” and proposing that with the LTTE “gone,” there was no further need to amend the Constitution. President Rajapaksa would be well advised to distance himself swiftly from his brother's stream-of-consciousness on sensitive issues that are not his business. This includes an outrageous comment that because a Tamil woman, an “LTTE cadre” who was a British national, interviewed in the Channel 4 documentary was “so attractive” but had been neither raped nor killed by Sri Lankan soldiers, the allegation of sexual assault by soldiers could not be true. For this statement alone, Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa must be taken to task.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-brother-out-of-control/article2359597.ece
16,8,2011,Quantity versus quality,"To observers of the technological education scene in Tamil Nadu, it will come as no surprise that as many as 45,062 engineering seats out of the 149,000 put up for admission through the single-window system remain vacant at the end of the counselling process. This is consistent with the pattern of recent years, not only in this State but in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra as well. Tamil Nadu has reported a marginal fall in the number of admissions — down from 112,000 last year to 104,000 in 2011 — even though the number of seats on offer has gone up by nearly 30,000. Behind these numbers lies a story of thoughtless quantitative expansion, lack of elementary attention to quality, an acute shortage of competent faculty, and parental anxiety to strike a deal with private college managements even before the single-window admissions begin. There are a handful of first-rate or very good private engineering colleges in Tamil Nadu, which is possibly ahead of other States in this respect. But the problem is that technological education is mostly seen as a lucrative business, with little attention paid to academic values, ideals, and good practices. Mindless of ground realities, the All India Council for Technical Education has been approving at least 50 colleges every year in the State, where the number has crossed 520, next only to Andhra Pradesh. Some years ago, the State government appealed to the AICTE to stop sanctioning new colleges, but the Council's contention was that it had no choice but to approve any proposal that fulfilled its norms.
A key reason for the high vacancy level is that students seek out institutions that have sound potential for placement. They also tend to factor in the college's academic performance, the quality of the faculty, the infrastructure on offer, and perhaps also locational attractiveness. If the problem of vacancies is to be addressed, colleges must be encouraged and indeed required to invest more in training, research, and development so that the capabilities of their students are significantly upgraded. There are positive indications that the Tamil Nadu government is thinking on these lines, but there are other issues — such as the insistence on nativity certificates for students who have passed out of school in other States, which means good students from traditional feeder States such as Bihar, Jharkhand, and Assam can be admitted only to expensive management seats — to be sorted out. There has been enough quantitative expansion for now; the strategic need is to work systematically to raise the bar.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/quantity-versus-quality/article2359598.ece
17,8,2011,"Corrupt, repressive and stupid","A corrupt government devoid of moral authority is ill equipped to deal rationally with legitimate public anger. By ordering the illegitimate detention of Anna Hazare before he began his fast in support of stronger anti-corruption provisions in the Lokpal Bill and the arrest of a large number of peaceful protesters in the national capital, the United Progressive Alliance government revealed its ugly, repressive face. No representative government in a democracy can deny citizens their fundamental right to dissent and peaceful protest. Insisting on unreasonable, inequitable, and suspiciously contrived conditions that everyone knows the protesters cannot accept is tantamount to denial of the democratic right. Instead of honestly dealing with the issues raised by successive corruption scandals, the UPA government chose to cover up. When that became unsustainable, it resorted to slurs and dirty tricks, and incrementally raised the level of repression to smother voices demanding accountability and corrective institutional measures. It is no wonder that from time to time such a government gets into panic mode, miscalculates, and commits acts that everyone outside the regime recognises as politically stupid.
Despite several opportunities to reach a consensus with Team Anna and other sections of civil society for the framing of an effective Lokpal Bill, the Manmohan Singh government attempted to push through a farce of a Bill. That it misread the national public mood was obvious. Anna Hazare might have given the cause a face, but the anti-corruption movement that is now in a rapid phase of expansion across India does not depend on one man or his team. The real force that is shaking the UPA government — which is widely perceived as the most corrupt in the history of independent India — is made up of hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens who are fed up with a system they believe is opaque, corrupt, and driven by greed. In the words of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, former President of India who has scrupulously kept himself above partisan politics, the recent events and findings have highlighted “the single biggest hindrance to India's growth — that is the corruption and degrading moral turpitude which is engulfing the nation like cancer.” What after all has made Team Anna the force it has become? It is the feeling among ordinary people across the land — a feeling strengthened by intense media coverage — that here is a rare opportunity to put in place a potent mechanism to end high-level corruption. If the UPA does not recognise the public anger against corruption, respect the ideals and values of democracy, and take steps to create a Lokpal that inspires confidence, there will be a political price to pay — perhaps well before the next general election.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/corrupt-repressive-and-stupid/article2362951.ece
17,8,2011,Last chance for Air India,"The appointment of Rohit Nandan as chairman and managing director of Air India marks the beginning of yet another attempt by the Government of India to restructure the public sector airline and effect a turnaround. Several attempts made in the past failed miserably, plunging the airline into a deeper financial mess. Air India reached a stage when it could pay neither its employees nor its fuel suppliers. The government has approved a plan to inject fresh capital and a tranche has already been paid. More is to follow this fiscal. But that seems a pittance for a national carrier groaning under a cumulative loss of Rs.22,165 crore plus a debt of Rs.22,000 crore. Air India, which had placed orders for 111 new aircraft, could take delivery of only a few. Since the complaints against its boss Arvind Jadhav were piling up and he antagonised all sections of employees, his continuance in office became untenable. Though the head-hunting committee looked beyond the administrative service for a new head, there were few qualified takers for this crown of thorns and the choice eventually fell on another officer from the Union Civil Aviation Ministry.
The government needs to finalise two plans for Air India — a turnaround plan and a financial restructuring formula. Air India has no choice but to go for the rationalisation of loss-making routes, the rescheduling of aircraft purchases, the return of leased aircraft that are underutilised, the rationalisation of human resources at various levels, and a possible reduction in contractual employment. This will naturally call for across-the-board consultation and consensus building. All sections of employees and their trade unions need to be taken into confidence if these plans are to be implemented smoothly. In a situation where government policy has favoured private airlines for whatever reason, the national carrier desperately needs a level playing field. If the idea is to persuade employees to accept some cuts in existing benefits or concessions, this cannot be a one-sided process. The approach to achieving operational profits for the airline must be balanced, equitable, and just. Ministers and officials must be asked to fly only Air India as a rule and the airline must be paid promptly by governments for VVIP movements and such special uses. Above all, the realisation must dawn on all stake-holders that this looks very much like the last chance to keep the erstwhile Maharaja in the skies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/last-chance-for-air-india/article2362949.ece
18,8,2011,No to death penalty,"Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights puts it simply: “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” The death penalty is the ultimate cruel punishment. Abolitionists tend to advance two main reasons why it must go: it does not deter crime; and, as justice systems around the world are flawed, there is more than a possibility that someone will be punished wrongly, and irrevocably. These are sound arguments, backed by statistics. But there is no more important strike against capital punishment than the sheer barbarity of taking another person's life even under sanction of law. There is no humane method of execution either. Death by hanging, lethal injection, electrocution, beheading, shooting are equally repugnant in their intent to take life, and in the violence they inflict on the condemned person. Proponents of the death penalty argue that this is the only way to compensate, or provide justice to, those affected by heinous crimes such as murder or terrorism. But an ‘eye for an eye' has no place in a modern, progressive criminal justice system. Internationally, there is an increasing trend towards abolition, with 96 countries doing away with it and 34 countries being abolitionist in practice by observing official or unofficial moratoria on executions. Each of the three United Nations resolutions calling for a moratorium has seen more countries backing it. On the other hand, China, the United States, Iran and other West Asian countries, and countries in South-East Asia buck the trend by frequently using the death penalty.
In India, there has been no execution since 2004 but that is poor consolation considering the swelling number of those who face the threat of execution. Indian courts handed down105 death sentences last year, according to Amnesty International. Earlier this week, President Pratibha Patil dismissed the clemency pleas of Murugan, Santhan, and Perarivalan, on death row for the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. The Home Ministry has advised President Patil to dismiss the plea of Afzal Guru, sentenced to death in the 2001 Parliament attack case. Without going into the possible motives for forefronting these mercy petitions at this politically difficult time for the United Progressive Alliance government, it must be recognised that both were monstrous crimes that deserved the harshest civilised punishment — an actual lifetime in prison rather than the seven to 14-year apology of a life sentence. It has been The Hindu's consistent stand for decades that India must make a clean break with a savage tradition by abolishing capital punishment. An immediate moratorium on executions should be the first step.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/No-to-death-penalty/article12057841.ece
18,8,2011,Advantage Miliband,"The recent riots in London and other major British cities have shaken the United Kingdom by revealing a streak of consumerist greed in the national culture. The reactions of leading politicians, however, reveal very different capacities for discernment and action. While Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband have been equally firm in condemning the rioting, which has claimed five lives, and both have approved of tough sentences for those convicted, Mr. Cameron sees the rioters as criminals and nothing else. He calls for punitive responses — through the courts and through tougher discipline in schools — and has legislated for parents and other bodies to set up their own schools with public funds. The Tory leader also plans to cut back the state benefits system, which he regards as a disincentive to work. Mr. Cameron's position, however, is full of contradictions. Ideologically, he has to hold the rioters responsible for their own conduct. But his talk of tax breaks for married couples implicitly accepts social factors like family breakdown as one reason for a general loss of public mores. Furthermore, his free-market ideology cannot allow him to accept that the dominant mores today are those of material acquisition. Mr. Cameron is also wrong on some key facts; as a percentage of GDP, total welfare spending is not very different from what it was in 1997, when Labour swept to power. In effect, the Prime Minister has offered nothing new. All he has done is to restate the commitments and policies his government has already proposed and started to implement, including highly controversial police cuts.
In heartening contrast, Mr. Miliband has been out and about, on the same north London streets along which, as a boy, he walked to his state-funded school. He has been freely approached by ordinary people, and has heard a wide range of responses to the riots. He makes it clear that he does not condone the behaviour of the looters but that he seeks reasons and explanations with a view to improving policy; he adds that ordinary people are telling him to keep doing that. What is more, he insists on a public inquiry into the disturbances. He has repeatedly made the point that the culture of immoral selfishness and greed is exemplified as much by the financial establishment as by looters on the streets. Where the Prime Minister is addressing only diehard Tories, the Leader of the Opposition is talking to the whole country. The good news for Labour is that after a tentative start, Mr. Miliband seems to have discovered a progressive way to take it to a pre-eminent position in contemporary Britain.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/advantage-miliband/article2366484.ece
19,8,2011,A revolution at 20,"A British physicist's frustration with varied data formats and computers coming to the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) laboratory in Switzerland from different countries in 1989 launched a revolution that today's generation takes for granted. Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1990 and published the first website on August 6, 1991 with the address >http://info.cern.ch, giving shape to a single information network. A common hypertext language, interconnectivity, and the sea of data it has created in two decades are testimony to its profound impact. With nothing more than access to the Internet and a web browser, users effortlessly navigate the online world using hyperlinks. Thanks to the standardised web, they do this without having to master the more complicated Internet technologies in use a generation ago. In many countries, the www has unarguably democratised information. What is even more significant is that today it enables every individual to become a creator of content, and to publish it. The user ‘pulls' materials of choice from websites in contrast to the passive consumer of yesterday, who received content ‘pushed' by television. Sir Tim's invention swept the planet because of his laudable decision not to patent it.
As the public web enters its next decade, its immense potential for good stands out. Going forward, though, it should place in the public domain the thousands of terabytes of data held by governments and institutions. This will help researchers, scientists, economists and other social scientists, to come up with better solutions to problems. Such data have already been paid for by citizens, and by adopting an open, linked approach to their dissemination, low-cost answers to issues can be found. No one has reinforced this thought more vocally than the inventor himself. Tim Berners-Lee forcefully advocates the publication of vast amounts of data that can be both open and linked, to aid decision-making. These can, for instance, pertain to government, enterprise, science, meteorology, and events. Moreover, this is an activity to which the ordinary citizen can contribute his or her bit. The only factor that stands in the way of this transformation is the secretive attitude of established power structures, including opaque government. Let us also recall the advice given by Berners-Lee against doing away with net-neutrality, the system under which all data on the Internet, including web traffic, are treated equally. Privileging one set of high-paying users by giving priority to their data can only create disparities. The power of good is intrinsic to the free web, now an energetic 20, and to the Internet in general.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-revolution-at-20/article2370351.ece
19,8,2011,Investment sans equity,"The focus of UNCTAD's World Investment Report 2011 is on a fast growing but less understood facet of international production and commerce. The term ‘cross-border non-equity modes' (NEMs) appears to be an inelegant description of the fairly common activities of transnational corporations (TNCs), such as contract manufacturing, services outsourcing, contract farming, franchising, licensing, and contractual management. However, it does effectively signify the one common element in them: the absence of an equity investment while contracting out manufacturing or licensing patents and processes to a firm located in the host country. International production is not exclusively about foreign direct investment (FDI) and trade. Investments that fund mergers and acquisitions and greenfield investments involve capital flows across borders. Hence it is customary to classify them as ‘cross-border FDI'. On the other hand, the NEMs are a mechanism that allows transnational corporations to coordinate activities in their global value chains and influence the management of host country firms without acquiring equity stakes in those firms.
The NEMs, which generated at least $2 trillion in sales globally in 2010, have acquired a significant presence particularly in many developing countries, including India, where governments have tended to put a cap on FDI in many sectors. Under the NEM arrangement, a TNC gains access to the productive capacity of a local partner without putting money into it. In some industries, major NEM firms, including those from developing countries, have become multinationals in their own right. Notable examples from India are software companies that have carved a niche for themselves in the technology outsourcing space. In the process of servicing their clients, they have expanded and established themselves in many countries. Development benefits flowing from NEMs are significant. In many countries, for example, their value addition is as high as 15 per cent of GDP. They employ 18-21 million workers worldwide, a chunk of them in developing countries, aside from boosting entrepreneurial skills and exports. On the negative side, the working conditions are known to be poor at least in some of the NEMs in developing countries. In the West, consumer groups have exposed the seamy side of some contract manufacturing units that have sacrificed safety and environmental standards for short-term profits. It is imperative for the developing countries to beware of the risk of getting tied up with low-value activities and adopt policies aimed at maximising benefits from the integration of domestic firms into global value chains.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/investment-sans-equity/article2370350.ece
20,8,2011,Anna is not India nor India Anna,"With the anti-corruption movement spearheaded by Anna Hazare winning the first round hands down and the United Progressive Alliance government capitulating to its demand that the Gandhian must be allowed to lead an indefinite fast without any restrictions worth speaking about, the focus shifts to what the agitation can expect to achieve in terms of an effective Lokpal Bill. The conditions seem propitious considering that the unintended consequence of a scam-tainted government's initial reaction — which bore the stamp of Pavlovian conditioning — has been the strengthening of the anti-corruption mood in the country. What the agitation symbolised by Mr. Hazare has succeeded in doing is to totally discredit the content of, and the motivation behind, the Lokpal Bill the UPA government has introduced in Parliament — which Prashant Bhushan, a key member of Team Anna, has taken to calling the ‘Promotion of Corruption Bill.' The wise course for the government is to withdraw the Bill immediately, without standing on false prestige. Not to do so would only strengthen the popular perception, reflected in a number of public opinion surveys, that it is bent on perpetuating and covering up corruption.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's exposition of a “constitutional philosophy” in his August 17 statement in the Lok Sabha misses the mark by a mile. Even a cursory look at the history and sociology of how major laws are shaped in India and other parliamentary democracies shows that quite often they are the end product of movements and struggles of various kinds and that the proposition that it is “the sole prerogative of Parliament to make a law” is true only in the most literal, superficial, banal sense. Moreover, in the Indian constitutional scheme (in contrast to the British), Parliament is not supreme; it is the Constitution that is supreme. That said, it does not in the least follow that settling the terms of the anti-corruption institutional mechanism can be left solely to Team Anna or that its Jan Lokpal Bill, which has some impractical and unsound provisions, must be accepted in toto. In quite un-Gandhian fashion, a mood of triumphalism has taken over the current occupants of Ramlila Maidan. Mr. Hazare has stated that he would not budge from the venue until the Jan Lokpal Bill was introduced in Parliament; and Kiran Bedi, a widely admired member of Team Anna, was so carried away by the mood that she proclaimed, perhaps momentarily forgetting the slogan's authoritarian era associations, that “Anna is India and India is Anna.” Democratic, progressive, political India needs to find its own way. It must use this favourable moment to push forward and shape a law that centre-stages the principle of independent, effective, and quick-acting investigation and prosecution of corruption, especially in high places.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/anna-is-not-india-nor-india-anna/article2373667.ece
20,8,2011,All credit to Nawaz Sharif,"The recent remarks by Nawaz Sharif, the leader of Pakistan's main opposition party, show that there are politicians in that country prepared to stand up against the populist view of India as dushman humsaya or the “enemy neighbour.” It would have been the easier political course for Mr. Sharif, who heads the Pakistan Muslim League(N), to fall in line with this idée fixe, born out of decades-long anti-India propaganda by the Pakistani state. He could have used it to score political points against the Pakistan People's Party government. To his great credit, the former Prime Minister has emerged as a voice of sanity and reason on Pakistan's relations with India. At a seminar organised by the South Asian Free Media Association in Lahore on the occasion of Pakistan's Independence Day, he urged his compatriots to conceptualise an economic rather than a military rivalry with India. He spoke of a motorway that would connect the subcontinent from Kolkata to Peshawar and from there to Central Asia. He also said it was time that Pakistan stopped blaming India for all its problems.
This is not the first time Mr. Sharif has taken such positions. He blames his military nemesis, Pervez Musharraf, for destroying his efforts to make peace with India in 1999 with the Kargil misadventure. Since his 2007 return from exile in Saudi Arabia, he has been a consistent advocate of building good relations with India. He has talked of “visa-free” travel between the two countries and the importance of building trade relations. He was the first to acknowledge that the Mumbai 2008 terrorist attackers were Pakistanis. Days after the May 2 Osama bin Laden raid by the U.S. military, he said, in defiance of the popular mood, that it was wrong to view India as the “number 1 enemy”. Mr. Sharif deserves full praise for taking a rational view of India-Pakistan relations without fear of the attendant political risks. For India, the position espoused by Mr. Sharif is reassurance that bipartisan support exists for the steps, however small, that Islamabad has taken and might want to take towards normalising relations with New Delhi in the post-2008 climate. Unfortunately, the UPA government, beset by other troubles, has been at best defensive about its efforts to restart a dialogue with Pakistan. The opposition BJP has been of no help. It has chosen to fall back on a populist hardline position on India-Pakistan ties instead of leading from the front to create political space towards normalisation. It has something to learn from Mr. Sharif.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/all-credit-to-nawaz-sharif/article2373668.ece
21,8,2011,Another blow for freedom,"In coming down heavily on the Uttar Pradesh government order suspending the screening of the Hindi film Aarakshan, which deals with issues of caste and reservation, the Supreme Court of India has struck another blow for freedom of expression and against the tendency of the state to resort to censorship at the first sign of political protest. Importantly, the court held that the government had no power to suspend screening of a film that had been cleared by the Central Board of Film Certification. The CBFC, or censor board, is an empowered regulatory body constituted to view, rate, and censor objectionable portions of a film prior to its release. To seek to ban or suspend the screening of a film certified by the censor board under the procedure established by law (in this case, the Cinematograph Act 1952) goes against the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by the Constitution — and is a threat to democratic dissent and artistic creativity. Hearteningly, the court found no merit in the contention that screening the film would cause a breach of peace and law and order. Besides pointing to the fact that the film had been released without difficulty in other parts of the country, the judges referred to the landmark Supreme Court judgment in the 1989 Ore oru gramathile case and ruled that it was for the state to maintain law and order and that “it shall maintain law and order effectively and meaningfully.” No democratic society can allow unreasonable restrictions on the freedom of expression under cover of maintaining public order.
As for the merits of the contention that a high-level committee appointed by the Uttar Pradesh government had recommended suspension of the film on the ground that it dealt with the sensitive issue of reservation, the Supreme Court was categorical that public discussion on such social issues was necessary in a vibrant democracy, and that informed decisions could be taken on the basis of such discussion and dissent. On the other hand, shutting out discussion on sensitive social issues, far from aiding public order, would have the effect of deepening social divides and breeding public unrest. Political stability and public order, it is clear, cannot be bought at the cost of freedom of expression and right to dissent. Successive Supreme Court rulings on the issue, which draw force from Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, should deter governments from going down this road again under pressure from organised groups or special interests or for any other reason. The Hindu hopes that Aarakshan will be the last film to face a ban in India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/another-blow-for-freedom/article2379702.ece
21,8,2011,Egypt makes Israel think,"Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak's announcement of a joint Israeli-Egyptian inquiry into the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) helicopter attack, which killed five Egyptian policemen on August 18, marks Israel's belated and grudging recognition of new ground realities in the region. Mr. Barak's contemptuous initial comment was that the IDF's intended target — Gazans who had apparently crossed into Egypt's Sinai peninsula and then into Israel to carry out attacks near Eilat — had exposed Cairo's inability to control Sinai. The forceful Egyptian reaction, however, made Israel think and Mr. Barak has even expressed regret over the policemen's deaths. Egypt threatened to recall its Ambassador to Israel; it demanded an apology and compensation, and summoned the Israeli Ambassador to receive a formal protest. The Egyptian public, for its part, mounted angry demonstrations outside Israel's Cairo Embassy. And Amr Moussa, former head of the League of Arab States and an Egyptian presidential candidate, declared that Israel must realise that the day “our sons get killed without a strong and appropriate response is gone and will not come back.”
The issues go far beyond both Israel's need for Egyptian cooperation to ensure its own security and its dependence on natural gas from the trans-Sinai pipeline — which has been sabotaged several times. The key point is that the Zionist state, which makes much of being a democracy surrounded by dictatorships and despotic monarchies, is finding it very difficult to respond to the changes in Egypt. For nearly 33 years after it signed the Camp David agreement with Egypt, Israel could rely on the autocratic rule of Anwar Sadat and the even more brutal regime of Hosni Mubarak to enforce a one-sided arrangement whereby Egyptian governments avoided any mention of justice for the Palestinians, suppressed internal dissent as well as public support for the Palestinian cause, and restricted their troop deployments in the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt may currently have a military government rather than a full-fledged democracy, but the Tahrir Square protests that removed Mr. Mubarak from office have made the new rulers in Cairo much more responsive to public feeling about their relations with their neighbour. Secondly, the traditional inhabitants of Sinai, the Bedouins, are now demanding redress for what they consider to be decades of discriminatory treatment by the majority Egyptian culture. In the rapidly expanding Egyptian public space, such issues will be increasingly articulated. Going by the evidence, it is clear that the idea of democratic states for neighbours is something Israel cannot handle.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/egypt-makes-israel-think/article2379703.ece
22,8,2011,The way out,"As the public support for Anna Hazare's fast swells by the day, the United Progressive Alliance government's reaction is a bewildering mix of dithering, denial, moral confusion, and fear. On the face of it, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's statement that there was a “lot of scope for give-and-take,” and the opening of backroom channels to talk to Mr. Hazare, may suggest flexibility and conciliation. But if the back-of-the-mind calculation is ‘how long can this 74-year-old man hold out at Ramlila Maidan before he is hospitalised and put on a drip?' the government and the Congress party would be committing a grievous blunder. Withdrawing the Lokpal Bill – which is widely perceived to be a farce – has become an urgent political imperative. Unless this is done, the exercise of addressing the contentious issues will carry no credibility.
What are these contentious issues? According to Prashant Bhushan, a key member of Team Anna, in order of priority the first issue is selection and removal of the Lokpal – which should be a fully empowered statutory institution with administrative, financial, and functional independence from the government. The civil society objection to a selection committee in which the government nominates five of the nine members, and also has the power to suspend the Lokpal, is unanswerable. (The five members in the government's Lokpal Bill are the Prime Minister, the Speaker, a Union Cabinet Minister, an ‘eminent jurist,' and a person of ‘eminence in public life.') The key challenge in India is doing away with the notorious non-independence of the process of investigating and prosecuting the corrupt, especially those in high places. The Jan Lokpal Bill's provision for a two-stage process of a search committee and a selection committee dominated by independent former constitutional authorities, in which the only politicians would be the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, has a far better logic and appeal.
The second issue to be resolved is the proposed inclusion in the Jan Lokpal Bill of “provisions for Lokayuktas in the States to deal with public servants of the State.” This demand by Team Anna bristles with difficulties. The creation of Lokayuktas is currently understood to be in the jurisdiction of State legislatures and having it legislated by Parliament would seem to go against the principles of federalism and States' rights under the constitutional scheme.
The third issue to be resolved is the question of jurisdiction of the Lokpal. Team Anna's demand that in addition to Ministers, Members of Parliament (for acts committed outside Parliament), and Group ‘A' officers, the lower bureaucracy and, at the other end, the Prime Minister must be brought under the jurisdiction of the Lokpal has the virtue of consistency. The provision in the Jan Lokpal draft to transfer the anti-corruption wing of the Central Bureau of Investigation to the Lokpal is in tune with this logic. However, the demand for bringing corrupt acts of MPs in respect of their speeches or votes in Parliament under the Lokpal's jurisdiction comes up against Article 105 of the Constitution, which deals with the powers, privileges, and immunities of Members of Parliament. This constitutional question will need to be resolved one way or another but it is unlikely to be a deal breaker in a serious dialogue process based on give-and-take.
Fourthly, Team Anna's demand that a grievance redressal system – backed by a provision mandating every public authority to prepare a citizen's charter and fulfill its commitments to citizens within a specific time limit – should be created under the Lokpal may not relate strictly to the issue of corruption. But there can be little doubt that a grievance redressal system is a progressive idea whose time has come. Agreeing to provide for this in a separate law will be a good solution. The Jan Lokpal draft's provisions for transparency and accountability of the Lokpal, for the encouragement of whistle-blowing on corruption in any public authority and for “full protection” to whistle-blowers, and the safeguards against entertaining vexatious complaints, such as the requirement that permission to investigate or prosecute the Prime Minister, Ministers, and MPs must be obtained from a seven-member Bench of the Lokpal with strong legal credentials, are sound and ought to be welcomed.
There is no logic in insisting that a sitting Prime Minister must remain outside the Lokpal's ambit in a country where the Constitution provides equality to all and where no one enjoys immunity from the provisions of criminal law. On the other hand, bringing the judiciary, including judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court of India, under the jurisdiction of the Lokpal has not found much purchase with political India and, in any case, is likely to be struck down as unconstitutional by the courts. But this particular demand made by Team Anna may be tactical. It seems designed to pressure the government to agree to introduce legislation for setting up a credible, independent Judicial Conduct Commission, which is empowered not merely to look into the misconduct of judges but also to investigate allegations of corruption against them.
Whatever be one's attitude to the agitation symbolised by Mr. Hazare, it is quite remarkable that it has not seen a single untoward incident on the street. But a serious deterioration in his health could lead to the situation spinning out of control. It will certainly open a new stage in the mass mobilisation and struggle against corruption and the high-level cover-up of corruption. The UPA government must seize the moment, open and fast-track a dialogue with Team Anna, other civil society organisations, and, importantly, all political parties to settle legislation for a no-nonsense, independent, credible, and workable Lokpal to investigate and prosecute corruption by public servants at all levels.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-way-out/article2384853.ece
24,8,2011,Regime in olive branch mood,"A few photographs and a couple of sketchy statements are all that we have about a meeting between Myanmar's democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and President Thein Sein. State-run television said both parties put aside their differences and “discussed common interests and areas of potential cooperation for the benefit of the state and the people.” Ms Suu Kyi reportedly said she was “happy and satisfied” with the meeting. A day after the meeting, the Nobel laureate travelled to Naypitaw — the new capital the junta raised a few years ago in the middle of a jungle — to attend a government workshop on economic development, where she met Ministers and other ruling party luminaries. There are indications that the government, run by the nominally civilian proxies of the erstwhile junta, wants to be seen as offering an olive branch to its chief adversary. In turn, perhaps influenced by the great example of Nelson Mandela, Ms Suu Kyi has been conciliatory without compromising her cause. In one of her first statements, after release from nearly two decades of house arrest in November 2010, she expressed a desire to open a dialogue with the generals of Myanmar. The military greeted this first with stony silence and later warned her against involvement in political activity.
In recent weeks, the regime has shown signs of loosening up. Ms Suu Kyi has been able to make an unobstructed trip out of Yangon to the countryside, receiving a warm welcome from people. She also released “open letters,” asserting her views on two important political issues: the big dams being constructed on the Irrawaddy and the problems these are causing to the ethnic groups in those areas; and the need for the government to declare a ceasefire with armed ethnic rebels and reach out to them through dialogue. The government has responded by expressing its readiness to hold peace talks with the rebels. Most recently, the President told parliament that he was trying to “ease tensions” with opposition groups that had not accepted the 2008 Constitution — a clear reference to Ms Suu Kyi and her National League of Democracy. The regime may have calculated that reaching out to the democracy icon could help ease economic sanctions by western countries. For her part, Ms Suu Kyi may be considering the opportunities the situation presents to force concessions from the regime. Over 2,000 activists of the NLD remain under arrest, and the party itself was derecognised before this year's election. The people of India are with this brave woman in a cause for which she has sacrificed so much — a genuinely democratic Myanmar that can take its place in the comity of nations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/regime-in-olive-branch-mood/article2393473.ece
24,8,2011,Aiming high in the 12th Plan,"The Planning Commission, under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, has fixed an average growth target of 9 per cent for the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-17), the same as the one set for the 11th (2007-12). The identical growth targets for the two successive plans ought not to hide the fact that there have been changes in the macroeconomic environment in the meantime. It is not that that India's growth trajectory that looked very promising — at one point in time the Prime Minister was visualising a double digit growth rate — has suddenly nose-dived. Rather, it is a change in the sentiment both within the country and outside that has made the achievement of a 9 per cent growth look daunting and contingent on the government taking some “difficult decisions.” Economic growth in the United States and Europe has petered out and there is a real danger of major economies slipping into another recession. India's growth slowed to 6.7 per cent in 2008-09 after exceeding 9 per cent for three consecutive years. Since then, it has ranged between 8 per cent and 8.5 per cent, which is still respectable in relation to what obtains in most other countries.
Yet the outlook for the current year has changed for the worse in the eyes of most forecasters. It is not just the external environment, but also the policy drift and indecision in government in recent months that have dampened sentiment. Improving governance will be a critical and necessary condition for growth to accelerate. Unfortunately the Planning Commission has been silent on the many issues that are crying out for reform. The approach paper ought to have been the forum for initiating debates on the more politically difficult subjects of reform. Fiscal consolidation, achieving a sustainable balance of payments position, and boosting productivity in agriculture and industry have remained unexceptionable goals. Fiscal prudence is absolutely necessary for long-term stability without which higher growth rates are not possible. Although the size of the current account deficit is estimated to be well within the prudential range of 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent of the GDP, the financing requirements are large, and at the current juncture, policymakers cannot take capital inflows for granted. Finally, monetary measures to curb the persistent inflation will necessarily entail sacrificing some of the growth momentum, at least over the short-term. Will the targeted 9 per cent growth be as elusive as the double digit growth was during the 11th Plan?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/aiming-high-in-the-12th-plan/article2393475.ece
24,8,2011,The price of Nato help,"The brutal 42-year-old dictatorship of Muammar al-Qadhafi is close to collapse and his own whereabouts are unknown. But the confusion over the Libyan situation cannot obscure the problems caused by the military intervention of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato). Heavy fighting continues in and around the capital, Tripoli, with Nato giving heavy bombing and shelling support to the rebel body, the Transitional National Council (TNC); and atrocities by both sides have been reported. This is, in large part, the outcome of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 — which bars landings by foreign forces but allows member states to use “all necessary means” (diplomatic terminology for military action) to ensure Libyan compliance with the Resolution. Humanitarian intervention as conceived by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France under cover of the U.N. has meant using highly advanced weaponry in helping the TNC, which includes militant Islamists of the sort who have been fighting Nato and other western forces in Iraq and Afghanistan for a decade, to bring about violent regime change. This western commitment to regime change, which could not have been achieved without Nato bombing, amounts to a total U-turn from the time, barely a year ago, when the same leaders were making much of Mr. Qadhafi in order to win access to Libya's substantial oilfields.
The entire rebellion and the Nato campaign are riddled with inconsistencies. Western proponents initially claimed the campaign would be over in days. It has lasted six months, is yet to end, and has cost the U.S. alone more than a billion dollars. Secondly, there are severe tensions among the TNC's three main factions; it is still not known who murdered the rebels' top officer, General Abdel Fattah Younes. Furthermore, many leaders among Libya's 140 tribes, including longstanding Qadhafi supporters, will want office in the new order. Above all, the western powers will almost certainly exact a heavy price for supporting the uprising. Their demands are likely to include — as they did in Iraq — preferential, if not monopoly, access for western oil corporations. It is no coincidence that as reports emerged of the rebel advance on Tripoli, the price of Brent Crude fell 1.7 per cent to $106.8 per barrel in futures trading. There are also likely to be lucrative contracts for western companies to rebuild Libyan cities; and the European Union members of Nato may want the new government to impose tight controls on Libyan migration to the EU. In effect, the U.S., Britain, and France, with help from Italy, have used the U.N. and Nato to bring about regime change and pull off a gigantic oil-grab.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-price-of-nato-help/article2389705.ece
24,8,2011,All that glitters,"Amidst all the chaos and uncertainty that engulfed the global financial markets, ordinary investors and governments alike turned to the sanctuary of gold. That response is not uncommon: during the previous crises — for example, the global financial meltdown of 2008 — gold benefited as equity stock prices sank. However, even after normalcy returned and stocks rallied, the price of gold did not fall back as one would expect. It seems likely that investors, traumatised by the crisis, were not fully convinced of the sustainability of the recovery and continued to keep a part of their money in recession-proof assets, of which gold ranks very high. That, however, cannot explain the phenomenal worldwide demand for gold in recent weeks and the consequent spike in its prices. Setting new records practically every day, gold touched an all-time high of $1,900 an ounce on Tuesday as investors, spooked by the prospect of a return to recession, sought out safety in the precious metal. Gold prices have more than doubled since the recession began in 2007. They have risen by 19 per cent since June when the eurozone debt crisis grew in intensity and threatened to spill over into its stronger economies.
Economic uncertainty has always added lustre to gold in the eyes of investors, and in recent weeks there has been no shortage of unsettling developments. The downgrade of the U.S. sovereign debt, after its politicians nearly drove the country to the brink of a default, was one significant upheaval. And by the close of last week came reports that pointed to a sharp economic slowdown in the developed countries. While gold has always won the vote of investors seeking safety from turbulent financial markets, the sharp rise in prices has now brought on a new set of buyers, those who take high risks for quick returns. Demand has come from yet another direction: Central banks in developing countries are switching their currency reserves to gold. Purchases by the world's central banks more than quadrupled during April-June this year over that a year ago. In India and some other countries gold is, of course, much more than an investment opportunity or a currency substitute. Ahead of the festival season, the demand from the jewellery industry has risen to unprecedented levels. Investment opportunities in gold and gold-backed instruments have been expanding in the country. Some non-banking finance companies in Kerala have seen an explosive growth in gold loan business. But, as this much-sought-after metal bounces along another volatile phase, the gold loan boom points to the risks ahead as much as to the potential.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/all-that-glitters/article2389700.ece
25,8,2011,Japan's turn for downgrade,"The downgrading of Japan's government debt by Moody's Investor Services on Wednesday was in the making for quite some time. The revised rating, down by one notch to ‘Aa3', carries a stable outlook and brings it on a par with the ratings by its two main rivals, Standard & Poor's and Fitch. Now, Japan is on the same level as China, which surpassed it last year to become the world's second largest economy. The action of Moody's has not caused, nor is it likely to cause, a turmoil in the markets because the rating agency is only seen as catching up with its peers. Moreover, Moody's themselves have said that taking into account Japan's credit strengths they do not see a funding crisis arising in the next 12 to 18 months. A key dampening factor is that the bulk of Japan's public debt is owned internally; there would have been much commotion if overseas creditors had been dominant. Inevitably, comparisons will be made with S&P's historic downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt earlier this month, for both are a verdict on the deterioration in the public finances of two of the top industrialised countries.
Of course, political factors also weighed in the downgrades in both cases. In the U.S., the absence of a smooth working arrangement between the two political parties almost forced the federal government to default and left the administration with very few options to tackle the debt crisis. In the case of Japan, “revolving door politics” — the country is preparing to elect its sixth leader in five years — have stood in the way of effective long-term fiscal and growth strategies. But the economics are more stark: Japan's financial position is in a miserable shape, with nearly half of the central government budget funded by bond issuance. Its gross debt now exceeds 200 per cent of the GDP, a dubious record unmatched by any industrialised country. In addition to its structural debt problems, Japan faces a bill amounting to ¥15-20 trillion for recovery work following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. Given the weak growth prospects, it is obvious that Japan will find the servicing of its burgeoning public debt very difficult. To crank up its usually efficient manufacturing sector, Japan has decided to tackle head-on the problems arising from the sharp appreciation in the yen, which is now at its highest levels since World War II. The yen's rise has blunted Japan's much-vaunted export competitiveness and threatens to derail its main growth engine. The $100 billion war chest announced on Wednesday to help small and medium enterprises cope with the surging yen might be too little in relation to Japan's problems and, perhaps, even too late.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/japans-turn-for-downgrade/article2397138.ece
25,8,2011,A massive tree,"Cataloguing the diversity of life on earth remains one of the incomplete goals of science. Taxonomists have tried to come up with a credible number for the species that have been identified as unique — and succeeded in entering some 1.2 million in a centralised database. The problem with this number is that it is a fraction of the whole; the majority of species both on land and in the oceans has not been catalogued. It is in this context that a new species count put out by a group of scientists becomes noteworthy. Camilo Mora and colleagues propose in an open access paper titled “How Many Species Are There on Earth and in the Ocean?” (published in the journal PLoS Biology) that the number of those with complex cell structures could be 8.7 million, plus-or-minus 1.3 million. Of them, the marine species could be about 2.2 million. This estimate is a projection based on consistent and predictable patterns in the system of classifying animals and plants. The real significance lies not in the absolute number — there could be many more species, other scientists think — but in the scale of effort needed to identify and save them in a human-dominated future. Given the magnitude of the task, taxonomy as a discipline should be drawing many more researchers. It also needs massive infusions of funding.
Underpinning the estimate arrived at by Dr. Mora and his group is the thesis that there has been a definite pattern to the discovery of new classes of animals from the year 1750. Reasonable predictions were possible in the past based on the classification pyramid that scientists could build. Now, based on that model, it is suggested there may be 7.7 million species of animals, 298,000 plants, and 611,000 fungi, among others. It will take an accelerated global campaign to validate these figures. It is worth pointing out that only about 15,000 new discoveries are added to the tally annually. At the same time, the mounting resource demands of 6.9 billion humans are altering habitats at such a rapid pace that the resulting extinction rates greatly exceed the natural rates of loss. In many parts of the world, there is a fading echo of biodiversity. This demands a stronger response from governments to document life. Funding to establish more taxonomy centres in universities, for DNA analysis and for scientific expeditions, is crucial. Where funding and expertise are available, the results are impressive. Many amphibians given up as lost in India have been rediscovered and catalogued in recent years, particularly in the Western Ghats. Saving what remains of species diversity is vital, and greater understanding of what exists will help make that possible.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-massive-tree/article2397136.ece
27,8,2011,Don't hang them,"Preparations have begun at the Vellore Central Prison for hanging Murugan, Santhan, and Perarivalan — convicted for their involvement in the 1991 assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. Jail officials have fixed September 9 as the date for the executions. The mercy petitions of the three were rejected by President Pratibha Patil earlier this month, 11 years after they were filed, and the Union Home Ministry has notified her decision to the Tamil Nadu government. Of the three, Murugan and Santhan are Sri Lankan Tamils. They were core members of the LTTE team that carried out the ground work for the assassination, acting as its conduits for money and messages; and Perarivalan, an Indian, was charged with buying the battery cells used in the belt bomb worn by Dhanu, the suicide bomber who carried out the assassination. He also bought the battery for an illegal wireless set the assassination squad used to communicate with the LTTE in Sri Lanka. All three were convicted and sentenced to death for murder and criminal conspiracy, along with Nalini, who was granted clemency in 2000. The assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who was on the comeback trail two decades ago, shook India. The monstrous crime, months in its planning and cold-blooded in its execution, deserves the harshest civilised punishment. Capital punishment is a throwback to a medievalist bloodlust that has no place in a modern criminal justice system. The sanction of law does not mitigate the cruelty of taking another person's life. It has been The Hindu's consistent stand for decades that, regardless of person, place, and circumstance, India must abolish capital punishment. The just punishment for crimes such as the Rajiv Gandhi murder must be a lifetime in prison without any possibility of remission.
Globally, an increasing number of countries are tending towards abolition of the death penalty. Ninety-six have done away with it, and 34 are abolitionist in practice by observing official or unofficial moratoria on executions. India too has not carried out any legal execution since 2004, though every year the courts add substantially to the numbers who face the threat of execution. That the government is suddenly eager to fast-track death penalties that it has sat on for years may be no coincidence. But hanging a few condemned prisoners is not going to redeem the UPA in the eyes of the nation. The case of the three LTTE operatives on death row at Vellore offers an opportunity to put an end to the death penalty without in any way going soft on their crimes. The government must seize it by commuting their sentences to life, extending this to all other death row prisoners as well.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dont-hang-them/article2400725.ece
27,8,2011,iConic Jobs,"Steve Jobs could connect the dots and how. Apple Computer, which he co-founded with Steve Wozniak in 1976, has been a world-beating success under his visionary leadership. It soared from its start as a garage venture into a technology giant with a market valuation of $350 billion, and an unmatched reputation for inventing disruptively brilliant gadgets. Apple's orchard has been sprouting wonderful things starting with the Macintosh computers and going on to the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad, each testifying to the value of fine minimalist design and excellence in performance. What makes the legacy of Mr. Jobs remarkable in the fast-changing world of consumer electronics is his ability to come back to the core of innovation after fighting tough battles, and set the bar higher. Neither a 12-year absence after his 1985 exit due to an internal power struggle nor serious health setbacks seemed to curb his spirit. Now that he is stepping down as CEO, the question naturally arises — can Apple maintain its pre-eminence without the boss at the helm? The answer would seem to lie in the leader's own philosophy of life and work.
Mr. Jobs, who was raised by working class parents, did not graduate from college. But he continued to learn. He listened to intuition. He is listed as either primary inventor or co-inventor in more than 230 awarded patents or patent applications. Talent must be allowed to speak and experiment with ideas, even if every move is not bound for immediate commercial success. Mr. Jobs has a timeless message for everyone — the only way to do great work is to love what one does. A second powerful message from the 56-year old tech wizard is to learn from failure. Mr. Jobs is on record that his departure from Apple in the mid-1980s was one of the best things that happened to him — the heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of becoming a beginner once more. He proved himself all over again before returning to the company. Perhaps even more extraordinary is his triumph over life-threatening health challenges. Yet, as events show, indomitable spirit must also defer to the constraints of physical ability. Today, legions of fans look differently at music, video, and the web with each wave of innovation at Apple. The iPad tablet computer is the latest. They will look for the same game-changing impact in future products, an expectation that incoming CEO Tim Cook will have to meet. In a competitive future, Apple will have put its trust in itself. As Mr. Jobs told Stanford University graduates in a 2005 commencement address: “You have to trust in something. Your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.” A fine thought from someone who has lived it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/iconic-jobs/article2400723.ece
28,8,2011,Significant victory,"Parliament's unanimous adoption of a resolution agreeing “in principle” with Team Anna's position on the three sticking points that prolonged the standoff on the Lokpal legislation is a triumph for the anti-corruption mood in the country — and for the Gandhian technique of non-violent mass agitation on issues of vital concern to the people. Anna Hazare and his team deserve full credit for recognising and riding this popular mood, which showed plenty of signs of becoming a wave; for giving concrete shape to the inchoate aspirations of the movement against corruption through the provisions of the Jan Lokpal Bill; and for working out a strategy and tactics that refused to compromise on the core issues but knew when to raise the stakes and when to settle. As for the political players, the major opposition parties did well to recognise the soundness of the core demands of Team Anna and keep up the pressure on the government. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the politically savvy elements in the United Progressive Alliance regime can also take some credit for the way they finally acted to resolve this crisis.
What is clear to everyone — except the unreconstructed elements within the political system who have long been opposed to a strong, independent, and effective statutory authority to go after corruption at all levels — is that the Lokpal Bill that was introduced in Parliament by the government and is now before a Standing Committee lies thoroughly discredited. The government must not be guided by those in its ranks who advocate some kind of rearguard action in committee or on the floor of the House to go back on commitments made. The fact is that in sum, that is, in the parliamentary resolution and during the preceding rounds of discussion with Team Anna, the government conceded the following key demands. In addition to Ministers, Members of Parliament (subject to Article 105 of the Constitution), and Group ‘A' officers, the Prime Minister at one end and the lower bureaucracy at the other will be brought under the jurisdiction of the Lokpal. Secondly, under the same statute, strong and effective Lokayuktas on the same model as the Lokpal will be established in all States. Team Anna contends that no constitutional problem is involved here since the Lokpal legislation deals with substantive and procedural criminal law, which is covered by Entries 1 and 2 of the Concurrent List in the Constitution. The bottom-line is that it makes no sense to have a strong and effective Lokpal to investigate and prosecute central public servants for corruption while having defunct or no Lokayuktas in States. Thirdly, the Lokpal legislation will provide for a grievance redressal system, requiring all public authorities to prepare a citizen's charter and make commitments to be met within a specified time frame. Constitutionally speaking, these arrangements are covered by Entry 8 of the Concurrent List dealing with actionable wrongs. Whether the Lokpal or another authority established under the same law will oversee this grievance redressal system remains an open question. For its part, Team Anna has agreed that judges need not come under the Lokpal provided a credible and independent Judicial Conduct Commission, free from conflict of interest and empowered to investigate and prosecute charges of corruption against judges, is established by law. Unfortunately, the contentious issue of a selection committee for the Lokpal could not be resolved. But considering that virtually everyone outside the UPA seems opposed to the official Lokpal Bill's provision that the government will nominate five of the nine members of the selection committee, this can probably be regarded as a dead letter.
There are some excellent provisions in the Jan Lokpal Bill that have gone mostly unnoticed. For instance, Section 6(o) provides that the Lokpal can recommend the cancellation or modification of a lease, licence, permission, contract or agreement obtained from a public authority by corrupt means; if the public authority rejects the recommendation, the Lokpal can “approach [the] appropriate High Court for seeking appropriate directions to be given to the public authority.” It can also press for the blacklisting of those involved in acts of corruption. Then there is Section 31(1), which stipulates that “no government official shall be eligible to take up jobs, assignments, consultancies, etc. with any person, company, or organisation that he had dealt with in his official capacity.” Section 31(2) provides that “all contracts, public-private partnerships, transfer by way of sale, lease, and any form of largesse by any public authority shall be done with complete transparency and by calling for public tender/auction/bids unless it is an emergency measure or where it is not possible to do so for reasons to be recorded in writing.” And Section 31(3) requires that “all contracts, agreements or MOUs known by any name related to transfer of natural resources, including land and mines to any private entity by any method like public-private partnerships, sale, lease or any form of largesse by any public authority shall be put on the website within a week of being signed.”
In appraising what has happened over the past fortnight, a red herring needs to be got out of the way — the idea of the ‘supremacy of Parliament' versus everyone who comes up against it. Parliamentarians who assert this need to learn their Constitution. In India, unlike Britain, Parliament is not supreme; the Constitution is. Nor is law-making “the sole prerogative” of Parliament. The significant victory of the anti-corruption campaigners gives political India a rare opportunity to translate fine anti-corruption sentiments into a potent law that can be a game-changer. The challenge before the people of India is to ensure, by keeping up the pressure, that in the tricky business of law making in committee and on the floor of the Houses of Parliament a potentially powerful instrument is not blunted.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/significant-victory/article2406721.ece
30,8,2011,Positive step in Sri Lanka,"Sri Lanka's decision to lift the Emergency regulations, as announced by President Mahinda Rajapaksa in Parliament last week, is a step towards creating a positive environment for national reconciliation. The regulations rode on powers granted to government under the 1947 Public Security Ordinance. They have remained almost continuously in force since the 1971 Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna insurgency in southern Sri Lanka, through the years of the armed Tamil militancy in the North and the East. But there was never any real justification for retaining them after the LTTE's military defeat in 2009. The broad sweep and vague language of the regulations struck fear among the Tamil minority, and curtailed the freedoms of all Sri Lankans. Over the years, and especially after the LTTE's assassination of Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar in 2005 until the end of the war, the government introduced a welter of overlapping regulations arming security personnel with wide and arbitrary powers to search, detain, and arrest people for “terrorism,” which itself was not clearly defined. Draconian in their scope, the regulations undermined the freedom of speech, expression, and movement. The monthly approval needed from Parliament for their extension was an insufficient cover. With the immunity they provided to officials, the instances of misuse were many, especially in the Tamil-dominated areas of Sri Lanka.
The Sri Lankan government must clarify how it proposes to deal with the people — their numbers are unclear — still detained under the Emergency laws. It also remains to be seen how Sri Lanka will now use the Prevention of Terrorism Act, a law so severe that it more than mirrors the Emergency regulations in its scope and powers; the two were implemented simultaneously or interchangeably. Without losing any momentum, the Sri Lankan polity must now quickly move towards setting up the political framework to address the Tamil question — the just solution to which is wide-ranging devolution of powers within a united Sri Lanka. The 13th Amendment provides a decent start but, as the whole world knows, Tamil aspirations go beyond this. It is certainly time to concretise the ‘plus' in the 13th Amendment-plus to which President Rajapaksa committed his government before the LTTE was eliminated as a military entity. In shaping an enduring political solution, the role of the Tamil National Alliance, which decisively won the recent local bodies elections in the North, is crucial. Thus far it has fallen woefully short of articulating a clear vision of a constitutional solution. It is time it steps up to the task.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/positive-step-in-sri-lanka/article2409578.ece
30,8,2011,Kashmir's unidentified dead,"More than two decades after the first shots of the jihad in Jammu and Kashmir were fired, the bodies of the men whom the fighting claimed could help build the foundations for the restoration of the rule of law. Earlier this month, investigators working for the State's Human Rights Commission reported that 2,730 unidentified people lie in unmarked graves strung along the Line of Control — people the Indian Army and State police claim were terrorists infiltrating across the LoC. That unidentified people alleged to be terrorists lie buried in makeshift graveyards across the State isn't a revelation: indeed, this newspaper has reported the existence of sites that have not so far been documented by investigators. The Army says it has no means of knowing who a terrorist crossing the LoC might be; Pakistan-based jihadist groups, in their own literature, admit to having sent hundreds of Kashmiri jihadists to their deaths. Nor is there evidence that the bodies were buried in a clandestine manner. The J&K Police have already established the identities of 574 of those buried, and another 17 bodies have been exhumed and laid to rest by next-of-kin. Each killing appears to have been recorded in a First Information Report, as required by law. Damningly, however, the post-mortems carried out on those killed were slapdash in the extreme, which means a number of the dead might have been victims of extrajudicial execution.
The debate over the unidentified victims now threatens to turn into an unproductive polemical exchange between human rights groups and the government. But name-calling will do little service to those at the centre of the debate: the hundreds of families whose loved ones have been missing for years. There are concrete things that should be done to give these families a sense of closure and justice. DNA samples could be taken from the bodies of the dead and matched against results from the families of missing persons. Forensic pathologists could re-examine the bodies where there is reason to suspect extrajudicial execution. Such a project would demand considerable resources and also take time: for homicide investigation, police forces face routine waits of over six months for DNA results from the country's overburdened laboratories. But going about this task honestly and thoroughly is important. Models exist for such a project. The United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation, for example, maintains a database that can match DNA from unidentified bodies with the profiles of the relatives of missing persons. In New Delhi and Srinagar, governments and rights activists need to stop scoring debating points, and focus instead on concrete solutions based on humanity and justice.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/kashmirs-unidentified-dead/article2409580.ece
31,8,2011,Dismal progress in social housing,"The progress in providing housing for the poor, as revealed by data recently released by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, is way off target. This calls for a serious questioning of the approach and capabilities of government institutions to deliver badly needed social housing. The Interest Subsidy Scheme for Housing the Urban Poor (ISHUP), launched in 2008 to provide an interest subsidy of five per cent on a loan amount of Rs.100,000 to the economically weaker section and lower income group, has so far benefited only 7,805 people as against the 2012 target of 310,000. Although a sum of Rs.1,378 crore was allotted, merely about Rs.6.5 crore has so far been utilised. Progress on the flagship project, the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, which has a provision of Rs.50,000 crore for the period 2005-2012, is no better. Only about 30 per cent of houses sanctioned for the poor under this scheme have been built. The lack of funds is often projected as the main reason for the dismal situation of social housing. It is now evident that, more than funds, poor conceptualisation of policies, procedural inefficiency, and ineffective construction practices are the major impediments.
ISHUP has failed to deliver because it is conceptually flawed. Policymakers assumed that the poor had access to land and needed only financial support to build their houses. As a result, the focus was on making credit easily available. However, the reality is that neither cheap land nor affordable houses are in good supply. If the demand for social housing is to be met, in addition to rectifying policies, construction practices and performance regimes need to be greatly improved. In particular, State-level housing boards must improve their capacity in order to fully utilise the available funds and deliver more houses. The experience of the United Kingdom offers valuable lessons in this area. Since 1998, after the Construction Task Force set up by the U.K. government published its seminal report ‘Rethinking Construction', local authorities earnestly adopted best building practices. They formed productive alliances with the construction industry and adopted modern methods that increased the production of homes four-fold. Specific annual benchmarks, such as a 10 per cent reduction in cost and construction time, were set and procurement processes were streamlined. The financial gains from these improvements were invested in the housing projects. It is only by adopting such innovative practices and radically changing the approach to the provision of social housing can the vision of making cities slum-free be realised.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dismal-progress-in-social-housing/article2415580.ece
31,8,2011,Raising the bar,"The Reserve Bank of India took a measured step towards licensing new private sector banks by releasing a set of draft guidelines on Monday. The central bank's concerns on licensing-related issues have been evident right from the time the Finance Minister mooted the idea in his February 2010 budget speech; unsurprisingly, these find expression in the guidelines. Allowing private players to start banks has always been a sensitive issue in India's recent history. More so when it is seen to benefit large industrial houses and business groups, whose questionable practices in banks they owned were one of the justifications for bank nationalisation that began in 1969. RBI Governor D. Subbarao was airing a widely held apprehension when he said recently that the “gaps” in the existing regulations could lead to corporations “self-dealing” in banks they promote or using them “as a private pool of readily available funds.” The limited attempts at licensing new private banks through guidelines issued in 1993 and 2001 do not offer any valuable lesson for current policymaking beyond the quite obvious fact that only banks with sound promoters do succeed. The RBI has therefore done well to insist on “sound credentials”, “integrity”, “diversified ownership” and a 10-year track record. Prospective promoters should not have even a 10 per cent exposure to real estate and broking businesses. That is ostensibly meant to keep out those from “speculative” sectors.
The stipulation that a new bank can be set up only through a wholly owned non-operative holding company is an important safeguard designed to ring fence the bank and its depositors from problems in related entities. Necessary amendments to the Banking Regulation Act 1949 will be carried out to remove the restriction on voting rights while concurrently empowering the RBI to approve acquisition of shares/voting rights of 5 per cent or more by persons who are “fit and proper.” The RBI will get sweeping powers, for instance, to supersede the bank's board in certain cases. The minimum capital requirement is fixed at Rs.500 crore and the capital adequacy ratio at 12 per cent. New banks will have an up-to-date technology platform from day one and ensure that every fourth branch is located in rural areas. Furthering financial inclusion is one of the main reasons for licensing new banks. It is likely that only a small number of applicants will qualify and fewer still will be able to get the licence from an RBI-appointed expert committee. The central bank has said that licences will not be issued to all those who qualify. It is clearly not about to open the floodgates.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/raising-the-bar/article2415582.ece
31,8,2011,The home stretch in Nepal,"With the swearing-in of Baburam Bhattarai as Nepal's new Prime Minister, the political pendulum has swung squarely back to where it ought to have been in the first place. A Maoist-led coalition is now in place, with the Madhesi parties comprising the other component. The Unified Marxists-Leninists and the Nepali Congress are not part of the new arrangement but Dr. Bhattarai has indicated that the formation of a national government with the participation of all major political parties will be a priority. The Nepali Maoists won the Constituent Assembly elections of 2008, emerging with many more seats than the UML and the NC. However, since the former rebels did not have enough MPs to form a government by themselves, let alone ensure the writing of a new constitution, it was evident that coalition building was the way to go. The first Maoist-led coalition under Prachanda — which collapsed in the face of opposition from the Nepali army, the UML, the NC, and India — may not have done much to further the twin tasks of constitution writing and concluding the peace process. But the opportunistic coalition under Madhav Kumar Nepal, which was in office for nearly two years and had tacit support from hardline elements in India who never reconciled themselves to the emergence of the Maoists as a parliamentary force, was far worse. It was only with the election of the UML's Jhalanath Khanal as Prime Minister in February 2011 that the political logjam began to clear. Today Dr. Bhattarai's emergence as head of a new government offers Nepal a new opportunity to complete its tryst with destiny.
While the principal challenge remains the drafting of a new constitution in accordance with the political, socio-economic, and cultural aspirations of Nepal's peoples, this task cannot be accomplished without tangible steps being taken towards completion of the peace process. The Maoists must disband their erstwhile Peoples' Liberation Army, with an agreed number of former combatants being integrated into the Nepal Army. At the same time, the Nepal Army must be democratised, in keeping with the temper and spirit of the new nation that emerged after the abolition of the monarchy. Numerous proposals have been made to accomplish the task of integration only to flounder in the face of intransigence by hardline elements within the Maoists, the Army, or other political parties. Now that the Maoists are back at the helm, every effort must be made to ensure the speedy resolution of the military question. The term of the CA was extended by three months on Monday night and will now run till November 30. Dr. Bhattarai and his colleagues, as well as all political parties, thus have 90 days to push the peace process and constitution writing seriously. The clock has started ticking. Given the differences on major constitutional issues, they have not a second to lose.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-home-stretch-in-nepal/article2412662.ece
31,8,2011,"Plutocrats, taxes & moral decay","Sixteen of France's richest people have sparked a lively debate by offering to pay higher taxes. They did this in a joint letter titled “ Taxez Nous!” (“Tax Us!”), published in the daily Le Nouvel Observateur on August 23. Among them are the heads of some of the country's largest corporations, including Liliane Bettencourt, Europe's richest woman. The signatories commend the French and the wider European environments, from which they say they have benefited and which they wish to preserve against threats such as capital flight and increased tax evasion. They also contend that by paying more tax they will help reduce the French budget deficit, which President Nicolas Sarkozy plans to bring down from 4.6 per cent this year to 3 per cent in 2013. France has, in fact, just announced a 3 per cent rise in income tax for all who earn over €1 million a year but the signatories say they are also responding to the government's call for solidarity. The letter appeared shortly after a joint proposal by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy for a financial transactions tax to help the eurozone economies — and after the multibillionaire Warren Buffett's New York Times article (August 14, 2011) calling for higher taxes on the “mollycoddled” super-rich so that they bear a share of the sacrifices others are making and also contribute to deficit reduction.
French trade unionists point out that merely reducing budget deficits will not encourage more economic activity. One of the letter's signatories calls the French plutocrats' idea “weak and insufficient”; and Mr. Buffett has been criticised for talking only about tax on his income, which forms a tiny part of his overall wealth of about $60 billion. Above all, neither the French super-rich nor Mr. Buffett and his critics analyse the reasons for the current economic crises. That critique is now coming from various British Conservatives who conclude that the so-called free market is a “corporatist racket for the few”; it is free only for the very rich, who can move their money around at will. In addition, the “feral rich” — bankers, business tycoons who exploit lax regulation and offshore tax havens, and expense-fiddling politicians — are all part of a wider problem, which the commentator Peter Oborne calls moral decay. The debate is significant and will continue but notable absentees from it are the centre-left parties that have in the past revived economies and ensured a decent life for hundreds of millions by protecting them from the worst effects of unrestrained markets. They must enter the fray if they are to stay relevant.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/plutocrats-taxes-moral-decay/article2412660.ece
3,9,2011,The hidden river,"The world's largest underground ‘ocean' — a water-body about the size of the Arctic Ocean and located 700 to 1,400 km below the ground and extending from Indonesia to the northern tip of Russia — has found its match. Scientists have discovered in Brazil the longest underground river — running for a length of 6,000 km at a depth of nearly 4 km. It flows all the way from the Andean foothills to the Atlantic coast in a nearly west-to-east direction like the mighty Amazon River. The discovery was made public at a recent meeting of the Brazilian Geophysical Society in Rio de Janeiro. The river ‘Hamza,' named after the discoverer, an Indian-born scientist Valiya Mannathal Hamza who is working with the National Observatory at Rio, makes it the first and geologically unusual instance of a twin-river system flowing at different levels of the earth's crust in Brazil. If the slowing down of certain seismic waves caused by the damp spot helped uncover the underground ocean, the unusual temperature variation with depth measured in 241 inactive oil wells helped locate the subterranean river. Except for the flow direction, the Amazon and the Hamza have very different characteristics. The most obvious ones are their width and flow speed. While the former is 1 km to 100 km wide, the latter is 200 km to 400 km in width. But the flow speed is five metres per second in the Amazon and less than a millimetre per second speed in the Hamza.
Several geological factors have played a vital role in the formation and existence of these subterranean water bodies. The underground ocean, discovered in 2007, has been formed when the plate carrying the Pacific Ocean bottom gets dragged and ends up under the continental plate. Water at such depths would normally escape upwards but the unusual conditions that exist along the eastern Pacific Rim allow the moisture to remain intact. In the case of the Hamza, the porous and permeable sedimentary rocks behave as conduits for the water to sink to greater depths. East-west trending faults and the karst topography present along the northern border of the Amazon basin may have some role in supplying water to the river. If the impermeable rocks stop the vertical flow, the west to east gradient of the topography directs it to flow towards the Atlantic Ocean. Unlike the Hamza, the 153 km-long underground river in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula and the 8.2 km-long Cabayugan River in the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park in the Philippines have come into being thanks to the karst topography. Water in these places drills its way downward by dissolving the carbonate rock to form an extensive underground river system.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-hidden-river/article2418772.ece
3,9,2011,Nigeria's untapped resources,"Nigeria's simmering ethno-religious tensions have entered a deadly new phase with the August 26 suicide bombing of the United Nations building in a relatively safe district of the national capital, Abuja. At least 23 were killed and 73 injured in this first attack on an international body in the country. The U.N. has condemned the bombing and stated that the mission's senior staff would remain at their post. The extremist Islamist group, Boko Haram, has claimed responsibility, as it has done for several other attacks and bombings since 2009. It is true that Nigeria's population of 160 million — the largest of any African state — is sharply divided on religious lines, with a Christian-majority south and a Muslim-majority north. But Boko Haram's propagation of hardline Islamism has been openly violent only since the middle of 2009, when followers rioted in the north-eastern city of Maiduguri and the central government cracked down brutally, killing more than 700 people in the process. The group's violence intensified further after its leader, Mohammed Yusuf, died in police custody.
Given Boko Haram's extremist ideology, it would be easy to neglect factors that have exacerbated the current tensions. Various northern Nigerian politicians had issued warnings about the group's proclivities, as had at least one senior police officer, but these were ignored. Secondly, the benefits of the country's oil wealth have not reached enough ordinary people, with northern provinces being particularly neglected. Further, official self-enrichment in one of the world's most corrupt countries is a longstanding cause of frustration and alienation for the bulk of the population. A positive factor is that Nigeria's main political parties are genuinely national. In the April 2011 presidential election, the winner, People's Democratic Party leader Goodluck Jonathan, had support throughout the country. The north witnessed a strong turnout of women voters, and northern politicians even apologised to Boko Haram for the severity of the 2009 crackdown. While some observers fear that the attack on the U.N. indicates contact between Boko Haram and al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Nigeria has the political systems and the political culture to withstand such threats. It will, however, be vital for the central government to curb corruption and improve the functioning of public institutions if the trust and confidence the public showed during the elections are to be strengthened. That would also reveal whether the hard-line Islamist elements are more troubled by Nigerian Muslims' commitment to democracy than they are by the country's religious divide.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/nigerias-untapped-resources/article2418773.ece
4,9,2011,Evaluating the macroeconomy,"The Reserve Bank of India's latest annual report, released recently, makes a candid assessment of the macroeconomic performance during 2010-11 and the prospects for the current year. Although the economy returned to its high growth path, it faced several challenges: investment activity slowed; fiscal consolidation was led by cyclical and one-off factors casting doubts on its sustainability; and inflation remained stubbornly high on the back of new pressures. The RBI responded to the challenge of inflation by raising policy rates by 4.75 percentage points on a cumulative basis from March 2010. The report points out that high inflation by itself would have brought down growth. When inflation is high, the theoretical tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment or between inflation and growth do not work. Well into the current year, inflation has continued to be the number one concern for policymakers. The RBI is poised to raise interest rates further even though it is well recognised that some of the growth momentum will be lost in the process. Indeed, the lower GDP growth at 7.7 per cent in the first quarter is partly attributed to the high interest rate environment.
The RBI's GDP growth projections for the current year have been more modest than those of the government. However, even with the expected deceleration, growth is likely to remain close to the trend of about 8 per cent, the rate forecast by the central bank way back in May. Inflation is expected to remain high for the rest of this year and moderate to about 7 per cent by 2012. In the absence of supply side responses, monetary policy has its own limitations as an instrument for curbing inflation, although it can still play an important part in countering the second-round effects of supply-led inflation. On current assessment, the fiscal deficit this year is likely to overshoot the figure anticipated in the budget. The deficit will widen further, if the economy slows down, as feared, and the revenues drop sharply from the anticipated levels as a consequence. On the other hand, the current account deficit can be contained within a sustainable level of 2.7-3 per cent of the GDP. However, the outlook for the external sector during 2011-12 looks uncertain. The annual report lists six medium-term challenges for the Indian economy. Predictably, bringing inflation and inflationary expectation down to acceptable levels tops the list. It is one thing to get the diagnosis right; it is yet another to come up with the remedy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/evaluating-the-macroeconomy/article2424157.ece
4,9,2011,Brief workouts count,"“I don't have the time” can no longer be an excuse for not exercising. According to a study reported recently in The Lancet (“Minimum amount of physical activity for reduced mortality and extended life expectancy: a prospective cohort study,” by Chi Pang Wen et al.,), health benefits have been recorded even with 15 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity daily for six days a week. Mortality dropped by 14 per cent, and life expectancy was extended by three years compared with those who led a sedentary lifestyle. The authors followed up, over an eight-year period, more than 400,000 healthy Taiwanese men and women with varying levels of physical activity. Although the public health recommendation in most countries is physical activity for a minimum of 30 minutes a day for five days a week, brief activity seems to be better than no activity. This message was brought out by the 2008 U.S. physical activity guidelines, which observed that “even low amounts of physical activity reduce the risk of dying prematurely.” A paper published recently in Circulation also underlined that the risk of coronary heart disease was “significantly lower” even when the physical activity was “lower than the minimum recommended amount.”
Fifteen minutes should be considered only a minimum. As the Lancet study found, there were more benefits when the duration was longer. Every additional 15 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a day reduced the total mortality by four per cent and cancer death by one per cent compared with people who were inactive. However, no additional health benefits were seen beyond 100 minutes. The work, however, has a major limitation — it was an observational study and not a clinical trial. Hence no direct link between health benefits and physical activity can be firmly established, as other factors would have played a role. Despite this limitation, the possible benefits of moderate-intensity workouts of shorter duration may encourage more people to abandon physical inactivity. There is also a greater likelihood of people increasing the duration once they start exercising. Those who intend to follow the public health recommendation of a minimum of 30-minute continuous workout a day but are unable to do so can take heart. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the benefits of 30 minutes can be reaped by working out for at least ten minutes thrice a day or 15 minutes twice daily. The World Health Organisation says physical inactivity causes six per cent of deaths globally and it has identified inactivity as the fourth leading risk factor for mortality. Hence any programme that can motivate people to exercise daily should be strongly encouraged.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/brief-workouts-count/article2424156.ece
5,9,2011,Sen and sensibility,"Impeachment is not merely a cumbersome business. It could also have divisive and other unintended consequences. This explains the sense of relief that Justice Soumitra Sen of the Calcutta High Court resigned on the eve of his certain impeachment by the Lok Sabha. It is welcome that there was a political consensus that the proceedings had become infructuous after his resignation had been accepted by the President. To have pressed on with impeachment, as Attorney General G.E. Vahanvati reportedly advised, may be justified on an interpretation of the law relating to Parliament and its functioning. But in a situation without clear precedents, it was far better that robust common sense prevailed, leading to the conclusion that it was unnecessary to impeach a person who has already demitted high office. Why Justice Sen did not see the light earlier and submit his resignation well before the Rajya Sabha voted overwhelmingly in favour of his impeachment, only he can explain.
This is the second time Parliament has grappled with the challenge of impeaching a judge. But the circumstances relating to Justice Sen are strikingly different from those that saw Justice V. Ramaswami let off the hook in 1993, when the Congress abstained from voting on the motion. Although the power to impeach vests with Parliament, the move was kick-started — unusually and extraordinarily — by Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan. He had recommended to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that impeachment proceedings be initiated under Article 124(4) of the Constitution against Justice Sen on the basis of an in-house inquiry, which declared him guilty of financial misconduct. Another unusual aspect is that the charges relate to a period when Justice Sen was a lawyer (he became a judge in 2003) and a case in which he was made a court-appointed receiver in 1984. Even though he was absolved of “misappropriation” by a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court, there is no doubt that he had acted with gross impropriety. He had mixed the funds entrusted in his capacity as a receiver with his own, failed to prepare and file accounts as required, and repaid the money with interest in 2006 only after he was directed to do so by a judge of the Calcutta High Court. Disgraced he might be, but anti-corruption campaigners will contend that he has got away lightly. There are two key lessons to be learnt from l'affaire Sen. The first and obvious lesson is that only those with impeccable integrity must be appointed to the higher judiciary. The second is that legislation for a Judicial Conduct Commission with a strong mandate has become an urgent imperative.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sen-and-sensibility/article2427234.ece
5,9,2011,Are Libya's friends for real?,"Suspicions grow about the motives of the United Kingdom and France, the primary international patrons of Libya's interim government, the National Transitional Council (NTC), in enabling the almost-completed overthrow of Muammar al-Qadhafi. French President Nicolas Sarkozy was not short of fine words in his March 19 statement that his country was protecting the civilian population of Libya against the “murderous madness” of a regime which, by assassinating its own people, had “lost all legitimacy.” But substantial evidence is already emerging of extensive links between major oil corporations and the British and French governments in supplying the rebels and in the reconstruction of Libya's only large-scale industry, which is oil production. An analysis in The Guardian mentions meetings between Britain's junior Minister for International Development, Alan Duncan, and the crude-oil trader Vitol, with whom Mr. Duncan had previous business connections. Meanwhile French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has tried strenuously to rebut allegations in a letter obtained by the daily Libération to the effect that the NTC had promised French companies 35 per cent of future Libyan oil production. Prospective western attitudes towards the government-in-waiting are thrown further into question by The Independent's revelation, based on documents formerly possessed by the Libyan defector and former security boss Moussa Koussa, that Britain and the United States offered prisoners to Libya under the rendition programme in the so-called war on terror, and that the British intelligence service, MI6, provided Mr. Qadhafi with information on exiled Libyan opponents and dissidents.
Once in office, the NTC will desperately want to revive oil production as a prerequisite for further economic development, but the conditions under which it can do so will not be in its hands. It may find that the terms of new contracts are imposed by foreign companies, and that if it attempts to favour western firms over oil industries in Russia, China, and India — all of which abstained from the United Nations Security Council vote authorising military support for the uprising — then it might incur lasting opprobrium from those potentially important partners. Further complications for the new government in Tripoli could arise from the fact that its patrons, the U.K., France, and the U.S., were not nearly as hostile to Mr. Qadhafi as they would have the rest of the world believe. In addition, if the NTC goes about nationalising the country's oil industry as part of a programme of economic reconstruction, it could end up at the receiving end of western-induced regime change.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/are-libyas-friends-for-real/article2427235.ece
6,9,2011,Mamata plays spoiler,"There can be no quarrel with the position that States bordering India's neighbours must be consulted in framing bilateral policies with those countries, especially when it comes to sharing crucial natural resources. New Delhi's proposed agreement with Bangladesh on a formula to share the waters of the river Teesta needed to take West Bengal along. But Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's row over the draft agreement on the eve of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's important visit to Bangladesh has set a new low in the shaping of India's foreign policy. The State government evidently knew in advance that the agreement was in the works, and was familiar with its provisions. National Security Adviser Shiv Shankar Menon met the Chief Minister for a discussion on August 31. For days New Delhi had been describing the Teesta pact as a crucial component of Prime Minister Singh's visit. So why did Ms Banerjee wait until the last minute to declare it was unacceptable to her? Although the specific objections are unclear, the State government is said to have found the agreement “detrimental to the interests” of West Bengal. There is also speculation that the decision was prompted by the Trinamool Congress leader's differences with the Centre over the State's financial allocation. That New Delhi was caught unawares by her dramatic withdrawal from Dr. Singh's entourage to Dhaka indicates that it had no prior indication of her dissent. The agreement has been jettisoned at least for now, the Mamata-authored fiasco casting a shadow over the visit, the first by an Indian Prime Minister to Bangladesh in 12 years.
Sheikh Hasina's government is already targeted by political opponents for its perceived ‘pro-India' tilt. Prime Minister Hasina might have hoped to use the Teesta pact to ward off some of this criticism — levelled against her for cooperating with India on denying safe haven to ULFA and cracking down on anti-India Islamist groups. It was also hoped that a similar treaty would follow for the Feni river that flows through Tripura into Bangladesh. For its part, New Delhi expected that the give on the Teesta would yield connectivity through Bangladesh to the North-East States and beyond, underlined by the inclusion of four Chief Ministers from the region in the delegation to Dhaka. All this is up in the air now. Prime Minister Singh's visit was billed as one that would “craft a new paradigm” in a complicated bilateral relationship. With the likely signing of a border agreement and an extradition pact, the visit is not a complete write off. But there was a palpable feeling of let-down even before the Prime Minister's delegation took off from Delhi.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mamata-plays-spoiler/article2430074.ece
6,9,2011,Good but not good enough,"The law has finally caught up with G. Janardhan Reddy, the Bellary-based mining tycoon, whose wealth and political clout created what the Karnataka Lokayukta in a recent report famously referred to as “the Republic of Bellary.” The arrest of Mr. Reddy, a former Tourism Minister and a director of the Obalapuram Mining Company (OMC), along with the company's Managing Director, by a Central Bureau of Investigation team is a welcome first step in the process of bringing to justice those involved in the unprecedented plunder of scarce natural resources. The arrests arise from a case registered by the K. Rosaiah government in Andhra Pradesh on December 7, 2009 for OMC's alleged illegal mining, corruption, and destruction of forest wealth. The cases were filed under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Prevention of Corruption Act, the Indian Forest Act, and the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act. It is significant that action against Mr. Reddy and his associates was initiated in Andhra Pradesh, where only a relatively small part of Mr. Reddy's business operations lie. According to the Lokayukta report and those of the Central Empowered Committee appointed by the Supreme Court, the bulk of the OMC's illegal operations are in Karnataka.
The rise of this son of a small-town police constable owed considerably to political patronage in both States. His proximity to former Andhra Pradesh Congress Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy helped in getting lucrative mining leases in Anantapur district, while in Karnataka his expanding business empire fed the fortunes of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The BJP government, of which he was part, is yet to initiate legal action despite the damning evidence in the Lokayukta report of the OMC's illegal operations. The long list of violations includes under-invoicing of iron ore exports to the tune of approximately Rs.215 crore that, according to the report, “might have been parked in some bank of another country.” If an inner-party rebellion led by his associate B. Sriramulu has been doused, his arrest will dent the party's credibility at a time its central leadership is attempting to ride the anti-corruption wave across the country. To its discredit, the State party leadership criticised the arrest, and the government did little to rein in Mr. Reddy's supporters who went on the rampage in Bellary city. N. Santosh Hegde, retired Supreme Court judge who served as Karnataka's Lokayukta until recently, has suggested that the BJP government must follow the example of Andhra Pradesh and seek a CBI investigation into illegal mining in Karnataka. It's the BJP's turn to feel the heat.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/good-but-not-good-enough/article2430075.ece
7,9,2011,Go for the masterminds,"In any criminal investigation, the police have a considerable amount of discretion about the manner in which evidence is gathered, sifted, and corroborated. While much of this is done outside public view, carrying out arrests sends a clear signal about the direction in which an investigation is proceeding. The fresh round of arrests in the cash-for-votes case only strengthens misgivings about the Delhi police’s sincerity in getting to the bottom of the case. Yes, there is evidence that points to the involvement of former Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh, who was arrested on Tuesday, in the bribery scandal. It was his aide Sanjeev Saxena, arrested two months ago, who was caught on camera giving money to BJP MPs to purchase votes to save the UPA government in the crucial 2008 floor test. But surely Mr. Singh could have only been acting on behalf of those who directly benefited — namely, those in power at the time? The arrest of the two BJP MPs, Fagan Singh Kulaste and Mahavir Singh Bhagora, raises another question. Shouldn’t the focus be on those who attempted to bribe Opposition MPs rather than on those who blew the whistle on this? Both Mr. Kulaste and Mr. Bhagora were part of a carefully planned sting, which involved setting up traps and secretly filming the payoffs. It defies logic that an investigation into a bribery scandal can be more concerned with the whistleblowers than with those who masterminded the bribe-giving.
Sadly, the lack of will in unearthing the truth continues despite the Supreme Court’s admonition of the “ineffective and directionless probe.” The court began actively monitoring the case and scrutinising the progress of the police investigation following The Hindu’s March 2011 expose of the secret U.S. diplomatic cable (accessed through WikiLeaks) that strongly suggested that money was indeed used to purchase votes. The basis of the writ petition filed by former Chief Election Commissioner J.M. Lyngdoh and others in the Supreme Court draws on this expose. While the flurry of arrests may give the impression that the police are finally serious about proceeding with the case, they seem to be going after either the smaller fish or the red herrings. Much of the evidence on cash-for-votes is in the public domain. The BJP MPs waved wads of currency notes before placing them on the table of the House; a television channel secretly filmed the bribery attempt, and the recordings were submitted to the Lok Sabha Speaker. What the police need to investigate and determine is at whose behest the bribery operation was carried out, and what was the source of the cash. Shockingly, they don’t seem to be in any hurry to do this.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/go-for-the-masterminds/article2433077.ece
7,9,2011,The real policy challenges,"The UNCTAD's Trade and Development Report gives a fresh perspective to the policy challenges that governments around the world have been facing since the 2008 global financial crisis. It questions the prevailing orthodoxy, the growing practice of governments resorting to tight monetary and fiscal policies. In the recovery phase, economic growth has been uneven across the world. The “two speed” recovery — developing countries have outstripped the developed ones and remain the engine of growth — is based on different sets of economic circumstances prevailing in the two broad categories. Most striking is the vast difference in domestic demand. In developing countries, strong wage growth and public support have sustained the recovery in investment and consumption demand. For countries such as India, the task before policymakers is to rebalance demand from consumption to investment by inducing more people to save. On the other hand, in most developed countries, private demand is subdued because of stagnating wages and high unemployment. The report disapproves of the fiscal-tightening measures the developed countries led by the United States seem keen on adopting. At this juncture not only will such belt-tightening be counter-productive, but when adopted by some of the biggest economies, it will pose a major risk for the global economy.
Policymakers do not appear to have learnt the right lessons from the crisis. There is hardly any justification for the current shift towards austerity, says the report. Fiscal imbalances were not the cause, but the consequence, of the crisis. Fiscal retrenchment, especially the moves to cut the fiscal deficits, and curbing public debt are inappropriate responses and, when projected as something that needs to be done to regain the confidence of the financial markets, self-defeating. The much anticipated reform of the global financial and monetary systems, especially the regulatory aspects, has been slow in coming. It is well recognised that financialisation of commodity markets has affected the prices of such basic goods as food staples and energy. Urging greater transparency in derivatives, the report wants an internationally-coordinated, tighter regulation of financial investors. To remove the disconnect between foreign exchange markets and macroeconomic fundamentals, the report calls for a rules-based system to monitor exchange rate movements at the multilateral level. These suggestions are by no means original. But seldom has a U.N. agency so eloquently called for a check on the unbridled expansion of global finance as UNCTAD has done now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-real-policy-challenges/article2433078.ece
8,9,2011,ULFA comes around,"The winding down of a 32-year-long low-grade armed struggle in Assam is on course. Following the declaration of a unilateral ceasefire by United Liberation Front of Asom chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa, the central government and the Assam government have signed a ‘suspension of operations' agreement with ULFA — what has been termed a “gentleman's agreement.” This is the first time ULFA has signed an agreement with any government and the expectation is that a substantive political dialogue will follow soon. ULFA's pragmatic approach, especially with regard to its longstanding but clearly untenable demand for “sovereignty” for Assam, has to be appreciated — even if it is clear that a combination of circumstances seemed to give it little choice. The central government's calibrated approach over the past few years was aided in no small measure by the tenacity, patience, and resolve shown by Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, who has led the State imaginatively over the past decade. The talking process took off once Mr. Rajkhowa and his associates landed in Indian custody, after being apprehended by the Bangladesh security forces: for this, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina needs to be given full credit.
Nevertheless, the peace process remains under the shadow of an unrelenting Paresh Barua, ULFA's ‘commander-in-chief' who is believed to be based, along with some cadres, in the unruly international border between Myanmar and China. However insignificant the threat they hold out may seem at this point, these elements will need to be brought round, or overcome. Trans-border linkages have aided and abetted militancy in the region for too long. The government also needs to be wary of a host of other insurgent groups in Assam and elsewhere in the region who may be biding their time; this calls for vigilance against opportunistic terror but also the avoidance of overreaction. Genuine reconciliation will require a far-sighted strategy of taking everyone along by ensuring the region's development, more effective legal protection for Assam's indigenous people, and generous leeway over issues of land and resources. The early efforts at rehabilitating some 600 ULFA cadre in special camps known as “Nabanirman Kendras” augur well for the process — although the militants' refusal to turn in their weapons does pose a problem. The agenda for the talks between ULFA and the central and State governments needs to be worked out meticulously — with due weight given to the popular perception that persistent under-development in the face of the region's rich resources is the outcome of a policy of discrimination and facilitating exploitation by outsiders. The best chance yet for enduring peace in Assam must not be squandered.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ulfa-comes-around/article2436590.ece
8,9,2011,"The sixth, in five years","The first question about Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda is: how long will he last? He is Japan's sixth Prime Minister in five years, and the third to assume the office since the historic victory of the Democratic Party of Japan in 2009. The promise of clean politics and good governance that came with the ousting of the Liberal Democratic Party — and with it a sleazy back-room style of functioning — appears to have all but faded from public memory. Instead, there is the uncertain economy, sharpened by the world's recession woes. Japan is burdened by a public debt of 225 per cent of the gross domestic product, high social security and pension costs due to an ageing population, and a shrinking work force. A strong yen threatens to hit exports. On top of it all, there is the daunting task of the nuclear clean-up and rebuilding after the devastating March 11 earthquake and tsunami. Prime Minister Noda's predecessor, Naoto Kan, had to step down following searing criticism of his handling of the disaster and the accompanying catastrophe at the Fukushima nuclear plant. Not surprisingly, the DPJ fared poorly in the April local elections. Mr. Kan survived a no-confidence vote in June, but promised to quit after seeing three pieces of legislation through the Diet in August.
Mr. Noda held the finance portfolio in the Kan cabinet, and advocated a tax hike to meet Japan's post-disaster public spending — a move opposed by his own party. One of the biggest challenges facing him is the task of playing the conciliator between the bitterly opposed factions within the DPJ. His election as Prime Minister showed how deep factionalism runs — Mr. Noda had to wrestle four other candidates off the mat, and he won only in a second round run-off. The DPJ's woes are compounded by the opposition LDP's control over the upper house of parliament, from where it has opposed all government policies. Prime Minister Noda has emphasised Japan's relations with the United States as “its greatest asset,” signalling his intention to strengthen the ties. The two previous Prime Ministers walked a tightrope between the perceived Japanese need for the U.S. as a guarantor of regional peace, and the growing desire to cut dependence on the superpower and improve ties with China and other regional neighbours. As for Tokyo's reservations about a civilian nuclear deal with New Delhi, these could have only got strengthened. Post-Fukushima, the Japanese want to reduce their dependence on nuclear energy. The new man in the job has to prove himself on many fronts before the next elections, due in 2013. That is, if he lasts until then.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-sixth-in-five-years/article2436591.ece
9,9,2011,Rebuild India's police forces,"Minutes after a bomb ripped through the Delhi High Court on Wednesday, India's politicians began sounding like an old broken record: the terrorists were “dastardly”; the attack was “cowardly”; the perpetrators would receive a “resolute response.” Terrorists are unlikely to be cowed by this. The sad truth is that not one case of urban terrorism since 26/11 has been solved, and there's a mounting body of evidence that suggests the alleged perpetrators of attacks prior to that are being tried for crimes they did not commit. Post-26/11, the counter-terrorism apparatus has acquired an alphabet soup of acronyms: the NIA (National Investigations Agency), the NCTC (National Counter-Terrorism Centre), and NATGRID (the National Intelligence Grid). The assumption seemed to be that technology and islands of excellence could substitute for the unglamorous business of building grassroots police capabilities and competence. The idea has failed. India's new systems for intelligence sharing are useless, for there is little intelligence to be shared; its new guns and listening devices have been rendered impotent by poor training and utilisation; and its forensic facilities are overstretched and under-skilled. Union Home Minister Chidambaram has pushed the States to hire substantial numbers of police in the hope of meeting chronic manpower deficits. But the battle won't be won by numbers alone: Bihar has a pathetic 74.29 police for every 100,000 residents, about a quarter of what it needs; Nagaland has a staggering 1,677.3 personnel per 100,000 population, almost seven times its requirement — but both are good examples of incompetent policing.
Even though policing is a State subject, there are three things the central government can — and must — do to kick-start police reform. First, it must prepare a template for nationwide standards of police training and competence, compliance with which must be regularly assessed. Secondly, India desperately needs world-standard institutions for police tactics and investigation to produce the core of instructors who can develop the capacities of State police forces. States do run training programmes but their syllabi and training methods are, for the most part, unsuited to real-world policing. Few police forces have in-house forensic facilities, language specialists, or intelligence analysts. Thirdly, India's higher security management must be drawn through a process that tests aptitude for the job. Professional competence must guide promotions and remuneration. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh spoke on Wednesday of a “long war” against terrorism. What the central government needs most is modesty: it must get back to the drawing board and start building the police forces the people of India deserve.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rebuild-indias-police-forces/article2439809.ece
9,9,2011,Turkey gets tough,"Turkey's decision to expel Israel's ambassador and downgrade its own mission in Israel to second-secretary level is a sign of the country's rising weight in the region. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is furious about Israel's refusal to apologise for killing eight Turkish citizens and one Turkish-American aboard the Mavi Marmara, the largest vessel in an aid flotilla attempting to break the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip in May 2010. Israel has offered only compensation and an expression of regret for the deaths. A United Nations investigation headed by Sir Geoffrey Palmer concluded that Israeli troops had used “excessive and unreasonable” force and that the government had offered no adequate explanation for “forensic evidence showing that most of the deceased were shot multiple times, including in the back, or at close range.” Turkey has suspended all defence-related dealings with Israel — which include buying weapons — and says it will go to the International Criminal Court to challenge Palmer's most controversial conclusion, namely that Israel's blockade of Gaza does not violate international law. Mr. Erdogan has even said that Turkish naval vessels will henceforth be “seen more often” in the Eastern Mediterranean.
What makes the current tensions different from many others in West Asia is the fact that Turkey has the political and economic weight to damage Israel. Ankara, which recognised the Zionist state in 1949, waived its veto so that it could join the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2010. Turkey is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), and a major regional ally of the U.S. This gives it some room for manoeuvre. The Erdogan government has suffered no sanctions for refusing to regard the elected Palestinian representative group Hamas as a terrorist organisation. Furthermore, Ankara can make life harder for ordinary Israelis by imposing tougher security searches on the thousands who, banned from several countries in the region, take their holidays in Turkey. Finally, Turkish influence in West Asia and North Africa could be decisive in the continuing U.N. negotiations on whether or not the issue of Palestinian statehood should be voted on at the world body. True to form, Israel's Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu does not seem to have got the message, and even public criticism in Israel has had no effect on his intransigence over the Palmer report. His fellow-citizens will discover the consequences the hard way.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/turkey-gets-tough/article2439811.ece
11,9,2011,Trouble for the Space Station,"It was in July 2011 that the last of the Space Shuttles, Atlantis, made the final trip to the International Space Station. With the Shuttles' retirement, only Russia's Soyuz spacecraft can transport crew to and from the huge station that is orbiting the earth. But with a question mark hanging over the Soyuz rocket that launches the manned capsule, there is a very real possibility that the station might have to be temporarily abandoned. The issue arose after a Soyuz rocket, which lifted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome on August 24, malfunctioned. The Progress cargo vessel it was carrying, with supplies for the space station, ended up crashing to the ground. The loss of those supplies is not a cause for concern as the station is well-stocked and can easily support the three Russians, two Americans, and one Japanese who are currently living aboard for several months. The problem is that the replacement crew, who are scheduled to leave for the station on September 21, is likely to be delayed while the Russians make sure it is safe for them to travel on the Soyuz rocket. But the astronauts on the space station may not be able to remain till the next crew arrive. That's because the two Soyuz capsules docked to the space station, in which they are to return home, are time-limited. Each of those capsules is certified to remain in space for only 200 days. Consequently, one set of three astronauts is now expected to leave the space station later this month and the remaining three in mid-November.
The Soyuz rocket is a lineal descendant of the launcher that carried the world's first satellite, Sputnik, and subsequently the first human to travel in to space, Yuri Gagarin. A production defect has been identified as the culprit in the latest failure. A week earlier, a Proton rocket with a communications satellite onboard developed trouble. Last December, another Proton rocket failed, followed by a Rokot booster this February. Some media reports suggest that poor pay, an ageing workforce, and inadequate state support are leading to a decline in quality standards in Russia's once well-funded space sector. After the Soyuz failure, the Russian government ordered an industry-wide review and improvement of quality control procedures. It is, however, clearly desirable to have an alternative to the Soyuz capsule and rocket, which can provide much-needed back-up. But it could take a few years for U.S. spaceflight companies, like Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX), to develop the necessary man-rated space hardware. Till then, Russia will have to shoulder the responsibility for taking astronauts to and from the International Space Station.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/trouble-for-the-space-station/article2444846.ece
11,9,2011,Signs of earliest life,"The latest fossil finds of microscopic life about 3.4 billion years ago in sedimentary rocks in Western Australia suggests that life began some 200 million years earlier than previously reckoned. Though a paper published recently in the journal, Nature Geoscience (“Microfossils of sulphur-metabolizing cells in 3.4-billion-year-old rocks of Western Australia,” by David Wacey et al.), does not claim them to be the oldest ones to have been ever discovered, the implications are clear. Assuming that the findings are correct, geologists might be a step closer to solving one of the greatest riddles — when did life first begin after the earth was formed some 4.5 billion years ago? They would also get a handle on the conditions that allowed primordial life to thrive. The authors have come across several lines of evidence that confirm the find to be truly microfossils. The foremost among them is the cell-like structures of similar size found in clusters. The microstructures also have uniform cell thickness, a hollow interior, and partially preserved partitions seen between adjacent cellular compartments. The presence of carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur in the cell walls clearly emphasises the biological nature. The presence of pyrite crystals associated with the microfossils indicates a possible sulphur metabolism by the life forms wherein sulphates are reduced to sulphides.
The compulsion to provide a wide range of supporting evidence arises because unearthing early life as old as a few billion years is a highly controversial field. For one thing, the number of sedimentary rock outcrops that retain the earliest traces of life intact is severely restricted. Even where these rocks have escaped metamorphism, most of the microstructures in them are deceptive. A controversial paper published in Science in 1993 reported the presence of filamentous microbes from Apex chert, just a few kilometres away from where the Nature Geoscience authors have found theirs. That the 3.4 billion-year-old microfossils from Apex chert belonged to the oxygen-breathing family of bacteria turned out to be the biggest sticking point. The fact that the identification of filamentous life forms were based solely on morphology proved to be its greatest failing. A 2002 paper in Nature based on re-analysis of the fossils using state-of-the-art techniques established that they are nothing but pseudofossils. This and a few other studies done in the recent past have brought to the fore the importance of undertaking geochemical analysis before declaring old microstructures as fossils. The current study has been well received but it would be unwise to conclude that the last word has been pronounced.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/signs-of-earliest-life/article2444847.ece
13,9,2011,Do not dilute the Bill,"The draft Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill 2011 circulated two months ago for public comments was a significant step forward but the amended version tabled in Parliament recently is two steps back. A thorough overhaul of the archaic Land Acquisition Act was overdue. To his credit, Jairam Ramesh, Cabinet Minister for Rural Development, proposed a new bill with progressive changes and put it up for public consultation. The draft had commendable features such as mandatory public discussion and enhanced compensation. It also had its share of shortcomings such as a dubious definition of ‘public purpose.' True to form, the United Progressive Alliance government has diluted the provisions that would have clearly benefited farmers. The most regressive move is the reduction of the compensation amount. Poor management of land records and the undervaluing of properties have been impediments to determining a just compensation amount. Much of the dissatisfaction and protest of farmers across the country has been on this account. Responding to this, the draft circulated for public discussion recommended increasing the registered value of a property six-fold in rural areas and two-fold in urban areas. Unfortunately, the bill tabled in Parliament has reduced it by one-third in rural areas, leaving the compensation amount unchanged in urban areas.
The draft was certainly more equitable. It not only tried to compensate landowners, but also proposed to extend the resettlement and rehabilitation benefits to all the tenants and agricultural labourers dependent on the land. The bill introduced in Parliament restricts the benefits to those who have been living or working in the place for more than three years prior to acquisition. Such a cut-off date is arbitrary and may keep a substantial number of people out. As past experience has shown, it also bristles with practical difficulties. The draft was particular about protecting fertile, irrigated multi-crop lands and prohibited their acquisition — but the bill allows for that. Though such acquisition is limited to a maximum of five per cent of the total irrigated multi-cropped area in that district, in terms of absolute extent this could get damagingly large, particularly in the bigger districts. Moreover, fertile lands can be acquired for private companies using this provision. If the UPA government presses ahead with these dilutions, it will be clear that all the rhetoric and posturing in Bhatta Parsaul and Singur were only for opportunist political gain. If it is serious about enacting just and defensible land acquisition legislation, the well-conceived provisions of the earlier draft must be restored.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/do-not-dilute-the-bill/article2447647.ece
13,9,2011,Look beyond Doha,"Despite attempts to carry it forward, the 10-year-old Doha round of trade talks has reached a moribund state. Although none among the 153 member countries of the World Trade Organisation has thrown in the towel as yet, there is very little chance of the talks reviving in the near future. WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy was putting it mildly when he said recently that the talks have reached a deadlock. But rather than pitch for a revival, the WTO and member countries having a vested interest in trade are keen on preserving the gains of multilateral agreements. And, why not? A successful conclusion to the Doha round would no doubt have boosted multilateralism. But since that seems impossible why not judiciously harness its principles in future trade talks. Multilateral trade has conferred many advantages in the past and is still extremely relevant. During the recent crisis, it helped in the smooth flow of goods and services between countries and in peaceful settlement of trade disputes. It also aided capacity-building in developing countries. At the present juncture, with the global economy limping towards recovery and many countries mired in sovereign debts, multilateral trade could be the only tool to fight poverty, generate employment, and counter the creeping protectionism in the developed countries.
The Doha round launched in November 2001 has had a chequered history, missing many deadlines over the past decade. Yet, at the very moment it is fading into oblivion, it is worth noting some of its achievements. The very fact that discussions were kept open for so long despite the seemingly irreconcilable positions of its members is a recognition of its intrinsic merits. It is a matter of record that trade negotiators managed to whittle down the many serious differences that cropped up. What let the Doha talks remain stuck was the lack of political leadership. Many countries have been moving away from the spirit of multilateral trade. For instance, several countries — India included — have shown a strong preference for bilateral “free trade” agreements which take less time to forge and promise almost immediate results. Experience suggests that these are second-best options and can only promote the hegemony of rich countries and distort trade policies. It is unfortunate that the failure of Doha talks will weaken the WTO itself. Member countries need to be convinced that despite the setback, the future lies in multilateral trade. It is in the fitness of things that the next ministerial meeting due to take place between December 15 and 17 at Geneva will be asked to draw a map for sustaining the multilateral system in future.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/look-beyond-doha/article2447648.ece
14,9,2011,Lessons from Paramakudi,"In any society with a history of caste oppression and conflict, the slightest provocation can sometimes set off a sequence of deadly attacks and reprisals. Law enforcement officers cannot prevent all acts of provocation, but what they can do is to anticipate and contain the resultant social tensions before they explode. Failure to do this at Paramakudi in Tamil Nadu proved tragic, with the protest by supporters of a Dalit party turning violent and the police opening fire and killing six persons. When a remark scribbled on a wall about Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar, who is revered as a reformer and saint by the intermediate caste grouping of Thevars, led to the murder of a Dalit schoolboy, it was clear there was going to be trouble. John Pandian, the leader of the Tamizhaga Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam, was understandably stopped from entering Paramakudi, but the police were unprepared for the consequences of their action. Opening fire reflexively on an angry group of people armed with nothing more than stones and crude petrol bombs was condemnable. Top police officers will have a lot to answer for before the Inquiry Commission constituted by the State government to inquire into the firing and related incidents.
For decades, certain rural areas in southern Tamil Nadu have been the battleground for ‘caste clashes' in which Dalits have been cruelly targeted by elements within the intermediate caste groupings. Dalits have certainly been at the receiving end of caste oppression — and have had to struggle and sacrifice to win rights to access public spaces, participate in temple rituals, and be free from humiliating casteist practices, which have survived from the feudal era notwithstanding Article 17 of the Constitution outlawing untouchability in all forms. With some heartening exceptions, the police and public officials have been far from even-handed in handling these grievances and demands. Thevars, sections of whom are as economically deprived as Dalits, carry their own resentments. From the time of the Mudukulathur riots in 1957, the triggers of violence have varied but the underlying reason has remained the same — entrenched caste oppression and the revolt against it, particularly by Dalit youth who are becoming increasingly organised by political groups. After a series of clashes in the 1990s, there was a lull for about a decade. The key lesson from the Paramakudi tragedy is that it was wholly avoidable. There would have been no loss of life had the early warning signals been heeded and well-thought-out and proportionate action been taken by the administration. The law enforcers need to be re-educated to change their ways of handling public agitations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lessons-from-paramakudi/article2450479.ece
14,9,2011,Not Djoking,"The stunning feat of winning at least three of the four Grand Slam titles in a calendar year has now been accomplished five times in eight years; it was achieved only thrice in men's tennis during the first 36 years of the Open Era. It was fitting that Novak Djokovic, who won his maiden U.S. Open title on Monday to complete the deed, defeated, in succession, the men who had preceded him: Roger Federer (2004, 2006, and 2007) and Rafael Nadal (2010). Djokovic's magical 2011, in which he has lost only two of 66 matches, has seen him rise to the top of men's tennis and set up a three-way dynamic. Federer, who was widely considered the best ever, has a clear problem against Nadal; and just as Nadal began to fashion a case for his being considered for the honour instead of the Swiss master, along came Djokovic. In the course of six straight victories over Rafa this year, the Serb has found his way into the Spaniard's head. Sport evolves in iteration. But perhaps never before in men's tennis have three of the finest, most dominant champions succeeded each other with such rapidity.
It's now apparent that Djokovic has elevated his game to a level only a few in the history of the sport, Federer and Nadal among them, have reached. Asked about his transformation from being a very good tennis player into one of the greats of the game, the 24-year-old said a change in attitude was key. He said he didn't believe he could consistently defeat Federer and Nadal in the past. But the loss in last year's U.S. Open final to Nadal and Serbia's subsequent triumph in the Davis Cup liberated him from the cares of failure. He also realised that a more aggressive style was needed to scale these heights. He made significant advancements in technique and fitness; the early success confirmed that the enhancements were working: the physical and mental aspects of his game drew from each other, creating the perfect storm. He knew he could stay with Nadal in the long rally: not only could he cover court as well, he could also hit with similar intensity in the later stages of the point. This protected him against the pressure to do too much too soon — a pressure every opponent of Nadal feels severely. Djokovic's relatively flat strokes, when compared with the topspin prevalent on courts around the world, have furthered his cause: they are not so much a unique challenge as a different one, but in a game of wafer-thin margins, change is often a determinant. Djokovic might have first come to attention as a prankster and a joker, but he has shown this year that his commitment to the business of winning is dead serious.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/not-djoking/article2450480.ece
15,9,2011,Love in the time of AFSPA,"Irom Sharmila's declaration that she is in love and will marry when her demand for the repeal of the draconian Armed Forces Special Provisions Act is met and she can call off her protest should shame the conscience of the nation. The 39-year-old Manipuri is about to complete 11 years of a hunger strike in protest against the AFSPA that gives security forces powers to kill with impunity. The United Progressive Alliance promised as far back as 2004 to replace the Act with a “more humane” law but has shown little interest in taking up the task in the face of opposition from the internal security establishment. Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram recently admitted there was no consensus within the government on the issue. Ms Sharmila's fast began on November 3, 2000, a day after security personnel shot down 10 people at a bus stand just outside Imphal. Within days, she was detained by the police. Since then, she has been nasally force-fed a liquid concoction of nutrients in a hospital, which serves as her prison. After every year in detention, she is released for a day and rearrested for attempting to commit suicide — because she refuses to call off her fast until the government repeals the legislation, which is in force in Manipur, Assam, Nagaland and parts of Arunachal Pradesh, besides Jammu and Kashmir. Hers may be the longest hunger strike in recorded history but it has generated little or no interest outside Manipur. In recent days, the attention Ms Sharmila has received in the wake of Anna Hazare's anti-corruption hunger strike has served to highlight her personal life. She comes out as a resolute but lonely woman, caught between her iconic importance to the struggle against AFSPA and her own only-too-human desire to lead a normal life. Her plan to marry, “after my demand is fulfilled” (as she told a newspaper), a British national of Indian origin who has been corresponding with her and who she has met once is remarkable testimony to her spirit.
But is Irom Sharmila being held hostage by the anti-AFSPA campaign? For their part, other leaders of the movement, who have long been depending on one woman's hunger strike to keep it going, are dismayed at the attention to her private life and suspect it might be a plot to break her and the campaign. If Ms Sharmila wishes to opt out of her chosen form of protest and return to normal life, others in the movement should allow her to do so with the dignity and solidarity she deserves. That will in no way be construed as a victory for the AFSPA. Ms Sharmila's peerless sacrifice, and the sacrifices of other Manipuris, in particular the Meira Paibi women who resorted to a naked protest to draw attention to the brutality of the security forces, are a big enough blot on the Indian state — one that can be washed away only by getting rid of the AFSPA.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/love-in-the-time-of-afspa/article2453501.ece
15,9,2011,Guatemala needs political guts,"Against a backdrop of 24 politically motivated murders since January 2011, a violent campaign, and a strong police presence during the poll, Guatemala's seven million voters have given the first round of the four-yearly presidential election to a retired general, Otto Pérez Molina, who promises a crackdown on crime, drug gangs, and corruption. With 98 per cent of the votes counted, the Patriotic Party's Mr. Pérez leads the tycoon-politician Manuel Baldizón of the Renewed Democratic Liberation Party (Lider) by 36 per cent to 23 per cent. The runoff will be held on November 6, and the new President will take office in January. The key campaign issues have been violence and insecurity. Mexican cartels are now involved in the drug gangs; 90 per cent of cocaine entering the United States crosses the Guatemalan border into Mexico and goes northwards; the murder rate is about a dozen killings a day. Guatemala is one of the most dangerous countries in the western hemisphere, and several provinces are under martial law. The violence has also hit employment in one of Latin America's 10 poorest countries. The voters seem to have responded more favourably to Mr. Pérez's promises of tough measures — he played a significant role in the 1990s in ending the country's 30-year civil war, which took a toll of 200,000 lives — than to his opponent's plans for enhanced welfare policies.
But this contest is also the making of fortuitous factors. The Supreme Court barred a strong contender, Sandra Torres Casanova, from running; the Guatemalan Constitution allows only a single presidential term, and Ms Torres's divorce from her husband, outgoing President Álvaro Colom Caballeros, was seen by the court as a stratagem to evade the law. Mr. Colom's centre-left National Unity of Hope Party then decided not to field a candidate. In the runoff, Mr. Baldizón is expected to benefit from the absence of a social-democratic rival. Whoever wins, the drugs policy will need more than tough talk. The ‘war on drugs' — the phrase was coined by U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1969 — may sound good, but the punitive strategy that followed was a disaster and Washington abandoned it in 2010. Fortunately, better models are available: Portugal, for example, has had considerable success with its 2001 law turning possession into an administrative offence while keeping trafficking as a serious crime. Guatemala's new President will need political courage to explore fresh cures to the country's life-threatening ailments.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/guatemala-needs-political-guts/article2453502.ece
16,9,2011,Funding health care,"Rising India’s lack of progress towards provision of universal, equitable health care for its people is distressing. The sidelining of the Bhore Committee recommendations of 1946 — which relate to ways and means of building a public-funded allopathic health system for the entire population — indicates the low priority given to public health in policy. The consequence of this disastrous neglect is that Indians have among the highest out-of-pocket expenditures on health anywhere. The Planning Commission is now considering a universal health insurance scheme. The goal is laudable but the premise is wrong. As the workshop of the Kolkata Group chaired by Amartya Sen pointed out in February 2011, influential policymakers seem to think that private health care with proper subsidies or private health insurance subsidised by the state can meet the challenge. This is unlikely to happen because of the asymmetry of information between providers and users, and the absence of patient empowerment. Moreover, costs and quality of care are poorly regulated. If the central government is sincere about building a strong health care system during the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-17), it must accept the primacy of public-funded provision, invest heavily in both preventive and curative spheres, and introduce strong regulation.
The High Level Expert Group on Universal Health Coverage headed by K. Srinath Reddy has the important task of prioritising the initiatives to be taken up during the 12th Plan. Universal health insurance is one stated goal. Here it is relevant to point out that some classes of citizens, such as children, the elderly, and women, can be comprehensively insured first. By focussing on these vulnerable groups, the National Rural Health Mission can take on an expanded role while new urban schemes can be launched to cut out-of-pocket expenditure substantially. There is also a felt need for oversight in the case of private health care providers. In the absence of benchmarking and scrutiny, hospital costs have hit patients hard. It is worth pointing out that the Affordable Care Act enacted last year in the United States emphasises patient rights through special provisions and mandates the spending of 85 per cent of large insurer premiums on actual care to prevent diversion to administrative overheads, salaries, and executive bonuses. Additionally in India, non-profit initiatives in health care can be invited to play a bigger role. Raising public expenditure on health to 2.5 per cent of GDP by the end of the 12th Plan will be a start; it needs to rise progressively. A cess to fund health care can scale up the effort rapidly.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/funding-health-care/article2456250.ece
16,9,2011,Unending game in Afghanistan,"If there is an overriding message from the Taliban attack on the United States Embassy and NATO’s headquarters in Kabul, it is that the tragedy in Afghanistan, scripted to a large extent by the Americans, is no nearer ending than it was two, five, or ten years ago. The U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan shrugged off Tuesday’s assault, which lasted 20 hours and left at least 11 Afghans dead, as “harassment rather than a direct attack.” He would. Over the last few months, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) has made out that it has successfully diminished the Taliban’s fighting capacities. Such spin enables the U.S. to claim a victory of sorts as some 30,000 of its troops are pulled out of Afghanistan, in keeping with the withdrawal President Barack Obama has promised by 2014. In some areas, including Kabul, ISAF has handed over to Afghan security forces. But Tuesday’s attack, and two previous attacks on well-protected high-profile targets in the Afghan capital — the British Council in August and the Intercontinental Hotel in June — have exposed the extreme fragility of the country’s security. It strengthens the hands of those who want western troops to remain in Afghanistan. There are bound to be fresh doubts now about the other part of the U.S. strategy — talking to the Taliban, or some sections of it. The U.S. accusation that the attack was the work of the Pakistan-based Haqqani network has only underscored the enduring complexity of getting to peace in Afghanistan, a full decade after “Operation Enduring Freedom” was launched in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
In these 10 years, the U.S.-led war has taken a horrific toll of civilian lives and welfare. In a report released in July, the United Nations estimated that the violence in the country claimed the lives of 1,462 non-combatants in the first six months of 2011. While the report attributed most of the deaths to “anti-government elements,” it held security forces responsible for 14 per cent of the deaths, with air strikes as the main killer. Even for a country that has known no peace for more than three decades, such high civilian casualties are difficult to absorb. Afghanistan’s double jeopardy is that the violence is certain to continue as long as western troops remain on its soil, but it has no mechanisms in place to ensure security and stability if and when those troops leave. The so-called end-game in anticipation of the American pull-out has only increased the bloodshed as the players — Afghan, regional, and international — compete to entrench themselves and outwit one another.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unending-game-in-afghanistan/article2456251.ece
17,9,2011,Shockingly insensitive,"Nothing is more reflective of the confusion and mix-up of priorities of the United Progressive Alliance government than the mismanagement of fuel pricing. While struggling to control inflation through monetary policy, the government sees no problem in allowing oil marketing companies to continually raise the price of petrol. The latest hike, by more than Rs.3 a litre, comes on top of the two substantial increases earlier this year. Although diesel price is still regulated, and remains unchanged for now, the repeated increases in the price of petrol have placed an enormous burden on the lower and middle income classes. The rationale for keeping the controls on diesel price is that any increase could affect agriculturists, freight carriers and public transport vehicles — but the unintended, and undeserved, beneficiaries of such a policy have been owners of high-end diesel cars and SUVs. On the other hand, owners of two-wheelers and small cars have borne the brunt of the escalating price of petrol. True, dual pricing for diesel is difficult to implement, but as suggested by the Centre for Science and Environment, other measures could be worked out to prevent misuse of the fuel by rich car-owners. What is clear is that the widening price gap between petrol and diesel has contributed to the rise in sales of diesel vehicles. According to CSE, diesel cars constitute 36 per cent of new car sales in India, and have disproportionately contributed to air pollution.
While grappling with the hardships of high inflation, most evident in the sharp rises in the prices of essential commodities, India's middle classes cannot afford the ballooning of their household budgets on account of recurrent petrol price increases. Nor are the poor spared the indirect effects. Waiting in the wings is a proposal to limit the number of LPG cylinders supplied to households paying income tax to between four and six a year. Although a meeting of the Empowered Group of Ministers that was to decide this issue on Friday was deferred following open opposition from the Trinamool Congress and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, indications are that the relief might be temporary. Political expediency, and not social commitment, seems to have stayed the hand of the government on this sensitive issue. Targeting subsidies is the name of the game, with the UPA government conveniently ignoring the fact that with social targeting, errors of exclusion are invariably high and the poorer and weaker sections often fall through the safety net. India still needs price controls on petroleum products if hundreds of millions of its vulnerable people are not to be exposed to sudden shocks.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/shockingly-insensitive/article2459837.ece
17,9,2011,Unrelenting focus,"In hiking the policy repo rate by 0.25 percentage point on Friday, the Reserve Bank of India is once again reinforcing its past actions in moderating inflation and anchoring inflation expectations. This is in keeping with the trend that began in March 2010 and has, including the latest hike, taken the policy rate from 3.25 per cent to 8.25 per cent in 12 doses. Yet even such sustained monetary tightening has apparently not been enough. Inflation remains the dominant macroeconomic concern, with the wholesale price index (WPI) rising to 9.8 per cent in August, from 9.2 per cent in July. Inflation rate in non-food manufactured products rose from 7.5 per cent to 7.7 per cent during the same period, suggesting strong and persistent demand pressures. The hike in petrol prices by Rs.3.14 a litre, effected on the eve of the policy statement, will have a direct impact of 0.07 percentage point on the WPI, not to speak of the indirect impact that will be felt only after a lag. Various consumer price indices have risen in the range of 8.4 per cent to 9 per cent in July. Food inflation remains stubbornly high despite a normal monsoon. What is clear is that the high food prices are not a temporary phenomenon but the result of a structural imbalance in demand and supply. Viewed in whatever way, inflation and inflation expectations remain well above the RBI's comfort level.
The official expectation is that inflation will start moderating, once the effects of past, cumulative action are felt. Any premature change in the monetary policy will be counter-productive and harden inflation expectations. The clamour for “a pause” in growth-inhibiting monetary tightening is countered by the argument that while growth has decelerated it has by no means collapsed. Indeed the GDP growth during the first quarter of 2011-12 at 7.7 per cent is only marginally lower than the previous quarter's 7.8 per cent. Besides, the RBI has conceded that a portion of the growth momentum will have to be sacrificed for the sake of price stability. The central government's finances have worsened during the first four months of the year. An even bigger worry comes from the developed world. The sovereign debt crisis in Europe is assuming menacing proportions. High unemployment and weak growth in the United States have prompted the authorities there to undertake some unconventional measures including an ultra-soft monetary policy. However, the weak demand from the developed world has not softened prices of commodities, including petroleum. As the volatile movements in the foreign exchange markets show, India has quite a task in managing its external economy in the face of mounting global uncertainty.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unrelenting-focus/article2459838.ece
19,9,2011,An excellent scheme,"In a pioneering initiative, the Tamil Nadu government is providing free laptops to students of government-run and government-aided higher secondary schools, arts and science colleges, engineering colleges, and polytechnic colleges. The scheme, which will cover 912,000 students this year at a cost of Rs.912 crore, is designed to give a major boost to Information Technology literacy. Social welfare programmes intended to increase enrolment and reduce dropout rates in schools are not new to Tamil Nadu, which was the first State to introduce a comprehensive nutritious noon meal scheme. Boys and girls in schools run and aided by government are being provided free uniforms and text books. From this year, under another novel scheme envisaged by Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, pupils in classes X, XI and XII will be given cash incentives to complete schooling. Even in this context, the free laptops scheme is exceptional — backed by a serious pedagogic effort, it could have a far-reaching impact on improving access to higher education for boys and girls from poor and needy families across the State. All higher secondary schools in Tamil Nadu have computer labs but students do not get sufficient exposure to computing, not to mention coding and programming. The free laptop scheme could open up a whole new world of knowledge-based opportunities to a generation of students who hope to do well in higher education and then in the job market.
As Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google, emphasised recently in his MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh International TV Festival, there is a need to reignite children's passion for science, engineering, and maths. “I was flabbergasted to learn that today computer science isn't even taught as standard in U.K. schools,” he told his British audience while recalling how the British Broadcasting Corporation in the 1980s not only broadcast programming for kids about coding but also shipped more than a million BBC micro computers into schools and homes. “Your IT curriculum,” he pointed out, “focusses on teaching how to use software, but gives no insight into how it's made. That is just throwing away your great computing heritage.” Taking a cue from this, Tamil Nadu can forge ahead by introducing computer science immediately after primary school. At present, only classes XI and XII have a structured curriculum in computer science; and though the School Education Department introduced it as a subject in class VI last academic year, intending to extend it up to class X this year, schools have not received textbooks or the syllabus. Equipping every school with the necessary infrastructure and appointing trained computer teachers should be the next big step towards achieving equity and universality in computer education.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-excellent-scheme/article2465338.ece
19,9,2011,German rift shows EU problems,"The German coalition government led by Christian Democrat Union Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing its most serious crisis since it took office in 2009. The issue also raises serious questions for the whole European Union. On the face of it, the CDU's problems have been precipitated by the Vice-Chancellor and Economy Minister Philipp Rösler, who heads the right-wing Free Democrat Party (FDP). This junior partner has defied Ms Merkel's directive against public discussion of the Greek economic crisis by arguing that Greece should be expelled from the eurozone. The third coalition partner, the Christian Social Union (CSU), has followed suit, calling for the expulsion of all highly indebted member states. Ms Merkel had ordered the silence on Greece with a view to minimising instability in the financial markets, which had been exacerbated by the apparent failure of recent talks between the Greek government and an international troika comprising the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and the European Commission.
The highly divisive German debate over the Greek crisis is primarily political in nature. The FDP's impressive vote share of 14.5 per cent in the 2009 general election has plummeted. In provincial elections earlier this year, the party lost its conservative stronghold of Baden-Württemberg to a Green-Social Democrat coalition, and lost all its seats in Bremen, the Rhineland-Palatinate, and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Party leader Guido Westerwelle stepped down in May. With its poll ratings now around 3 per cent, the party faces meltdown. For its part, the CSU, which has a majority to defend in Bavaria in 2013, may be distancing itself from Ms Merkel well in advance. After all, EU law does not permit direct bailouts of member states, and the prospective Athens bailout in fact stems from a Franco-German initiative. The German right therefore has some basis for complaining that prudent Germans are bailing out profligate Greeks. As for the Chancellor herself, she has tried only to quell market jitters and has said nothing about the ways EU institutions operate. The Greek budget deficit crisis occurred mainly because the EU's financial bodies failed to restrain the profligacy of the centre-right New Democracy government that was in power between 2004 and 2009. The European Financial Stability Fund, created in 2010, will do little to cure the deadly Hellenic ailment. The backdrop to the German right's opportunism and bloodletting is the deepening democratic deficit within key institutions of the EU.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/german-rift-shows-eu-problems/article2465339.ece
20,9,2011,Living through earthquakes,"As a natural calamity, powerful earthquakes are in a class of their own, able to strike without warning and capable of creating widespread devastation. So it was with the magnitude 6.8 temblor that struck near the Sikkim-Nepal border on Sunday evening. At least 66 people have been killed and many more injured in India as well as in neighbouring Nepal and Tibet, China. Buildings and roads in Sikkim have been badly damaged. Reports from Tibet speak of landslides disrupting traffic, power, and water supplies. Rain and landslides have hampered relief efforts, and the central government has sent in military and paramilitary units, along with aircraft and helicopters, to help the civilian authorities. Tremors from the quake, which could be felt hundreds of kilometres away, caused panic in many cities, including Kolkata, Patna, and Lucknow. In Delhi, which experienced a magnitude 4.2 earthquake near the Haryana border earlier this month, the latest episode left many with jangled nerves.
This quake should serve as a wake-up call. Earthquakes don't kill people, buildings do, goes the old adage. But human-made structures — buildings, bridges, power plants and so forth — can be designed and constructed to withstand the sort of quakes that might hit a place. An earthquake quickly exposes failures in construction. Valuable infrastructure is destroyed and falling masonry can crush people to death. “In recent earthquakes, buildings have acted as weapons of mass destruction,” remarked one leading seismologist after the calamitous quake that hit the Caribbean island of Haiti in January 2010, killing tens of thousands of people. Poor quality construction on the island made the earthquake twice as lethal as any previous magnitude 7.0 event. As the crustal plate bearing India steadily pushes against the Eurasian plate, some experts fear that enough stress might have accumulated to unleash a great earthquake in parts of the Himalayas. Such a quake could have disastrous consequences across the highly populated Gangetic plain. Nor are places away from the plate boundary necessarily safe. The powerful quake at Bhuj in January 2001, for instance, claimed thousands of lives and caused havoc across a considerable area in Gujarat. Safety lies in ensuring quake-resistant construction. The Bureau of Indian Standards has laid out earthquake engineering codes for various structures. In addition, the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) and the Union Government's Building Materials & Technology Promotion Council have published guidelines and brochures on quake-safe construction. Turning a blind eye to such safety requirements will extract a heavy toll when an earthquake strikes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/living-through-earthquakes/article2468142.ece
20,9,2011,Risky ways of global finance,"The immense debacle in the international derivatives trading desk of a major Swiss bank in London has once again drawn attention to the risky ways of global finance. The facts of the case, as reported, conceal more than they reveal about the risk-rewards system in large international banks. A 31-year-old trader of Ghanaian origin allegedly indulged in fraudulent accounting practices and concealed trading losses while working at UBS, London, his actions dating back to 2008. When these were detected last week, the “rogue trader” was accused of blowing a $2 billion hole in the bank's balance sheet. It is incomprehensible how a single individual, however well placed, could escape scrutiny by his peers and superiors over such a long period. Nor is it clear as to how the Swiss Bank will refurbish its tattered reputation, although there is a widely-shared view that UBS is strong and resilient enough to withstand the staggering loss. As with such debacles, the post mortem in this case will lead to making promises to shareholders, depositors, and national regulators of better vigilance and internal audit. Important as these are, they will still not address the basic malaise of today's globalised, international banks.
The globalisation of finance has altered traditional banking's core structure and values and that is why the latest dealing room debacle at UBS will have far wider ramifications. Banks traditionally do their best to match their assets and liabilities — to ensure that the money they borrow from depositors and markets matches the loans they issue. When there is a mismatch — the two could be in different currencies or at different maturities, for example — trouble often follows. Over the past few decades, global finance has been driven by an enormous mismatch between the two. Retail and private bank deposits from several countries have supported the expansion of leading banks into global markets. For all the benefits this meant for global trade and commerce, it resulted in a vast increase in risk-taking and a culture of paying extraordinary sums as bonus to managers that most outsiders find abhorrent. For its part, global financial regulation sought to put a lid on the quantum of bonus, hoping to reduce the levels of risk-taking by banks. But such efforts have not always been successful. The U.K.-based Independent Commission on Banking under Sir John Vickers has suggested the ring-fencing of the banks' retail operations to protect domestic deposits from being put at risk by the “casino” type culture of investment banks. That recommendation needs to be acted upon by other countries as well.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/risky-ways-of-global-finance/article2468143.ece
21,9,2011,No stopping the Palestinian tide,"The Palestinian Authority (PA) President, Mahmoud Abbas, has exposed a mass of contradictions in the positions taken by Israel, the United States, and major European Union countries by announcing that on September 23 he would submit to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon a letter requesting full United Nations membership for Palestine. The request will be based on the Palestinian borders as they obtained on June 4, 1967, that is, before the Six-Day War. The U.S. has already said it would veto the proposal in the Security Council, in which case Mr. Abbas will request the 193-member General Assembly to recognise Palestine as an observer state. While not amounting to full membership, that would mean a significant enhancement of Palestine's current “observer entity” status, which allows it only to maintain an observer mission at the world body. It would enable Palestine to bring actions in the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Court of Justice, and thereby call Israel to account for its conduct. Palestine would also be able to join a range of U.N. bodies, which it cannot do now.
In reaction, Israel is maintaining its refusal to stop illegal construction in the West Bank and other occupied territories, and now hardliners are calling for it to withhold customs revenues which it collects on behalf of the PA and passes on. The Netanyahu government seems unable to see that Palestine as a full U.N. member would also be responsible for any attacks, say from Gaza, on Israel, and that starving the Palestinians will only embitter them further, with the likelihood that support for their elected representatives, Hamas, will grow. The U.S. Congress, for its part, has threatened to stop aid to the Palestinians, but that will damage Washington's already diminished standing in West Asia and North Africa even further. As for the Middle East Quartet (the European Union, the U.S., Russia, and the U.N.), its frantic efforts to revive Israeli-Palestinian talks reveal, in particular, a failure to accept that the 1993 Oslo accords are now a dead letter. With the exception of Russia, the governments involved are flying in the face of global public opinion. About 140 countries in the General Assembly support the PA application to the U.N. One poll puts public support for it in Britain, France, and Germany at 59, 69, and 71 per cent respectively. Even in the U.S., according to another poll, 45 per cent back the bid while only 36 per cent oppose it. Israel and its allies are both trying to deny the justice of the Palestinians' legitimate aspirations and to hold back an unstoppable tide.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-stopping-the-palestinian-tide/article2470799.ece
21,9,2011,Commendable solidarity,"The stereotype about wealthy Indians living in the Gulf countries is that they lead lavish, kitschy lives and build ostentatious houses back home. That is unfair. A group of Indians recently pooled in more than Rs.9 million (729,000 dirhams) to secure the release of 14 compatriots jailed in the United Arab Emirates for causing death without intention (for instance, in a road accident or at a work site). Even though these men had served out their jail terms, the local courts ruled that they would not be released until they paid the victim's family anywhere between 100,000 and 200,000 dirhams as diyat, or blood money. In Islamic law, such a payment is made in exchange for a pardon from the family members of the victim. But these men, employed as manual labourers or in other low-paying jobs, had no means to pay the amount laid down by the court. It is commendable that the Indian Community Welfare Committee, encouraged by the Indian Embassy, decided to reach out to these men. It also assisted in negotiating individual settlements, so that in some cases, the families of the victims were willing to accept less than the sum decreed by the court. In another case, an Indian hotelier in the UAE paid a diyat of 3.4 million dirhams to the family of a Pakistani man, leading to the release of 17 Indians who had been arrested for his murder in 2010. Amnesty International had taken up the cause of the 17 men, alleging torture in custody and denial of due process.
A majority of the Indians who flock to West Asian countries are semi-skilled or skilled workers; they go in the hope that their earnings, considerably higher than the wages paid at home, will help the family they have left behind lead a better life. But working in a tough, alien environment, with its own set of rules, is not without hazards. Mistakes are bound to be committed, deliberately or unintentionally. Unscrupulous recruiters are known to fleece job-seekers and leave them stranded without travel documents or any other means to fend for themselves. When a worker finds himself in trouble with the local authorities, the sense of helplessness is acute due to the unfamiliarity with the environment and the language, and a lack of awareness about processes in that country and who to contact for help. The reflex is to look towards the Indian government for assistance. But there are limits to what a diplomatic mission can do to help in cases where the host country's criminal laws are involved. Influential members of the Indian community may be better placed to help in such situations, as the initiative in the UAE has shown.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/commendable-solidarity/article2470800.ece
22,9,2011,A necessary pause at Kudankulam,"The response of the State and central governments to the snowballing protest against the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project (KKNPP) has been marked by a sober realisation that popular fears over the safety of the nuclear plant cannot be ignored in the post-Fukushima era. Thanks to this attitude, the hundred-odd protesters who have been on an indefinite fast since September 11 are set to call off their agitation. The Tamil Nadu government has given them an assurance that its Cabinet would call for halting the project until the people's fears are allayed to their satisfaction. Chief Minister Jayalalithaa's letter drawing the Prime Minister's attention to the urgent need to allay apprehensions voiced by the people evoked an instant response. Dr. Manmohan Singh deputed Minister of State in his office, V. Narayanasamy, to meet the protesters at the venue of their fast in Tirunelveli district, and assure them that safety, rather than power generation, was the government's priority. Here is yet another opportunity for the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd., which is implementing the project, to bring on board the public at large, especially the local communities whose apprehensions have been compounded by fears stoked by traditional opponents of nuclear power, and assure the country of the safety and reliability of the two Russian-made reactors. At the expert level, there has not been any doubt that the design of the two VVER-1000 state-of-the-art reactors installed at Kudankulam is safe but the message has to be taken to the masses.
There is no reason, however, to believe that the AIADMK government is against the implementation of this long-delayed project that is expected to boost power generation in Tamil Nadu, which has been suffering from a serious power deficit. Post-Fukushima, it is unlikely that nuclear power projects anywhere in the world are going to enjoy unqualified support from local communities, unless all their concerns and fears are sincerely and transparently addressed. The nuclear establishment need not be dismayed by the obstacle thrown in its path just a few months before the KKNPP first unit was set to be commissioned. Instead, it should address the issue in a democratic manner and not let its traditional culture of non-transparency prevail. The bill introduced in Parliament to set up a Nuclear Safety Regulatory Authority has drawn sharp criticism on the ground that the new body will be captive to the government. Kudankulam offers India a new opportunity to meet the challenge of achieving the highest safety standards in the nuclear power sector — under the watch of a truly independent authority.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-necessary-pause-at-kudankulam/article2473749.ece
22,9,2011,Another assassination,"The assassination of Burhanuddin Rabbani, former President of Afghanistan and the head of the High Peace Council that is leading reconciliation efforts with the Taliban, has underlined that the prospects of peace in that long-suffering land remain remote. The manner of the killing, by a trusted visitor carrying a bomb in his turban, has an eerie resemblance to the assassination of Ahmed Shah Massoud of the Northern Alliance 10 years ago. Two men posing as television journalists killed the “Lion of Panjshir” two days before al-Qaeda carried out its horrific attacks on the New York Twin Towers. It was clearly a pre-emptive move to neutralise the Northern Alliance and deny the U.S. a strong ally on the ground in the military retaliation that would follow the 9/11 attacks. Rabbani's assassination is the most significant political killing since that of Massoud. With the Taliban and the Pakistan-based Haqqani network emerging as prime suspects, it is a massive setback to the peace process. An ethnic Tajik who headed the fragile and embattled Afghan government between 1992 and 1996, Rabbani was a hated figure for the Taliban. The feeling was mutual, but he had thrown himself into the efforts by the U.S. and President Hamid Karzai to bring the militants to the negotiating table. Only in June, Rabbani declared that the HPC's efforts had led to a breakthrough in contacts with the Haqqani network and the Quetta Shura. Even Mullah Omar, the Taliban supremo, made some interested noises. The 71-year-old Rabbani was also making overtures to Pakistan in an attempt to repair relations that had soured in the 1990s. The assassination revives doubts about the assumption that some Taliban are ready to do a deal with Washington.
Rabbani himself was not entirely convinced about the reconciliation project. His participation was most likely driven by fears of being left out of any settlement in a post-U.S. scenario. Both the U.S. and President Karzai saw him as vital to the challenge of bringing non-Pashtun groups on board. This task is bound to get more complicated as non-Pashtuns are now likely to turn suspicious about Taliban intentions. For India, the killing means the loss of an ally. Coming barely a week after the Taliban attack on the U.S. Embassy, this terror strike in an area described as the “Green Zone” of Kabul also nails the U.S. claim, as it withdraws troops from Afghanistan, that western troops have succeeded in weakening the militants. The American envoy in Kabul brushed off last week's attack as mere “harassment,” saying the traffic congestion in the Afghan capital was now the bigger headache. If only that were true.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/another-assassination/article2473751.ece
23,9,2011,A prince among cricketers,"Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, who passed away in Delhi on Thursday after a battle with interstitial lung disease, was the last of the princely cricketers. Born into privilege — his father, the Nawab of Pataudi, Sr., made a century on debut in Sydney in the first Test of the Bodyline series and was the only cricketer to represent both England and India in Tests — Tiger (as M.A.K. Pataudi was nicknamed) was a gifted and elegant batsman, a magnificent fielder, and a natural leader of men. Educated at Oxford's Balliol College, he took over as captain of the Indian side when he was just 21 — astonishingly, not long after losing vision in his right eye in a car accident. He went on to lead the country in 40 of the 46 Tests he played. Arriving at a time when India was a perennial underdog in the Test arena, he welded individual talents into a world-class team and led it with magisterial self-assurance and rare tactical nous. Sooner than anyone else, he saw that India must play to its strengths, which meant going all out with many-splendoured spin. His jaunty confidence and sanguine attitude rubbed off on his teammates and it was under Tiger that India achieved its first overseas Test series triumph — 3-1 against New Zealand in 1968. Hailed as a transformative influence on Indian cricket, Pataudi saw his star fading not long after. Ahead of the tour of the Caribbean in 1971, the chairman of the Selection Committee, Vijay Merchant, used his casting vote to replace Tiger with young Ajit Wadekar at the helm.
Wadekar justified the confidence placed in him by leading India to successive series wins in the West Indies and England — but Tiger was not one to give up. He made a characteristic comeback, first as a player and then as captain, leading India at home against the West Indies in the close-fought 1974-75 series. He ended his Test career with an average of just over 34 — but everyone recognised that in his case greatness could not be measured by statistics alone. Playing with one eye long before the helmet arrived to protect face and skull, Tiger was courage personified against fast bowling. There were times when his batting reached a level of subliminal beauty rarely matched by anyone in that era. More than his double hundred against England in New Delhi in 1964, or any of his five other hundreds, connoisseurs of the game will recall Tiger's 75 and 85 — made while nursing a hamstring injury in one leg — against Australia at Melbourne in the 1967-68 series. In his retirement, Tiger made valuable contributions to Indian cricket and his incisive and forthright views set him apart from many a temporising expert. Long before the TV boom gave rise to Indian cricket's cult of celebrity, Pataudi, on and off the field, was the real article — a debonair superstar without a peer.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-prince-among-cricketers/article2476838.ece
23,9,2011,The importance of archaeology,"Archaeology in India has progressively changed from antiquarian pursuit to rigorous science. Leading this transformation has been the Archaeological Survey of India. Since its establishment in 1861, it has been ‘digging and discovering’ precious historical sites, and ‘deciphering and describing’ thousands of important inscriptions. The 150th anniversary is an occasion for the nation to acknowledge the ASI’s commendable track record and reflect on its future. Alexander Cunningham’s 1861 memorandum to Lord Canning, which impressed on the colonial power “the supreme need” to undertake a systematic survey of monuments in India, led to the appointment of the first Archaeological Surveyor. Ten years later, the ASI became a distinct department, with a monthly budget of Rs.54,000. Since then, it has taken up important excavations at sites such as Kusinagara, which provided an archaeological basis for Buddhist history. It recovered the famous Lion Capital at Sarnath, which has become a part of the national emblem. It unearthed key evidence at the urn burial site at Adichchanallur, which spotlighted the unique features of the Iron Age in South India. The high point in the ASI’s history was the 1921 discovery of Indus Valley sites at Harappa (by Daya Ram Sahni) and at Mohenjodaro (by R.D. Banerji).
While epigraphy, excavation, and setting up site museums were part of ASI activities from the start, the periodic conservation of monuments and sites was taken up only from the 1940s. Here too, much of the work has been first-rate, with the magnificent preservation of the millennium-old Brihadisvara temple at Thanjavur standing out as an example. The ASI has shared its expertise with other countries and done significant work at Bamiyan and Angkor Vat. On the flip side, it has been able to protect only 3,676 historic sites, leaving an estimated 700,000 heritage structures unattended. If this huge deficit can be blamed on poor funding by the government and shortage of trained human resources, the delays in writing and publishing excavation reports and the loss of 35 nationally important monuments to encroachment represent serious professional failures. Another area where the ASI has not done well is in adopting cutting edge technologies for Archaeological Prospection. The way forward is to correct these deficiencies, provide more autonomy to the ASI’s regional circle offices, and do regular performance audits. Finally, the ASI must be encouraged to engage local communities in the protection of archaeological heritage, a strategy found to be rewarding in many countries.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-importance-of-archaeology/article2476835.ece
24,9,2011,IMF's dire warning,"The International Monetary Fund has a creditable record of spotting, and tracking, world economic recovery more accurately than most other global institutions. As such its prognosis has always been keenly watched. Hence its warning, first issued while launching the latest edition of the World Economic Outlook on Tuesday and repeated on at least three different occasions, that the global economy was in “the danger zone” ought not to be treated as a hyperbole. The onus of taking corrective measures is squarely on politicians round the globe, and not just on those in the United States who have displayed an amazing disharmony in sorting out key economic issues. As Indian experience too demonstrates, a fiscal policy that is dictated by political considerations cannot complement the monetary policy adequately to achieve key objectives, such as reining in inflation. The global growth forecast for 2011 has been marked down to 4 per cent from 4.3 per cent. That small decrease in percentage terms, however, does not fully reflect the fears and forebodings of the IMF, which stand reinforced by its Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR), released almost simultaneously with the WEO. The report serves as an early warning system and recommends policy action to stave off a crisis.
There are ample reasons for policymakers of both the developed and the developing countries to worry, as risks of financial instability have increased significantly in the past few months. The global financial crisis that began with the U.S. sub-prime loans and then morphed into a systemic banking problem with international implications is far from being resolved. The sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone countries represented the next stage. Now, there is a political phase where a consensus on fiscal consolidation and adjustment has been eluding the politicians on both sides of the Atlantic. As part of a three-pronged action plan for the developed countries, the IMF has called for a credible, medium-term fiscal adjustment plan. The U.S. should take steps to resolve the problem of overstretched household balance sheets through an aggressive restructuring programme. Thirdly, the banking sector in Europe should be fixed immediately, if necessary through infusion of capital. Developing countries need to avoid a further build-up of financial imbalances. In words that seem prophetic, the IMF has cautioned that countries such as India will face a sudden reversal of capital flows if foreign investors see their growth prospects petering out. In the post-crisis period, country risk assessments have become more important than interest differentials.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/imfs-dire-warning/article2479880.ece
24,9,2011,AIDS vaccine: a ray of hope,"The search for an effective AIDS vaccine began a quarter-century ago and after a series of failures, there finally appears some reason to cheer. The first signs of success are beginning to emerge, ironically, from a trial (RV144) that seemed destined to flop. The two vaccine candidates — ALVAC-HIV and AIDSVAX — used in the prime-boost trial conducted in Thailand from 2003 to 2009 failed in their prime objectives when each vaccine was tested individually. However, the trial, which involved more than 16,000 healthy volunteers, showed a statistically significant protection rate of 31 per cent in one of the three analyses performed. Further analysis of the trial data has revealed something more interesting. During an AIDS Vaccine Conference held recently in Bangkok, scientists reported the discovery of molecular clues that might have played a crucial role in the vaccine’s performance. Forty-one volunteers who received the vaccine and contracted HIV, and 205 others who received the vaccine but did not get infected with the virus, were chosen for some detailed investigations. Much to their surprise, the scientists found distinct antibodies that provided protection against or made the volunteers vulnerable to HIV infection. A Y-shaped immune molecule called an immunoglobulin G (IgG) was found in the blood of those who were not infected. It turned out that this molecule had the ability to recognise a particular portion of HIV’s outer covering and hence was able to confer better protection. On the other hand, another antibody (IgA) that recognised different portions of the HIV’s outer covering made people more susceptible. According to Nature, these people were 54 per cent more likely to become infected than those who did not have this antibody.
This is the first time a clinical trial has provided interesting leads that hold the promise of advancing AIDS vaccine research. Scientists are already planning animal studies to test the effectiveness of these antibodies. Three human trials using the same vaccines are also likely to start on a small scale in Thailand next year. The results from such studies may tell us if the antibodies caused the protection against HIV or if other factors played a role. But one thing is certain — the outer covering that conferred protection will become one of the most studied aspects of the virus. Only further trials in different populations can ascertain if the antibodies will be able to confer the same level of protection when used in other HIV vaccines and against other HIV strains. There is a ray of hope, but the need to temper optimism with caution stands out in a field littered with failures and disappointments.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/aids-vaccine-a-ray-of-hope/article2479881.ece
25,9,2011,Shaming numbers,"Among the many forms of gender inequality, perhaps the most insidious is the one related to the sex ratio. India ranks high among countries having an adverse sex ratio, with fewer women than men. The 2011 Census revealed a small improvement in the overall sex ratio, from 932.91 females for every 1000 males (in 2001) to 940.27, but a steep fall in ratio for the 0-6 age group, from 927.31 to 914.23. Now the World Bank’s ‘World Development Report 2012’ has come up with more shaming numbers. After China, India has the highest number of “missing girls” at birth, that is, the numbers that should have been born in keeping with the average world sex ratio at birth. It is small consolation that in India, the number of girls missing at age zero has come down marginally since 1990. The report, titled ‘Gender Equality and Development,’ notes that were it not for these two countries, an additional 1.2 million girls would have been born in the world (1 million in China alone). In both countries, the son preference — a clear cultural preference for boys — combining with the easy availability of technology to discover the sex of the foetus has resulted in sex-selective abortions, a phenomenon Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen terms “natal inequality.” The high numbers in India show that attempts to tackle female foeticide through a ban on sex-determination tests, imposed under the Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act, have been largely ineffective.
China and India also account for the highest excess female mortality after birth, that is, the numbers of girls and women who die prematurely. The disproportionate mortality of girls during infancy and early childhood is the result of discrimination and a lack of access to water, sanitation, and health facilities. In India and some other countries, complications of pregnancy and childbirth are the cause of excess deaths of women in the reproductive age. The World Bank report makes the telling point that “despite stellar economic growth in recent years, maternal mortality [in India] is almost six times the rate in Sri Lanka.” On the other hand, in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for 1.1 million missing women — a majority of them in the reproductive age group — the report notes the “dramatic” impact of HIV/AIDS on the increase from about 639,000 in 1990. From these and other numbers presented by the report, it is clear that, while more women are getting educated and entering the labour force, the gender gap stubbornly persists in vital domains. These gaps cannot be addressed unless it is first realised that gender inequality is not a women’s issue — and that it affects the well being of both men and women.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/shaming-numbers/article2484981.ece
25,9,2011,The Arab League resurfaces,"Amid the West Asian and North African turmoil, the League of Arab States has begun to raise its profile, a development that bodes well for the whole region. Prompted by popular uprisings, by the Nato-inspired attempt at regime change in Libya, and by the brutalities governments in the region have inflicted on protesters, a committee of the Arab Parliament, to which the League's 22 members send representatives, has recently taken public positions on several key issues. It has proposed suspending Syria and Yemen for their failure to heed popular demands for reform and for cracking down on democratic protests. Significantly, the League rules out any call for international intervention of the kind it opportunistically approved in Libya — where, without its agreement, the continuing episode of western military adventurism would have been extremely difficult in the first place. Tripoli, however, remains suspended from the Arab body.
The League now appears to be transcending some of its constitutional constraints. It has no supranational powers or enforcement mechanisms to support its broad objective of improving coordination among members on a wide range of matters, including military ones, and it cannot override national sovereignty. As a result, rivalries and disagreements between member states, and external exploitation of these, have at times rendered the grouping almost impotent. It has also been criticised as a body that serves dictators and despots, not ordinary citizens. In 2008, however, its Arab Charter on Human Rights, which is broadly consistent with other international rights instruments, came into force, and its recent expressions of concern over Syria and Yemen mark an important departure from its earlier silence on internal repression. The Arab League can become a genuine forum for the voices of the region's many peoples. Its potential for constructive engagement stands in contrast to that of the 57-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which bases its own Declaration on Human Rights in Islam on the Sharia law and has only just abandoned a 12-year campaign to have what it called the “defamation of religions” incorporated into international human rights law. The League now has a chance to widen and deepen its forward-looking concerns — and to remind member-governments that progress towards democracy founded on the protection of human rights is a key element in political stability. That, in turn, will give greater weight to its members' calls for the creation of a Palestinian state. In sum, the Arab League's enhanced standing must be welcomed as a positive factor for the region and the world.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-arab-league-resurfaces/article2484982.ece
27,9,2011,Valuing biodiversity,"Countries endowed with genetic resources contained in rich flora and fauna will welcome the addition of 19 party-signatories to the Nagoya Protocol, which forms part of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. India has been a votary of the accord, which aims at promoting fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources, and informed, agreed terms of access to such wealth. The protocol also applies to traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources and the benefits flowing from their use. What is important is that the 61 countries that have signed on so far, and others that may follow, must ratify the text of the Convention, for it to enter into force. Once operationalised, it will provide a framework for the drafting of domestic laws in member states. Such legislation is necessary to ensure the transfer of benefits to communities that have nurtured natural resources. India has launched a domestic process under the Biological Diversity Act to document, regulate, and manage its genetic resources. But it has a long way to go in creating comprehensive documentation and involving local communities as stakeholders.
The Nagoya Protocol assumes importance in a globalised era of intensive exploitation of natural resources for commerce. Several requests are made to governments for the transfer of genetic resources abroad for research. Often these efforts are sponsored by corporates, particularly in the area of plant genetics for agriculture. It is vital that India strengthens its regime of access and benefit-sharing in such a scenario, a goal that can be aided by the Nagoya Protocol. What must be emphasised here is the importance of protecting the rights of farmers and traditional communities to extant natural resources, avoidance of restrictive patent regimes in agriculture, and the equitable sharing of proceeds of beneficial research. The danger of allowing one-sided commercial exploitation of genetic resources, such as pathogens for vaccine production, was underscored last year by Union Minister Jairam Ramesh who was holding the Environment portfolio at the time. This would merely aid for-profit activities at the cost of the host nation. India, which is scheduled to host the UN Biodiversity summit in 2012, must persuade all industrialised nations, which have a major stake in the plant and other genetic resources of the world, to ratify the Nagoya Protocol and make it a meaningful international instrument.

27,9,2011,Saudi women gain little,"King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has stirred interest with his September 25 announcement that women would have the right to vote in future municipal elections and would be able to contest as well. Women are also to have seats in the Majlis Al-Shura, the body consulted by the King on a range of public policy issues. The new law is to take effect in the 2015 municipal polls. Campaigners have attributed the King's move to the courage of Saudi women themselves, to Saudi social media, and to the effect of the continuing popular uprisings across West Asia and North Africa. In fact, this modest extension of the franchise to women will be in accordance with a law made in 2005 but never implemented. One of the stated reasons for non-implementation was that there would be problems in running segregated polling booths. In any case, the 2008 elections were postponed to 2009 and then did not take place at all. This time, the Majlis itself seems to have played a part by reviving the issue of women's suffrage. While it has always been able to summon officials and request access to official documents, its powers have been gradually extended, and it can now propose and amend legislation without the ruler's prior approval.
The King's announcement might be viewed as an overdue recognition of what should be treated as an inalienable human right — but the move is not all it might appear to be. The hardline Salafist clergy who form the country's ulema have, according to the ruler, endorsed this limited form of women's suffrage. The clerics have little to fear at present. The municipal councils are virtually powerless, and even if women can stand for office they will find it extremely difficult to campaign or even to get to the polling stations (as they are banned from driving, not by any written law but by a fatwa). As for the Majlis, it is in no sense a representative assembly, as it is appointed by the King. In contrast, challenges to the driving ban have provoked far stronger reactions, with several women being stopped and questioned; some, clearly under duress, have signed promises not to drive again. The clergy's differing reactions to the issues expose the mutual dependence of the hard-boiled clerics and the royal family. The former, who are suspicious of the more liberal royals, provide the House of Saud with spiritual legitimation in a deeply conservative society. The latter ruthlessly suppress any expression of ideas that implies a departure from Salafist orthodoxy. The two dominant Saudi Arabian institutions evidently fear democracy and equality even more than they fear women at the wheel.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/saudi-women-gain-little/article2490894.ece
27,9,2011,The rupee under pressure,"Amidst the turmoil in the stock markets, one might choose to underrate or even ignore the significance of the sudden volatility in India's foreign exchange markets. That would be unfortunate. The rupee's steep fall against the dollar, after a fairly long period of stability, is a development that has major implications not just for exporters and importers but for the macroeconomy. The sharp declines in both the stock markets and in the rupee's external value, interrelated as they are, have some common features. With the global economy pushed to the brink by the persisting sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone countries, the uncertainty in the global financial markets increased as a natural consequence. Last week, there was a huge sell-off in the stock markets around the world, including India. At the global level, there is a strong demand for dollars as a safe haven. Ironically, all the troubles the United States is facing — a sharply lower-than-expected economic growth, persistently high unemployment, and fractious politics — have not dimmed the lustre of the American currency. Heightened risk-aversion, which is a direct consequence of the global crisis, has caused investors to liquidate their assets in what they perceive to be riskier markets and repatriate the money to safer destinations. Consequently, the demand for the dollar from exiting foreign institutional investors has risen in India, pushing up its price. In times of great uncertainty as now, it is not the prospect of better return but safety that drives investment decisions.
On Monday, the rupee traded around Rs.49.60 to the dollar, perilously close to the psychologically important Rs.50 mark. In the current phase of rupee depreciation, the RBI does not appear to have intervened aggressively, possibly because it wants to conserve its firepower for a future contingency. The foreign currency reserves at around $318 billion may be comfortable, but not sufficient for a long-drawn campaign of intervention. Besides, the negative sentiment is driven entirely by global factors over which the RBI has no control. Also, the growing dependence on short-term flows and the widening current account deficit might neutralise the impact of intervention. As a rule, a depreciating rupee is good for exporters. But this time, the swing is so sudden and sharp that the exporters were, probably, caught off-guard. In any case, many of them would have hedged their positions. These explain why there has not been an adequate supply of dollars in the domestic market. But the truth is that exporters, like importers, prefer stability in exchange rates. The chances are that exchange rate management will be more challenging in the days to come.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-rupee-under-pressure/article2487647.ece
27,9,2011,"A malady, not a crime","Are people who attempt to put an end to their lives criminals? Yes, says Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code 1860, condemning “whoever attempts to commit suicide” to “simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.” The obsolete provision flies in the face of modern and humane approaches to suicidal behaviour, which regard those who suffer from this malady as people in need of care, support, and rehabilitation. We now know that suicidal behaviour is determined by a complex matrix of factors including personal experiences, psychological history, the socio-cultural environment, and genetic make-up. The central government's decision to initiate steps to delete Section 309 is certainly overdue. The Law Commission of India recommended its repeal as early as 1971 and, once again, called for decriminalising the attempt to suicide in its 210th report in 2008. As it pointed out, this inhumane provision, which is a form of double punishment, remains on the statute books only in a few countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Singapore, besides India. The view that decriminalising the attempt to suicide will encourage people to take their own lives has no basis. As the International Association for Suicide Prevention has pointed out, there is nothing to show that suicide rates have increased following decriminalisation; in fact, the converse may well be true as decreasing suicide rates in some countries can be related to the medical and psychological help people who attempt suicide turn to in the absence of fear of being penalised by the law.
It is important to stress here that deleting Section 309 does not absolve the state, public authorities, and society at large of the responsibility to prevent suicides. It is the duty of the state to protect and preserve human life, and it can be argued that Section 306 of the IPC, which penalises the abetment of suicide, casts an obligation on public authorities to prevent the loss of life that may result from such acts as fast-unto-death. Upholding the constitutionality of Section 306, the Supreme Court of India observed it was a distinct provision that existed independently of Section 309 ( Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab, 1996). In the United Kingdom, the last European country to decriminalise the attempt to suicide, the Suicide Act of 1961 holds people criminally liable for aiding, abetting, and counselling the suicide of another. Decriminalisation is a recognition that suicide is a complex problem with psychological and social dimensions. As the Supreme Court observed, it is decidedly not a manifestation of a base criminal instinct.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-malady-not-a-crime/article2487648.ece
29,9,2011,Crisis in U.S.-Pakistan ties,"The accusation by the United States that the Haqqani network is “a veritable arm” of the Inter-Services Intelligence seems to have hardly embarrassed Pakistan. Instead, following the pattern of defiance that it has shown since Osama bin Laden's killing, the Pakistan Army has made clear it will not subordinate its strategic interests to those of the U.S. But this new crisis in a rocky marriage may yet pass. The U.S. blames the Haqqani network, a faction of militants allied to the Afghan Taliban and based in the North Waziristan frontier region of Pakistan, for the recent attacks in Kabul. This includes the killing of former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani and the attack on the U.S. Embassy some days before that. The July 2008 attack on the Indian Embassy in Kabul was also traced to the Haqqani network. Islamabad is correct in saying it was the CIA that nurtured Jalaluddin Haqqani — the leader from whom the group takes its name — during the anti-Soviet war in Afghanistan. But that is half the story. The Pakistan military's embrace of the CIA-Saudi-funded jihadists for its own goals in Afghanistan and against India is of no less relevance to the unending tragedy in the region. As the Pakistan security establishment prepares for the so-called end game in Afghanistan, it sees the Haqqani group as its best insurance policy against being sidelined — and importantly, against the rise of Indian influence over its western neighbour. The generals in Rawalpindi are confident that the superpower has no choice but to remain dependent on Pakistan to ensure a semblance of peace in Afghanistan and, by extension, in the whole region.
Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar's articulation of the message that the U.S. risks losing an ally with its allegations shows that even if the civilian dispensation is at variance with the security establishment, its political space is limited. Rightfully, the All Parties' Conference called by Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani should question the army's continuing links with militants and the internal risk this poses. But the track record of such initiatives, undertaken each time the Pakistan Army finds itself in hot water, shows that they end up endorsing the security establishment and its misguided strategies. Pakistan's ability to stand up to a superpower patron would have been admirable were its agenda clean. All this might be a source of anxiety to India, which depends to an extent on Pakistan's influential allies to force it to rein in groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba. Even so, New Delhi must work to discourage any precipitate action by Washington against Pakistan that may put the entire region at risk.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/crisis-in-uspakistan-ties/article2494310.ece
29,9,2011,Miliband senses the mood,"Ed Miliband, leader of the British Labour Party, has, on the occasion of the party's annual conference, made a speech that signals a significant departure from the ‘New Labour' vision of the Blair-Brown era (1994-2010). Speaking in Liverpool, Mr. Miliband addressed a national mood of uncertainty and fearfulness about the future, in which ordinary people feel that they are at the mercy of forces and institutions they cannot control and which are indifferent to their fate, and feel further that the rapidly increasing inequalities in British society are threatening Britons' very sense of who they are. Among other things, the Labour leader attacked the Conservative-led coalition government for proposing to cut the maximum tax rate of 50 per cent for those earning over £3000 a week; for planning to cut corporation taxes for banks; and for raising university fees to a level that will leave all but the richest students tens of thousands of pounds in debt.
Such moves took courage, as they were guaranteed to draw fire from the Tory-supporting majority of the national press. Mr. Miliband, however, knows that many of the worst features of the last three decades, such as the banking crisis (after which the public bailed the banks out to the tune of almost £1 trillion), rigged markets, the MPs' expenses scandal, and the phone-hacking by journalists, have created a “something for nothing” culture in which the predatory and the unscrupulous deprive the honest majority of the things they deserve. The Labour leader was as sharp about poorer people's illegalities and exploitation of state benefits as he was about the plunder at the top, notwithstanding the differences in scale at the two ends of the system. As for detailed policies, these cannot normally be expected on such occasions but Mr. Miliband indicated potentially major new approaches to political economy, including workers' representation on committees that decide directorial pay levels, greater emphasis on ethical conduct in business, and rewards for firms that invest for the longer term. These amount to more than just policy directions stated in the Labour leader's customary low-key manner. They show Mr. Miliband's quiet strength and confidence both in his sense of public feeling and in the best features of British social democracy. What they also reveal is his vision of a very different kind of society from one founded on the self-seeking ethos created by neoliberalism and its retrograde social values. On available evidence, the British public, with 70 per cent willing to consider voting Labour, share that vision.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/miliband-senses-the-mood/article2494311.ece
30,9,2011,Diabetes alarm,"New data on the population-level prevalence of diabetes in India underscore the need for a major public health initiative aimed at prevention and control of the condition. Small-scale studies highlighted the problem earlier, but the just-out results of the first phase of the Indian Council of Medical Research-INdia-DIABetes (ICMR-INDIAB) study in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, and Chandigarh present more robust evidence that diabetes is growing in urban and rural areas. The scale of the challenge is clear from what is now empirically established. In just three States and one Union Territory, the number of people classified as pre-diabetic is an estimated 14.73 million, and 11.88 million are confirmed to be diabetic. These groups represent a significant percentage of the total population. Diabetics form 10.4 per cent of the total population in Tamil Nadu, 8.4 per cent in Maharashtra, 5.3 per cent in Jharkhand and 13.6 per cent in Chandigarh. For pre-diabetics, the percentages are 8.3, 12.8, 8.1 and 14.6 respectively. It is reasonable to assume that the story is not very different in demographically similar States and future data are likely to confirm that. Going by medical evidence, a quarter of the patients with diabetes are at risk for coronary artery disease, eye and kidney damage, foot complications, and the like. These trends are bound to increase disease burdens and health care costs over time.
The policy imperative is to identify those at risk through established protocols, initiate prevention strategies, and offer good health care to diabetics. Data from the ICMR-INDIAB study demonstrate that periodic screening can reduce the ratio of new cases of diabetes to known cases. Tamil Nadu fares the best in this regard among the States studied, which points to higher public awareness. A significant finding is that urban residents in all the States had higher Body Mass Index, waist circumference, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and also a higher prevalence of diabetes, than residents in rural areas. Many studies have shown that lifestyle modification plays a major role in preventing the onset of diabetes in pre-diabetics, who have Impaired Fasting Glucose or Impaired Glucose Tolerance. Treating diabetes involves a much lower cost than managing the serious complications that set in later. The ICMR-INDIAB study presents a more complete picture of diabetes than what has been available at the population level. The insight it provides must inform public health policy. The way to go is to facilitate low-cost testing and expand specialised treatment. In parallel, governments must promote healthier lifestyles through an effective and innovative mix of policy measures.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/diabetes-alarm/article2497770.ece
30,9,2011,French Senate goes left,"For the first time since the Fifth Republic was founded in 1958, the French political left have won an absolute majority in the Senate. In elections held on September 25, a broad front, ranging from the Communist Party through the Socialist Party (PS) to the Europe Ecologie-The Greens (EELV) and left radicals, gained 175 of the 348 upper chamber seats. The Socialist Party, which now has 127 Senators, is their single largest contingent. The French right, which has traditionally dominated this house, has been badly shaken by the loss of several stronghold seats, including Loiret in north-central France. The Senate is elected by a college drawn from the lower tier assemblies, namely those of the regions, cantons, and municipalities. Across the country, the left have won heavily at all those levels during the last three years and, as municipal councillors comprise 95 per cent of the electoral college, the Senatorial left will now have much greater weight in its dealings with the President. It will be able to direct Senate powers towards controlling the executive, especially by using commissions of inquiry. It will be able to propose legislation, although the lower house, the National Assembly, which is still controlled by President Nicolas Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), retains the last word in the legislative process.
The result reflects the public mood in France, the strength and depth of broad left opinion at the grassroots level. As for the clout this provides, the leading Socialist Party Senator, Jean-Pierre Bel, says his party does not intend to be obstructive — but will use the Senate's constitutional powers to the full. The political climate is therefore likely to change significantly. President Sarkozy, who has seven months left of his five-year term, is already in serious trouble. He is beset with corruption scandals, including allegations of illegal party funding obtained through kickbacks in arms sales to Pakistan. He is trying to revive a foreign policy mired in the Libyan sands by his own adventurism. His poll rating of 37 per cent, although slightly up owing to the intensification of his anti-immigrant rhetoric, cannot conceal his overall unpopularity. While the Socialist Party still has a lot of work to do before next year's presidential election, the capture of the Senate has reinvigorated the French left. The radically altered membership of the upper house can give Mr. Sarkozy a very rough ride from now on, thereby ensuring that the Socialist candidate has an advantage when French voters choose their next President.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/french-senate-goes-left/article2497772.ece
1,10,2011,"Justice, at last","In many ways, Vachathi was a test case: not so much for the judiciary as for India's social conscience. In June 1992, this tribal hamlet in northern Tamil Nadu was witness to what brutal law enforcers and callous government officials could do to the poor and the powerless. Women were raped, men were assaulted, houses were looted and destroyed, and cattle were killed, all in the name of upholding law, of preventing the illegal felling and smuggling of sandalwood. The planned, systematic attack on Vachathi was carried out quite brazenly. The 269 persons arraigned as accused by the Central Bureau of Investigation must have thought that they could get away with crimes against the hapless villagers, who were offenders in the eyes of the law. Nothing else can explain the seeming impunity with which they went about the assault on the village. While men in the lower ranks indulged in violence, senior officers watched from a distance. The subsequent attempts at denial and cover-up were indicative of sanction for the attack from elements at the higher levels of the government. That the tribals of Vachathi slowly found their voice in the face of such repression, and fought for justice in the courts during these 19 years with support from social and political organisations and human rights activists, is reflective of the strengths of a democratic society, notwithstanding its obvious inequities and deficits. The wait for justice might have been long and tiresome, but was finally rewarding. That people's struggles can have a decisive impact on the course of justice was clearly demonstrated in the Vachathi case.
But what is worrying is that such attacks can happen in the first place. Those given charge of enforcing the law often see themselves as above the law. Uniformed forces, especially, think nothing of trampling on the rights of ordinary citizens. Misuse of power and abuse of authority are seen as perks of office. Security personnel and government officials are themselves steeped in social prejudices, and tend to show little respect for the rights of those lower down in the societal hierarchy. The correct lessons must be learnt from Vachathi. The verdict of the district and sessions court, holding all the 215 surviving accused in the case guilty of various atrocities, should serve as a reminder that the rule of law will have to be upheld everywhere, including in the remotest of villages. Atrocities and violations of rights anywhere shall not go unnoticed, and there can be no refuge for the law-breakers, especially for those from among the law enforcers. Civilised India cannot afford a repeat of Vachathi.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/justice-at-last/article2500974.ece
1,10,2011,Angela Merkel's moment,"After the recent annual IMF-World Bank meetings in Washington, which brought together finance ministers and central bank governors of member countries, the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis is not any nearer a solution. Despite considerable pressure from other members, the leading European countries failed to draw up a specific bail-out plan that could stave off default by one or more eurozone countries. That is particularly unfortunate. Recent developments have conclusively established that the eurozone is not an island. Its fast-escalating problems can hardly be confined to its geographical boundaries, let alone the continent's periphery, as was imagined earlier. It is clear that the consequences of a sovereign default will have global ramifications. Even the more optimistic of predictions points to a banking-led liquidity crisis in the aftermath of a default by Greece. As banks dump their holdings of sovereign debt and pull back their loans, the global economy will face a severe credit crunch. Unemployment will rise and, along with it, social unrest. Large banks will cut back on their exposures even to countries not directly involved in the crisis. The U.S., already witnessing anaemic growth, will be dragged into a double-dip recession. The euro, as a currency, could be a significant casualty.
None of these need happen if the eurozone countries had a credible plan of action and, equally importantly, dynamic leadership. Much was expected from Germany, the eurozone's strongest and most influential economy, the very foundation of the euro and the only member with the necessary resources and stature to sustain it. Yet over the past two years, as Greece followed by Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy tumbled into a crisis, Germany has been a reluctant member of the rescue team, clearly unwilling to commit to the costs of deeper fiscal unity in the eurozone. One reason for Germany's inhibitions has been the way the monetary union — comprising 17 members, each with different goals and interests — stands organised. Every member has a veto and important proposals such as augmenting the European Financial Stability Fund need to be approved by their Parliaments. Political opposition to a greater integration has been the strongest in Germany. Although the ruling coalition lost in some recent state elections, the Bundestag vote that Ms Merkel convincingly won on Thursday to increase Germany's commitment to the eurozone rescue fund is clearly a measure of her own domestic political strength. Whether that delayed action will be enough to shore up the euro and the many wobbly economies on the continent is yet another matter.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/angela-merkels-moment/article2500976.ece
2,10,2011,"Al-Awlaki, al-Qaeda and drones","The killing of Anwar al-Awlaki in a drone attack in Yemen shows the extent to which the C.I.A has succeeded in putting together an effective intelligence gathering system on the ground to track al-Qaeda's leadership. It is the second important catch for the United States after the killing of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan earlier this year. Awlaki had been on the C.I.A radar ever since a U.S. military doctor killed 13 fellow soldiers at a Texas military base in 2009. Immediately before that incident, the medic had exchanged emails with the American-born Yemeni cleric who lived and preached in the U.S. until 2002. Awlaki was said to have inspired others arrested in the U.S. for terrorist plots, such as the Nigerian ‘underwear bomber,' and the Pakistani-born Times Square bomber. He was also linked to the 2010 airline parcel bomb, and though he was never named in the 9/11 attacks, three of the bombers were said to be in frequent contact with him. President Barack Obama has described him as the chief of “external operations” of “Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.” But his role was more of a propagandist whose fluent English and insider knowledge of the west appealed to the young American and British Muslims al-Qaeda sought to radicalise and recruit. Also killed in the attack was another American citizen, Samir Khan, who was the editor of al-Qaeda's magazine Inspire. More than Awlaki's elimination, the gain for Washington would be the panic and insecurity that the manner of his killing is likely to have created in the top al-Qaeda leadership: from a Hellfire missile fired by an unmanned plane that had the information to pinpoint his location exactly as he travelled with companions across a desert in North Yemen.
Believing the al-Qaeda's Yemen operations were now a bigger threat than what was left of it in Pakistan, the C.I.A sought to expand its covert war against the group by building a secret base in the Arabian peninsular region earlier this year. Awlaki's killing would seem to be a fairly quick payoff. As Pakistan and Yemen are thought to cooperate in the C.I.A's drone operations, the question of U.S. violation of the national sovereignty of those countries finds no resonance in the world today, despite the dangerous precedents it sets in international relations. It is ironical that Awlaki's killing has drawn protests against the Obama administration's denial of due process to an American citizen. Something is clearly wrong if American rights activists can work up so much outrage on behalf of a fellow citizen linked to al-Qaeda but not for the innocent civilians who perish in C.I.A's drone attacks in Pakistan.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/alawlaki-alqaeda-and-drones/article2506677.ece
2,10,2011,Necessary but not good enough,"A political declaration adopted recently by more than 30 world leaders and 100 senior Ministers at the United Nations General Assembly is a welcome first step in tackling four non-communicable diseases (NCDs) — cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes. The declaration calls on all governments to “advance the implementation of multi-sectoral, cost-effective interventions in order to reduce the impact of the common NCD risk factors without prejudice to the right of sovereign nations to determine and establish their taxation policies, other policies, where appropriate.” Unfortunately, the consensus declaration is a let-down when it comes to committing to robust measures, including legislation, for taming the risk factors related to the NCDs. Evidently, pressure from the food and beverage industry on the governments of some rich countries stymied forward-looking efforts to discourage the consumption of unhealthy food and to regulate harmful market practices. We know that policy-led solutions aimed at the prevention and control of NCDs by taming the risk factors do work: this can include banning a practice, product or ingredient; mandatory labelling; or limiting the quantity of an ingredient in a product. Ban on smoking at work and public places and mandated pictorial warnings on tobacco products have produced good results. WHO Director-General Margaret Chan did well to demand full implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and call on the heads of state and government to “stand rock-solid against the despicable efforts of the tobacco industry to subvert this treaty.”
Dr. Chan also did well to speak out against “processed foods, very high in salt, trans-fats, and sugar,” which were “readily available and heavily marketed” and had become “the new staple food in nearly every corner of the world.” Trans-fat increases the risk of cardiovascular disease but the food industry loves it because trans-fat extends the shelf life of products. Denmark took the first bold step in 2003 by banning it; Austria and Switzerland followed in 2009, and a few more countries are likely to mandate a reduction or complete elimination of trans-fat. Salt and sugar cannot be completely eliminated, but their intake can be reduced. There are effective ways of discouraging their consumption — for example, banning marketing directed at children and restricting the sale of these products at and near schools. Developing countries like India can do their people a world of good by acting on this knowledge of what needs to be done here and now to reduce their unconscionably high NCD burden.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/necessary-but-not-good-enough/article2506678.ece
4,10,2011,Who are the poor?,"The controversy over who in India is ‘poor’ enough to receive state support has been partially laid to rest. A joint statement by the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission and the Minister for Rural Development has declared that data collected by the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC), 2011 will be the basis for identifying those deemed eligible for entitlements under various central government programmes. India’s official poverty estimates based on the Planning Commission’s ‘methodology’ will not be used to cap the number of households considered eligible. The immediate need for this clarification was the controversy over an affidavit filed by the Planning Commission in a case in the Supreme Court. That affidavit was doubly problematic. On the one hand, without qualification, it declared a particular per person daily expenditure as the level at or below which a person was ‘officially’ poor. On the other hand, given the context, it implicitly suggested that this figure provided the benchmark to assess how many of India’s citizens qualified as eligible for state subsidies or support. The numbers that defined a person as poor appalled the media and the public: a measly Rs.32 or less in urban areas or Rs.26 or less in rural areas in a day.
What is not adequately stressed is that even these figures represent a considerable improvement on what used to be India’s much-discussed poverty line — computed by inflating an expenditure level from 1973-74 that ensured an adequate calorific intake. It was when that original poverty line was being considered as a possible cap to identify ‘beneficiaries’ eligible for government support that officialdom too realised its gross inadequacy. What followed was an effort by the Suresh Tendulkar Committee to revise upwards the poverty line, applying principles that were arbitrary. This effort was not without intent. It furthered the official agenda of curtailing subsidies, including those on food. Reducing subsidies required a step-wise process in which the Tendulkar Committee estimates played a part. The first of these steps was to move from a PDS that offered self-selecting universal access to one that was targeted at those below the poverty line. The second was to identify a set of indicators the prevalence of which could help identify the BPL population. And the third was to apply those indicators with a severity that ensured that only that proportion of the population in individual States that were under the poverty line would qualify for state support. Experience suggests that the consequence of such targeting is that many deserving support are left out, whereas many not needing it are identified as eligible. Universal access is the solution and the additional costs are unlikely to be high. This, unfortunately, is the lesson that the current ‘retreat’ to the SECC does not fully take account of.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/who-are-the-poor/article2512607.ece
4,10,2011,Cameron’s Libyan script,"British Prime Minister David Cameron may have thought he had arrived on the world stage when he addressed the United Nations General Assembly on September 22 and defended military intervention in other countries, ostensibly on liberal humanitarian grounds. At first sight, he seemed to have a case. Mindful of the debacle of the illegal 2003 invasion of Iraq, he had insisted throughout that any intervention in Libya must comply with international law, and he had given his Cabinet all the legal advice he had received. He had also stood by the principle, even under pressure of events, that British military action under the Nato umbrella should cause no harm to civilians. By Mr. Cameron’s lights, the action against the Libyan dictator Muammar al-Qadhafi has been a success. Mr. Qadhafi is nowhere to be seen. The rebel group, the National Transitional Council (NTC), has been recognised by the U.N. as well as by a large number of countries. Libyan civic bodies are not being abolished as their Iraqi counterparts were; and the NTC has opposed reprisals against those who remained loyal to the former ruler.
But there are serious problems with such an innocent narrative. To start with, the intervention would have been politically much more difficult without the approval of the League of Arab States (the Arab League), which soon reversed its position. The overthrow of Mr. Qadhafi would have been militarily impossible without Nato’s air support, which has meant no fewer than 24,789 sorties, including 9240 ‘strike sorties,’ to date. In defiance of the applicable U.N. Resolution, Britain refused even to rule out deploying ground troops. Mr. Cameron’s claim that the “Libyans liberated themselves” is patently false. Moreover, the British Prime Minister’s continuing silence over brutal repression in Bahrain, for example, exposes his liberal interventionism as highly selective. It has now emerged that, in the past, Britain and the United States offered Tripoli prisoners under the notorious rendition programme, and that Britain gave the Qadhafi regime details of exiled Libyan dissidents. But what undermines Mr. Cameron’s case above all else is the fact that he raised no objections when the NTC rejected Mr. Qadhafi’s offer to become a figurehead at the top of a reconstituted Libyan state. What is clear from an analysis of the Libyan drama is that the U.K. and its allies were after regime change — but Mr. Cameron himself wanted more. Just as Tony Blair infamously did, he wanted war.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/camerons-libyan-script/article2512608.ece
4,10,2011,Stopping the loot,"A robust new law to regulate mining in India is overdue. The proposed Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Bill, 2011 is the central government's response to a full-blown crisis in the sector. There are several serious issues that the legislation promises to address, such as sharing of profits with project-affected people, environmental sustainability, competitive bidding to improve returns to States, and transparency in grant of permits. A major challenge the law must confront is illegal mining. Under the federal structure, the State governments are the owners of minerals located within their boundaries and issue mining leases under the empowering Central law, the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. As recent experience has shown, the law is virtually a dead letter; and illegal extraction, transfer, and export of millions of tonnes of minerals, including iron ore, has become rampant. This loot of finite natural resources has gone on despite the powers available to the State governments under Section 23(C) of the 1957 Act to stop the practice. It is not just that they have failed to act; they have egregiously aided the activity in some cases. The reluctant arrests of influential politicians in Karnataka and Goa point to the rot.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/stopping-the-loot/article2509680.ece
4,10,2011,Littered space,"A one-inch long piece of debris in space travels at 7.5 km per second, about 30 times the speed of a jumbo jet. It can easily destroy a satellite in orbit; and a centimetre-long fragment can seriously damage a satellite. Researchers are currently tracking some 22,000 junk objects — from small bits of debris to large satellites. There are about 500,000 waste fragments between 1 cm and 10 cm in length. The amount of junk accumulating in space has been growing over the last five decades, and is estimated to triple in the next two decades. Little wonder that a recent report by the U.S. National Research Council warns that the amount of debris in space has already reached a “tipping point.” The increase in debris can come in two ways — addition of new material from broken satellites and spent rocket stages, and newer and smaller objects thrown up by the collision of two waste materials. For instance, in 2009, the collision of two satellites over Siberia — a defunct Russian military satellite (Cosmos 2251) and a functioning U.S. Iridium satellite — created nearly 1,700 waste items. But even more waste was created by the testing of an anti-satellite weapon by China in January 2007 when an obsolete Chinese weather satellite was struck by the weapon. According to , nearly 40,000 particles between 1 cm and 10 cm, and around 800 pieces of more than 10 cm in length, were generated by this collision. In all, the “catalogued debris fragments” stood “more than doubled” by the two incidents.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/littered-space/article2509681.ece
6,10,2011,A visionary passes,"When Steve Jobs was asked in 1985 why people should make a heavy investment on a new computer built by Apple, he replied that if one had asked Alexander Graham Bell about the possible uses of a telephone, he would not have been able to say. Moreover, he envisioned a time when computers like the one he had made would be linked to a nationwide communications network. That uncanny understanding of the future course of technology, the intuition, vision, and courage necessary to build it marked the extraordinary life of Steve Jobs. When he died on Wednesday at the age of 56, he left the venture he co-founded in his parents' garage the most valuable technology company in the world. A restless diviner of the digital future, Jobs made things for people before they knew they needed it. The first Macintosh computer brought technologies such as the graphical user interface and the mouse to the mainstream, scoring a giant leap over text-based displays. The iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad were products of his belief that humans, as instinctive users of tools, would love them. These creations successfully disrupted the universe of gadgets and entertainment, creating new benchmarks for products.
A quarter century ago, at a time when the computer business was focussed on big corporations and mainframes, Jobs pursued a vision to take the productivity of the computer to the small businessperson and the home user. He used innovation and reliability as growth engines. He was the digital woodworker who never compromised on design, materials, or craftsmanship, in hardware and software. Early in his career, Jobs argued that creativity was an asset of the young. As people grew older, they got stuck in the patterns etched in their mind by their thoughts. Companies with many layers of middle management filtered out the passion for products. Jobs was the great exception — mercurial, driven, and eager to connect the dots of the future till the end. Unceremoniously thrown out of the company he co-founded, he returned to it enormously enriched with creative ideas. Despite suffering from a rare form of pancreatic cancer diagnosed soon after he unveiled the iTunes music store, he persevered with the development of new products such as the iPhone. In his famous commencement address at Stanford University in 2005, he reflected on the inevitability of mortality: “Your time is limited, so don't waste it living somebody else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people's thinking ... And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.” This summed up the life and work of a college dropout who, by connecting the dots and having the courage to follow his heart and intuition, changed the world.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-visionary-passes/article2515372.ece
6,10,2011,How pathogens are killed,"Inside our body can be found the bloodiest of battlefields, where millions of organisms are massacred daily, without cease. It is a battle waged by our body's robust immune system against a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria, virus, fungi, and parasites. What makes the defence mechanism powerful is the two-level protection conferred by the immune system. The innate immune system that serves as the first line of defence is not antigen-specific; it readily targets all pathogenic organisms the moment they enter the body. The antigen-specific adaptive immune mechanism acts as the second line of protection to keep us healthy. This year's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to Bruce A. Beutler, Jules A. Hoffmann, and Ralph M. Steinman for revolutionising our understanding of the immune system by discovering the key principles that activate the defence mechanism. Beutler and Hoffmann will share half the prize money for discovering the receptor proteins that recognise micro-organisms and activate the innate immunity. In 1996, Hoffmann found that the Toll gene was responsible for sensing pathogenic micro-organisms and that its activation was required for mounting innate immune response. Two years later, Beutler discovered that components of micro-organisms bind to Toll-like receptors located on many cells. The binding activates the innate immunity, which results in inflammation and destruction of the pathogens.
The other half of the prize money was awarded to Steinmann for discovering, way back in the 1970s, that dendritic cells were responsible for adaptive immunity. As they are antigen-specific, dendritic cells take time to react to an invading organism on first exposure; but immunological memory allows them to react more rapidly to the same antigen on subsequent exposures. This is the attribute researchers exploit while designing preventive vaccines. Adaptive immunity holds great medical promise. The immune system can be directed to attack the tumour. Blocking the excessive production of cytokines when diseases show up can ameliorate autoimmunity. Even preventing autoimmune diseases may become possible when certain cells of the immune system are successfully silenced. Steinmann will go down in history as not just a highly worthy Nobel Prize winner. He was (as a Rockefeller University statement explains) “diagnosed with pancreatic cancer four years ago ... his life was extended using a dendritic-cell based immunotherapy of his own design,” and he died three days before his Nobel was announced.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/how-pathogens-are-killed/article2515373.ece
7,10,2011,Cities and climate change,"Rapid urbanisation has enabled cities to become engines of economic growth and helped reduce urban poverty levels. But the same process has made them highly vulnerable to the severe effects of climate change. Although cities use only two per cent of the land mass, they are responsible for 75 per cent of human-induced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions released into the atmosphere, making them the biggest contributors to global warming. To bring world attention to this disquieting fact, UN Habitat has chosen the theme of Cities and Climate Change for this year's World Habitat Day. The larger objective is to drive home the point that unless growth is intelligently planned for and energy use patterns are rethought radically, cities run a big environmental risk, which would make them susceptible to climate-change-induced disasters such as sea level increase and frequent flooding. Urban sprawl, combined with unsustainable transportation planning and energy guzzling building practices, has been the main source for the GHG emission. Urban waste now accounts for only 3 per cent of total emissions, but given the accelerated expansion of urban populations, increasing waste volumes could become a big concern in the conceivable future.
How have the Indian policymakers measured up to these challenges? A mission on sustainable habitat has been constituted as part of the National Action Plan on Climate Change. Instead of seriously promoting a green growth model and pushing for radical reforms in urban planning, the mission has been pursuing an ineffective incremental approach. It has not influenced any major policy shifts at the State or city level. Despite the rapid increase in commercial building construction, the new Energy Conservation Building Code, framed four years ago, is yet to be made mandatory, nor have the States integrated it into their building regulations. Given the present trends, electricity-related emissions are likely to increase by 390 per cent in four decades (UNEP, 2010) and could cost the cities dear. It is now established that every one per cent increase in the density of urban areas would reduce the carbon monoxide level by 0.7 per cent. Specific environmental targets have not been built into the urban planning process. A high-density, poly-nodal, public-transport oriented urban pattern that would reduce travel distances and encourage non-motorised travel has not found favour with India's city planners. It is vital that urban and climate change policies synergise at the local body level and a sustainable growth pattern is adopted on priority. Simultaneously, the resilience of cities, particularly of their poor areas, has to be vastly improved so that they can better manage the impact of climate change.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/cities-and-climate-change/article2518565.ece
7,10,2011,An unpopular verdict,"It is doubtful if the death sentence awarded to Mumtaz Qadri, the policeman who shot dead Salman Taseer, the Governor of Pakistan's Punjab province, can stem the extremism that has the country in its grip. Qadri confessed to the January 4 killing, proudly defending his action in court as a religious duty. He argued that Taseer had offended the sensibilities of all Muslims by his campaign to save a Christian woman sentenced to death on the charge of apostasy, and by supporting a move to amend the country's blasphemy laws. A frighteningly large number of Pakistanis approved of Qadri's act of murder. He became a hero, and lawyers volunteered to defend him in court. Nine months later, his popularity has not waned. After the court verdict, his supporters were out on the streets protesting it and threatening that “by punishing one Qadri, you will give rise to a thousand Qadris.” His lawyer has said that as the judge read out the verdict, Qadri recited verses from the Koran, accepting his death sentence as a sacrifice of his life for the Prophet. It is not clear if that means he will not contest the verdict in a higher court. There has been an undeclared moratorium on implementing the death sentence since the Pakistan People's Party came to power in 2008. It is admirable that the judge, who was asked by Qadri's defence to decide the case on religious rather than legal grounds, had the courage not to succumb to the pressure. With Qadri's supporters already announcing rewards for killing the judge, it falls on the Pakistan government to provide him protection.
Since Taseer's assassination, and the killing soon thereafter of Shahbaz Bhatti, the Minister for Minorities who supported Taseer's campaign, the fear of death has silenced the bravest moderate voices in Pakistan. The world-wide shock and outrage over the killings seem to have had little effect in the country — a 13-year-old Christian girl who misspelled the Prophet's name was expelled from school recently on the charge of blasphemy. The government has dropped the move to amend the blasphemy law so as to make the process of registering complaints far more difficult than it is now; the member of Parliament who moved the Bill lives under the shadow of a death threat. This sorry state of affairs owes much to the long-term policies of the Pakistani state. Its policy of encouraging religious radicalism in the pursuit of regional strategic goals has perpetrated such horrors that there should have been a serious rethink by now. If this has not happened, it is because Pakistan has yet to produce a truly visionary leadership.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-unpopular-verdict/article2518566.ece
10,10,2011,Breaking conventions,"In his efforts to shield Chief Minister Digambar Kamat from charges of involvement in illegal mining, Goa Speaker Pratapsinh Rane was not only being politically partisan — he was also bending rules and breaking conventions. After declining to table the report on illegal mining prepared by the Public Accounts Committee, which was headed by the Leader of the Opposition Manohar Parrikar, the Speaker reconstituted the PAC. True, the term of the PAC had ended, and the new chairman, Vijay Pai-Khot, is also from the main opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party. But in blatant disregard of established legislative procedure, Mr. Rane chose not to consult the BJP leadership on the change. Mr. Parrikar appears to have been kept out solely because of his role in drafting the report, which was a damning indictment of the government. In any case, Mr. Rane ought to have tabled Mr. Parrikar's report in the Assembly, instead of looking for excuses for not doing so — that a majority of the members of the PAC, four of seven, had not signed it, and the report was, therefore, no more than a draft. The PAC, as was to be expected, was divided on party lines, with three members of the ruling Congress and one from the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party disagreeing with the findings. The proper course for the Speaker would have been to table the report in the House, and allow an honest debate on illegal mining in the State. That this was not done gives rise to suspicion that senior leaders in the Congress and in the government have a lot to hide. It lends credence to the allegations of irregularities in renewing mining leases, of non-payment of mining royalties, and of damage to the environment.
The PAC report followed up the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General on revenue loss to the government in iron ore export. The increased demand for iron ore in China made mining extremely lucrative, and illegal mining worth the risk. Indiscriminate mining over the last few years has contributed to the depletion of forest cover. Instead of facing up to these hard facts, the Kamat government launched into a cover-up operation. By all accounts, Chief Minister Kamat, who holds the mining portfolio, does not want an impartial probe into the issue. Under these circumstances, the only option is to have the Central Bureau of Investigation inquire into what the PAC report refers to as a “clear nexus of politicians, bureaucrats in the Mines Department, local police officers and officers from the Forest Department” in illegal mining. The choice before Mr. Kamat is stark: make way for such investigation, or quit.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/breaking-conventions/article2523647.ece
10,10,2011,India in Afghanistan,"As it prepares for a withdrawal of its combat forces in Afghanistan, the United States has been particularly vocal about a larger Indian role in that country. The Strategic Partnership Agreement between India and Afghanistan is confirmation that New Delhi is willing to take on such a role. India, with a commitment of $1.2 billion through 2013, is already the sixth largest donor to Afghanistan, It has been involved in diverse development projects in infrastructure, education and agriculture. The agreement signed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Afghan President Hamid Karzai in New Delhi goes beyond such development and humanitarian assistance. India is to also assist “as mutually determined, in the training, equipping and capacity building programmes for the Afghan National Security Forces.” In addition, the two countries will hold a regular strategic dialogue “with the aim of intensifying mutual efforts towards strengthening regional peace and security.” Significantly, two MoUs were also signed for the development of minerals and natural gas in Afghanistan, which is said to hold mineral deposits worth $1 trillion. If all this is a reflection of friendly ties between India and Afghanistan, it comes with the discomforting knowledge of the fraught nature of geopolitics in the region. Pakistan is bound to view the agreement with unease — the Pakistani security establishment has been suspicious even of India's development assistance to its western neighbour.
The suspicion is quite self-serving: it heightens the bogey of “Indian encirclement” of Pakistan, provides justification to the Pakistan Army's idea of building “strategic depth” in Afghanistan, and strengthens the military's position within Pakistan. That the India-Afghanistan agreement has come at a time when Afghan-Pakistan relations are at a particularly low point does not help. After the killing of former Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani, linked by both Kabul and the U.S. to Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence, President Karzai has called off reconciliation talks with the Taliban. But this makes it more important for India to dispel the notion that its increasing involvement in Afghanistan is aimed at marginalising Pakistan. India has legitimate interests in Afghanistan and the friendly ties between the two run deep into the past. Equally, Pakistan and Afghanistan are unique neighbours, with shared bonds of culture, ethnicity, language, and religion. As President Karzai himself pointed out, while India is “a friend” to Afghanistan, Pakistan is a “twin brother.” In the interests of regional peace, New Delhi must take this opportunity to declare a willingness to work with Pakistan for stability in Afghanistan.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/india-in-afghanistan/article2523648.ece
11,10,2011,Three very courageous women,"The Nobel Peace Prize for 2011 has been won by three women, each of whom has shown sustained moral and physical courage in situations of war and state violence. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, an economist with a Harvard master's in public administration, survived imprisonment and a rape attempt during the brutal regime of Samuel Doe. She went on to win the Liberian presidency in 2004, becoming Africa's first elected woman head of state. She immediately started rebuilding a shattered country. Declaring that empowered women were essential to a civilised and safe society, she got 40 per cent of girls into free compulsory elementary schooling, and tightened the laws on rape and women's property rights. The second winner is also a Liberian; Leymah Gbowee, a social worker-turned activist, started a women's prayer for peace on a football field in 2002. This became a daily event, even though soldiers involved in the savage civil war could have fired on the women while driving past. Ms Gbowee then led her followers to surround the hall used for peace talks until the delegates signed a deal. She also advised Liberian women to deny sex to their men until they stopped war, in which mass rape was widespread. The third winner, Tawakkul Karman of Yemen, a journalist-activist, has campaigned for women's rights in a conservative society. She became an iconic figure in her country's protests, which have resulted in the dictator Ali Abdullah Saleh announcing his departure. Ms Karman has often been jailed and has survived an assassination attempt. Earlier this year, her response to Mr. Saleh's comment that female protesters had been “mingling with men” was to lead 10,000 women in a march down a highway.
Women laureates have been a rarity in the history of Nobel prizes. Only 15 women, including these three, have won the Peace Prize in 110 years. This year's prize is also the first to go to any African since the Kenyan environmentalist Wangari Maathai was honoured in 2004. The very nature of the Peace Nobel means that some controversy is usually involved. As Ms Johnson Sirleaf is standing for re-election, Liberian opposition leaders say the Committee is interfering in domestic politics. Ms Karman, for her part, belongs to an Islamist party, Islah, which has links with the Muslim Brotherhood. By choosing someone from Yemen — and not, say, Bahrain, where repression is equally severe but the ruler is favoured by major western countries — the Committee has shown that its decision might not be as free of political considerations as it claims it to be. None of this takes away from the fact that these three very courageous women eminently deserve the Prize.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/three-very-courageous-women/article2526312.ece
11,10,2011,Avoidable downgrade,"The downgrade of State Bank of India's standalone rating of credit worthiness by Moody's Investor Services last week needs to be understood in its proper perspective. The agency, one of the big three — Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings are the others — cut the rating on SBI's financial strength to D-plus from C-minus, reflecting its concern over the Bank's capital adequacy as well as deteriorating asset quality. Indian stock markets, which have been on a roller coaster ride over an extended period, lurched downwards after the announcement, with bank stocks in general coming under intense pressure. SBI is by far the biggest commercial bank in the country, accounting for more than a fourth of total banking business. While it is, therefore, easy to exaggerate the significance of the downgrade, a few facts need to be borne in mind. The downgrading will indeed affect SBI's standing in global financial markets. But almost 95 per cent of SBI's business is within India. Granting that there will be a “ripple effect” — as the higher costs of new foreign currency loans trickle down to the domestic sector — SBI will be able to provide foreign currency support to its clients at competitive rates. Moreover, as the SBI Chairman has said, the revised rating is still of investment grade, and is no worse than that of other public sector banks.
Several banks on either side of the Atlantic have faced downgrades recently as they reel under the European debt crisis. Yet that is small comfort for SBI simply because the reasons here are very different. SBI, which is government-owned to an extent of almost 60 per cent, has been, for close to a year, contemplating a rights share issue of about Rs.23,000 crore to shore up its capital base. It is stalled by the government's inability to find money to put up its share of the rights issue. The government realises it has to do so for sustaining its majority ownership and also because SBI's tier-I capital has fallen below the regulatory norm of 8 per cent, to which the government is committed. SBI also faces the twin problems of higher interest rates and deteriorating asset quality. If the bank had gone through with the capital raising effort, these pressures would have been well under control; there would have been no question of a downgrade. Even as the government is planning to infuse emergency capital, it needs to be emphasised that SBI and a few other public sector banks would have absolutely no difficulty in mobilising resources from the capital market at very attractive rates. It is the imperative to preserve government majority ownership that stands in their way.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/avoidable-downgrade/article2526313.ece
12,10,2011,IT policy and credibility gap,"Statements of policy can sound grand but when it comes to promises of administrative reform, what India needs is a reality check. The draft National Policy on Information Technology, 2011 claims that providing “ubiquitous, affordable, access to information and public services for enhancing efficiency, transparency, accountability and reliability” is among its important goals. Another key objective is to incentivise the software industry to boost exports, to expand IT education, and generate ten million new jobs. It can be assumed that economic imperatives will lend fresh dynamism to the high-performing software industry, but the same cannot be said of public services. Take the key areas under the National e-Governance Plan. Income Tax, passport, visa, land records, property registration, pensions, road transport, police, municipalities, panchayats, and employment exchanges are all priority services, but these are not ready for electronic service provision even after years. Communications and IT Minister Kapil Sibal must address this serious credibility gap. He has acknowledged the problem of bribery to get even a refund in departments such as Income Tax, but only firm action can produce solutions. The situation is not very different in other government services.
The IT Policy can bring about progress in service delivery if the Ministry of Information Technology starts with an audit of the status quo and sets deadlines for reform. It is revealing, for instance, that the Department of Posts is yet to provide computer hardware to all post offices in the country. Scores of post offices do not have computers in Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Uttar Pradesh, and even Maharashtra. Besides installing machines, ensuring robust communication networks is vital. In keeping with global trends, the IT Policy lauds social media, which a vast number of people have taken to enthusiastically. Yet government has not exploited its potential to engage citizens. India also does not have national data networks in areas such as education and health that can aid research and informed policymaking. Here it is encouraging that one of the objectives is to design and implement a framework to place data in the public domain “for use and value addition.” This needs to be done on priority in all areas of development, including agriculture. The emphasis on open standards and open technologies is progressive. It is worth emphasising that the UPA government must enact the Electronic Service Delivery Bill 2011, if the goal of providing high quality public services, outlined in the IT Policy, is to be met anytime soon.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/it-policy-and-credibility-gap/article2529037.ece
12,10,2011,Weird Mercury,"Our basic understanding of the fundamental aspects of Mercury stands challenged just six months after the Messenger spacecraft settled into orbit around the innermost planet. If the three fly-bys of Mariner 10 in the 1970s and Messenger indicated the strange nature of the planet, the first major release of results from NASA's spacecraft has confirmed its weirdness. The results published recently in Science are prompting researchers to reconsider some of the fundamental ideas about the nature and history of the planet. Mercury and earth are the only two terrestrial planets that have global magnetic fields generated internally. But the magnetic field of Mercury has some strange characteristics, that is, in comparison with the earth. The magnetic equator is displaced northward of the geographical equator by nearly 500 km. The net result of this displacement is that the surface field at the North Pole is larger than at the South Pole by a factor of nearly 3.5. But the surprising find is that unlike the earth, Mercury shows “no evidence” of electron radiation belts (Van Allen belts) surrounding it. Also, an acceleration phenomenon that produces energetic electrons fails to produce energetic protons. This phenomenon is unique to Mercury, and may be due to the “weakness of the planetary field.”
The next strange feature confirmed is the presence of northern high-latitude smooth plains, produced by the globally extensive flood volcanism that occurred once the heavy bombardment ceased. Flowing out of the cracks some 3.8 billion years ago, the low-viscosity lava with high effusion rates apparently covers six per cent of the total surface area of the planet. Data suggest that Mercury's mantle must have undergone extensive partial melting at the fag end of heavy bombardment to produce large-scale flood volcanism. Internal heat production may be declining post-planet formation as there has been only isolated volcanic activity after the massive lava flow. This may also explain why naturally occurring radioactive isotopes of potassium, thorium, and uranium are found in abundance on the surface. In fact, contrary to models explaining Mercury's formation, the evidence collected strongly suggests that the planet was not subjected to extreme heating. For instance, sulphur and potassium, which are moderately volatile, are found in abundance. Similarly, there is plenty of potassium relative to thorium and uranium. The overall composition makes the planet comparable to chondritic meteorites. These baffling observations invest the Messenger mission with great significance, and the remaining six months of its mission life will be keenly followed by scientists round the world.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/weird-mercury/article2529038.ece
13,10,2011,Getting it right on Kudankulam,"New Delhi's handling of the protests at Kudankulam marks some improvement over the ham-handed way in which popular concerns over the Jaitapur nuclear power project in Maharashtra were dealt with. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa has shown the way with her deft handling of the protests by the local population, shifting from appeals to support the project to articulating the concerns of the people of the project area and throwing the ball into the centre's court. The central government needs to understand that routine prime ministerial assurances will not work in the post-Fukushima era. It must come up with a radically different approach, in form and substance, to the question of nuclear safety — if it has to safeguard the future of the Kudankulam project and other civilian nuclear ventures. The protagonists of nuclear power are on a reasonably good wicket at Kudankulam. The VVER-1000 reactors have been in operation across the world at a number of locations for several years. They are considered to be inherently safer than the untested EPR design of the French nuclear operator AREVA or the reactor designs of the Fukushima vintage.
India cannot ignore nuclear power in the era of global warming. Its civilian nuclear programme is an ongoing venture that has enjoyed public support over the decades. In principle, there is no reason why the Kudankulam project should not enter operation. But this will not happen of its own accord. The practical question is how to address public concerns over nuclear safety. Here a clear distinction needs to be made between the ‘fundamentalists' who are philosophically and absolutely opposed to nuclear power and those who have real and legitimate fears about nuclear safety. Nothing the government or, for that matter, anyone can do is likely to persuade the former group but plenty can be done to engage democratically and transparently with the latter. Unfortunately, the credibility of the Manmohan Singh government and the nuclear establishment took a beating when it turned out that the draft legislation for a supposedly independent nuclear safety authority provided it with little genuine autonomy. The Bill makes the new authority subordinate to a Council of Nuclear Safety dominated by the government that may even supersede the authority if it so pleases. The government continues to be oblivious of the need for a credible process of post-Fukushima certification for the VVER-1000 installations at Kudankulam as well as other operational nuclear reactors. Fresh verification by independent experts is required to assure us that the passive safety systems of the VVER-1000 reactors are adequate or can be suitably augmented to prevent the dangers of meltdown from residual heat as a consequence of coolant circulation failure in the background of a catastrophic natural event. The challenge to Kudankulam can be converted into an opportunity to set a new course on nuclear safety in India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/getting-it-right-on-kudankulam/article2532034.ece
13,10,2011,Myanmar's changing pulse,"The visit to India by the President of Myanmar, Thein Sein, comes at a time of change in his country. His last visit was in 2008, as Prime Minister of the military junta that called itself the State Peace and Development Council. The SPDC has been replaced by a government that was elected in November 2010 but remains predominantly military in composition — President Sein and most of his cabinet members were high-ranking military officers in the SPDC; and the election rules were engineered to ensure that the military-backed United Socialist and Democratic Party won. While the junta prevented the main democratic opposition, represented by the iconic Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League of Democracy, from contesting the elections, the new dispensation has sent up smoke signals for political reconciliation with her. President Sein invited her for talks, and she has been allowed to tour the country unobstructed. But more remarkably, the government has bowed to popular will for the first time by suspending the Chinese-assisted Myitsone dam project on the Irrawaddy river. In an open letter to the government some months ago, Ms Suu Kyi highlighted the displacement the project would cause and its feared impact on the environment. At the risk of straining ties with China, President Sein told Parliament earlier this month that the government had “a responsibility to solve the worries of the people so we will stop construction of the Myitsone dam.” Also significant is the inclusion of 300 political prisoners in an amnesty to over 6,000 others.
Over the last decade or so, India played down a longstanding friendship with Ms Suu Kyi as it assiduously courted the junta, to the extent of making an assessment — exposed by WikiLeaks — that her “day has come and gone.” Countering China's influence and securing the SPDC's cooperation to crack down on safe havens of insurgent groups from the North-East were the two main reasons cited for building ties with Myanmar's junta. President Sein's October 12-15 visit to New Delhi is likely to shine some light on how far the military is willing to travel in its rapprochement with Ms Suu Kyi. For New Delhi, the shift in Myanmar's political landscape is an opportunity to reinvigorate its engagement with Ms Suu Kyi and other pro-democracy forces. It can no longer remain diffident about doing this.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/myanmars-changing-pulse/article2532035.ece
14,10,2011,Dangerous culture of intolerance,"It speaks to the deeply divisive times we live in that Team Anna activist and Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan was savagely assaulted in his own chamber — and in the full glare of television cameras — for the “crime” of saying something that his attackers disapproved of. In the past, intolerant groups who seem to have no problem breaking the law with impunity, have targeted writers, artists, journalists, scholars, and activists whose work they did not like. Mr. Bhushan has lately been in the public eye for going full-throttle against high-level corruption, both in his capacity as a lawyer and as part of Anna Hazare's spectacularly-mounted and hugely resonant Jan Lokpal Bill campaign. As a petitioner in the 2G scam case, he has taken on some of the most powerful names in politics and industry. Yet if Mr. Bhushan has rendered himself vulnerable today, it is for his daring work in the field of civil liberties. In recent years, he has braved criticism to defend those accused of terrorism, taken up the cause of Binayak Sen and spoken out against the violation of human rights in Kashmir. Indeed, Mr. Bhushan was set upon in his office by right-wing fanatics because he suggested at a conference on Kashmir that a referendum may be an option failing other measures such as withdrawal of the Army and the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act. That the Ram Sena activists had worked themselves into a frenzy ahead of the attack is evident from a YouTube clip containing the speech in question. In the digitally altered clip, Mr. Bhushan appears with his face blackened, and there is a warning to Anna for harbouring a traitor: Brashtachari ko phansi to desh drohi ko kya? (You are advocating death to the corrupt, what about traitors?)
The brazen manner of the attack on Mr. Bhushan — with the goons obviously enjoying being on camera — exposes the extent to which lawlessness and intolerance have corroded the Indian political culture. The attack is also proof — if any were needed — that corruption and communalism cannot be fought separately. If anything, today's right-wing intolerance is a product of the failure of past anti-corruption campaigns to recognise the dangers of communalism. The RSS was an integral part of the anti-corruption movements of 1977 and 1989, and the Anna campaign too suffers from the perception that its ranks have been permeated by RSS foot soldiers. Fortunately, Team Anna has dissociated itself from the dubious elements that once shared its anti-corruption plank. It must also help the group that it can count among its members men of such impeccable credentials as Mr. Bhushan. For once the UPA government must shed its customary apathy and proactively prosecute the culprits in the case, especially in the light of Thursday's ‘follow-up' attack by Ram Sena thugs on supporters of Mr. Bhushan. For its part, Team Anna needs to be as watchful of right-wing ascendancy as it is of all-pervasive corruption.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dangerous-culture-of-intolerance/article2535104.ece
14,10,2011,Twin challenges for Tantawi,"The worst violence Cairo has seen since Hosni Mubarak's brutal attempts to suppress the Egyptian protests in February has claimed at least 24 lives. Military trucks and armoured cars are alleged to have run over peaceful demonstrators, mainly Coptic Christians. Along with Egyptian Muslims, they had marched peacefully from the city's Shubra district to the state television offices in Maspero Square, where they began an outdoor sit-in to protest over the destruction of a church in the southern governorate of Aswan the previous week. The protesters also allege that thugs started targeting Christians before the army joined in; al-Jazeera has carried reports that 300 were injured in all. Egyptian Prime Minister Essam Sharaf, in a response that is typical of Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi's governing Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, has blamed foreign interference. But the civilian cabinet has held an emergency meeting, and the Council has called for a speedy inquiry into the incident.
The episode highlights continuing problems in Egypt's transition to democracy. The military rulers have been unable or unwilling to control sectarian prejudices in official institutions. Ordinary Egyptians of all faiths are troubled by the slow progress towards the drafting of a constitution. The Supreme Council may be trying to delay or even prevent reform; since Mr. Mubarak's departure from office, some 12,000 people have been tried in military courts, not the civilian judicial system. A further result of the institutional resistance to change is that the Copts, who at 10 per cent are Egypt's largest single minority, continue to be exposed to discrimination and, on occasion, violence. Those involved in the recent Cairo demonstrations have called for the removal of the Aswan provincial governor, accusing him of failing to protect the church that was attacked. The current situation must be a bitter disappointment to all reform-minded Egyptians, not least those Copts and Muslims who, during February's uprising, prayed together in Cairo's Tahrir Square and chanted “We are one!” in a clear and inspiring message to the Hosni Mubarak dictatorship and to sectarian forces in Egypt. Some religious leaders, such as the country's Grand Imam Ahmed el-Tayeb, have condemned the attack on the Aswan church, but the Tantawi regime now faces a severe test of its sincerity and political will. If it fails to rise to the challenge of genuine democratic reform, it will risk a fresh national uprising.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/twin-challenges-for-tantawi/article2535106.ece
15,10,2011,A Megha bonanza,"The Indo-French atmospheric research satellite, Megha-Tropiques, is now safely ensconced in orbit, a fact that will gladden the hearts of many scientists around the world. This is just the second satellite that will gaze down on the formation of clouds and powerful storms in the tropical regions of the world. The ageing U.S.-Japanese Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), launched in 1997 and still operational, has provided a bonanza of information. There are high expectations from Megha-Tropiques, which will concentrate even more on the tropics and provide greater coverage of the region. This satellite will measure the flow of energy and the build-up of water vapour at different levels in the atmosphere, both critical factors in the evolution of large cloud systems. By deciphering the complex linkages between land, ocean, and atmosphere, it will be possible to greatly improve weather and climate models, making for better monsoon prediction. It should also provide vital clues for determining whether a warming climate could lead to more rain or less. And the benefits will not be restricted to India. That the 21 science teams formed for the mission have drawn scientists from 11 countries is a testament to its global importance. After a three-month period during which the instruments on the satellite will be calibrated and another six months when data will go only to the international science teams, data from the satellite will be freely accessible to all. A number of groups from various countries, including India, have plans to feed the data in real-time into their simulation models for weather prediction. In the meantime, another Indo-French satellite, SARAL, which will study the oceans, is being prepared for launch next year.
Along with the Megha-Tropiques, the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) also carried three tiny satellites as co-passengers, two of them designed and developed by the faculty and students of Indian academic institutions. The three-kilogramme Jugnu nanosatellite came from IIT Kanpur and the 11-kilogramme SRMSat from the SRM University near Chennai. The PSLV had launched the 40-kilogramme ANUSAT from Anna University in 2009, and last year it put up the STUDSAT, weighing less than one kilogramme, built by a consortium of seven engineering colleges in Bangalore and Hyderabad. This sort of effort must be encouraged. For one thing, novel technologies can be tested quite cheaply. More importantly, putting together any satellite, however small, that will survive the rigours of launch and then work in the hostile environment of space is a tremendous challenge. It is unquestionably an excellent way to train the technology leaders of tomorrow that India needs.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-megha-bonanza/article2538286.ece
15,10,2011,Clean up the air,"City-dwelling Indians are at higher risk for respiratory illnesses, heart disease, and lung cancer — because the concentration of fine particulate matter in the air is way above the guidelines of the World Health Organisation. The recently released WHO data related to Particulate Matter measuring 10 micrometres or less (PM10) for 33 Indian cities are staggeringly high. These particles enter the bloodstream through the lungs, with grave consequences for health; urban outdoor air pollution is thought to cause 1.3 million deaths a year worldwide. The cities with the worst air quality are Ludhiana, Kanpur, Delhi, Lucknow, Indore, and Agra, in that order. Significantly, the WHO pollution atlas has a lot in common with the map prepared by the Central Pollution Control Board for cities that do not meet ambient air quality standards. This is an issue of serious concern because PM10 levels in ambient air in 27 Indian cities range from 80 micrograms per cubic metre in Ahmedabad to 251 in Ludhiana, against the WHO guideline norm of 20. Sadly, the average citizen can do little to mitigate the pollution. Achieving good air quality requires intervention at the policy level in key areas — vehicular emissions, polluting small-scale manufacturing, and burning of biomass and coal.
The abysmal air quality in Indian cities calls for determined, speedy action. Thus far the response to the problem has been directed towards improving the quality of automotive fuels, mandating higher emission standards for automobiles, using CNG for commercial vehicles in Delhi and LPG in some other places, organising surprise checks on polluting industries, and so on. That these have not made a significant difference to air quality is clear proof of their inadequacy. Delhi experienced a perceptible improvement in air quality thanks to CNG, but it has begun to slide in the last few years. The WHO figures indicate that Amritsar and Kochi have lower PM10 levels than other cities, but even these are almost double the guideline figure. The answer lies in providing alternatives to fossil-fuel driven vehicles, taxing inefficient use of cars, and encouraging non-motorised transport such as cycling. No time should be lost in expanding and liberally subsidising public transport. Unfortunately, India is motorising at a rate much faster than the United States or countries in Europe did in the 20th century. The result is massive urban vehicular congestion. The imperatives of economic growth do demand better and faster mobility but this has to be achieved in smart ways that do not subject entire populations to terrible health risks.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/clean-up-the-air/article2538023.ece
16,10,2011,Good monsoon but bad forecast,"The rains have been good during this year's south-west monsoon. The season ended with the country, as a whole, receiving one per cent more rain than the long-period average. The rains have been geographically well distributed too, with the north-west, the central region, and the southern part of the country getting more than average rainfall. Only the north-east recorded a deficit. Consequently, the country is looking forward to a bumper harvest in the kharif season. In this optimistic scenario, it is easy to forget that the India Meteorological Department's forecasts had gone awry. In mid-April, the IMD put the countrywide seasonal rainfall at 98 per cent of the long-period average, with an error bar of five percentage points. In June, the agency revised it as 95 per cent with an error bar of four percentage points. While the country received excess rain in June, the rains in July were considerably below par. By the end of July, the nationwide deficit for the season stood at about four per cent. On August 1, the IMD declared that countrywide rainfall during August-September was likely to be 90 per cent of the long-period average, with an error bar of eight percentage points. This forecast raised the possibility of the monsoon fizzling out. But, as things turned out, the rains were well above average during both August and September.
In its end-of-season report, the IMD agreed that its operational long-range forecasts had not been “very accurate.” It explained that the sudden re-emergence of a La Nin˜a — the cooling in the equatorial Pacific Ocean that is usually beneficial for the monsoon — led to increased rainfall in the second half of the season. What is clear is that the department needs to re-evaluate the parameters that go into the statistical model used for its seasonal predictions. These parameters have remained unchanged for the past five years. It is possible that the correlation of some of them with the monsoon's outcome has dropped sharply and must therefore be replaced with new ones. There is also a good case for focussing on probabilistic forecasts. The IMD's April forecast indicated a 93 per cent probability that the monsoon would be ‘normal', with the nationwide rainfall between 90 per cent and 110 per cent of the long-period average; in June, that probability had dropped only to 80 per cent. Rainfall data for over a century show that seven years out of ten fall into this category. Thus, the probabilistic forecasts showed that this year the odds favoured a normal monsoon. And that, mercifully, is just how things have turned out.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/good-monsoon-but-bad-forecast/article2543416.ece
16,10,2011,Captive to domestic politics,"With its international economic policy very much captive to factious domestic politics, the United States is hardly in a position to exercise the global economic leadership role that would have been expected of it in these abnormal times. Since the financial crisis of 2008, it has been the robust growth in countries such as India and China that offset the anaemic performance in the advanced economies. Indeed, the advanced economies are in worse shape today than they were during the initial phase of the recovery. With euro zone policymaking also in disarray, emerging economies have even greater reasons to worry. They realise that solutions to most of the global economic problems will not come from the West because of the divisive politics in the U.S. and the euro zone countries. In the U.S. the bickering in Congress over debt and deficit has rendered much of its international economic policymaking counterproductive. Gains have been few and far between, and even those, such as the much-delayed Congressional approval to bilateral trade deals with South Korea, Panama and Colombia, are not considered significant. These deals were negotiated four or five years ago by the previous administration, and, in any case, are unlikely to contribute significantly now to growth and employment. Most of the tariffs with South Korea are already low. However, these pacts have been widely blamed by the trade unions and the public for sending jobs abroad. The debate over the trade deals has become a proxy for those over employment and globalisation.
Free trade has become a casualty as the world's number one economy has turned inwards embracing protectionism in many notable instances. The Doha development round of trade talks is as good as dead. The absence of political will in the U.S. to pursue free trade agreements overruling significant domestic opposition is palpable. Even more ominous is the purport of a bill recently passed by the Senate that aims to punish China for holding down its currency and hence boosting its export competitiveness. Any “fundamentally misaligned” currency would be deemed to be a subsidy subject to countervailing duties. The move has been severely criticised by China and other countries which see in the new legislation shades of the “protectionist “ policies of the 1930s that made the Great Depression even worse. The World Trade Organisation is sure to frown upon the imposition of such duties. There is a fear that such a move might lead to full-blown trade and currency wars between the world's top two economies, with all other countries being inevitably drawn into them.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/captive-to-domestic-politics/article2543417.ece
17,10,2011,Japan's aid diplomacy & India,"The decision by Japan to exempt India from the cuts it has implemented in its overseas aid programmes following the tsunami and the nuclear disaster at Fukushima is an indication that Tokyo, despite its internal political turmoil, is giving its ties with New Delhi high priority. Financial aid may sound like a paradoxical way to go about this. After all, India — ranked among the world's top emerging economies, with a high growth rate — is not desperate for the money. Indeed, India now gives considerable financial assistance to neighbouring countries and to Africa. It is a contributor to the poverty alleviation fund set up by the India-Brazil-South Africa grouping and managed by the United Nations, among other projects. But it also continues to receive funding from Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Russia, the European Union, the Scandinavian countries and a few others, aside from what these countries channelise through non-governmental organisations. While foreign funding constitutes a minuscule fraction of India's GDP, it is not irrelevant. Fewer strings are attached to it today than three decades ago, when India was in dire need of it. India is also better equipped than it was, in knowledge and capacity, to utilise the money. Foreign funding can be deployed in the battle to make health, water, and sanitation available to millions of Indians who live without these facilities; it can be used for global initiatives, of which India is a part — the fight against climate change, for instance. It is also used in infrastructure projects. Financial aid from Japan funds the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, a $100-billion infrastructure development that extends over six States.
Japan's aid diplomacy with India should be seen in the context of ties that have improved steadily in the last decade but are yet to break the surface. The Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement the two countries signed last year promises to further trade relations that have stagnated far below their potential. In parallel, both sides have also sought to develop a strategic partnership. The exemption from aid cuts has come ahead of the fifth round of the India-Japan Strategic Dialogue scheduled for the end of October, in which the Indian side will be led by External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna, and a visit to Japan by Defence Minister A.K. Antony in the first week of November. Both events are likely to focus on issues of maritime security in the East Asian region, including in the South China Sea. But while it is in India's interests to find a firmer footing with Japan, New Delhi should guard against attempts to project this relationship as a counterpoint to China.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/japans-aid-diplomacy-india/article2546625.ece
17,10,2011,Supporting the export effort,"The government's new “incentive” package for exporters is meant to help some of them cope with the looming uncertainties in the global markets. It will cost the exchequer Rs.900 crore. Taken along with the interest subsidy of 2 per cent announced by the Reserve Bank of India a couple of days earlier for labour-intensive industries such as handicrafts, handlooms, and carpets and for small and medium exporters, the cost will add up to at least Rs.1,700 crore. Obviously, there would be questions as to whether the amount is really enough to restore the competitive edge and whether it is well targeted. It is said that the new measures are part of the Foreign Trade Policy (2009-14) and will be incorporated in its next annual supplement. That should elevate what may seem to be ad hoc measures to the status of policy, giving them a semblance of durability. The intention clearly is to dovetail the ingredients of this package with the broader thrust of the foreign trade policy, which seeks to reward exporters who move into newer markets in Latin America, Africa, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), with an additional one percentage point duty credit. Around 50 products in the engineering, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals sectors would get the special bonus, subject to certain conditions. For many years now, the government's trade policy has aggressively promoted the diversification of India's exports to non-traditional markets and products.
That strategy appears to have paid off, if recent export performance is anything to go by. Between April and August this year, exports grew by 54.2 per cent over the same period a year ago to touch $134.5 billion. Such a scorching pace will be hard to sustain, however. India's traditional export markets — the United States and Europe — which account for about 35 per cent of the total, are facing uncertain times and virtually flat economic growth. Since Indian exporters would be hard pressed to sustain their volumes in these markets, let alone increase them, their initiatives to get into the non-traditional markets make good sense. The export performance has been commendable also because it has come in the face of large uncertainties caused by the fluctuating rupee and rising interest rates. Obviously, India's trade figures are extremely relevant in the larger context of balance of payments. According to RBI data, merchandise trade deficit has gone up to $35.54 billion from $31.38 billion during the first quarter of this fiscal year. That is another reason why export promotion ought to remain a top priority.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/supporting-the-export-effort/article2546624.ece
19,10,2011,J&K: a road map for progress,"Fourteen months after a tear gas shell arced over a Srinagar street, killing a teenage bystander who became the first of over a hundred young protesters to die in clashes with the police, New Delhi has something like a road map for progress. Last week, a three-member panel of interlocutors appointed by the central government to engage political actors in Jammu and Kashmir submitted its report. Based on meetings with more than 6,000 people who participated in 700 delegations from 22 districts, it was a sincere effort to address one of the world's most intractable conflicts. The report is not yet public; it is expected to be submitted first to the members of an all-parties delegation that visited J&K in September 2010. The interlocutors are known to have recommended to the State's major political formations that they must be willing to shed accumulated historical baggage. This itself should trigger a lively debate — and, with some luck, yield a template for action.
Much of the report is believed to focus on the fraught question of how to grant J&K the largest quantum of autonomy possible — while respecting constitutional red lines such as the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of India and the protection of fundamental rights. This State, the interlocutors are known to have argued, has a unique character as part of the Indian Union but with a distinct constitutional position enshrined in Article 370. Its residents have a special identity, as Indian citizens and subjects of an exceptional State. This identity, though, is made up of multiple, often conflicting, elements. In much reportage, the State's identity is conflated with its most influential and populous region — the Kashmir Valley. But the reality is that each of J&K's three major regions is home to multiple ethnicities. Any durable political solution must respect their aspirations — though the report, thankfully, is known to have shot down chauvinist proposals for ethnic-religious partitioning. The interlocutors are believed to have called for more movement across the Line of Control and the roll back of laws giving the armed forces special powers. As might be expected, they have reflected critically on the State's battered economy, its fragile administrative institutions, and its widespread corruption. Intriguingly, politicians across the board in J&K have been quick to dismiss the report — without reading it, of course. In the year since the outbreak of violence, Chief Minister Omar Abdullah's government has shown that improved governance and political outreach can help secure the peace. The report's authors, Dileep Padgaonkar, Radha Kumar, and M. M. Ansari, do not claim to have a solution to the J&K problem. What their efforts have shown is that the long-suffering peoples of a beautiful State have real ideas for building a better future — ideas their leaders ought to heed and follow up constructively.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/jk-a-road-map-for-progress/article2552465.ece
19,10,2011,India versus TB,"Although the number of new TB cases worldwide remains a matter of concern – the figure stood at nearly 9 million in 2010 – the incidence rate has been falling since 2002, according to a recent report of the World Health Organisation. Estimates of the year-wise number of deaths reveal a declining trend. Against this background, India presents a dismal picture. Last year, the case detection rate — the first and the most vital parameter — was only 59 per cent of all cases (both smear positive and smear negative). China, on the other hand, has made tremendous progress in this area — the case detection rate increased from 33 per cent in 2000 to 74 per cent in 2006 to 87 per cent in 2010. Prevalence was halved between 1990 and 2010 and the annual rate of decline, which was 2.2 per cent between 1990 and 2000, rose to 4.7 per cent in the next decade. The mortality rate was slashed by almost 80 per cent, and the incidence rate fell by 3.4 per cent, over the past 20 years.
The key factor behind China's success is the mandatory web-based TB reporting system that has been in operation since 2005. This covers virtually every health facility in the country. In addition, all TB deaths are required to be registered in all the 31 provinces. These hard-nosed initiatives have enabled the country to measure the prevalence of even multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB). In stark contrast, underreporting of TB incidence for 2010 in India was as high as 41 per cent, in WHO's reckoning. The reasons for this are not difficult to find. Data are collected only from the government-run institutions and there is no mandatory system for private practitioners to report every confirmed TB case. With many patients seeking treatment from non-government doctors, India's contribution to the world's notified cases in 2010 was surely much higher than WHO's estimate of 24 per cent. It is well established that a flawed reporting system and an inaccurate data base undermine the formulation of effective policies. Many private medical practitioners fail to diagnose the disease; and even when they do that, they tend to follow a regimen that is not standard, thereby contributing to the emergence of more MDR-TB cases. Two people die very three minutes in laid-back India from this infectious disease. The government must give the highest priority to the battle against TB, emulating countries that have done dramatically better on this front.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/india-versus-tb/article2552467.ece
19,10,2011,"Four winners, one loser","Four by-elections in four States cannot be held up as an index of the national public mood against corruption. But surely it is not without significance that while the winners were different, the loser was the same in each case: the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance. The Hisar Lok Sabha contest came to be seen as a referendum on the Congress by not only the party's political rivals, but also by Team Anna, which has been in the forefront of the campaign for an effective Lokpal Bill against corruption. The victory of Kuldeep Bishnoi of Haryana Janhit Congress, an ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party, was on the cards. The real setback for the Congress was a significant erosion in popular support, with its candidate finishing a distant third and losing the deposit. Corruption was a key issue in the election — and that hurt the Congress and nobody else. The shocker was in Khadakwasla Assembly constituency in Maharashtra, where the candidate of the party's ally, the Nationalist Congress Party, was the front runner. For all practical purposes, the fight was that of the senior partner: the candidate Harshada Wanjale was a former Congress Zilla Parishad member who contested on the NCP ticket as the seat was allotted to that party. Khadakwasla was the ruling alliance's best chance to take away something from this round of by-elections. It turned out to be a rout.
In the two other Assembly by-elections, in Daraunda in Bihar and Banswada in Andhra Pradesh, the stakes were not as high but the losses compounded the Congress's misery. In Daraunda, the Janata Dal(United), capitalising on the popularity of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, closed out both the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress. In Banswada, the game was quite different: Telangana overrode all other issues, and Pocharam Srinivas Reddy, who resigned as a Telugu Desam member to contest again as a Telangana Rashtra Samiti candidate, trounced the ruling Congress party candidate by a huge margin. For the loser, there were different lessons from the four by-elections. Hisar showed that corruption is a powerful issue, and that the party can no longer make light of the movement for a strong anti-corruption institutional mechanism. Khadakwasla taught the Congress and the NCP that opportunistic, short-sighted politics does not pay. Daraunda exposed the Congress's grassroots weaknesses. Banswada served as a reality check on the Telangana issue, demonstrating the spreading popular support for statehood in the region. A party in denial might be tempted to dismiss these results as no more than straws in the wind. The real point is that each one of the straws, coming from different directions, is a bearer of grim tidings.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/four-winners-one-loser/article2549323.ece
19,10,2011,ISAF fiddles the figures,"Press releases issued during wars may be deemed to be closer to propaganda than anything else but they still need careful analysis. A meticulously researched report by Alex Strick van Linschoten and Felix Kuehn published at the Afghanistan Analysts Network identifies cause for much concern in the 3,771 press releases put out by the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan between December 1, 2009 and September 30, 2011 ( >https://www.afghanistan-analysts.net/uploads/AAN_2011_ISAFPressReleases.pdf). The two researchers, who live in Kandahar, focussed on ISAF's kill-or-capture policy, the use of which increased sharply during General David Petraeus's time in command from July 2010 to July 2011. Their first conclusion is that, while ISAF has reduced its use of kill-or-capture, it has not ended the practice. Secondly, the strategy is supposed to be targeted at ‘leaders' and ‘facilitators' but in a total of 3,157 incidents, including 2,365 kill-or-capture raids, only 174 ‘leaders' and 25 ‘facilitators' were killed. Even by the military's own figures, these deaths amounted to 5 per cent of the total killed, while those detained made up 13 per cent of the 7,146 held. Thirdly, ISAF itself muddies the data by often putting ‘facilitators' in the ‘leaders' category; and its aggregated data sometimes do not match the figures in the press releases.
ISAF's media policy is riddled with contradictions. One ISAF official says that if his side does not “fill the early information void” after an event, the Taliban version will “win the day.” This means that accuracy is not an issue and the data cannot be trusted. But even the aim of beating the Taliban to the press is negated by the fact that only a few of the releases are put out in Dari or Pashto; the great majority are in English and are meant for foreign reception first and foremost. Obvious parallels arise with Iraq, where U.S. troops and their allies began releasing body counts without formal clearance from Washington — but had their figures challenged by eyewitnesses and survivors. The current media strategy implies that ISAF does not have to answer to Afghans and may even be indifferent to what they think of the incidents. In addition, it appears that the politicians and commanders directing foreign troops in Afghanistan are replicating the notorious practice of falsifying the figures to exaggerate their own successes for domestic consumption. The parallel here is really with Viet Nam. Both the invasion of Iraq and the war of aggression against Viet Nam were completely unlawful. ISAF, by contrast, has a United Nations mandate but by fiddling the figures it is undermining even its own formal legitimacy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/isaf-fiddles-the-figures/article2549320.ece
20,10,2011,A triangle of great promise,"Of all the foreign policy endeavours India has embarked upon in the last decade, the trans-continental partnership with Brazil and South Africa is surely one of the most innovative. IBSA is unique because the link between the three countries is not geographical but situational. Each finds itself occupying a similar position with the other two in the global matrix of economic, political, and strategic attributes. As large developing nations with dynamic, multi-branched economies, the IBSA trio have emerged as key players at the international level. As social democracies, they share a political culture that sees openness and the fulfilment of social obligations as key ingredients of governance. And as countries that have been denied their rightful place in global institutions, they share not just the goal of democratising bodies like the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund but also an approach to international politics that values dialogue and diplomacy over coercion and the use of force. That is why the IBSA forum has slowly expanded its agenda and sphere of activities. The Tshwane declaration issued at the recent summit in Pretoria offers a good indication of where the grouping is headed. Apart from the issues of global governance, development, and climate change, the document deals with diverse subjects like intellectual property rights, internet governance, and gender as well as a range of regional problems from Afghanistan and Syria to Somalia, Haiti, and Sri Lanka.
Given the turmoil in the international economy and the uncertainty emanating from the Eurozone nations, it was natural for the IBSA leaders to stress the need for Europe to implement a credible plan of structural reform. The three also agreed jointly to push for expansion of the UNSC. However, South Africa's inability to get the African Union to endorse the draft resolution being prepared by India, Brazil, Germany, and Japan — the G-4 — will likely limit its willingness to get into campaign mode in New York. Apart from resolving this disconnect, IBSA needs to deal with two other structural weaknesses. The level of intra-group economic and business relations is relatively low. Secondly, civil society and people-to-people interaction is negligible. The lack of transportation links speaks volumes for the absence of demand within the triangle. Some headway has been made at the level of trade and investment but not enough. The government can do only so much. It is for the private sector to realise the enormous opportunities that closer relations with Brazil and South Africa bring, in terms of markets and natural resources as well as access to their continents.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-triangle-of-great-promise/article2556137.ece
20,10,2011,Delhi as world heritage city,"Delhi, in the centenary year of its designation as a capital city, has taken the first serious step towards seeking World Heritage City status from UNESCO. Three years after initiating the exercise, the State government has commenced its active campaign by launching “Delhi: A Heritage City” project and preparing a dossier to back its credentials. Aside from honouring the city in a historical sense and enhancing tourism, the much-sought-after designation could significantly improve the conservation of priceless heritage. Delhi is one of the few metropolitan cities with a high concentration of heritage structures: 155 national monuments and another 1,000 culturally important places. Various historical periods have left their imprint and turned the city into an extraordinary mosaic. Shahjahanabad is a grand example of 17th century Mughal urban planning; Mehrauli, built around the 12th century Qutub Minar, is the oldest urban settlement in the city; and New Delhi or Lutyen's Delhi is an impressive expression of 20th century garden city principles. Sadly, conservation efforts have been neither adequate nor effective. About 14 national monuments have been encroached upon and numerous heritage structures lost; continued neglect has turned Shahjahanabad into a near-slum; and the old bungalows of New Delhi have been in constant danger of being pulled down to make way for multi-storeyed buildings.
If the campaign succeeds — and there is absolutely no reason why it shouldn't — Delhi will become the first Indian city to receive world heritage status. Like the 220 other world heritage cities across the world that have benefited from such designation, Delhi could reorient its conservation plans, moving away from the narrow building-centric approach and looking at protection of larger areas. A wider array of heritage elements such as gardens and squares could be safeguarded and the plan itself could be better integrated with contemporary development plans. To the credit of the Delhi government, the entire city has not been included in its proposal for world heritage status. To begin with, it plans to focus on four important heritage zones: Mehrauli, Shahjahanabad, New Delhi, and Nizamuddin. Each of these areas poses specific challenges and, quite obviously, one solution will not fit all. In the New Delhi zone, preserving the architectural character and open space must be the priority, while in Shahjahanabad the thrust has to be on improving the delivery of urban services and retrofitting housing stock. It is only by being inclusive and enabling cities to become better places to live in that conservation can succeed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/delhi-as-world-heritage-city/article2556135.ece
21,10,2011,The killing of Qadhafi,"The violent death of Col. Muammar Qadhafi is the worst possible beginning for a new Libya where 42 years of dictatorial and whimsical rule by a strongman are supposed to make way for democratic structures. The exact circumstances in which Col. Qadhafi was killed are unclear. It is known that NATO bombed a convoy in which he was trying to flee a blockade of his hometown Sirte by forces allied to the National Transitional Council government. He might have been wounded in the bombing; subsequent video footage shows him asking for mercy from his captors. The NTC, which took power after over-running the Qadhafi regime two months ago with NATO's assistance, has said he was shot in crossfire between its forces and his loyalists. But reports from the ground suggest he was executed in cold blood. Libya has failed its first democratic test, with vengeance and bloodlust triumphing over due process, the rule of law, and justice. NATO is deeply complicit in this. The role of western powers, especially the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, through this sorry saga of violent regime change reiterates the question that has been asked ever since NATO began bombing Libya, ostensibly as a “humanitarian intervention” authorised by the United Nations Security Council: does the West want democracy in Libya or just any friendly regime that will give it access to the country's oil? It is disappointing that India, which opposed external intervention in Libya, has expressed no concern at Qadhafi's violent end.
Muammar Qadhafi will certainly not be mourned as a great leader of his people. His rule did bring about positive changes for his country, notably in health, education, and infrastructure development. In contrast to other Arab states, it also gave Libyans a consciousness about their oil wealth as a national resource. But he was a ruthless dictator, and his regime was infamous for crushing dissent by imprisoning, torturing, and killing a large number of political opponents. Qadhafi's Libya was also associated with deadly terrorist acts in Europe, including the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am plane over Lockerbie in Scotland, for which the world imposed sanctions on the country. It was only after 9/11 that both the West and Qadhafi saw opportunities in compromise: after condemning Osama bin Laden, he gave up Libya's nuclear programme and surrendered two suspects in the Lockerbie bombing, in return for a lifting of international sanctions. With Qadhafi gone, the NTC will no doubt move to cement its hold on power. But if it genuinely wants to set Libya on the right path, it would do well to begin by conducting an honest and impartial investigation into Qadhafi's killing.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-killing-of-qadhafi/article2559752.ece
21,10,2011,Paid news claims its price,"The Election Commission of India's disqualification of Umlesh Yadav, sitting MLA from Bisauli in Uttar Pradesh, is a landmark order that notches some firsts for India's electoral democracy. Ms Yadav was disqualified on Thursday under Section 10-A of the Representation of the People Act 1951 for a period of three years for failing to provide a “true and correct account” of her election expenses. She had failed to include in her official poll accounts the amount she spent on advertisements, dressed up as news, in two Hindi dailies, Dainik Jagran and Amar Ujala, during her 2007 election campaign. The case arose out of an adjudication by the Press Council of India on the complaint of a losing candidate against the two dailies for publishing paid news. After holding the newspapers “guilty of ethical violations” and issuing a caution to them, the Council sent its adjudication to the ECI “for such action as deemed fit by them.” No sitting MP or MLA before Ms Yadav, wife of a liqour baron and strongman, has ever been disqualified by the ECI on grounds of excessive expenditure — and certainly none on account of paid news. This is also the first verdict in the paid news saga — a scandal that has hurt the credibility of the Indian news media and demoralised journalists — and it comes just after the Delhi High Court's dismissal of former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan's petition challenging the ECI's jurisdiction in probing the truth or falsity of his 2009 poll expenses. The High Court affirmed the ECI's powers to do so.
The potential ramifications of Ms Yadav's disqualification are enormous. In the pipeline are the paid news cases of Mr. Chavan and former Jharkhand Chief Minister Madhu Koda. There will be others coming up too, as the public realises that it now has recourse against the abuse of money power, where earlier it felt helpless. The verdict should, hopefully, act as a deterrent to obscene spending in elections. In its 23-page order (http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/recent/Disqualification_case_Umkesh_Yadav.pdf), the ECI makes the wider and vital observation that “by suppressing expenditure on ‘paid news' and filing an incorrect or false account, the candidate involved is guilty of not merely circumventing the law relating to election expenses but also of resorting to false propaganda by projecting a wrong picture and defrauding the electorate.” The ECI deserves the highest praise for functioning without fear or favour as the upstanding institution of Indian democracy that it is. The question does pop up, though: what about the newspapers and television channels that enable “defrauding the electorate”?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/paid-news-claims-its-price/article2559714.ece
24,10,2011,An extended honeymoon,"Honeymoons, by definition, do not last long. But in Tamil Nadu, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam appears to have found a way to prolong the political honeymoon with the voters. After scoring a landslide win in the Legislative Assembly election held in April, the AIADMK swept the local body polls last week, capturing all the 10 corporations, and a majority of the municipalities, town panchayats, district panchayat wards, and panchayat union wards. And in the by-election to the Tiruchi (West) Assembly constituency, the party more than doubled its April victory margin. All this was achieved without the support of its major allies, notably the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam led by actor Vijayakant and the two Left parties. These three parties had formed a separate front for the local body polls, after differences surfaced with the senior partner over seat-sharing, but finished well behind the AIADMK and the principal opposition, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Like the AIADMK, the DMK contested without entering into seat adjustments with its Assembly election partners but, unlike the ruling party, it failed to make any gains. To nobody's surprise, the Congress, contesting alone, failed to win even a single corporation or municipality. The Pattali Makkal Katchi and the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, former allies of the DMK, fared worse. The Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, which boycotted the Assembly election after seat-sharing talks with the AIADMK broke down, won the chairmanship of one municipality and seven town panchayats, but was not in the reckoning in most other places.
For the AIADMK, the results were an endorsement of the schemes and policies of the Jayalalithaa government in the last six months. Besides implementing the ‘free rice' scheme, the government began fulfilling the election promises in quick time. Indeed, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa created a new Ministry for Special Programme Implementation to push through priority schemes such as free laptops for school and college students and mixers and grinders for the cardholders in the Public Distribution System. The welfare schemes aside, the AIADMK government appears to have got good ratings for its performance on the law and order front, and especially for its measures to reverse land grabbing. Unlike in 2001 and 2006, the local body elections this time were free of large-scale violence and irregularities. Now, with this reinforced mandate, the Chief Minister must ensure that the local bodies have sufficient funds and administrative autonomy so that they are enabled to function effectively as grass-roots democratic institutions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-extended-honeymoon/article2565324.ece
24,10,2011,"Names, novels and the Booker","The Man Booker Prize was instituted in 1969 to reward the ‘best' novel of the year written by a citizen of a Commonwealth country or the Republic of Ireland. This annual prize is so influential now that it transforms the fortunes of authors and their publishers. But once in a while it seems to get deflected from its stated purpose, giving rise to the suspicion that it is awarded not so much for the book in contention as for the whole body of work of the writer. Nobody doubted that Margaret Atwood, shortlisted thrice before she won in 2000, was the most deserving winner. But, as it was hotly debated then, did she really win for The Blind Assassin or was it that it was no longer possible to ignore an author of her stature? When Ian McEwan, rated by The Times as one of “the 50 greatest British writers since 1945,” won for Amsterdam in 1998, the question was asked: was it the literary merit of the novel or his literary oeuvre that did it? This year's prize engenders a similar feeling of discomfort. Julian Barnes's The Sense of an Ending is an endearing and enjoyable book. But this resonant semi-autobiographical novella about growing up in the face of the unreliability of memory, the capacity for self-deception, and the encumbrance of guilt is a much slighter work than his wickedly funny and architecturally complex A History of the World in 10-1/2 Chapters, the erudite and meditative Flaubert's Parrot, and the inventive quasi-historical Arthur and George.
With an output of 11 novels and a half-a-dozen works of non-fiction (not to mention pseudonymously written crime novels), Barnes's place in Britain's literary A-list is well established. Shortlisted for the award, the 65-year-old novelist was justified in feeling “mild paranoia” on whether he would ever win a Booker, which he once described as a “posh bingo.” In this year's shortlist, which the chairperson of the judges declared controversially was chosen for “readability” (as opposed to literary inventiveness or merit, inferred some critics), Barnes was the only weighty name, the odds-on favourite of bookmakers. Of course, the Booker usually places novels well above names, which is what lends this prize its special and seemingly impudent appeal. The award has brought prestige and attention to new novelists (Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children was his second, Arundhati Roy's The God of Small Things was her debut). It has also gone to a number of other richly deserving works such as Kazuo Ishiguro's The Remains of the Day, Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient, and, more recently, Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall. The Prize has had its share of controversies, but is only the richer for it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/names-novels-and-the-booker/article2565326.ece
25,10,2011,An opening with Nepal,"The most significant outcome of Nepali Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai's visit to India is the growing trust between the two countries, and between the Indian establishment and his own party, the Unified Communist Part of Nepal (Maoist). The stagnation that marked the bilateral relationship is now broken. New Delhi's policy of trying to keep the Maoists — the legitimately elected biggest party in parliament — out of the power structure over the past two years was counter-productive. It only prolonged the stalemate over constitutional issues, deepened the instability, and generated resentment against India. But there has been a policy course-correction in the last few months. India did well not to try and block the election of Mr. Bhattarai as Prime Minister by using its leverage with the Madhesi parties. The immediate invitation extended to the new leader, the low-key efforts by the new Indian Ambassador in Kathmandu encouraging all sides to be flexible, the new support for the integration of a certain number of Maoist combatants into the Nepal Army, and the atmospherics of the prime ministerial visit show a renewed Indian commitment to playing a constructive role. With a section of the Indian establishment remaining uncomfortable with the emerging rapprochement, Nepal's opposition parties seem to have lobbied with senior members of the Indian cabinet to slow down the engagement with Maoists. Fortunately, this didn't work.
Nepal appears to be on the verge of achieving a breakthrough in its peace and constitutional process. Its political parties are close to an agreement on the issue of the integration of Maoist fighters, which is at the core of the peace process. There is also a power-sharing proposal on the table, with the Maoists saying the Nepali Congress president, Sushil Koirala, can be the next Prime Minister who will lead the country into elections after promulgation of the new constitution. India must play a supportive role, as it did in 2005 when the 12-point agreement was forged. It should continue supporting the present government in its quest to wrap up the political transition, use its leverage with the Nepali Congress to get it to cooperate on the peace process, and nudge the Maoists to implement past commitments. Prime Minister Bhattarai and the Maoists took a political risk in signing the Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement — his rivals back home have dubbed it an ‘anti-national' deal — because they want to tell India that they can deliver on contentious issues, including the security of Indian investment. It is vital that India recognises these changing political realities in Nepal, and plays the role of a constructive facilitator once again.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-opening-with-nepal/article2568355.ece
25,10,2011,Eliminating encephalitis,"The scourge of encephalitis has once again struck parts of Uttar Pradesh and killed or crippled a large number of children. This dance of death has become an annual feature. The public health community views it as a crisis that can be controlled, if the political will to engage in reforms exists. For one thing, the pattern of the epidemic, with Gorakhpur as its nucleus, has been studied well, after a major outbreak more than three decades ago. It is clearly linked to the monsoon rain, which inundates the large number of rice fields in this area, leading to a rapid rise in the density of Culex mosquitoes. The period between July and November then becomes transmission season for encephalitis through mosquito bites. The epidemic is amplified by the presence of large numbers of pigs, which act as hosts. What all this underscores is the need for a State-wide massive prevention campaign that should consist of three parts: distributing insecticide-treated bed nets, free or subsidised, to protect against mosquito bites; creating awareness on the need to keep pigs away from habitations; and persuading people to avoid outdoor movement when the mosquito is most active. Gorakhpur, where more than one child is assigned to the same hospital bed during an epidemic, also needs rapid expansion of its infrastructure.
Prevention is likely to be the more effective approach to curb the spread of encephalitis in India. The Indian Council of Medical Research is yet to confirm the different virus strains causing the annual epidemics. Last year, the ICMR said Japanese Encephalitis represents only about 15 per cent of the fatal cases, and it would take more research to isolate the other viruses. Union Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad has reiterated this view. If this is correct, vaccination against Japanese Encephalitis can only be of limited value, even if it is scaled up to cover the entire population. Public health policy should therefore focus on removing the factors that aid transmission. This can only be achieved through massive investments in hygienic housing, sanitation, supply of bed nets, vector control, and behaviour modification. Relocating pigs is a sensitive issue in the encephalitis-hit districts, and calls for measures that inspire confidence in the community. Andhra Pradesh has carried out such a programme successfully and may offer important lessons. Moreover, incentives for hygienic practices are bound to persuade those rearing the animals to do the right thing. What is worrying is that the infection is spreading — to more places in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The epidemic needs action on a war footing.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/eliminating-encephalitis/article2568353.ece
26,10,2011,End of the tightening cycle,"Given that inflation continues to be the main worry for policymakers, it is not surprising that the Reserve Bank of India, in its second quarter review of monetary policy, has extended its policy of monetary tightening, raising the repo rate by another 0.25 percentage point to 8.50 per cent. Although manufacturing and core inflation have moderated sequentially, year-on-year inflation continues to rule well above the RBI's medium-term targets. Arguing that any premature withdrawal from what has been a consistent policy stance since February 2010 will entail the risk of leaving inflation expectations unhinged, the RBI has, for now, ignored the growing clamour for a “pause” in hiking interest rates. It has, however, conceded that some important growth indicators are slowing down at a rate faster rate than anticipated, partly due to the delayed impact of previous interest rate hikes. Slower growth in the United States and the spiralling sovereign debt problems in Europe pose significant challenges for the management of external economy. Petroleum prices remain sticky and the sharp depreciation in the rupee can offset the gains from the fall in other commodity prices. However, the good news is that, in RBI's assessment, inflation is likely to moderate from December onwards. In its clearest message yet of a softer monetary policy ahead, the RBI says that the possibility of a rate hike in the December policy review “is relatively low”. While retaining its inflation target for March 31, 2012 at 7 per cent, the RBI says that monetary policy will have more room for addressing short-term growth concerns.
The RBI's growth estimates have generally been more conservative than those of the government. In May, the annual policy statement had projected an 8 per cent growth for 2011-12, at least 0.50 percentage point higher than what most official estimates indicated. In the light of growth trends during the first half of the year, the RBI has revised it to 7.6 per cent. Among the development and regulatory policies announced along with the review, the deregulation of savings bank interest rate stands out. With this, administered interest rates will be confined to a very narrow spectrum of small savings schemes. Ironically it was only recently the government decided to borrow Rs.50,000 crore more than was budgeted to offset a huge fall in small savings collections, which were drifting towards bank deposits. In a deregulated environment there will be stiffer competition and that should be good for savings bank account-holders. But the biggest impact will be on the banks themselves. The way the leading ones manage their balance sheets will be keenly watched.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/end-of-the-tightening-cycle/article2571381.ece
26,10,2011,A well deserved triumph,"President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner of Argentina has won re-election in a landslide which is historic for several reasons. With voting compulsory and 97 per cent of results declared, the winner's vote share of 54 per cent obviates the need for a runoff. The victory margin of 36 percentage points over the second-placed Hermes Binner of the Broad Progressive Front is the second largest in the country's history. It is exceeded only by the legendary Juan Perón's win in 1973, which included additional support under the complex two-round system for presidential elections. This time, Ms Kirchner won over 90 per cent of the vote in some provinces. Secondly, she is the first woman head of state in Latin America to win a second successive term in office. Thirdly, the President's Victory Front coalition has won eight out of nine provincial governorships, recapturing the wine-growing Mendoza province in the process. In effect, the electorate has resoundingly endorsed the political and economic strategies followed by Ms Kirchner and her predecessor, her late husband Néstor Kirchner.
Furthermore, the election results send messages far beyond Argentina's borders. They are consistent with the strong left and centre-left commitments Latin American voters have shown for a dozen years now, in Venezuela, Bolivia, Brazil, and Chile as well as Argentina. They also confirm the benefits of well-strategised government intervention in the economy. In the last decade, Argentine GDP has grown by 94 per cent and poverty among the 41 million population has declined by two thirds. Moreover, inequalities have been reduced, in contrast to countries where high aggregate growth has been accompanied by huge increases in inequality. It is true that Buenos Aires will need a backup plan for what is expected to be a slowdown in the country's global trade. Inflation at a decadal peak of 20 per cent remains a concern. But the successive Kirchner governments' strategies expose the hollowness of two current orthodoxies. The first is that recessions must be followed only by slow recoveries; the Argentine economy was back on its feet within three years of a financial meltdown in the late 1990s. The second shibboleth is that debt requires economic shrinkage. Argentina's revival started after it defaulted on a $95 billion debt and resolutely ignored the prescriptions of international financial institutions in order to revive a broadly interventionist political economy. That strategy could be a model for many other countries, and Ms Kirchner's renewed four-year mandate is therefore all the more welcome.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-well-deserved-triumph/article2571384.ece
28,10,2011,Recycle the bulb,"India consumes a few hundred million energy-efficient compact fluorescent lamps every year and the volumes are growing. This is welcome news not just for the lighting industry, which places the number of pieces manufactured in 2010 at around 304 million, but also for climate change mitigation efforts. Yet this also presents a waste management challenge. The problem with fluorescent lamps is that they contain small amounts of mercury. Unfortunately, India has not evolved a good system to recover this hazardous heavy metal from end-of-life lamps. Moreover, the trend is towards dosing CFLs made in India with levels of mercury that exceed the international norm, apparently to improve their performance. A recent study by Toxics Link, a non-governmental organisation, indicates that mercury levels in domestic CFLs may even be four to six times the norm in developed countries. The issue was acknowledged by the Central Pollution Control Board three years ago. Since disused CFL and mercury-laden lamps, and fluorescent tubes, are generally dumped in municipal waste or sold to unorganised recyclers, there is harmful release of mercury into the soil, water, and air. This is happening in spite of the forward-looking “Guidelines for Environmentally Sound Mercury Management in the Fluorescent Lamp Sector” the Board issued in 2008.
Mercury can cause serious, well-recognised health effects when there is chronic exposure. Permanent damage to skin, eyes, and respiratory tract and other symptoms are caused upon skin contact, inhalation of vapour, or ingestion. The onus is on the State Pollution Control Boards, which are responsible for the handling and management of hazardous waste, to ensure that environmental exposure to this toxic chemical is eliminated. The imperative is to reduce the amount of mercury that goes into CFLs through standards and regulatory controls and enforce the principle of extended producer responsibility for the collection and disposal of waste. This cannot be achieved without the active involvement of municipal authorities, manufacturers, and the trade. The way forward would be to provide a financial incentive to consumers for turning in old mercury lamps of all types, particularly conventional fluorescent tube lights and CFLs, and to ensure their scientific disposal through a network of authorised recyclers. Such a system can succeed because there is greater awareness of negative externalities among consumers today. For instance, shoppers are willing to pay extra for plastic bags as required by the new Environment Ministry rules; many use their own bags. In the case of used light bulbs, consumers stand to gain if the rewards-based system is introduced. Recycling mercury lamps should be an environmental priority.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Recycle-the-bulb/article13470882.ece
28,10,2011,Conquering malaria,"When the World Health Organisation published its revised guidelines for malaria treatment in March 2010, just four years after it came out with its maiden version, an editorial in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) was quick to highlight its significance. It was a “testament of how quickly malaria control” had developed and a “marked reduction in the global burden of malaria” had been achieved. A WHO report now confirms this assessment. There has been a 20 per cent drop in the number of malarial deaths during the last decade — from about one million deaths in 2000 to about 800,000 in 2009. The number of infections fell from 233 million to 225 million. About a third of the 108 countries where the disease is endemic may be able to eradicate it in a decade if all targets continue to be met. In India, the annual number of confirmed cases has remained “stable” at 1.5 million since 2007. But according to a 2008 WHO report, the number of cases reported by countries was “only 37 per cent of the estimated global incidence.” And the gap between reported numbers and true incidence “was greatest in [the] South-East Asia region,” where 10 of the 11 countries were malaria endemic. This gap certainly exists in India. The data collection is poor and is mainly confined to the nine States that are highly endemic — Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, and West Bengal.
The battle against mosquitoes can be won when an efficacious vaccine becomes available. Interim results of a Phase-III trial undertaken in seven African countries on more than 15,000 children of two age groups — 6 to 12 weeks and 5 to 17 months — show some promise. Fifty-five per cent protection was seen in children belonging to the older age group. However, efficacy declined with time, and adverse events like meningitis and seizures were observed in the vaccinated children. Although complete results will be available only by 2014, WHO has taken the “unusual step of recommending” the vaccine for use in some African countries by 2015 if the final results turn out to be favourable, as The New England Journal of Medicine notes in an editorial. In the absence of a vaccine, insecticide-treated mosquito nets and indoor spraying will continue to be the two potent preventive weapons. Though the preventive tools were able to cut malaria cases and deaths by half in 11 African countries, the malaria control programme could be declared successful only when the disease ceases to be a mass killer in Africa and South-East Asia.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/conquering-malaria/article2574393.ece
29,10,2011,Kashmir: why AFSPA must go,"More than 23 years after the bombing that signalled the beginning of the murderous insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir, India's strategic establishment is demonstrating a curious unwillingness to grasp the fact that the war to restore peace has been won. Ever since 2009, Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has been advocating the withdrawal of the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act from parts of the State, as a first step towards an incremental rollback of the Army's presence in civilian-inhabited areas — a source of everyday friction with civilians. Even though Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram has backed the idea, and a report by three government interlocutors has endorsed it, New Delhi has proved unwilling to act, in part because of bitter resistance by the Indian Army. Based on an analysis of central government data, this newspaper reported on Friday that J&K was more peaceful than many ‘perfectly peaceful' States — among them, economically vibrant Haryana. In population-adjusted terms, violent deaths in J&K — those of terrorists and security force personnel, as well as murders of civilians, whether terrorism-related or otherwise — were at the same level as in Bihar, and not significantly higher than in Delhi. No one in New Delhi, though, wishes to be charged with overruling an assessment by the armed forces — an assessment which, regrettably, is driven more by fear than hard-headed strategic sense.
Three spurious arguments are being used to justify the status quo. First, the Army contends that the situation across the Line of Control needs a robust military presence. But Mr. Abdullah isn't proposing removing a single soldier. His proposals would only lift AFSPA from two areas where the Army in any case has no security responsibilities. If things went well, troops would be freed up for deployment along the LoC, leaving the State and central police forces to deal with the degraded insurgency. Secondly, it is claimed that without AFSPA, the Army will not be able to stage counter-terrorism operations in an emergency. Proponents of this argument forget that AFSPA did not have to be imposed to allow the Army to assist in the defence of Parliament House when it came under terrorist attack in 2001 — and that the Army staged many successful counter-terrorism operations in Jammu province before AFSPA was imposed there in 2001. Finally, some argue that the AFSPA-free enclaves will be magnets for terrorists. This, too, makes little sense, since the Army is not present in the enclaves anyway — and it is improbable that terrorists have not established themselves there for fear of a mere law. Chief Minister Abdullah's proposals do entail risks. Yet not taking those risks involves heavy costs — key among them, creating a reservoir of frustration and anger that will undermine the hard-won peace that so many Indian soldiers gave their lives for.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/kashmir-why-afspa-must-go/article2577520.ece
29,10,2011,A new deal for Europe,"It is not the first time that a high-level summit of Europe's leaders has claimed a breakthrough in providing solutions to the Continent's festering debt crisis. The emergency deal struck on Thursday at Brussels after a marathon session is comprehensive and can mitigate the rigour of the debt crisis which has threatened the financial stability of not just Europe but virtually the entire global economy. The deal has three elements. One, with a renewed focus on Greece, political leaders persuaded reluctant private banks holding Greek debt to accept a write-off of 50 per cent of their returns. This is much more than the 40 per cent “hair-cut” that banks were willing to offer. The move, which holds the key to the success of the overall strategy, is expected to cut Greece's debt burden to 120 per cent of its GDP in 2020. Without it, the debt would have risen to 180 per cent. Secondly, the corpus of the main euro bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), is being increased substantially from €440 billion to €1 trillion. This is meant to prevent market panic from spreading to other countries, notably Italy. The fund will be leveraged four to five times to enhance its fire power.
Thirdly, European banks are asked to raise about €106 billion in new capital by June 2012. Such a massive recapitalisation, it is hoped, will shield not only the banks against losses resulting from government defaults, but will also protect the larger economies such as Spain and Italy from slipping into default. The financial markets around the world have responded favourably to the news of the package. The euro has risen. While the leaders can justifiably claim to have engineered the breakthrough, it is clear that the success of the package is contingent on whether, and to what extent, Greece and the eurozone are able to convince the markets that the worst will be over soon. However, even the reduced debt burden Greece will carry till 2020 is hard to service by an economy that will be subjected to harsh austerity measures. Investors need to be convinced that the money promised for the bailout fund will in fact be available, preferably through simpler structures than what has been proposed. Finally, infusion of public money into big European banks might have boosted bank stocks, but the larger, fundamental question of whether taxpayers should bailout banks that have been reckless in their operations remains unanswered.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-new-deal-for-europe/article2577523.ece
31,10,2011,Covering all subjects,"The British Prime Minister, David Cameron, has announced one of the most radical changes in the law of succession to the British throne, by informing the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Perth that the principle of male primogeniture is to be ended. Henceforth, the first offspring, whether male or female, of any British monarch will take precedence in the line of succession. The 1701 Act of Settlement, under which female offspring can ascend the throne only if there are no male heirs, will have to be amended. Another change proposed is that the ban on succession if the heir is married to a Roman Catholic will be lifted, but the monarch himself or herself will have to be an Anglican and will continue to be Supreme Governor of the Church of England. The new law will not have retrospective effect — but the first child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will have precedence whether or not the current law has been amended before the child is born. It is appropriate that Mr. Cameron has announced the changes to CHOGM, as no fewer than 15 other Commonwealth countries that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as head of state will need to amend their own legislation accordingly.
The abolition of male primogeniture is long overdue; the Queen, in her speech at the Perth meeting, noted the need for gender equality in public life. The measure will also bring the British monarchy more into line with the times. Many British constitutional developments, such as the Act of Settlement and the 1689 Bill of Rights, were pragmatic resolutions of urgent political problems, but became key principles in the country's uncodified constitution. The new law will also end a problem under the Human Rights Act 1998, which requires that primary and secondary legislation be read and given effect to in ways that are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. Some major issues, however, are still unaddressed. To start with, Mr. Cameron appears not to plan large changes to the Act of Settlement despite the fact that it is so hostile to Catholicism that it could not be drafted today — Catholics will still be banned from holding the monarchy. Secondly, the Bill of Rights is not a statement of citizens' rights. It transfers almost all power from the monarch to the British parliament, and such rights as are given specifically to United Kingdom nationals are potentially revocable. The new law on succession will be morally right, but U.K. nationals will remain, substantively, subjects of the monarch, male or female, not citizens of the state.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/covering-all-subjects/article2582948.ece
31,10,2011,No risk of brain tumour,"Five months after the World Health Organisation classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as only “possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B),” the findings of a study published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) suggest no risk of brain tumour from mobile phone use. There was no indication of “dose-response relation either by years or by anatomical location of the tumour” (“Use of mobile phones and risk of brain tumours: update of Danish cohort study,” by Patrizia Frei et al.). It was found to be true even among those who used mobile phones for more than 10 years. The conclusion is in line with more than a dozen large studies that looked for a possible link, including the first cohort study involving more than 400,000 Danish phone subscribers. In the latest instance, the study covered those diagnosed with brain tumour between 1990 and 2007 among more than 350,000 mobile phone subscribers in Denmark. By using digitised subscriber data obtained from operators, the researchers avoided two important methodological shortcomings — that of relying on users' ability to recall phone usage pattern and, two, selection bias.
But the study has certain limitations. The conclusion was not based on the actual use of mobile phones — the period of subscription was used as a surrogate for phone usage. The compounding limitation was the potential misclassification of exposure. Corporate subscriptions were excluded from the study, and the data on subscribers were available only till 1995. Hence all corporate subscribers and those who had a subscription post-1995 were labelled ‘non-users'. However, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to conduct proper case-controlled studies that are free from selection and recall biases. For various reasons, even the most robust study to find a link based on usage pattern over the last 10 years or more will not be able to arrive at a correct conclusion. For instance, older analog phones used more energy than the currently available digital versions. Moreover, the energy given off by all the latest phones is not the same, and it also varies according to the strength of the signal — more energy is emitted when the signal is poor. Studies looking at effects from long-term usage will have little relevance to children, whose use of mobile phones has grown dramatically in recent years. Therefore, the need to adopt a precautionary approach to the use of mobile phones, especially by children, becomes extremely important. This, despite the fact that developed countries have witnessed no sudden spurt in brain tumour incidence, and the radiowaves, unlike X-rays and gamma rays, are non-ionising in nature and do not have the energy to damage cellular DNA.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-risk-of-brain-tumour/article2582949.ece
1,11,2011,Seven billion and counting,"Is the population bomb ticking again? The world has crossed the milestone of seven billion people, and there is renewed debate on the impact of a growing number of humans on the planet's finite resources. Neo-Malthusian arguments, centred mostly on environmental concerns, are pitted against the optimistic view that economic development will safely stabilise birth rates. The population question is complex and there is no panacea for the travails of hundreds of millions of deprived citizens who need food, shelter, safe water, and energy. It is distressing that more than 800 million people live in slums and a similar number, mostly women, are not literate. In the popular imagination, growing populations can only have a negative outcome, depleting scarce resources faster — more so in an era of economic uncertainty. The dilemma therefore is whether to enlarge the pie or reduce the number of hands competing for a share. Empirical evidence supports the humane answer, which is simply to have more development. Crucially, this demands sharing the fruits of economic growth with the less privileged through access to education, health care, and welfare, besides re-distribution of wealth. Particularly significant is the role played by education and empowerment of women.
Developing countries with higher population growth rates are often viewed as the source of an emerging environmental crisis. That perspective is narrow and flawed, given the patterns of resource consumption. As India's Nobel laureate Amartya Sen observed in a 1994 essay titled “Population: Delusion and Reality” ( New York Review of Books), “one additional American typically has a larger negative impact on the ozone layer, global warmth, and other elements of the earth's environment than dozens of Indians and Zimbabweans put together.” That was true even before the world had six billion people, and the pattern remains unchanged, although a small minority of profligate emerging economy consumers now have a comparable ecological footprint. What reinforces fears of overpopulation the most is the visibly desperate living condition of large numbers of the poor. It is this that governments must address on top priority. They also need to prepare for a difficult future in which greater life expectancy coupled with falling birth rates would produce an ‘inverted pyramid' — an enlarging geriatric population and shrinking numbers of young men and women. Equally important is preserving the natural environment, which has thus far enabled increasing levels of food production. Only a rising quality of life can lead to voluntary stabilisation of the world's population, which is projected by the United Nations to touch 9.3 billion by 2050.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/seven-billion-and-counting/article2586282.ece
1,11,2011,Tunisian voters lead the way,"As expected, victory in the Tunisian general election has been claimed by the Islamist party An-Nahda, led by Rachid Ghannouchi. Going by early results, it has won about 40 per cent of the vote, with the remainder shared among four other parties, including two on the centre-left, namely Ettakatol (the Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties) and the Progressive Democratic Party. The proportional electoral system is unlikely to deliver an outright winner. An-Nahda is likely to head a coalition in the 217-seat constituent assembly, which is tasked with deciding on a government and also has a year to write a new constitution. The 7.5 million voters, many of whom were voting for the first time, showed their commitment with turnouts of better than 90 per cent in many areas. There were no fewer than 11,000 candidates from 110 parties. Half the party list places were reserved for women, with the names of men and women alternated so that women were not relegated to the bottom of the ballot papers. The Tunisian people, who in January 2011 became the first in West Asia and North Africa to reclaim their state, have led the way again in participating in free and fair elections.
The hard political work that now awaits them will be made all the more complex by a society that stands out in the region, as a result of the secularisation imposed by Habib Bourguiba, who led the country to independence from France in 1956. Polygamy is banned, the minimum marriageable age for women is 18, and women have abortion rights. In addition, female literacy is over 65 per cent, rising to 96 per cent in the 15-24 age group. Women play a substantial part in public life and in all occupations. Tunisia's rural population, however, is culturally conservative, and clearly expects An-Nahda, which it supports strongly, not to force the pace of social change. That pressure on the majority party will make it difficult for the coalition partners to agree on key constitutional points such as the status of religious law. Mr. Ghannouchi, a scholar who was imprisoned by the deposed strongman Zine el Abidine Ben Ali and also spent 22 years in exile, insists that members of his party are democrats first and Islamists second, but opposition supporters are sceptical about that statement. In addition, major institutions of state such as the judiciary, the military, and the police are likely to resist, and may even undermine, attempts to create a substantive democracy in which public officials are answerable to the people. Nevertheless, the Tunisian election has been a triumph for the people, and is a beacon for the rest of West Asia and North Africa.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tunisian-voters-lead-the-way/article2586286.ece
2,11,2011,Human rights and the Commonwealth,"The fracas at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth over a proposal to appoint a human rights monitor has reopened an old debate that pits national sovereignty against an international human rights regime. India and Sri Lanka were among the countries that opposed the idea of a Human Rights Commissioner for the Commonwealth nations. The proposal has been given up, at least for now. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights is possibly the finest document of the world's aspiration to treat all human beings equally and with dignity. Even though the UDHR was assailed from the beginning by some as a western construct that ignored cultural and religious differences, most countries, including India, are signatories to it and its various covenants. What really undermines the international rights framework is the perception that the international human rights mechanisms are a weapon in the hands of powerful countries to lord it over less powerful states, through economic sanctions or other means. The perception is strengthened by the flagrant double standards in the way rights issues are raised. For instance, Australia and the United Kingdom, in the forefront of the Commonwealth human rights campaign, are quite content to ignore alleged violations in China or India, where their own interests — principally economic ones — are involved. Canada is outraged by rights violations during Sri Lanka's military victory over the LTTE, but is quiet about the appalling toll of civilian deaths in U.S. drone attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Another eye-opener has been in the western handling of the Arab Spring in Libya on the one hand, and in Bahrain on the other.
It is for this reason that India — which has resisted cultural and religious exceptionalism to human rights at the United Nations — was correct in opposing the Commonwealth's efforts to impose another layer of international scrutiny into the conduct of member-states. This is not to give a clean bill of health to the Indian record: in some places, such as Jammu & Kashmir, in the North-East, and in areas hit by the Maoist insurgency, the shocking and repeated instances of rights violations by the security forces are a blot on the country's democratic credentials. But outside intervention cannot be the answer. Aside from enabling external actors with unclean hands to assume control of governance, it often ends up discrediting local efforts to improve the situation. It is understandable that the Commonwealth, a grouping of former British colonies, is striving to remain relevant in the present day. Meddling in the affairs of member-states, whether it is Pakistan, or Sri Lanka, or India or Zimbabwe, is not the way to go about it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/human-rights-and-the-commonwealth/article2589381.ece
2,11,2011,Formula One in India,"In a country of nearly 1.2 billion people where over 60 per cent are below any commonsensical definition of the poverty line, it is quite natural that motorsport, especially Formula One, is associated with the rich, new Indian elite. This is perhaps why the debate whether motor racing is a sport or a meaningless exercise involving profligate spending still rages on in the country. Recently P.T. Usha, one of the greatest athletes the country has produced, trashed Formula One as a criminal waste of money. There are not many who think differently. However, understanding the nuances of F1 would enable people to appreciate the sport better. And the truth is F1 is a sport and a business. The top Indian business houses vying for advertising space during the inaugural Grand Prix of India held at the Buddh International Circuit (BIC) in Greater Noida showed that F1, which has a total global television audience of 527 million, is indeed a fantastic medium for promoting brands in overseas markets. The sport could also act as a powerful vehicle for the steadily growing Indian automotive sector to position its brands globally. After all, the engine maps and components used in the F1 car are not very dissimilar to the ones in a road car today.
The Grand Prix of India, which attracted 95,000 spectators, has opened a new chapter in the country's sport. India's ability to organise top-end, world-class events, especially after the fiasco of the run-up to the Commonwealth Games, has been re-established. The early apprehensions about the conduct of the race and the fears that the farmers would protest against the event on account of the inadequate compensation handed out to them for land acquired to build the track blew over as the big day dawned. The crucial role played by the Mayawati government in this regard and the help it offered to the local organisers, Jaypee Sports International, must be recognised. The organisers though could have avoided the embarrassment caused by the inexplicable act of not inviting India's Sports Minister Ajay Maken to the races. F1 races in Asia — the Korean, Chinese, and Abu Dhabi — outside Japan tend to be handicapped by a lack of understanding of the sport, which has led to a rapid fall in spectator interest. It is here that young cohorts of the ‘Facebook Generation' of avid F1 fans could give India an edge. The 5.371-kilometre long BIC, designed by the renowned German architect and track designer, Herman Tilke, and built at a cost of $400 million, has drawn a lot of praise from F1 officials and the drivers. The future of F1 in India depends on how well the facility is utilised.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/formula-one-in-india/article2589379.ece
3,11,2011,Bail versus jail,"It is an established principle of criminal jurisprudence that in the absence of specific countervailing factors, there is a general presumption in favour of bail. This rule is a natural extension of the very foundation of the modern legal system, which proceeds on the assumption that all persons are innocent until proven guilty. The enormous public anger against the scale of corruption and fraud, and the brazenness of the conspiracy, involved in the 2G spectrum scandal is understandable and must be commended. But the ‘grave magnitude' of the case should not be allowed to detract from the basic legal principles underlying the grant of bail. But this is what seems to have happened in the CBI special court's denial of bail to DMK MP Ms Kanimozhi and seven others in the 2G case. Given that charges have been framed and the case will go to trial in a few days, why should they remain in jail? The contention that they could tamper with evidence is unpersuasive — the gap between the time the 2G licences were issued and the probe was initiated would have given all accused enough time to destroy or conceal whatever they wanted to. The court maintained that the accused, being influential, could influence the witnesses and prejudice the trial. But the obvious answer would be to place certain restrictions on their movement and activity. The unstated implication of bail denial is that the accused should be in jail until the trial is over — a position that is extreme. The court also ignored the fact that some of the usual grounds for refusing bail — such as the possibility of the accused fleeing from justice or repeating a similar offence — do not apply here.
Unfortunately, the attitude adopted by the CBI vis-à-vis bail for the accused was inconsistent and hard to defend. While it opposed bail to a few high-ranking telecom company executives, it chose not to do so in the case of Ms Kanimozhi and others connected to the alleged payoffs to Kalaignar TV. Ostensibly, this was because the latter were accused in a supplementary charge sheet and under sections where the maximum punishment is five years (as opposed to seven). What this unconvincing argument did was to harden suspicions of political motivation. It is good that high profile cases such as the 2G scandal evoke public outrage, but it is imperative that the criminal justice system is not led by public opinion and emotions. The denial of bail does not presume guilt; nor does the grant of bail imply innocence. The job of the criminal justice system is to do its best to see that all the guilty in the 2G scam are convicted — it is not to make the accused languish in jail as undertrials.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bail-versus-jail/article2595433.ece
3,11,2011,Women and war,"Women are the worst sufferers of conflict. Study after study has shown this. All over the world, women constitute the majority among people fleeing conflict; they often find themselves pitchforked into the role of the sole breadwinner of the family in an environment that is hardly conducive for economic activity; they are vulnerable to sexual violence and exploitation by combatants and non-combatants alike; for this reason, they are also the most susceptible to sexually transmitted diseases. As there is much at stake for women in preventing conflict, it follows that women would be most effective in peace-building and mediatory roles. But this has not been widely acknowledged or even accepted. That the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution in 2000 (No.1325) urging member states to “ensure increased representation of women at all decision-making levels in national, regional and international institutions and mechanisms for the prevention, management, and resolution of conflict” says much about the lack of women's involvement in these roles. Eleven years later, the situation is not much improved. Last week, the Security Council held deliberations on how to better implement Resolution 1325, at which Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon and the head of UN-Women, Michelle Bachelet, noted that female participation in preventing and resolving conflict was still low and much more needed to be done in this direction.
The problem is that peace building and conflict resolution cannot take place in a vacuum; they are a part of the political process and of policy-making. Women are not adequately represented in either. Their empowerment is inadequate everywhere, not just in conflict regions. In India, political parties have dragged their feet for 15 years on a Bill to reserve 33 per cent of the seats in Parliament for women; after the Bill made it through the Rajya Sabha in 2010, the government developed cold feet and failed to present it in the Lok Sabha. Unless countries resolutely address the gender gap in decision-making, the potential of women will remain unfulfilled. The U.N. also needs to introspect. While it is all very well to talk about women and conflict prevention, it must be remembered that the longest and still ongoing conflict of the new millennium, the ‘war on terror' in Afghanistan, is being waged on the back of Security Council resolutions. More recently, the Council authorised the NATO bombing campaign in Libya, ostensibly to ‘protect' civilians, but it ended up killing hundreds of them. It is hypocritical to encourage conflict, on the one hand, and make pious declarations about how women are better at cleaning up the mess, on the other.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/women-and-war/article2595431.ece
3,11,2011,A chance to do real science,"If doing real science is the best and most enjoyable way to learn the subject, a unique opportunity awaits students — designing before December 7 an experiment to be tested in microgravity. The chosen experiment will be performed in 2012 by astronauts aboard the International Space Station. The students will not be involved in conducting the research, and their role will be restricted to producing a two-minute video of the test. However, they will be required to follow the rigours of structuring an experiment, as full-fledged scientists do: from raising a novel scientific question in the field of biological or physical sciences to stating the hypothesis and the manner in which the experiment should be conducted; they are even required to state the expected outcome. Exciting rewards await the winners. The research of the two global winners one from each age group — 14-16 years and 17-18 years — will be live streamed worldwide on YouTube, and the winners could be individuals or teams. They will also be able to take a zero-G flight, and either tour the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) facilities and watch the launch of the rocket carrying their experiments, or experience astronaut training in Start City in Russia once they turn 18. And there are rewards galore for the six winners, one from each age group, from the three regions — the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa; and Asia-Pacific.
The initiative presented by YouTube and Lenova, in cooperation with three space agencies — NASA, JAXA, and the European Space Agency (ESA) — will go beyond igniting a passion for science. The live webcast of the experiments will take the message far and wide and they could well be a splendid learning tool. The open science will serve as a rare window on how the real thing is done. Space agencies have been very good at finding imaginative and generous ways of engaging young minds with the subject in a high-cost field. In February 2011, ESA launched two sounding rockets, REXUS 9 and 10, carrying students' experiments, and more launches are scheduled for 2012. NASA's Student Spaceflight Experiments Program, launched in June 2010, has carried out several experiments designed by students. Since 2009, the Indian Space Research Organisation has been helping university graduates build satellites, and has carried them to orbits. The significance of such initiatives goes beyond space research. There is a compelling need to engage with, and whip up, children's interest in science — at a time when the number of teenagers opting for a degree and career in science is declining sharply not just in India but in many developed countries too.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-chance-to-do-real-science/article2592178.ece
3,11,2011,"Michael, row the boat ashore","The Labour candidate Michael D. Higgins has comprehensively won the Presidency of the Republic of Ireland. His rivals conceded defeat when it became clear that he had gained 40 per cent of the vote in the first round of the alternative-vote electoral system; and the final count gave the winner nearly 57 per cent on a voter turnout of 56 per cent. Mr. Higgins, known in his country as Michael D., had stayed out of several ugly controversies during the campaign. The key episode occurred when the Sinn Féin candidate, Martin McGuinness, a former Provisional IRA leader and Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister who has disowned the violence of the past, accused the front-runner, independent candidate Seán Gallagher, of financial irregularities during the latter's time in the Fianna Fáil party. Mr. Gallagher's failure to rebut the charges decisively caused his support to plummet. The electorate then swung towards Mr. Higgins, who has been a Labour member of the Irish lower house, the Dáil Éireann, since 1981, and a former university lecturer. Among other things, he has strengthened Irish-language broadcasting and done much to promote a proud nation's arts and culture.
The Irish presidency is a non-executive office, but the election result has broad socio-political implications. For most of the campaign, Mr. Gallagher's business acumen as a millionaire from a modest early background resonated with the voters, as the economy is struggling despite a 2010 international bailout of €85 billion; but what cost him the public's trust was the link with his troubled former party. Secondly, broad Labour support held up. The party won the simultaneously held Dublin West parliamentary by-election even though its larger partner in the governing coalition, Fine Gael, crashed, coming fourth in both the by-election and the presidential election. That the voters rejected both Fine Gael and Mr. Gallagher is a development consistent with rising support for the centre-left in many regions of the world, from Latin America to continental Western Europe and now the United States, where the Occupy Wall Street movement is gaining ground. Mr. Higgins, for his part, has a strong commitment to human rights, and openly criticised many U.S. policies during Ronald Reagan's two White House terms. He will have a seven-year tenure as head of state. His predecessor, Mary McAleese, courageously strengthened links with Protestant leaders in Northern Ireland, and her predecessor, Mary Robinson, went on to become the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Mr. Higgins should prove a worthy successor.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/michael-row-the-boat-ashore/article2592174.ece
4,11,2011,Let the library stay,"The decision of the Tamil Nadu Government to shift the Anna Centenary Library from the spacious, well-equipped modern building in Kotturpuram, Chennai, is difficult to justify on any ground. That the library is to be moved to the proposed Integrated Knowledge Park on the Directorate of Public Instruction campus in Nungambakkam is no consolation. The nine-storied, 3,48,480 square feet ACL building, erected on an eight acre site at a cost of Rs.172 crore to mark the centenary of C.N. Annadurai, attracts between 1,200 and 2,000 book lovers every day. Now the imposing structure, which was specially designed and engineered for a library, is to be converted into a super-specialty paediatric hospital. While there can be no argument against enhancing health care facilities in Chennai, doing so by dismantling a functioning library is clearly not the way to go. A lot can be done to further develop Tamil Nadu's health infrastructure, which has won widespread praise, without encroaching on the space accorded to other priority sectors. If the rationale for the shift is that the DPI campus would provide an ideal educational environment for the library, then the current location, which is within the Science City, is even more congenial. Kotturpuram is in the Guindy-Taramani institutional belt, which hosts several educational and research institutions, including the Indian Institute of Technology, Anna University, the Periyar Science and Technology Centre, the Central Leather Research Institute, the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, the Asian College of Journalism, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, and the National Institute of Fashion Technology.
The underlying reason for the proposed shift, which has now been stayed by the Madras High Court, is clearly subjective-political. The library was built by the predecessor Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam government on land that the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam government headed by Ms Jayalalithaa had, during its previous term (2001-2006), earmarked for housing the Secretariat. One of the first decisions made by Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in her current term was to shift the Secretariat back to Fort St. George from its new premises in Government Estate on Anna Salai. The reasoning was sound: the DMK government's shift had been hasty and haphazard, the building was incomplete, and the structures meant to accommodate Secretaries and other officials were not even built. The government would effectively have been functioning from two different premises had the switch back to Fort St. George not been made. Also, there were allegations of irregularities, including the use of sub-standard material, in the construction of the new Secretariat complex. No such objection can be raised against the ACL building. Instead of fighting court battles on this issue, the AIADMK government would do well to rescind its decision and let the library stay and flourish, respecting public sentiment.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/let-the-library-stay/article2598604.ece
4,11,2011,"After MFN, the next steps","Pakistan's decision to give India Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status is a big leap forward in bilateral relations. Paradoxically, the term of art connotes the opposite of what it means in common speech — under MFN a country agrees to treat another country equally with all the other countries with which it trades, as part of the agreement in the World Trade Organisation on non-discriminatory trade practices. As India and Pakistan are WTO members, this should have happened as a matter of course, but their uniquely poor relations ensured that even the routine was difficult. India accorded MFN to Pakistan in 1996 but Islamabad, which had linked improvement of trade ties to the resolution of the Kashmir issue, was propelled by the logic of its own position to withhold reciprocity. The change of heart now might have been prompted by a realisation in Pakistan that it can no longer afford to isolate itself from India's economic growth. As a next step, Pakistan would have to replace its positive list for trade with India with a negative list. New Delhi too has agreed to address the Pakistani grievance of Indian non-tariff barriers against its exports. But MFN status also means that Indian goods must compete in Pakistani markets with products from China or any other country, and vice versa. Both countries must now facilitate trade with each other through all possible routes, including the contentious land crossing at Wagah. They must also operationalise their part of the South Asian Free Trade Area agreement.
Prospects for improved India-Pakistan relations seem better now than at any time in the past three years. There have been some positive political developments as well: India recently backed Pakistan's entry into the United Nations Security Council; Pakistan supported another term for India's Kamlesh Sharma as the Commonwealth Secretary-General. A potential spat over the crossing of an Indian helicopter into Pakistani airspace was quickly averted — the Pakistani military sent the helicopter back after properly forcing it to land and questioning the Indian Army officers in it. There are still influential hawkish sections in both countries that stand in the way of rapprochement. The Pakistan government has drawn much criticism internally for the MFN overture to India. It can only be hoped that the forward momentum will be sustained.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/after-mfn-the-next-steps/article2598710.ece
6,11,2011,The price of mismanagement,"On the face of it, a Rs.1.82 increase in the price of petrol may seem modest, given the successive hikes consumers have had to put up with over the past year. But set against the backdrop of persistent inflation and rising interest rates, the burden of the latest oil shock is proving too much to bear. Important constituents of the United Progressive Alliance such as Mamta Banerjee's Trinamool Congress have demanded a rollback and even the Congress party's initial instincts were to call for a rethink. Even though the Congress promptly fell in line, parties across the political spectrum understand only too well that the tolerance level of ordinary citizens has reached breaking point. From an accountant's point of view, the oil marketing companies and the Finance Ministry may be correct in saying that higher pump prices will help pay for the rising crude import bill that has been triggered by the rupee's depreciation in recent weeks. But it is the UPA's wider mismanagement of the economic situation — and its failure to evolve a rational urban transportation policy — that is solely to blame for the burden of adjustment being thrust squarely on to the shoulders of the consumers.
The government argues that a petrol price hike will not prove as inflationary as feared because it is not used as an intermediate product. But the fact is that petrol plays a major role in private urban transportation, especially for the middle classes and the salariat. One option the Finance Ministry had was to reduce the amount of indirect tax levied on petrol. Today, customs and excise levies on the fuel add up to Rs.14.35 per litre and a temporary reduction of around 30 per cent would have averted the need for the latest price hike. A temporary excise cut might have negative fiscal implications but public finance and sound macroeconomic management are all about prioritising outcomes. Given the current inflationary outlook, prudence would suggest doing what it takes to relieve pressure on the general price level. Here, it is not enough to claim credit for keeping the diesel price steady. Though a lower diesel price helps in keeping transportation and shipping rates down, it also encourages dieselisation of private transport. Data from the latest quarter indicates that the growth in diesel sales outstripped that of petrol for the first time in six years. Since diesel models typically cost more than their petrol variants, the ‘rent' from the use of diesel in private cars accrues mostly to car manufacturers. Apart from rolling back the latest petrol price hike, the government must craft an intelligent excise policy that does not enable auto companies to profit from the sale of subsidised diesel.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-price-of-mismanagement/article2604445.ece
6,11,2011,Unwelcome improvisations,"There are a number of reasons why the government ought to be concerned over the tardy progress of the public sector disinvestment programme. Against the budget target of raising Rs.40,000 crore, it has so far mobilised only a paltry Rs.1,145 crore. With just five more months to go, there is very little likelihood of the figure going up substantially. The extreme volatility witnessed in the stock markets in recent months is likely to persist, which means the disinvestment process will continue to be dogged by a high degree of uncertainty. Against this backdrop, it is understandable that the government should be wary of shedding its shares at this juncture. Moreover, there is the political factor to reckon with. After all, every such move in the past has evoked the accusation from the opposition that the government was “selling the family silver cheap.” The UPA II government has tended to play down the significance of public sector divestment as a means of mopping up capital receipts, emphasising, instead, the social objectives sought to be served by it. Even so, given the current state of public finance, all possible ways of augmenting revenues and reducing public expenditure need to be explored.
Half way through the year, the fiscal deficit is already at 71 per cent of the budget estimate for the whole of 2011-12. That the deficit target of 4.6 per cent of the GDP will be missed has been conceded by the Finance Minister. With the economy slowing down, tax revenues will be lower than expected. And, there is little prospect of a windfall, such as through spectrum sales. All these, however, cannot be an excuse for resorting to short-cuts to boost disinvestment. Reports say the government has under consideration two proposals, and both, if implemented, will be detrimental not only to the disinvestment programme but to the health of public finance as well. One of the options is to ask the cash-rich Public Sector Enterprises to buy a portion of government equity in other PSEs, a method that was tried out earlier, in 1998-99 when oil companies were asked to go for mutual investment. This way the government will get its money, but for the investing company, it will be a forced diversion of funds. The other option is to get the PSE to buy back its shares, the facility being restricted to the dominant government shareholder. The two proposals are inimical to the interests of minority shareholder, go against corporate governance norms, and might be violative of company law and regulatory provisions. The process of disinvestment is for the long-haul. Success lies in sticking to the basics and avoiding short-cuts.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unwelcome-improvisations/article2604444.ece
7,11,2011,Breakthrough in Nepal,"Nepal's political transition has entered its final lap, with all parties signing a major peace agreement on November 1. The deal settles the future of combatants of the Maoist People's Liberation Army (PLA), who have been in cantonments across the country for over four years. A maximum of 6,500 of the 19,602 former fighters will be integrated into a special directorate under the Nepal Army. The rest would be offered attractive rehabilitation and cash packages. There is also an informal understanding that once the peace process commences, opposition parties would join the present government to give it an inclusive character. Once the constitution is promulgated, a new government under the Nepali Congress (NC) will supervise the next elections. The pact removes the single biggest obstacle in the process of constitution writing, as non-Maoist parties had refused to resolve the constitutional issues until what they saw as a Maoist instrument of coercion was not disbanded. Now that the Maoists have agreed to surrender their ‘advantage', the other parties can no longer cry wolf about the absence of a level playing field.
The breakthrough was made possible by the coming together of the original set of actors, primarily the Maoists and the NC, who had conceptualised the peace process in its early days. Maoist Chairman Prachanda and Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai did well in standing up to pressure from dogmatists within the party, and being flexible on the modality of integration, norms, and ranks. The NC also deserves credit for not playing spoiler despite being in the opposition. India, which facilitated the 12-point agreement in 2005, played a constructive role as a non-partisan, behind-the-scenes interlocutor. There are two key challenges now. The first is implementing the agreement within the tight timelines that have been laid out. The parties have committed themselves to completing the regrouping of combatants into those to be integrated and rehabilitated by the third week of November, and preparing a draft constitution by November 30. This would enable another extension of the CA. The second is resolving constitutional issues, particularly the nature and shape of federalism. A longer term challenge is the democratisation of the Nepal Army, meaning institutionalising both civilian control and the respect for human rights. This goal was a part of the original peace agreement but has not been touched in the recent pact. Nepal's politicians have shown remarkable wisdom in shepherding the transformation of their country from a monarchy to a republic, from war to peace. In this final phase, they must direct all their energies towards writing a democratic, socially equitable, and federal constitution.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/breakthrough-in-nepal/article2607181.ece
7,11,2011,Upstaged by Greece,"It was certain that Greece would figure prominently on the agenda of the G20 summit held at Cannes, France. Just a week earlier, European leaders had sealed an agreement over Greece's sovereign debt. It envisaged a drastic, 50 per cent reduction in the value of Greek bonds held by banks and in private hands, and a big boost to the euro zone's main bailout fund. As a follow-up of these measures, it called for a massive recapitalisation of Europe's leading banks. In return, Greece was required to make huge sacrifices. That Greece's leaders would face huge problems in selling a severe austerity package to an unwilling electorate was anticipated. But the kind of political spectacle that was witnessed was beyond anybody's expectations. Amidst high drama, involving a flip-flop over a referendum, Prime Minister George Papandreou narrowly survived a confidence vote in Parliament. After stifling a revolt within his party, he pledged to seek an interim government that would secure a comprehensive accord to save the euro. Completely upstaged by the developments in Greece, the G20 summit achieved precious little by way of commitments from the rest of the world to back the euro zone's efforts to contain the contagion.
Specific proposals for getting the G20 countries to augment the resources of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) made little headway. Nor was there any fresh commitment to boost the IMF's resources. The IMF, it was clarified by its Managing Director, will not be able to contribute to the EFSF because, under its mandate, the Fund can lend only to countries, not legal entities. Other ideas — for instance, that countries such as China and Brazil could lend to a special purpose vehicle seeded with money from the EFSF — have been played down. On a more positive note, Italy, the third largest economy in the euro zone, has agreed to have the IMF monitor its progress. The communiqué, even if bland, is somewhat reassuring. It calls upon every country to play its part in addressing the challenges facing the global economy and, in the medium-term, in strengthening the foundations for growth. It lays stress on familiar policy prescriptions such as rebalancing global demand, maintaining price stability over the medium-term, and reinforcing the social dimension of globalisation. Every country is urged to honour its commitment to reform the financial system. These are laudable objectives, but the real test for the usefulness of Cannes summit is whether it has met its short-term objective of calming the financial markets, reeling under the debt crisis.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/upstaged-by-greece/article2607183.ece
9,11,2011,Manipur blockade must end,"It is inconceivable that agitationists can ever succeed in blocking the main highways leading into, say, a State such as Madhya Pradesh for more than a few hours. Yet they get away with blockading Manipur for months on end, again and again, simply because disruptions in that farthest corner of the Northeast do not cause a ripple in the rest of India. So it is hardly surprising that people in Manipur think the country does not care for them. The latest blockade, which started on August 1, has led to an acute shortage of essential commodities, with the prices of food, medicines, and fuel shooting up sky high. Ordinary people have borne the brunt of the agitation, black marketeers and hoarders are having a field day, and the central government has been a bystander to the less-than-competent handling of the situation by the Ibobi Singh government in the hapless State. The siege began when the Kukis affiliated to the Sadar Hills Districthood Demand Committee blocked National Highways 53 and 39 to press their demand for a Kuki majority district to be carved out of portions of a larger district claimed by the Naga people as part of the ‘greater Nagalim.' The Nagas responded to the SHDDC blockade with one of their own. Instead of handling both firmly, the State government appears to have only worsened ethnic tensions by getting the SHDDC to withdraw its blockade with a written assurance that the demand for a separate Kuki district would be met. The United Naga Council and the All Naga Students' Association of Manipur have since intensified their blockade.
The Centre's apathy aside, the inflexible positions taken by the protesters, and their political vision stretching no further than the narrow confines of their ethno-nationalism, are the main reason for the mess in Manipur, and in some other parts of the Northeast as well. The Meities, who form the majority ethnic group, are not blameless in this saga of exclusivist politics; the tussle between the Kukis and the Nagas cannot be separated from the larger confrontation between the nationalisms of the Meitei and the Naga. Reconciling these competing visions is not an easy task; there are no quick answers. It calls for a leadership that is prepared to think big and re-imagine the State, and the region, in progressive inclusivist fashion. More immediately, the blockades on the highways must end. They have caused immense suffering to the poorest of Manipur's 2.7 million people who cannot afford to pay black market rates for their daily essentials. The blockaders must realise that they cannot use blackmail to gain their political ends.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/manipur-blockade-must-end/article2609723.ece
9,11,2011,Getting away with murder,"Israel's reaction to the revelation that it selectively assassinates suspected Palestinian militants in the West Bank exposes disturbing developments in the West Asian state. Anat Kam, a former soldier who was under house arrest for nearly two years, has been sentenced to four and a half years in prison for leaking the explosive documents to Uri Blau, a journalist on the newspaper Haaretz, which published articles based on them in November 2008. The principled leak comprised 2,085 documents, including 700 classified as top secret, on a disc Ms Kam had copied while, in the course of her compulsory military service, she was a junior clerk in the office of General Yair Naveh, then responsible for the Israeli military in the illegally occupied West Bank. The Tel Aviv District Court's sentence follows a plea bargain whereby Ms Kam admitted the unauthorised possession and distribution of classified information; the state had planned to pass on classified information with the intent of harming state security, conviction for which would have meant life imprisonment. Mr. Blau, for his part, went to the United Kingdom in April 2010, returning only in October 2011, after his source waived immunity and he agreed to tell the Shin Bet security agency where the materials were located.
The case is highly significant. To start with, Ms Kam could copy the documents involved only because General Naveh did not like reading them on a computer, so his staff had copied them from a secure machine to one from which soft and hard copies could be made. The Israeli judge Zeev Hammer has severely criticised both this and Shin Bet's failure even to find the discs afterwards. Secondly, Mr. Blau himself submitted the articles to the military censor, who cleared them for publication. Thirdly, the authorities banned any reporting of Ms Kam's house arrest, though blogging and international press coverage led to a partial removal of the embargo after four months. In addition, the attorney general has cleared the officers who failed to keep the documents secure; one of them is now deputy chief of staff of the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF). Worst of all, the IDF ignored a High Court order not to kill suspected militants when arrests could be made. Such killings are war crimes. In effect, the Kam verdict means the Israeli press will be less able to scrutinise official bodies, and whistleblowers, especially in the armed forces, will hesitate to reveal official crimes of any kind. In combination with the documented increase in repressive action against Israeli citizens who happen to be Arabs, the evidence shows the Zionist state in the worst possible light.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/getting-away-with-murder/article2609720.ece
10,11,2011,A low score,"The Human Development Report 2011 of the UNDP affirms what critical scholars have been saying for years now: the high economic growth achieved by India has not translated into a better quality of life for the vast majority of its citizens. For all its ambitions to power ahead in the global economy, India suffers from basic policy and structural failures that prevent its people from enjoying the fruits of a higher national income. Among 187 countries ranked in the HDR, India comes in at a dismal 134 in the main composite index that looks at life expectancy at birth, mean years of schooling, expected years of schooling, Gross National Income per capita, and other metrics. Failure to invest in core areas, such as education and health care, has led to the incongruity of better per capita GNI but not a higher HDI. Again, in the gender inequality index, India fares poorly, trailing neighbours Bangladesh and Pakistan, although it is better placed in terms of GNI per capita. These are proof positive that a serious course correction is needed in government policy. The first order priority should be to massively scale up public investments in education and health care in the coming Plan period.
HDR 2011 makes the important point that environmental degradation and climate change will exacerbate inequalities, a trend already in evidence. India has been modifying the natural environment at a feverish pace and without adequate study and thought. In a recent essay published by Outlook magazine, economist Jean Dreze and Nobel laureate Amartya Sen highlight destructive aspects of India's growth, such as the razing of forests, indiscriminate mining, the drying of rivers, and the massacre of fauna. This thoughtless course has invited a strong public backlash in some places as vulnerable communities feel the effects. Moreover, as the UNDP points out, long-term environmental degradation in the form of soil erosion, water stress, desertification and deforestation is expected to continue. These factors are likely to intensify climate change, with impoverishing consequences. What the patterns underscore is the need for India to strengthen the social protection floor. Obviously, big investments are needed to reduce multidimensional poverty — in education, health care, and sanitation. But only political will and decisive action can raise capacity and incomes, and make communities more resilient. As things stand in the South Asian region, emerging India lags behind Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in basic indicators such as life expectancy at birth and mean years of schooling. The big question is: can it change the focus of its growth to meet the aspirations of all its people and move up the HDI ranking?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-low-score/article2612528.ece
10,11,2011,Punishing Palestinians,"In a significant advance for the Palestinian cause, the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) has voted by 107 to 14, with 52 abstentions and 21 absentees, to admit Palestine as a full member. Brazil, China, India, Russia, and South Africa voted in favour, as did France. The United States, predictably, voted against, saying that the proposal was “regrettable” and would undermine a “just and lasting peace” in the region. Directly after the vote, the U.S. acted on a 1990s law requiring it to end payments to any U.N. body that admitted Palestine. Unesco will lose about $70 million a month, or some 22 per cent of its budget. Israel has stopped its 3 per cent contribution to the organisation, and is accelerating settlement construction in the illegally occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. It has also frozen customs and other revenues of about $100 million a month, which it collects for the Palestinian Authority, as the latter has no control over its own borders. In addition, since the Unesco vote, there have been several cyber attacks on Palestinian internet service providers, with net access cut off in many cases.
The whole issue shows how vindictive both Israel and the U.S. are towards the Palestinians. That some Israeli Ministers disapprove of the money freeze and that Washington has expressed disquiet about it reflects merely instrumentalist concern that the Palestinian Authority (PA) might now lack funds to enforce order in the West Bank. The freeze and the illegal building programme amount to collective punishment. Washington's Congress-imposed block on its payments to Unesco is another form of that, but one aimed at the whole world, despite the fact that firms like Google, Apple, and Microsoft use Unesco for access to developing markets. The lobbying body, American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) ensured that all mention of national interest was excluded from the relevant law. Clearly, the Zionist lobby in the U.S. is so powerful that it can make Congress pass legislation that ties the President's hands in foreign affairs even if that harms U.S. interests. Yet, by a cruel irony, Unesco, the very body on to which Palestine has been voted, was, only a few years ago, involved in plans for a wider protection zone around the former Nazi extermination camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau in southern Poland. It is only to be hoped that the U.S. and its major ally Israel can learn something from that memento of evil, and that they will stop punishing the Palestinians for claiming their legitimate rights, in effect for being Palestinians.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/punishing-palestinians/article2612526.ece
11,11,2011,A milestone verdict,"In a historic first, a special court in Gujarat has convicted and awarded life sentences to as many as 31 mostly high caste, landed Patels for burning alive 33 Muslims — the majority of them women and children — of Sardarpura village in Mehsana district. The village was among numerous Muslim habitations targeted across the State by irate Hindu mobs as part of a pogrom ruthlessly executed in the aftermath of the February 27, 2002 Godhra train carnage. The rioters locked the victims in a cramped room and set it on fire, suggesting that they wanted a repeat of the Godhra horror. In handing out exemplary punishment to the murderers, the court has sent out a strong message that perpetrators of communal violence cannot get away lightly and, indeed, that the judgment is a critical step in the reversal of the pattern of administrative and judicial inaction seen in such cases so far. Sardarpura is a legal trendsetter in many ways. It is the first of nine post-Godhra riots cases prosecuted by a Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court, which in another remarkable initiative aimed at securing justice for the pogrom victims, also supervised the setting up of a string of fast-track trial courts.
It cannot be overemphasised that the pogrom-related cases came under the watch of the Supreme Court following complaints that the Gujarat police, itself perceived to be complicit in the riots, was deliberately lethargic in booking and prosecuting the accused. As the highest court in the land observed in an interim order, “the need for early completion of sensitive cases, more particularly in cases involving communal disturbances, cannot be overstated.” In the Sardarpura case, during the course of the trial, the SIT twice amplified the list of accused through additional charge sheets, taking the total number to 76. However, in a blow to the families of the victims, the court has acquitted 42 of them. The SIT also failed to prove the charge of conspiracy. But easily the most significant aspect of the case — which ought to have a decisive bearing on how future communal cases are fought — relates to the emphasis laid during the trial on protection of witnesses. The Supreme Court's directive to the SIT to provide tamper-proof cover to witnesses ensured that they were able to testify without fear of reprisals. Its instructions to the trial courts to deal “sternly” with any disturbances that might be created to “terrorise witnesses” strengthened the cause of justice. It is now the turn of the central government — which for some inexplicable reason put on hold the comprehensive architecture laid out by the 17th Law Commission in its report on ‘Witness Identity Protection' — to act.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-milestone-verdict/article2615779.ece
11,11,2011,Italians deserve better,"By announcing his intention to resign, Silvio Berlusconi has precipitated the kind of ferment on which he thrives, and which he has used to remarkable effect through a political career riddled with allegations of corruption and sordid sex scandals, some of them leading to criminal charges. The combative and colourful Italian Prime Minister's third term has been ended, after three and a half years, by his coalition partners, the far-right Northern League, whose leader Umberto Bossi told him to resign after the government lost the lower parliamentary house vote on the 2010 public finances. The entire opposition abstained to assist the bill's passage, but that exposed cracks in Mr. Berlusconi's support; eight of his own People of Freedom (PDL) MPs voted against, so the measure got 308 votes and not the 316 needed, whereupon Mr. Bossi acted. The Prime Minister says he will step down after proposals for economic reforms get through the legislature; the process is likely to take another fortnight. The main opposition party, the Democratic Party (PD), has called for the creation of a transitional government by President Giorgio Napolitano, but the Prime Minister asserts that parties that lost the general election must not be allowed thus to gain office.
As usual with Mr. Berlusconi, however, anything could happen. He has survived 51 confidence votes in his present term, and now says one will not be needed after the budget defeat, as he plans to resign; but he may in fact decide to stay on after the reforms legislation clears parliament. Leaving office could render him liable to criminal prosecution from which he is currently immune. But it will also divert attention from his failure to improve Italy's dire economic condition; the poverty rate is above 14 per cent and unemployment among the 15-24 age-group is over 25 per cent. The eurozone's third largest economy, with debts amounting to €1.9 trillion, might well need a bailout to dwarf that of Greece. In addition, the opposition may not want office now; its MPs did not celebrate the budget vote result. While the evidence is that many voters want a reasonably competent government, , the electoral system, which Mr. Berlusconi introduced in 2005 and himself calls rubbish, makes that very unlikely; it enables a party with just one per cent vote share to topple a government, and causes permanent instability. Furthermore, the Italian centre-left is yet to find a convincing candidate. Mr. Berlusconi, then, may well remain Prime Minister. Italian voters, however, deserve better, in respect of their leaders and of the system that produces them.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/italians-deserve-better/article2615781.ece
12,11,2011,The new India-Pakistan plot,"India and Pakistan are clearly aiming for a big breakthrough moment in their relations, one with the potential not just to overcome a difficulty in the existing model of conducting bilateral ties, but to change the model itself. That is as it should be. In today’s world, it is simply unsustainable for two neighbouring countries to limit their bilateral interaction to set parameters, in the way these two have done over the last six decades. For Pakistan, it had to be Kashmir first or nothing. New Delhi twice broke off talks with Islamabad, after the 2001 attack on Parliament, and then after the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, only to realise that it could not keep its head turned away from a neighbour indefinitely. The India-China model has been repeatedly invoked to demonstrate that two not-too-friendly countries could successfully interact in mutually beneficial ways. It does not imply that the contentious issues between them have vanished; rather, it means these issues can and should be resolved without foregoing the benefits of bilateral interaction. Given that the problems between India and Pakistan go beyond a dispute over a line on the map, the comparison with India-China relations may be too facile. Beyond the issue of Kashmir, elemental suspicion and mistrust plague India-Pakistan relations, and this now extends to what each is doing in Afghanistan. On the other hand, there is the advantage of a natural people-to-people bonding that has managed to thrive, despite the state-manufactured animosity and mistrust. As has been evident from the time of the 2010 Thimpu talks between Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and Yusuf Raza Gilani, the spirit of which was reiterated in their upbeat meeting on the sidelines of the 17th SAARC summit in Maldives on Thursday, political will for a breakthrough is not lacking.
Pakistan’s decision to acknowledge India as a Most Favoured Nation under World Trade Organisation rules, despite opposition at home, was a game-changer. Both sides must swiftly build on this. Prime Minister Singh has talked of the two countries gradually moving towards a Preferential Trade Agreement, and of loosening up an egregiously retrogressive visa regime. The goodwill thus built — if these intentions bear fruit in forthcoming rounds of talks between officials of the two sides — is likely to have an impact on the process for the resolution of the major issues, including Kashmir. However, the reality is that terrorists retain the ability to disrupt relations between the two countries. This is why there can be no overstating the importance of Pakistan making an example of the Mumbai attack perpetrators by bringing them to justice quickly.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-new-indiapakistan-plot/article2619160.ece
12,11,2011,Confirming the slowdown,"One does not need GDP forecasts to gauge the downward drift in the economy. Even as the optimistic official forecasts peg economic growth rate for 2011-12 at not more than 7.7 per cent, data from a wide range of sectors are capturing the economic slowdown more graphically. Extrapolating such data, it is possible to see the heightened risks to the growth process in the months ahead. An analysis of the recently released merchandise trade data for October is revealing. After a long period of heady growth, merchandise exports have come down sharply, falling to a 12-month low of $19.9 billion. On a year-on-year basis, export growth at 10.8 per cent was at its slowest in the past two years. From a high of 82 per cent in July, it dropped to 44.25 per cent in August and to 36.36 per cent in September. The demand contraction in India's principal export markets, the United States and the European Union, is finally impacting the export figures. The spectacular run, which saw exports surge 46 per cent to touch $179.8 billion over a seven-month period, is coming to an end. Thus, the export sector, the only bright spot today in the economy, is beginning to lose lustre and hard days seem to be ahead for the exporters.
Even as exports are on a declining trend, imports have remained buoyant. In October, imports soared 21.7 per cent to touch a three-month high of $39.5 billion. During the first six months of the year, imports have gone up by 31 per cent to $273.5 billion and this is mainly due to higher prices of crude and vegetable oil and an increase in the import of coal as well as gold and silver. Petroleum prices are expected to remain sticky at high levels, while the strong consumer preference for gold and silver, both for investment and as jewellery, is unlikely to abate in the future. The prevailing acute shortage of coal for power plants will require large imports for a long time to come. The upshot is that trade deficit, which rose to a four-year high of $19.6 billon in October and has already touched $93.7 billion at the end of the first seven months of the current fiscal year, will be very difficult to rein in. In fact, the possibility of the trade deficit breaching the psychologically important $150 billion mark is real. There are other indicators pointing to a slowdown, such as lower collections in both direct and indirect taxes. The rise in the index of industrial production has remained below 5 per cent in July and August. The fall in exports in October corroborates the signs of slowdown seen elsewhere.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/confirming-the-slowdown/article2619161.ece
13,11,2011,Don't bail out,"After much delay, the Government of India has finally decided to come to the rescue of Air India, which was grounded in a sea of financial trouble. If it took so long to hammer out a rescue package for the national carrier, there should be no question of even thinking of a bailout for a private airline, Kingfisher. Several airlines have got into a financial mess and cannot now queue up for relief from the Union Civil Aviation or Finance Ministries. As the old adage goes, you have to cut your coat according to the cloth, and if private airlines began flying even before they could walk, they have to pay the price. They found it profitable when the going was good and there were fewer competitors. Now that competition is tight and airfares cannot be raised at will, the business model, financial management, and operational efficiency make all the difference to success or failure. In the case of Kingfisher, the entire industry knew that the crisis was imminent. Salaries to staff were being delayed; aviation fuel bills were not being paid on time; dues to the Airports Authority of India and the new private airports were also mounting. Pilots and other staff began deserting the troubled airline. In the face of such turbulence, the airline started cancelling 40 to 50 services a day over the past week. Kingfisher claims to be operating, on an average, some 300 out of 350 daily services, and the DGCA promptly slapped a notice on the airline for doing so without prior announcement.
For its part, Kingfisher would like its passengers and the authorities to believe that the ongoing cancellations are on account of “route rationalisation” and “reconfiguration of aircraft for full service market.” The management is laying the blame on oil prices, high taxes imposed by the States, the fall in the value of the rupee, and the operation of services on “non-profitable routes.” When ordinary citizens are being forced to pay more for the fuel, there can be no reason to subsidise airlines. The central government has repeatedly urged the States to lower the VAT or Sales tax on petrol and diesel, and some States have obliged. The time is ripe for a review of the Civil Aviation policy. A major decision on aviation policy relates to FDI in the industry. From the 1990s, when there was talk of opening civil aviation to foreign investment and both Singapore Airlines and the Tatas were interested in taking a major stake in Air India, the government has been dragging its feet on this sensitive issue. The time has come to make a clear and transparent decision on FDI in an industry that has acquired considerable popularity among the travelling public but needs to get its house in order.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dont-bail-out/article2624710.ece
13,11,2011,Downgrading the banking system,"The decision of Moody’s Investor Service last Wednesday to change its outlook on India’s banking system to ‘negative’ from ‘stable’ need not have come as a surprise. A month ago, Moody’s cut the standalone rating of State Bank of India, the country’s largest bank, citing concerns over capital and weakening loan quality. Some of these concerns have again been cited to justify the downgrade of the entire banking sector. There is no doubt that a slowing economy will witness a rise in loan defaults and they will have to be provided for. An increased recourse to provisioning will naturally impinge on the bank’s profitability. Besides, in a scenario of rising interest rates, banks will have to offer a higher interest on their deposits and this will naturally shrink their interest rate margins. It is also true that raising fresh capital will be more difficult and expensive in times of slowdown. Moreover, the global economic environment is chaotic and not conducive to the stability of the financial sector. These as well as the more specific factors responsible for slowing down the Indian economy — high inflation, rising interest rates, and monetary tightening — are easily understood. Moody’s decision has inevitably drawn strong criticism from the banks, the government, and many independent analysts, who are convinced that the Indian banking system is healthy and that banks are adequately capitalised. Problems in specific sectors such as power are no doubt a cause for concern, but they are not sufficient reasons for a general downgrade of the banking system.
The Reserve Bank of India’s Financial Stability Report (June 2011) indicated that the domestic financial system remained stable “in the face of some fragilities being observed in the global macro financial environment.” Compared to their peers in developed countries, Indian banks are surely better regulated and do not deal in exotic products. The downgrade will raise the cost of borrowing by Indian banks in overseas markets. It is small consolation that Moody’s has assigned a ‘stable’ outlook to 14 of the 15 banks rated by it in India, even while downgrading the entire sector. It, however, helps that Standard & Poor’s, another large rating agency, has chosen to upgrade India’s banking sector, the very next day. The rating process does not quite capture the strengths and weaknesses arising from government ownership of a majority of banks. One important source of strength is that the government remains committed to providing capital to the banks. On the other hand, the downgrade of SBI was primarily caused by the government’s procrastination about subscribing to a rights issue of shares that the bank has been planning for quite some time.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/downgrading-the-banking-system/article2624711.ece
14,11,2011,Syria and the Arab League,"The decision by the League of Arab States (the Arab League) to threaten Syria with suspension and possible sanctions if President Bashar al-Assad does not stop his regime's violence against protesters is not all that it might seem to be. The League has long been seen by tens of millions of people throughout West Asia and North Africa as toothless and a puppet of the despots, dictators, and absolute monarchs who comprise the majority of its governments. This time 18 of the 22 members voted for the proposal at an emergency meeting in Cairo, with three — Syria, Yemen, and Lebanon — voting against and Iraq abstaining. The immediate cause of the vote is the failure by Damascus to abide by its own November 2 assent to an earlier League plan to end the violence, which the United Nations estimates has caused more than 3,500 deaths since the protests began in March. At first sight, it looks as though the League is at last addressing serious issues; earlier in the week, its Secretary-General, Nabil al-Araby, met a delegation from the opposition Syrian National Co-ordination Committee (SNCC).
Closer examination, however, reveals covert non-military intervention in Syria. To start with, other opposition groups, such as the Syrian National Council, were not received by Mr. al-Araby; quite apart from such bodies' suspicions that their rivals, the SNCC, are Assad stooges, a transitional council created by outside powers is very likely to fail. Secondly, some League members have their own agenda. Qatar, which supported Nato-backed regime change in Libya, led the League's move against Mr. Assad, and — with France and Turkey — has been involved in aggregating Syrian opposition groups. Saudi Arabia, which is extremely hostile to Iranian influence in Syria and to democracy in the region, advocates encouraging Sunni Islamist forces, and this would also marginalise moderate Syrian Sunnis. This suits Nato members very well. Those western powers whose leaders, facing severe domestic problems and needing some high-profile foreign adventurism, suborned the U.N. Security Council into voting for the violent and destructive intervention against Muammar al-Qadhafi know that Russia and China will rightly veto any such resolution on Syria; but now the West can look uninvolved and can expect little criticism for its silence over continuing state brutality in Bahrain and Yemen. Interestingly, the democratic Syrian opposition is strongly against external intervention, fearing that it will cause civil war. But the Arab League is colluding with western double standards to betray the very democracy the Syrian people deserve as of right.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/syria-and-the-arab-league/article2627593.ece
14,11,2011,A hero — but no magic this,"If discrimination against people infected with HIV continues to be a major problem even today, despite innumerable initiatives to remove the stigma attached to it since the first case was reported in 1981, it must be remembered that the situation was scary in the early 1990s. It called for clear-sightedness and guts even to get tested for the virus then. And it required enormous moral courage and strength of character to reveal one's HIV-positive status to the immediate family, not to mention the public. Earvin ‘Magic' Johnson, the 32-year-old towering basketball legend who was at the peak of his career, did a lot to change this. He let the world know of his infection on November 7, 1991. That single act served as a powerful catalyst, removing misconceptions about the disease — that it was restricted to gays, drug users, and sex workers. Overnight, Johnson became a global ambassador for millions of distressed folk. The Magic Johnson Foundation, which he created the same year he was diagnosed with HIV, has played a pivotal role in spreading awareness, particularly about the need to get tested at the earliest. Twenty years after the disclosure, an equally important message comes from the man himself — that being infected with the virus does not mean a death sentence and that the progression from HIV to full-blown AIDS can be delayed with the help of medicines, a nutritious diet, and regular exercise.
Easy access to efficacious medicines has played a vital role in reducing the number of deaths from HIV in the low- and middle-income countries — from 2.1 million in 2004 to 1.8 million in 2009. According to the 2010 UNAIDS Global Report, an additional 1.2 million people received antiretroviral therapy in 2009, bringing the total number of beneficiaries to 5.2 million. The spotlight is however on the 25 per cent drop in the number of new infections in a year in 33 countries, many of them in the sub-Saharan Africa. India, along with a few other Asian countries, has witnessed the same rate of drop in incidence. But despite a reduction in incidence level, global prevalence has continued to increase. At the end of 2009, it stood at nearly 33 million, up from 28.6 million in 2001. The reason: a reduced number of deaths due to increased longevity of people living with HIV. For a variety of reasons, there has been lull in AIDS awareness campaigns in India in recent years. It may not be incorrect to state that a reduction in the incidence level in India was achieved mainly through awareness programmes. There is no room for complacency, as any negative change in people's behaviour can quickly alter the course of the epidemic.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-hero-but-no-magic-this/article2627594.ece
15,11,2011,Makeover for small savings,"After months of dithering, the government has accepted most of the recommendations of the Shyamala Gopinath Committee, which was set up at the instance of the 13th Finance Commission to review the parameters of the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) and the various small savings schemes. The most significant of them is to link the return on the small savings instruments to market rates, a step that will have major implications for the finances of the Centre and the States. Surely, there will be greater transparency in interest rates as the small savings instruments are being benchmarked to yields on government securities, and this in turn will pave the way for a more cost-effective management of public finances at the Central and State levels. Presumably, the market-oriented rates on the small savings instruments will revive popular interest, which has of late been flagging as depositors started migrating to banks. Indeed, the Centre recently announced public borrowing of about Rs.53,000 crore over and above what was budgeted for to offset the shortfall in collections under various small savings schemes. Even with their new market orientation, small savings instruments will still be subject to government control, although to a lesser degree than before. The contrast with the banking system is particularly striking in one key area: while the interest rate on savings deposits with banks has been freed recently, that on post office savings bank deposits remains controlled, though it has been raised from 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent.
The committee has done well to recognise the role of the various small savings schemes in catering to the thrift needs of different sections of the population. Only one scheme — the Kisan Vikas Patra — has been recommended for closure. The most popular scheme, the Public Provident Fund, gets a substantial boost. PPF deposits will now carry an interest of 8.60 per cent instead of 8 per cent. More significantly, individuals can invest a larger amount, up to Rs.1 lakh, in a year and claim tax rebate under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. At present, the ceiling is Rs.70,000. However, borrowing from the PPF has become costlier. Rules relating to post office deposit schemes have been relaxed, with the depositor given the option to close the deposit before maturity. The Senior Citizen Savings Scheme will continue to offer 9 per cent for investment up to Rs.15 lakh. The scheme, which was popular at a time banks were offering very low rates, is bound to be less attractive now. Small savings schemes will continue to be relevant as a means of furthering financial inclusion.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/makeover-for-small-savings/article2630737.ece
15,11,2011,A rivalry for the ages,"The sight of a bent 69-year-old man, his once handsome face ravaged by Parkinson's, slowly making his way to his car after attending the funeral of his great rival brought back memories of one of the stirring chapters in the annals of sport. For, no two athletes are bound to each other in history in quite the same way as Muhammad Ali — named by Time magazine and Sports Illustrated as the Sportsperson of the 20th century — and Joe Frazier, who passed away recently after a battle with liver cancer. Sport has revelled in any number of celebrated rivalries. And professional boxing has had more than its share, from the bare knuckle days of Jack Johnson through the memorable Joe Louis-Max Schmeling era when the confrontations had unmistakable ideological implications —'The Brown Bomber' versus 'The Aryan Superman' — and beyond. But no other pair of boxers has ever featured in fights of such gladiatorial severity and nerve-jangling compulsion as did Ali and Frazier from 1971 to 1975. Their three bouts, starting with what is widely acknowledged as the Fight of the Century, at the Madison Square Garden in New York in March 1971, and ending with the ‘Thrilla in Manila,' a brutal death-or-glory contest in 1975, have the kind of powerful emotional valence that is unmatched in modern sport.
Of course, there is a back-story to this operatic storyline. Ali, stripped of his heavyweight title in 1967 following his refusal of the draft to fight in the Vietnam War — he won back his boxing licence in 1970 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in his favour — was not merely a hero; he was at the opposite end of the spectrum in African-American society from Frazier, who said he would have had no ideological issues about fighting in Vietnam if he had not been a father. And boxing in America in that era had a relevance that went way beyond the ring. The insolently charismatic Ali knew how to take advantage of the socio-political ramifications of his rivalry with Frazier. He called his opponent, a relatively short man (under 180 cm) a “gorilla” and “Uncle Tom.” But the rather reticent Frazier, who had spent time working in a butcher's shop before winning an Olympic gold medal in 1964, was not only a courageous and resourceful fighter. He knew how and where to give vent to his anger. He had a left hook that could bring down prison walls and it did floor Ali in the first of their three fights. But round for brutal round, blow for blow, their last fight in Manila was perhaps the most memorable and also a fitting climax to a rivalry that has a near-mythical aura to it. Ali said it was “the closest thing to dying that I know of,” after responding to Frazier's challenge with extraordinary resilience and typical emotional intensity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-rivalry-for-the-ages/article2630739.ece
17,11,2011,Planning for the billions,"More than half of the seven-billion world population is huddled on three per cent of the earth's land area. But as the recently published U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) report cautions, this should not be taken to mean that the world can mindlessly absorb any number of people for years to come. Nor does it imply that its cities can expand without rethinking their current course. What emerges from the population figures is that there is an urgent need to plan human settlements proactively, using the available land wisely and ensuring that the future population is provided with better places to live in. In the next three decades, much of the population growth will occur in urban areas, and about five billion people will live in cities. Africa and Asia are set to double their urban population in the same period. If the business-as-usual approach continues, this growth is bound to be haphazard and lopsided, throwing up serious problems of population management. Smaller towns that have neither the resources nor the planning infrastructure are absorbing significant numbers of people. For instance, in India, of the 2,774 new urban centres that have emerged in the last decade, 2,532 are census towns or places without a statutory urban local body such as a municipality. This disconnect is an urgent reminder to policymakers that they must strengthen the capacities of smaller towns and enable them to handle the population surge better.
Large urban agglomerations pose a different problem. The number of people residing within the city core has come down because of expensive land prices, but the peripheries have expanded with low densities, consuming more land and forcing long commutes. Mumbai city, for instance, had a negative population growth rate of 5.75 per cent in the last decade, but Thane, its suburb, which is about 40 km away, recorded 36 per cent growth. Such a sprawl means a huge loss of agricultural land, and it pushes the perimeter of urban consumption far beyond its immediate region. If this pattern continues unchecked, the land required to support each person, currently estimated to be 2.7 hectares, will increase and result in an ‘ecological overshoot.' Harnessing the advantages of population growth and stemming the ‘degenerative peripheralisation' are challenging tasks. Recycling urban properties to enhance population densities and planning a balanced regional development could be a way forward. A vital issue of concern is planning for the poor. Studies have shown that a large part of future urban growth will comprise poor people (UNFPA 2007). If the world has to remain slum-free and equitable, providing for the land needs of marginalised people should be a top priority.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/planning-for-the-billions/article2633443.ece
17,11,2011,Aung San Suu Kyi steps up,"Exactly one year after her release from nearly two decades of house arrest, Aung San Suu Kyi seems be on the threshold of a new role in Myanmar, still in opposition to the military-backed civilian regime, but no more standing outside the political system that it has set up. Earlier this month, the government changed the rule that required political parties to “preserve” the military-drafted 2008 Constitution; they are now expected to “respect and obey” it. This change has paved the way for Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy to register as a political party. NLD leaders are likely to meet later this month to take the call. Indications are that the regime is thinking of setting some 600 political prisoners free. If it does so, it will make the decision easier for the NLD. The party boycotted last year's elections, but it is now widely expected that Ms Suu Kyi will contest an election in December, and thus enter Parliament. On the first anniversary of her release on Monday, the Nobel laureate told journalists that the Myanmar regime had taken some steps towards political reform. She described recent developments in the country as “eventful, energising and, to a certain extent, encouraging.” One of these was a statement by the Speaker of the Parliament's Upper House, Aung Khin Myint, that he recognised the results of the 1990 election. The NLD swept the 1990 polls, and it was following that victory the junta put Ms Suu Kyi in what turned out to be the first of long spells of detention for the next two decades.
Ms Suu Kyi's latest move towards reconciliation with the same people who imprisoned her is not a sign of weakness on her part. Clearly, the iconic leader, who made great personal sacrifices as she spearheaded the pro-democracy movement, would not have responded to the regime were she not convinced that an opportunity now exists to unshackle Myanmar from a past that had kept the country isolated and led to the impoverishment of its people. The Thein Sein regime launched the process of reform with the realisation that the previous model of authoritarian governance had become untenable and unsustainable. The regime needs Ms Suu Kyi's participation in the project for political credibility. True, the Myanmar military still has the power to call off the reforms process, but its positive attitude to the changes that President Thein Sein has ushered — radical, by Myanmar's standards — suggests that it is on board. Without doubt, the changes in Myanmar represent its best chance to emerge from a five-decade-long wilderness.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/aung-san-suu-kyi-steps-up/article2633441.ece
18,11,2011,Investing in health,"The High Level Expert Group of the Planning Commission on Universal Health Coverage for India has laid out a clear road map: it is to provide access to affordable, accountable, and appropriate health services for all citizens in a meaningful time frame. Free India adopted the goal of preventive and curative care for all, as recommended by the Bhore Committee in 1946. But it faltered and failed to raise public spending. What the expert group chaired by Dr. K. Srinath Reddy proposes is far-going reform in several areas. On funding, it puts the onus on the government to mobilise the resources necessary, relying mainly on general taxation; complementary funds would come in the form of mandatory deductions for health care from salaried individuals and tax payers. Country-level policies oriented towards equity and free, universal access to health care favour such a financial model. This is also logical, considering that health should be viewed as a public and merit good available to the entire population. India's approach to public spending on health needs a radical change. It has a pathetic record of devoting a mere 1.2 per cent of GDP as public expenditure. To scale up care, that must be raised to at least 2.5 per cent by the end of the 12th Plan, and 3 per cent in the subsequent five years. This, the expert group estimates, can bring about a dramatic reduction in out-of-pocket spending from 67 per cent of total health expenditures today to 47 per cent by 2017 and 33 per cent by 2022.
An entitlement to free health care, implemented through a carefully chosen package of cashless in-patient and out-patient services, will be a paradigm shift. This is doable, given consistent GDP growth. Moreover, there is adequate room in the tax system to accommodate new demand for a national health plan; after all, India's tax ratio, at a little over 15 per cent of GDP, is much lower than the average of 22 per cent for countries with comparable per capita incomes. The private sector can participate in the provision of universal health coverage as contractual partners, with appropriate regulation and monitoring of costs and quality. The key principle laid down by the expert group for universal access is to not levy any user charge at all. Levying such fees can perpetuate or widen inequalities in poor and middle income settings. The more rewarding approach would be to invest heavily in the public system to provide primary, secondary, and tertiary care, and use private expertise mainly to strengthen that capability. The recommendations of the expert group, including the emphasis on making essential medicines available free to patients through state funding, must be wholeheartedly welcomed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/investing-in-health/article2636575.ece
18,11,2011,New kid on the nuclear block,"India has a formidable new addition to its armoury — Agni-IV. The missile's first test flight under its earlier name, Agni-II Prime, in December 2010 ended in failure. But those problems have clearly been sorted out. Tuesday's test went without a glitch, and the missile successfully carried a 800-kg warhead to a distance of over 3,000 km. Agni-III missile, which was first successfully tested in 2007, already has a range of over 3,500 km when carrying a 1.5 tonne warhead. With less payload, this missile's range would be considerably greater. The success of Agni-III and Agni-IV reflects the maturing of capabilities in the long-range missile programme. The Agni missile family began with a ‘technology demonstrator' that combined the one-metre, solid-propellant first stage of India's first launch vehicle, the SLV-3, with a liquid-fuelled second stage. When the decision was taken to turn the technology demonstrator into an operational missile, the upper stage too was turned into a solid propellant one. This upper stage was equipped with a ‘flex nozzle' that could be swivelled to control the missile's orientation. Agni-II has a range of more than 2,000 km with a one-tonne payload. A single-stage version, Agni-I, with a range of about 700 km was subsequently developed.
The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) demonstrated a big leap in its ballistic missile capabilities with the two-stage, all-solid Agni-III. With a diameter double that of the one metre of its predecessors, this was the first Indian missile that can potentially be equipped with multiple warheads. This time the first stage too had a ‘flex nozzle,' a major technological achievement that considerably reduced the weight of the missile's control systems. With the addition of a solid third stage, the missile will be turned into Agni-V, with a range of over 5,000 km. This missile is scheduled to be tested in February. The missile team appears to have used its skills to upgrade Agni-II. Agni-II Prime, now known as Agni-IV, has a diameter of 1.2 metres, allowing a ‘flex nozzle' for the first stage as well. Further weight saving was brought about by having a composite second stage motor casing, instead of the earlier metal one. These weight reductions meant that more propellant could be loaded, thereby increasing the missile's range. Improvements in the missile's navigation systems, which now use laser gyros, as well as better onboard computers and avionics will make it more accurate too. Armed as they are with nuclear warheads, these are capable of causing immense destruction. The hope must be that they will never be put to actual use.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/new-kid-on-the-nuclear-block/article2636571.ece
19,11,2011,Need for a partial rollback,"Given Tamil Nadu's precarious fiscal situation, the upward revision in bus fares, milk prices, and power tariff announced by Chief Minister Jayalalithaa seemed to have an air of inevitability about it. The power generation and distribution corporation, the State transport undertakings, and the cooperative milk producers' federation, and also other State public sector institutions, were facing mounting losses. Tamil Nadu's debts had crossed Rs.100,000 crore, and the government was finding it difficult to fund welfare schemes and initiate infrastructure projects. But while the rationale for the revision is clear, this cannot be of much solace to the poorer sections, who are reeling under the effects of food inflation and rising costs of living. The increases are steep, in some cases as high as 50 per cent. They should have been done more sensitively, more selectively, and in stages. That would have been easier for people to accept and to bear. The hike in milk prices, from Rs.17.75 to Rs.24 a litre, is bound to have an adverse impact on the nutritional levels of children in poor households. This 35 per cent hike, on top of an increase two years ago by the predecessor DMK government, is indefensible, especially considering that only less than one-third of the increase will go to the milk producers.
A good part of the blame for the difficult situation must be borne by the United Progressive Alliance government, whose efforts at controlling food inflation have been feeble and ineffective. Frequent increases in fuel prices have worsened the situation for the vulnerable sections. And as Chief Minister Jayalalithaa pointed out, the centre was hesitant to come to the aid of Tamil Nadu despite her repeated appeals for help. Not for the first time, a Congress-led central government has been shown up to be politically partisan. While States ruled by the constituents of the UPA such as West Bengal have got special financial packages, Tamil Nadu was, in Ms Jayalalithaa's words, “shown a step-motherly attitude.” What is of some relief is that the price hikes have come after the State kick-started several social benefit schemes such as free mixers and grinders and fans, and free laptops to school and college students in government and aided institutions. Crucially, Tamil Nadu remains the only State with a universal and efficient Public Distribution System that provides free rice to all eligible cardholders. But the government cannot give with one hand and take away with the other. A partial rollback of the increases will be in order.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/need-for-a-partial-rollback/article2639891.ece
19,11,2011,Nudging pension reforms,"The Union Cabinet's decision to give statutory status to the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), though belated, is welcome. In 2003, the NDA government set up the PFRDA through an executive order. That it has taken eight years for the government to take that step does not in any way diminish the importance of the reform itself. For instance, the measure will enable millions of people, who are now without a worthwhile security net in the form of retirement savings options, to get the benefit of an organised, regulated pension. The PFRDA bill is expected to come before Parliament in the winter session starting next week. But then, political opposition to the bill remains. Specifically, the government has drawn flak for rejecting two of the recommendations made by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance. While the government gave its nod for foreign direct investment (FDI) in the pension sector to an extent of 26 per cent, the bill makes no mention of the sectoral cap although the standing committee recommended it. Instead, the government has chosen to notify the cap under the rules to be framed under the proposed legislation. This is evidently because the government wants to have some flexibility in the matter of raising the cap to 49 per cent, if and when it decides to do so. After all, changing the rules is much easier than amending the Act for the simple reason that the latter requires Parliament's approval.
Obviously, the government's experience with the insurance sector — where there has been no political consensus on changing the cap on FDI that has been built into the relevant statute — has weighed with it in going for this hassle-free non-legislative route. The government is on an even stronger ground in not accepting the recommendation for a guaranteed minimum return to pension fund subscribers. The standing committee had wanted pension fund managers to be appointed on the basis of their commitment to generate minimum returns. No prudent investment policy would insist on guaranteed returns from stock market investments. Indeed, mutual fund subscribers are warned that investments in stock market instruments are subject to market risk. For pension fund subscribers, the time horizon is even longer and the authorities will have to go the extra mile to educate them. Subscribers must be made familiar with the risks and rewards that go with their chosen pension plan, whether the investment is in debt or equity, or in a combination of the two. Once the IPRDA bill becomes law, the New Pension Scheme, which has not made a mark so far, will get a big boost. The opening up of the pension sector will make available large, long-dated funds for infrastructure.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/nudging-pension-reforms/article2639887.ece
21,11,2011,Division games,"From an administrative point of view, Uttar Pradesh is truly an unmanageable State. Cutting it up into four smaller States as Chief Minister Mayawati has proposed, roughly along regional cultural divides — Bundelkhand, Avadh Pradesh, Purvanchal, and Paschim Pradesh — has its merits as an idea. It could lead to more equitable development of these regions, and relieve the pressure on Lucknow. The idea itself is not new. But politically, it is counter-intuitive — the Chief Minister of a State that elects 80 Lok Sabha members wields much more influence than one that sends one-fourth that number. Even with Ms Mayawati's confidence that her party would rule all four proposed States, the instability of governments in small States makes it an unattractive political proposition. And administrative manageability could be achieved by a more effective decentralisation. So it seems more plausible that the Chief Minister rolled out her promise of a 1x4 division of U.P. in the knowledge that it will not become reality, at least in the near future. In any case, a green light from the State cabinet is only the first step in a long process that involves an approval by the State Assembly, and then by Parliament.
It is certainly a clever political gambit by Ms Mayawati ahead of the elections, and it has already succeeded in confusing the opposition parties. There are no popular agitations for the division of Uttar Pradesh, yet the idea is not without some resonance in the four regions. The Congress has always opposed the creation of smaller States; its dilemma is all the greater now as its reaction to Ms Mayawati's move would hold immediate significance for the Telangana agitation. Mulayam Singh's Samajwadi Party is set against any division of U.P. as his party's backward caste vote base is not as evenly spread as Dalits are across the four regions. Only the Bharatiya Janata Party favours smaller States, but it too has been taken by surprise. As hot air builds under the proposal, it is bound to deflect attention from other issues, such as the BSP government's track record and allegations of corruption against the Chief Minister. While there is no doubt that Ms Mayawati has stolen a march over her rivals, it is surprising that for a politician with national ambitions, she seems to have not fully thought through the ripple effect of the move on statehood demands in other parts of the country. There is no denying that the disappearance of single party rule at the centre and the growth of regional politics have brought about a more federal polity, and a more equitable sharing of power. But fragmentation of the country on the basis of ever-narrowing identities hardly represents a progressive idea of India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Division-games/article13372118.ece
21,11,2011,Under neo-Nazi flat stones,"German complacency about the country's control of neo-Nazism and about a decline in racism and xenophobia has been shattered by the discovery of a tiny far-Right cell which, over a period of 13 years, carried out at least 10 cold-blooded murders, funded itself with 14 bank robberies, planted two nail bombs, and put 88 public figures, including MPs and leaders of Islamic and Turkish groups, on the hit list. The group came to light earlier this month when the bodies of two men were discovered in a camper van in Thuringia state; they had set the van alight and shot themselves as police approached. A few hours later, their female accomplice burned down their flat in the eastern city of Zwickau, and turned herself in. The ten murdered included eight of Turkish descent. All three gang members were born in the former German Democratic Republic and spent their youth there after the 1990 unification of Germany, in a period when neo-Nazism surged as the East German economy crashed and unemployment exceeded 30 per cent. All three had open Nazi leanings.
Both the circumstances and the political context raise serious questions. The most serious problem arises from official failure to track down the neo-Nazi gang. The police have not solved even one of the murders, though they now connect the group with the racist killings. In addition, a member of the German internal security service (BfV) was present at one of those, and was exposed because he was the only witness not to call the police. The official was also a known far-Right supporter, and the spotlight is now on the BfV's use of paid informers and possible protection of such links at the expense of criminal investigation. This problem has also arisen in the English courts, where two men are being tried, on the strength of new evidence, for the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993; at that time, links with informers were publicly said to have hampered the Metropolitan Police investigation, and a later public inquiry also excoriated the force for institutional racism. As for the German security agencies and police, they have long kept German Muslims and other ethnic minorities under sustained surveillance but seem to have paid far less attention to white terrorism. The influence of some far-Right sympathisers in these official bodies cannot be discounted. Any resulting partiality will only strengthen feelings in West Asia and elsewhere that the west is blindly prejudiced against Islam and is incapable of dealing with its own homegrown racist terrorism.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/under-neonazi-flat-stones/article2644341.ece
22,11,2011,Another round to Pakistan military,"‘Memogate', the fresh controversy that has enmeshed the democratic government in Pakistan, is yet another round in the strained relations between the civilian dispensation and the military. As before, the Pakistan Army has come out on top. The crisis was set off when a dubious Pakistani-American businessman claimed he had carried a memo from President Asif Ali Zardari to Admiral Mike Mullen, who was then chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, asking for U.S. help to prevent a military takeover in the wake of the Osama bin Laden raid in Abbottabad. Pakistan's Ambassador in Washington, Hussain Haqqani, is said to be the person who drafted and handed over the memo to the businessman. If true, why the businessman entrusted with a top secret mission should have chosen to go public with it, of all places, in a write-up in Financial Times, itself raises many questions. That President Zardari and Mr. Haqqani should have thought a coup was in the air after the May 1 fiasco for the Pakistan Army is no less intriguing: in retrospect, there has been no worse moment for the Pakistan Army in recent times, and no better time for the civilian government vis-à-vis the military. The real story behind this episode may not come out for quite a while. But its immediate fallout is likely to be the replacement of Mr. Haqqani. The Pakistan Army sees him as an irritant in its relations with the U.S. He was blamed for clauses in the Kerry-Lugar legislation that made U.S. aid to Pakistan conditional on the Pakistan Army's good behaviour. He is also blamed for not being combative enough with Washington and for compromising national sovereignty in bilateral dealings. His likely departure will be a political loss for President Zardari. The military will no doubt have a say in appointing Mr. Haqqani's successor.
That this controversy has erupted around the same time as the rise of the former cricketing hero, Imran Khan, in Pakistan's political firmament may be no more than a coincidence. It is believed that one reason why the Pakistan Army has not acted against the Pakistan People's Party government despite its extremely frayed relations with President Zardari is that this would mean putting its institutional weight behind Nawaz Sharif, whom it distrusts even more (the feeling being mutual). Although it is premature to talk of an Army-backed caretaker government under Mr. Imran Khan, at the very least the cricket superstar is now counted among the available alternatives. Throw into this Admiral Mullen's confirmation of receipt of the controversial memo, thus compromising the PPP government, and one can see that ‘Memogate' is much more than the sum of its parts. None of this is good news for democracy in Pakistan.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/another-round-to-pakistan-military/article2647959.ece
22,11,2011,Rupee in uncharted territory,"Although the rupee has been on a downslide in relation to the dollar for quite some time, the extent of depreciation has been particularly striking recently. On Monday, the rupee fell to below its all-time low of Rs.51.97 (reached in March 2009) when it breached Rs.52 during intraday trading. On November 18, it closed at Rs.51.33. The home currency's fall is mirrored by the sharp drop in the benchmark stock indices, the Sensex and the Nifty. Both lost 5 per cent during last week. According to SEBI, there was an outflow of $254 million from the domestic equity and debt markets, attributable to concerted selling by foreign institutional investors. A combination of domestic and global factors is behind the rupee's fall. Economic growth is slackening.
The widening current account deficit and the critical reliance on short-term capital flows to bridge it are adding to the pressure on the rupee. Recent export figures have dashed hopes that exporters would continue their sterling performance of the first seven months and help in containing the merchandise trade deficit. The sharp demand contraction in the traditional export markets — the United States and Europe — has begun to take a toll. A depreciating rupee makes India's imports costlier. Many items, notably petroleum, have an inelastic demand. The import bill is bound to go up steeply. Moreover, the falling rupee has offset the recent declines in the prices of certain imported commodities. On the other side, exporters who normally stand to gain say that they did not quite expect the rupee to slide so precipitously. Anticipating a further decline, many exporters are holding on to their proceeds, while importers have been rushing to buy dollars to cover their imports. What is intriguing is the Reserve Bank of India's rather passive stance in the face of such large declines in the home currency. It is possible that, in its assessment, the size of forex reserves is not large enough to defend the rupee in what promises to be a period of prolonged uncertainty and financial market volatility. Or else it wants to conserve its fire-power for future contingencies that may warrant aggressive intervention. Either way there is a strong case for the RBI to communicate its stance to the markets proactively. Its only significant policy initiative with a bearing on the exchange rate has been to increase the ceiling for FII investment in corporate and government bonds by $5 billion in each category. The expectation is that debt flows to India will increase and that would relieve the pressure on the rupee to some extent.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rupee-in-uncharted-territory/article2647958.ece
23,11,2011,Opera versus Einstein,"“The weight of evidence for an extraordinary claim must be proportional to its strangeness.” These words of Pierre-Simon Laplace, the 18th century French mathematician and astronomer, apply to an Italian research team's recent claim that it has found that fundamental particles called neutrinos break the light barrier. This strange and extraordinary result was naturally received with scepticism in the world of science. That nothing can move faster than light was immortalised in 1905 by Albert Einstein's Special Relativity, a theory that has been tested countless times in diverse physics experiments involving high energy particles. Indeed the many experiments at Cern, the European centre for particle physics in Geneva, from where neutrinos are shot through the earth to be detected by this underground Italian experiment called Opera at Gran Sasso, 732 km away, are themselves different tests of Einstein's theory. Opera found that the neutrinos, which are about a million times lighter than electrons, arrived about 60 nanoseconds earlier than the time light would have taken. This corresponds to neutrinos travelling at a speed of 1.0000247 times 299,792,458 m/s — the speed of light. To measure neutrino speed with such great precision is an achievement; and Opera has measured the speeds of 15,233 neutrinos with checks and counter-checks. So if this were true, it would shake the very foundations of physics done over the last century; there is nothing in known physics of a causal four-dimensional universe that can explain it. Last week Opera reconfirmed the original finding by measuring the time of flight of each of 20 well-separated extremely short duration neutrino pulses. The burden of the critiques of Opera's measurements has been that there could be some unsuspected minute systematic errors, particularly in the exact timing of departure and arrival of neutrinos.
Soon after the first announcement, Nobel Laureate Sheldon Glashow and Andrew Cohen argued convincingly, on the basis of simple physics, why the experiment must be wrong. They said if neutrinos had travelled faster than light, they would have lost energy during their travel through radiation in a manner akin to the sonic boom when an object breaks the sound barrier. Another Italian experiment, Icarus, quickly seized on this observation and measured the energies of the arriving neutrinos. Using the same source of neutrinos from Cern, it found that there was no unusual loss of energy in the detected neutrinos. Announced just two days ago, this would seem a refutation of the faster-than-light finding. But since the Opera scientists did not quite agree with the Glashow-Cohen argument, they are unlikely to be impressed by the Icarus results. Meanwhile, other neutrino experiments have geared up to see if the extraordinary evidence to match the strange result exists. What one is witnessing is yet another instance of the method of science at work.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/opera-versus-einstein/article2650874.ece
23,11,2011,A yatra like no other,"No two rath yatras are alike, not for L.K. Advani. All his cross-country tours, beginning with the most controversial of them all — the communally divisive and provocative Ram Rath Yatra of 1990 — were designed with specific issues and electoral objectives in mind. Whether it was demanding a Ram temple at the Babri Masjid site or celebrating a rising India (Bharat Uday Yatra, 2004) or drawing attention to threats to national security (Bharat Suraksha Yatra, 2006), the Bharatiya Janata Party leader chose the time and theme of his yatras to maximise the political yield for his party and himself. Even so, the latest in his efforts to mobilise public support and enthuse party cadres, the Jan Chetna Yatra, is in a category of its own. After tailing the national movement against corruption, which was entirely the initiative of sections of civil society, and seeming incapable of taking on the United Progressive Alliance government either on corruption or the price rise, the principal opposition party has managed, through this yatra, to gain some traction on the issues of transparency and accountability in governance — and position itself for some offensive play in the winter session of Parliament.
The BJP, of course, was handicapped by corrupt elements flourishing within its fold. In Karnataka, Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa, who faced serious allegations of corruption, repeatedly defied a confused BJP national leadership before events beyond the party's control forced him to quit and landed him in jail. Indeed, while touring Karnataka during the yatra, Mr. Advani felt compelled to declare that the party could not make any concession in the fight against corruption. Interestingly, he sought to take the moral high ground by announcing that all Members of Parliament of the BJP and its partners in the National Democratic Alliance would declare that they do not own, directly or indirectly, bank accounts or assets outside India. The question, of course, would be the truth behind such declarations and also the method by which they could be tested. But to the extent Mr. Advani managed to win for the BJP a position of some advantage in the anti-corruption movement, the Jan Chetna Yatra appears to have worked. Through this yatra, the BJP strongman and former Deputy Prime Minister might have just given himself another shot at the prime ministership in 2014.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-yatra-like-no-other/article2650871.ece
24,11,2011,Gujarat's close ‘encounters’,"The Narendra Modi government has reason to feel severely embarrassed and exposed by the report submitted by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) to the Gujarat High Court. In holding that Ishrat Jahan, the 19-year old Mumbai student, and three others were killed in cold blood by the Gujarat police, the SIT has dismissed the State government's persistent claim that the four died in a shootout. The evidence on which the team reached its conclusion is not yet publicly available but the High Court has revealed that the three-member SIT reached the unanimous conclusion that the four victims were murdered before their bodies were dumped on the outskirts of Ahmedabad. In short, summary extra-judicial executions were dressed up to look like a police encounter. This is exactly the same conclusion the Ahmedabad Metropolitan Magistrate had reached in 2009. Going by the forensic evidence and the post-mortem reports, the magistrate dismissed the Gujarat police's claim that the victims, who were allegedly involved in a plot to assassinate Chief Minister Narendra Modi, were killed in an exchange of gunfire on a highway. He concluded that the victims were shot dead at very close range the night before the encounter was supposed to have taken place. Instead of acting on this honest finding, the Bharatiya Janata Party State government denied that the encounter was fake and accused the magistrate of overstepping his jurisdiction by writing such a report. Now that the High Court has ordered that a fresh FIR be registered against those suspected of murdering Ishrat and the others, cover-up of the heinous crime will no longer be possible.
It has been seven years since the killings took place, a period during which the Modi government feigned a posture of hurt innocence. With the High Court declaring its intent to hand over the investigation, after the filing of a fresh FIR, to a central agency, there is no way the 21 policemen, including some officers, allegedly responsible for staging the fake encounter could be shielded. Among them is Deputy Inspector General D.G. Vanzara, the so-called ‘encounter specialist,' who was arrested and jailed for the extra-judicial murder of Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife in 2005. The issue of staging fake encounters should be seen for what it is — murder most foul. It should not be clouded or sidetracked by questions on whether those done away with were ‘innocents' or extremists, gangsters, or whatever. Enough of rationalisations: no civilised society under the rule of law can countenance or tolerate extra-judicial killings, a practice that subverts the very principles the criminal justice system is founded upon.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/gujarats-close-encounters/article2653856.ece
24,11,2011,Hard times for Spain,"The Eurozone crisis has claimed its third government in a month, with Spanish voters giving the conservative Mariano Rajoy's People's Party a 16 percentage points triumph over José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's Socialist Party. Under the proportional electoral system, the winners have an absolute majority, with 186 seats out of 350 in the lower chamber of parliament, and are also set for a large Senate majority. The Socialists, who had called the election six months early in the hope of a third four-year term, lost one third of their seats. Despite being led through the campaign by the highly-respected Alredo Pérez Rubalcaba, they finished with their worst showing since the first post-Franco elections held in 1977. The economy, which was the decisive election issue, is moving steadily towards the point where, like those of Greece and Portugal, it will need a bailout. Spanish borrowing on international markets now faces interest rates of 6.3 per cent on 10-year loans, in contrast to 1.3 per cent for Germany. Unemployment is at 23 per cent. The Zapatero government has paid the price for being in office at the wrong time, when the housing bubble it was not really responsible for burst. Under Spanish procedures, the new government will not be formed for another few weeks.
It is true that Mr. Rajoy has promised no miracles. He says Spain will continue working within and through the institutions of the European Union. But his policy file looks thin, with few intentions stated beyond tax cuts for the small and medium-sized businesses that comprise over 90 per cent of the country's firms. He will benefit from measures his predecessor introduced, such as civil service pay cuts, a pensions freeze, and a higher retirement age, in addition to a constitutional amendment requiring long-term caps on budget deficits; Mr. Rajoy will have the difficult task of specifying the level of capping. Moreover, under the Socialist government, Spain's debt ratio fell to 36 per cent of GDP by 2007, and in effect Mr. Zapatero maintained zero borrowing on average until late 2008. Then disaster hit the Spanish economy with the housing bubble pushing mortgages up to unsustainable levels; when the bubble burst, the construction sector led the slide and revenues fell sharply. The economy now faces a deflationary spiral, not least because Mr. Rajoy's ideology involves yet more austerity. Nobel laureate Paul Krugman calls this strategy a romantic fantasy. The Spanish electorate may well find that, with the country in a hole, the new government knows only how to carry on digging.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Hard-times-for-Spain/article13497423.ece
25,11,2011,The challenges in banking,"The underlying theme of the Reserve Bank of India's report on ‘Trend and Progress of Banking' for 2010-11 is that domestic banks, which have acquitted themselves quite creditably in the recent past, will have to equip themselves to face an uncertain future. Increasingly, the banks and their regulator will be evaluated against global benchmarks. So far, banks in India have grown, showing remarkable resilience. Sporting adequate reserves of capital and liquidity, they have been able to improve both their profitability and asset quality. Given the high growth potential of the economy and favourable demographics, banks have immense opportunities to expand their business with traditional as well as innovative products. However, they face a number of challenges. Important among them are two: to maintain capital adequacy and to put in place risk management systems that would meet global standards. For some of the larger banks, the process of moving towards the Basel III regulatory regime has already begun. While the banking system as an entity may not have any great difficulty in adjusting to the new capital rules, there might be slippages at the level of individual banks, and they would have to augment their capital urgently. Studies by the RBI show a high level of inter-linkages among banks and this introduces an element of vulnerability. Checking the contagion will become particularly onerous for the RBI if the less regulated entities such as non-bank financial companies and mutual funds are also taken into reckoning.
Management of asset quality has always been a challenging task. It's more so now, because the apparent improvement in the levels of non-performing assets hides some disquieting trends. For instance, loan recoveries have not kept pace with slippages since 2007-08. The rising interest rates and the substantial restructuring done during the crisis period can undermine the asset quality of banks. There is an urgent need for all banks to address the NPA-related concerns and tighten their credit risk management systems. Over the past 15 years, Indian banks have raised the productive level remarkably and, in the process, moved closer to global benchmarks. Yet, they should do a lot more by way of attracting people's savings and channelling them into investment. In effect, this means banks will have to cut their ‘net interest margin', which in any case is high compared to some emerging economies. In the long term, the bank sector should work towards financial inclusion, where its products are accessible to everyone and its services run efficiently. In the medium term, banks have ample opportunities to grow, the challenges notwithstanding.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-challenges-in-banking/article2657023.ece
25,11,2011,Tantawi betrays public trust,"The Egyptian revolution is far from over. Public protest has surged again in response to the killing of at least 35 people, with 3,250 injured across the country, in violent crackdowns by the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF). In Cairo's Mohammed Mahmud Street near Tahrir Square, a volunteer doctor — one of about 200 who had turned up to help — was killed by gas inhalation after police fired a tear gas canister directly at the field hospital where she was working. Other doctors have spoken of the injured suffering convulsions, and have expressed suspicions that the military regime is using chemicals deadlier than the tear gas its forces used earlier. The cabinet has offered its resignation, but it is not clear if SCAF has accepted this. Following the latest atrocity, the protesters are calling for the departure of SCAF's chairman, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi. They want the Council to be replaced by civilian elders until elections are over. A compromise whereby a presidential election would be held in June 2012 and not at some unspecified time in 2013 might have been accepted had Mr. Tantawi not infuriated protesters by blaming foreign interference. For the time being, clerics from Al Azhar University, the country's foremost madrassa, have brokered a fragile truce.
SCAF has lost public trust through its indefensible acts of commission and omission, for instance trying civilian protesters and bloggers in military courts, and not even starting to clean up Egypt's notoriously corrupt administration. Nor has the regime made any attempt to reform the judiciary, the civil service, and the police, all of which had been turned into puppets in the hands of Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted by nationwide protests in January. Furthermore, SCAF has refused to postpone parliamentary elections scheduled for November 28; all political groups except one say this will leave them no time to build party organisations. The exception, significantly, is the Muslim Brotherhood, which has the biggest party machine and a socially conservative rural following. It stands to gain most in the imminent election, despite the damage its reputation has suffered on account of its opposition to the current protests. But all is far from lost for the pro-democracy campaigners. Even the Brotherhood is divided as a result of the latest violence, and some senior figures have defected. The military rulers, who seem to have learnt nothing and forgotten nothing, are replaying Mr. Mubarak's language and strategies. It is clear that Egypt, its hard-pressed people and its institutions, are in for a stern test.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tantawi-betrays-public-trust/article2657022.ece
26,11,2011,Indefensible ban,"None of the reasons given by the Tamil Nadu government for imposing a ban on the film Dam 999 holds water. The right to freedom of speech and expression, as enshrined in the Constitution and upheld time and again by the Supreme Court of India, is too dear to be sacrificed at the altar of political contingency. Everything the Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary, Debendranath Sarangi, stated about the film could be true, yet nothing would justify the ban on a film cleared by the Censor Board. Admittedly, the title of the film alludes to the Mullaperiyar Dam in Kerala, which was built in 1895 on land given to Madras State on a 999-year lease. The climax depicts the bursting of a weak dam, resulting in the death of hundreds of thousands of people. In publicity material for the film, the director, Sohan Roy, who hails from Kerala, spoke of dangers posed by old dams. Further, Biju Vincent, representing the Mullaperiyar Samara Samiti, which is spearheading opposition to the dam in Kerala, was present at a press conference to announce the release of the film. These facts do not constitute the slightest justification for a ban. To say the film would create discord between the people of Tamil Nadu and Kerala is to underestimate their good sense and maturity. If a motivated few instigate tensions that lead to law and order problems, the onus is on the State government and its law enforcing machinery to deal with them.
What is surprising is that the government allowed itself to be led by the chauvinist demands of some political parties for a ban on the film — instead of dealing firmly with those who threatened to prevent the screening of the film. As pointed out by A.P. Shah, retired Chief Justice of the Madras and Delhi High Courts, in an article in The Hindu ( >https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article2656995.ece), “different views are allowed to be expressed by proponents and opponents not because they are correct or valid, but because there is freedom in this country to express differing views on any issue.” If disturbance to law and order on account of the release of the film was a concern, the proper course for the government would have been to provide adequate security to cinemas screening the film and to act firmly against those seeking violently to disrupt public viewing of the film. As the Supreme Court laid down in its 1989 judgment in S. Rangarajan v Jagjivan Ram involving the film Ore Oru Gramathile, “freedom of expression cannot be suppressed on account of [the] threat of demonstration and processions or threats of violence.” Bans cannot be allowed to become a substitute for responsible policing. This is settled law, which will no doubt be reaffirmed when the matter is taken to court.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/indefensible-ban/article2660294.ece
26,11,2011,An apology in Turkey,"With his unexpected apology for the Kurdish massacre of 1937, Turkey's Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has opened the door to the darkest episodes in the country's history. The Dersim massacre, named after the place where it occurred, refers to the killing of nearly 14,000 Kurdish people to contain a rebellion that began soon after a 1935 law decreed ‘Turkification', the forcible assimilation of ethnic minorities. In this case, the flashpoint came when the name ‘Dersim' was changed to ‘Tunceli'. Referring to the incident, Mr. Erdogan said: “If it is necessary to apologise on behalf of the state, if there is such a practice in the books, I will apologise, I am apologising.” His main objective was to embarrass the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), which was in power at the time under a system of single-party rule established by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. He prefaced his statement of contrition with a challenge to the CHP leader to make the apology. He was also playing to the turmoil within the CHP, where some are calling on the party to face up to its past. For all the political point-scoring, Mr. Erdogan is the first Turkish leader to mention the incident and the word ‘apology' in the same breath. In this sense, it is historic. It also coincides with a government military offensive against the Kurdish rebel group PKK, the first in three years. Although the Erdogan government has made some linguistic and cultural concessions to the Kurdish minority, including starting a broadcast on state television in the once-banned Kurdish language, and reiterated a commitment to resolve the issue politically through talks with the Kurdish representatives, it is insistent that the PKK must first lay down arms.
In describing the Dersim incident as the “most tragic” in Turkey's recent history that should now be confronted “with courage,” Prime Minister Erdogan has unintentionally turned the spotlight on the 1915 massacre of Armenians, who say 1.5 million of them were killed in a genocide by the Ottoman regime that year. Turkey officially rejects the accusation, holding instead that up to half-a-million Armenians were killed, alongside a similar count of Turks, when they revolted against the Ottoman rulers during the First World War. Turkey's tough position on this is one of the obstacles to its entry into the European Union. The apology for Dersim is likely to spur fresh demands that Turkey show contrition for 1915 as well, although this seems unlikely. Beyond Turkey, there is a lesson in this for other nations: state injustice and brutality against a group or groups of people is not easily forgotten, not even in a hundred years.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-apology-in-turkey/article2660295.ece
28,11,2011,Misplaced obsession,"In a show of audacity, the United Progressive Alliance government has decided to further open up the retail trade sector to foreign investment. Foreign investors will be permitted to enter the hitherto prohibited multi-brand retail segment and hold equity of up to 51 per cent in the units established. That there is widespread political opposition to this change in policy was known for long. Hence, the move is nothing short of a declaration that UPA II would proceed with implementing its agenda of economic reform, irrespective of whether there is majority support for, let alone a consensus on, that agenda. The opposition to foreign direct investment in the retail sector stems from a number of well-grounded fears. FDI in retail would introduce competition from large players with deep pockets and international sourcing capabilities who would be able to exploit economies in procurement, storage, and distribution to out-compete smaller traders and subordinate myriad small suppliers. The immediate and direct effect would be a significant loss of employment in the small and unorganised retail trade displaced by the big retail firms. The government's claims to the contrary are questionable. They exaggerate the direct and indirect employment that large retail would create and ignore the number of jobs they would displace. Conditions on foreign investors, such as the requirement of a minimum investment of $100 million and entry permission only for cities with populations exceeding one million are not material. They do not change the source of the competition — giants like Walmart, Tesco, and Carrefour — nor the locations in which such competition is most likely to be faced. And the requirement that 30 per cent of manufactured or processed products sold should be sourced from small and medium enterprises would be impossible to implement, especially because it applies to such producers from anywhere in the world.
An erosion of the incomes earned by petty producers is likely to accompany the loss of employment. Prices paid to and returns earned by small suppliers, especially in agriculture, would be depressed because a few oligopolistic buyers dominate the retail trade. This would shift the distribution of the margin above production costs implicit in the retail price away from the producers to the retailers. Given the precarious viability of crop production even at present, that shift could severely damage livelihoods. Moreover, once the retail trade is concentrated in a few firms, retail margins themselves could rise, with implications for prices paid by the consumer, especially in years when domestic supply falls short. None but the Manmohan Singh government believes that FDI in retail is a remedy for the relentless inflation the country faces. All things considered, it would be best advised to focus on improving public distribution and enhancing agricultural productivity — and not court more controversy pursuing a misplaced obsession.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/misplaced-obsession/article2665876.ece
28,11,2011,Europe's blow for health safety,"The European Commission's recent decision to ban the use of X-ray technology for full-body scanning at airports to avoid “jeopardising” the health and safety of passengers is a victory for millions of travellers. The legislation requires all the 27 member countries to follow “strict and mandatory safeguards” that comply with the “fundamental rights and protection of [passengers'] health.” This marks a sharp departure from the stand taken by the United States, which is planning to increase the number of such machines at airports. Though X-ray scanners expose passengers to only low levels of radiation, equivalent to that received in a few minutes of flying, any intentional use for purposes other than medical violates the basic tenets of radiation safety. That people are naturally exposed to ionising radiation every day is not an acceptable argument. Avoiding exposure, and reducing it where unavoidable, must be the cornerstone of radiation safety. Ionising radiation has a cumulative effect, and the risk of cancer exists even when the radiation dose is low — this was highlighted in a 2006 report of the National Academy of Sciences. The risk to an individual may be small. But the overall impact may not be so when the number of people exposed to radiation is large. The use of X-ray scanners becomes all the more questionable considering that millimetre-wave scanners — an equally efficient technology that uses radio waves — can be used for screening. Unlike X-rays, radio waves do not ionise the molecules of the body, and there is virtually no health risk. Nearly 250 millimetre-wave scanners are already in use in U.S. airports.
Security concerns seem to override health concerns in the U.S. Unlike radiation-emitting appliances in hospitals, X-ray scanners do not come under the preview of the Food and Drug Administration and are not subject to rigorous evaluations. The reason: they are not used for medical purposes. This raises serious concerns as regular and thorough monitoring of radiation dose by a competent authority is essential for all radiation emitting machines. Why the U.S. Transportation Security Administration is keen on equipping airports with more of these machines when a safer alternative is available remains a puzzle.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/europes-blow-for-health-safety/article2665877.ece
29,11,2011,Death of an extremist,"The killing of Mallojula Koteshwar Rao, known as Kishenji, at the hands of counterinsurgency security forces in the Burisole forests of West Bengal's West Midnapore district may be a setback to the Maoist movement but it gives no cause to rejoice. The circumstances of the killing raise several questions. Was it really an encounter in the forests, as the security forces claim, or was he executed after being captured? If it was indeed an encounter, the Maoist leader battling security forces by himself with the AK47 found by his body, could he have been apprehended alive? In some ways, Kishenji's death recalls the dubious circumstances in which another Maoist leader, Cherukuri Rajkumar, known as Azad, was killed in Andhra Pradesh in July 2010, along with journalist Hemachandra Pandey. On the Supreme Court's intervention, the CBI is conducting a probe into that killing. The doubts about Kishenji's killing also warrant an impartial investigation. After all, the killing came at a time when Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, through interlocutors, was exploring the possibility of talks. Even though a one-month long ceasefire in West Bengal had ended after the Maoists killed two Trinamool members, setting off a full-fledged operation in the State earlier this month, the interlocutors, on instructions from the Chief Minister, were trying to bring the Maoists to the negotiating table. Angered by Kishenji's killing, five of the six interlocutors have quit causing a setback to those efforts.
That Azad was killed at a time when the central government was contemplating a ceasefire and talks with the Maoists may be a coincidence. But there is no escaping the reality that over and above being a threat to security, the Maoist insurgency is a political question that needs political answers. It cannot be wished away with heavy-handed security operations. Its call to arms against the Indian state has drawn followers from the poorest, the most deprived, the most exploited sections of the people. As insurgents whose war is waged among the people, the Maoists have built a reputation for savage violence that has been unsparing of combatants and civilians alike, and sometimes deliberately put civilian lives at risk from the security forces. But they will continue to find supporters as long as there are people who feel excluded from the country's politics and its economic policies. Kishenji was successful in building up what was described, with some exaggeration, as a ‘second Naxalbari' in Lalgarh, and in organising people in Nandigram and Singur, precisely because he was able to tap into people's anger at economic policies that were perceived as unjust. His killing deprives the Maoist movement of a leader, but not the causes that sustain it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/death-of-an-extremist/article2669002.ece
29,11,2011,Could life have arisen on Mars?,"On Saturday, a car-sized rover named Curiosity rocketed off to Mars to seek further clues to that tantalising question — is there life out there? At the turn of the last century, there were fanciful ideas of a sophisticated Martian civilisation capable of digging vast systems of canals. But the Mariner spacecraft that flew past and orbited Earth's neighbour as well as the two Viking landers that touched down on its surface in 1976 sent back images of a cold, bleak, and barren land, with a thin atmosphere that was mostly carbon dioxide and no signs of life. However, missions to the planet since the 1990s have raised exciting possibilities that scientists are eager to explore. There are indications that Mars was once a wetter, perhaps even warmer, place. Water may have flowed on its surface and could still exist below the surface. Life could have arisen there and may be clinging on in some niches, such as underground springs warmed by volcanoes. Such life could take the form of hardy microbes.
Curiosity, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory, is expected to complete its 567-million-kilometre journey to the Red Planet in August 2012. A complicated and perilous descent will follow to set the 900-kg, six-wheeled rover on the floor of the large Gale crater. The rover, equipped with a suite of 10 scientific instruments, is the most sophisticated explorer sent to another planet. The experiments it will carry out are not, the U.S. space agency says, intended to “detect active processes that would signify present-day biological metabolism.” Nor would it try to image micro-organisms or their fossil remains. Rather, its task will be to find out if conditions favourable for life existed on the planet. It will seek additional evidence of water and how the Martian climate might have changed over time. A layered mountain at the centre of the crater, with minerals that form in water, might provide a wealth of information about such changes. The rover will also look for organic molecules, a further sign that life could have arisen there. It will examine whether the traces of methane found in the atmosphere could have a biological origin. In addition, it will try to establish the various energy sources that life forms could utilise. Down the road, what scientists would really like is a mission to bring back Martian soil and rock samples for detailed analysis in the lab. But such a mission will be costly and stands little chance of being funded any time soon. So when it comes to understanding possibilities for life on Mars, it's over to Curiosity and the science it can do.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/could-life-have-arisen-on-mars/article2669000.ece
30,11,2011,Protecting the Himalayas,"The ministerial declaration issued by India, Bhutan, Nepal, and Bangladesh addressing food, water, energy, and biodiversity concerns in the Himalayan region is a welcome initiative to protect this biodiversity-rich mountain range. The vast area faces a variety of problems that directly affect the local communities, and threaten ecosystem services provided to millions of people in neighbouring countries. Some of the serious issues that need urgent attention are accelerated forest loss, soil erosion, resource degradation, and loss of habitat and biodiversity. Climate change is a major source of worry, and needs intensive study because of its potential for severe ecological damage. It is a step forward therefore that four countries in the subcontinent convened the Climate Summit for a Living Himalayas in Bhutan and evolved a consensus-based mitigation effort primarily for the eastern part. The task before the signatories is to build institutions that will pursue research and share knowledge, beginning with a centre for the study of climate change. Sustained effort is necessary to achieve the key goals: access to reliable and affordable energy; food and water security; demarcation of connected conservation spaces; and sustainable use of biodiversity for poverty alleviation.
The Himalayan region includes many climatic systems: tropical, sub-tropical, temperate, and alpine. Thanks to sheer inaccessibility, this remote and difficult landscape has mostly escaped the ill-effects of the industrial farming system, such as pesticide and insecticide use and the introduction of hybrid or transgenic crops. Himalayan biodiversity provides a resource base for an estimated 80 million people, mostly subsistence farmers and pastoral communities. The challenge is to provide strong support systems to help them adapt to climate change. And yet data that can aid conservation of biodiversity are far from comprehensive. India, for instance, acknowledged at the summit that an inventory of the Eastern Himalayas, the target region for protection, at the level of genes, species, ecosystem, and landscape is yet to be completed. This task can brook no delay. The Himalayas form part of global natural heritage, and the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change must provide substantial funding for research, capacity-building, and preservation. It is also important to harness traditional knowledge and get local communities to participate in conservation programmes. A good example of this is the protection plan for snow leopards in India's Spiti valley. The Himalaya protection programme can achieve even more, if Pakistan, China, and Afghanistan join the initiative.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/protecting-the-himalayas/article2672059.ece
30,11,2011,Morocco bound in quasi-democracy,"As expected, Morocco's moderate Islamist group, the Justice and Development Party (PJD) headed by Abdelilah Benkirane, has emerged on top in the 395-seat lower chamber, the House of Representatives. In the November 26 election, the PJD took 107 seats under the closed-list proportional electoral system, which also reserves 60 seats for a national list of women and 30 for candidates aged below 35. The turnout of 45.4 per cent was up on the lowest recorded, 37 per cent in 2006, but the registered electorate of 13.6 million is well below reliable estimates that 21 million of the country's 33 million people are eligible to be on the electoral rolls. In the event, the former ruling party, Istiqlal, came second with 60 seats, and is likely to join the PJD in government; the alliance will need the backing of other parties as well. The new constitution, approved by national referendum in July, requires King Mohammed VI to name the leader of the winning party as Prime Minister — instead of nominating anyone he pleased. Mr. Benkirane becomes the second moderate Islamist leader to win an election since the start of the pro-democracy uprisings in West Asia and North Africa, the first being Rachid Ghannouchi, whose An-Nahda party won in Tunisia a month ago.
The vibrant Tunisian election saw 90 per cent turnout in some areas while the Moroccan poll took place amid widespread cynicism and allegations of fraud. The King has faced lower levels of open dissent than other regional leaders. He seemed to herald reform of a brutal state apparatus when he ascended the throne in 1999 but abandoned the project when he cracked down on the pro-democracy February 20 movement, which pressed for a boycott of elections. Subsequent concessions such as the transfer of many powers to the prime minister have failed to inspire many voters. Furthermore, the monarch retains control of foreign policy, security, and religion. Mr. Benkirane, for his part, will face economic problems with 8.5 million Moroccans destitute. The PJD's conservative voter-base will also resist change; despite constitutional recognition of civic and social equality to supplement political equality, women continue to suffer subjugation and discrimination in a very traditional society. On the brighter side, the European Union-Moroccan agreement to develop wind and other renewable energy projects could prove a handsome earner; and with western tourism badly needed, the PJD may moderate some of its stances. The February 20 movement plans further protests and is unlikely to let up until Morocco becomes a full-fledged democracy. This election is by no means the end of the story.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/morocco-bound-in-quasidemocracy/article2672062.ece
1,12,2011,Don't bend to bigots,"“One is my brother and the other is not is the thinking of a narrow-minded person. For those who are broad-minded, liberals, or noble people, the entire world is one big family.” This translation from the Maha Upanishad is part of the vision statement of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), established in 1952 and held annually in Goa. Unfortunately, the IFFI directorate seemed to have momentarily lost the nerve to uphold the spirit of broad-mindedness and tolerance reflected in these uplifting lines. When faced with the threat from right wing groups such as the Janajagruti Samiti (HJS), which had vociferously demanded that a documentary directed by the celebrated painter M.F. Husain be withdrawn, the IFFI's organisers, in a Pavlovian response, deferred the screening of the film. They also came up with a dubious explanation for their action. The IFFI director, Shankar Mohan, said legal technicalities (an apparent reference to the court cases against Husain that a HJS memorandum had drawn attention to) would be examined before a final decision was taken on screening. But what law could have possibly prevented or interfered with the screening of a documentary produced by the Films Division of the Government of India — one that was good enough to win the Golden Bear award at the Berlin International Film Festival? Not surprisingly, the abrupt cancellation of the scheduled screening was widely perceived as a re-run of 2009, when the Husain documentary was withdrawn following threats from the very same quarters.
To their credit, the IFFI's organisers acted quickly to reverse course. To have buckled under the threat would have been unpardonable. After all, the Goa film festival is jointly conducted by the Union Ministry of Information & Broadcasting and the State government; and the director of IFFI is appointed by the central government. In other words, it was not as if the HJS was attempting to sabotage the screening by threatening a few vulnerable individuals or a weak organisation. Like the news media, cinema creates its own space for free expression. An important reason for an organisation such as IFFI to stage film festivals is to promote cinema as a vehicle for encouraging reflection and debate on a variety of social issues. Withdrawing the film would have been tantamount to encouraging those very groups that forced Husain to flee India by threatening his life and liberty and by filing a slew of venomous complaints against him. Fortunately, IFFI did the right thing in the end by declaring it would go ahead with screening the film in the face of the threats — a decision that sends a timely message against cultural bigotry, obscurantism, and moral vigilantism.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dont-bend-to-bigots/article2675499.ece
1,12,2011,Travails of technocrats,"In both Greece and Italy, the biggest threats to the European monetary union, technocrats rather than elected political leaders have been given the daunting task of salvaging the economies, a crucial step towards saving the euro. On November 13, Mario Monti, a former European Union commissioner, was appointed Italy's new Prime Minister, after the scandal-ridden government of Silvio Berlusconi resigned. Two days earlier, in Greece, Lucas Papademos, a former senior official of the European Central Bank, took over as the head of a new coalition government, replacing George Papandreou. The two leaders preside over governments that are packed with technocrats. Both are eminently qualified to undertake tough economic reforms and push through unpalatable austerity measures. Both understand the language of the financial markets, to which they owe their appointments in the first place. Yet neither has ever contested an election or held an office before being pitchforked into the high office. To be fair, neither country had much choice. In Greece, Mr. Papandreou struggled to implement the austerity measures demanded by euro-zone lenders to keep the bailout money flowing into his empty coffers. Knowing that these measures would be hugely unpopular, he promised a referendum but soon backtracked in the face of opposition from Germany and France.
In Italy, Mr. Berlusconi's dithering over reforms was not received well by financial markets. The country's borrowing costs soared and, in a worst case scenario, it was feared that it would not be able to finance its $2.6 trillion of debt. The consequences would have been disastrous, and not just for the euro. Less than two weeks after the change of guard in Greece and Italy, it is becoming clearer by the day that an administration led by technocrats by itself cannot go far in reforming the economy or, even more basically, in winning the confidence of the bond markets. Without political constituencies of their own, the leaders may not to be able to muster support for reforms. Politicians in both countries, quite unnerved by the defeat of governments in Portugal, Ireland, and Spain — where elections were held after the debt crisis started — have threatened to withdraw support. It might well be that the task of saving the euro, which has become Europe's main goal, cannot be left exclusively to technocrats or politicians. More than its undoubted economic significance, the euro has had a deeply political message of integrating diverse nations and providing a framework for promoting peace and harmony in a continent so often ravaged by war.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/travails-of-technocrats/article2675498.ece
2,12,2011,No more blockades,"The United Naga Council's decision to lift its blockade of two crucial national highways leading into Manipur ahead of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's Imphal visit this weekend is hardly a cause for relief in the State. The Naga groups ended the 100-day blockade with the threat of another one, if the government made any move in favour of a competing territorial demand by the Kukis. The Kukis are demanding a separate district in an area of Manipur that the Nagas claim as part of their ‘Nagalim' demand. The UNC says it decided to call off the blockade after a meeting with Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram on November 22, at which he gave the assurance that the Manipur government would not be allowed to take any unilateral decision on the issue of a Kuki district. Meanwhile, the Kukis have threatened to carry out their own blockade if the promise of a district for them, contained in a written assurance from Chief Minister Ibobi Singh, does not materialise. The rhetoric on both sides is only likely to become more strident as the State heads towards elections, due early next year. Manipur's Congress government appears content to muddle through the conflicting demands, perhaps betting that this is the best course to win the backing of the majority Meitei community in the coming elections. In any case, it does not have an entirely free hand to resolve the issue. The resolution of ethnic territorial demands in Manipur is inextricably linked to the Centre's negotiations with the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah), a process so opaque since it began in 1997 that it has added much to the suspicions and tensions between the ethnic groups in the region.
A three-day bandh called against the blockade by a Meitei secessionist group — the Kangleipak Communist Party — and a bomb explosion in Imphal on Wednesday that killed one person underline the fact that Manipur is one of the most troubled States in that region today, given its ethnic tensions and a host of insurgencies, run by shadowy militant groups that are little more than criminal gangs. The Centre has shown an alarming disinterest bordering on apathy about Manipur's problems. The only possible excuse is that the UPA government is too beset by its problems to pay attention to a faraway State. Prime Minister Singh's December 3 visit is an opportunity to demonstrate renewed focus on Manipur. He must send a clear message that the politics of blackmail, whether through blockades or bombs, will not be allowed to succeed, and that the way forward is in building an inclusive vision for the region, rather than one based on narrow ethnic identities.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-more-blockades/article2678399.ece
2,12,2011,Bring in plain packaging,"The reason why only 2.5 per cent of children in Australia in the 12-17 age group smoke daily is not difficult to figure out — they have never been exposed to any cigarette advertising. If the Australian government banned cigarette advertising on television and radio way back in 1976, a similar ban for the print media came into effect in 1989. Pictorial warning was enforced in 2006, and since 2010 tobacco products have been removed from sight in retail outlets. Now the Plain Packaging Bill 2011 legislated recently seeks to undermine the last powerful marketing vehicle used by manufacturers to build and sustain brand image — cigarette packaging. With effect from December 1, 2012, cigarette packs and tobacco products will have no logos, promotional text, or colour variation. Instead, 75 per cent of the pack must carry horrendous pictures of diseases and conditions caused by smoking. Large text warnings must accompany the pictures. The rest of the pack will have a plain background with the name of the company and cigarette brand in a prescribed size and font. In short, packaging will be used for strongly conveying a vital public health message, and for reducing the association with the brand's identity. Unsurprisingly, the revolutionary legislation has been challenged by one of the manufacturers — Philip Morris Asia of Hong Kong that owns the Australian affiliate.
The challenge is mainly on the ground that the government has been “unable to demonstrate” that plain packaging will be “effective in reducing smoking.” There is no precedent to measure the effectiveness of plain packaging. But the fact that adult smoking rates dropped from 24 per cent in 1991 to 15 per cent in 2010 is proof that several marketing and smoking restrictions put in place have produced excellent results. In fact, as a signatory to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), Australia is following the world health body's guidelines on plain packaging. Canada, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand are keenly following the case as they plan to introduce similar measures. India is a study in contrast. The government took the moral high ground during the TRIPS council meeting on June 7, 2011, but has failed to implement simple anti-smoking measures recommended by the WHO. It has not replaced the old ineffective pictorial warnings introduced in 2009. Worse, succumbing to industry pressure, it has revised the FCTC norms of rotating pictorial warnings every year; it will now rotate them only once in two years. Smoking is estimated to kill nearly a million people in India every year. Why can't we emulate Australia?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bring-in-plain-packaging/article2678398.ece
3,12,2011,Egypt's problematic election,"The Egyptian election, the country's first since Hosni Mubarak's 30-year dictatorship ended, is procedurally complex. More important, the exercise, which started on November 28, takes place in a profoundly uncertain political climate. It is not a general election; the bodies elected — the 498-seat People's Assembly, and the 270-seat Shura Council (upper house) — will have the task of writing a constitution ahead of the June 2012 presidential election. Both chambers will be elected under a version of the additional member system; the 50-million electorate will choose two-thirds of the members from party lists and one-third by simple majority, but if they do not also pick two independents on their respective ballot papers, their votes will be invalid. In addition, the three-phase process means different regions will vote at different times; the People's Assembly poll, which started on November 28, ends on January 10, 2012, and the Shura vote will last from January 29 to March 11. As many as 40 parties are involved, with over 10,000 candidates contesting. There were huge turnouts on the first two days; reliable initial estimates give a substantial lead to the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), the Islamist party of the Muslim Brotherhood.
The context, unfortunately, undermines some of the poll's legitimacy. Voting is compulsory; the fine of over $80 for not voting will inflate the turnout unrealistically, among an electorate already suspicious of the system. Secondly, the timing will skew the results; the FJP has by far the biggest party machine, and the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) has ignored the calls by other groups for more time to organise. In effect, the whole playing field is tilted in favour of the FJP. Many secular parties stopped campaigning in protest against the November killings of 42 protesters in and around Tahrir Square, but the FJP continued campaigning. Neither the party nor its parent body has condemned those killings or the earlier sectarian killings of Copts. Furthermore, the party has a vast, socially conservative, and predominantly rural voter base, whose attitudes it is sure to reflect when the assemblies deliberate on the place of religion in the new constitution. The movement, however, is not monolithic. Some senior figures have quit over the failure to condemn the killings, and a generational divide is also appearing. Above all, the holding of the election itself is an achievement not of the Brotherhood but of the Tahrir Square protesters. They challenged and overthrew one of the most enduring and repressive of the many dictatorships and absolute monarchies in West Asia and North Africa. Egypt is a great nation and its secular democrats can still transform their country and the region.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/egypts-problematic-election/article2681764.ece
3,12,2011,The slowdown captured,"The official GDP data for the second quarter of this fiscal year (July-September 2011) reflect the economic slowdown more vividly than they did in the previous quarter. The deceleration in economic activity has been in evidence for quite some time now and seen across many sectors. Forecasters, both official and private, have been consistently revising downwards their projections for the year. Hence the Central Statistics Office data pegging second quarter growth at 6.9 per cent, the lowest in nine quarters and sharply lower than the previous quarter's 7.7 per cent, do not come as a surprise. Over the same period last year, the growth rate was 8.4 per cent. The decline is spread across agriculture and most of the sub-sectors of industry, while the services have performed well. Agriculture grew by 3.2 per cent, as against 5.4 per cent last year. It is however hoped that the remaining two quarters will see the farm sector making a recovery, buoyed by the good monsoon. As for manufacturing, the sharp fall in growth from 7.8 per cent last year to 2.7 per cent now was not unexpected. The monthly industrial production figures have been clearly indicating the downtrend. Mining output fell by 2.9 per cent, whereas it recorded a growth of 8 per cent in the second quarter of last year.
The slowdown in general and the decline in manufacturing and mining in particular are attributed to a number of well-known factors. The debt crisis in Europe and the lacklustre performance of the U.S. economy have certainly had their impact on India. Specifically, India's booming export performance during the first half of the year could not be sustained in the face of demand contraction in the advanced economies. Monetary tightening by the RBI has increased the cost of borrowing. However, inflation has remained stubbornly high, at close to double digit, and it is by no means certain that the central bank will loosen its monetary stance in the ensuing policy statement. The government's procrastination in taking certain key decisions related to mining, granting infrastructure concessions and setting tariffs has been another contributory factor. By far the most worrying aspect is the fall in investment. While the gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) has registered a negative growth of 0.6 per cent, the investment rate has dropped to 28 per cent. These suggest dimmer growth prospects in the months ahead. It is time to realise that growth rates would be more in the range of 7-7.5 per cent than the 9 per cent that was hoped for earlier.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-slowdown-captured/article2681763.ece
5,12,2011,Mood shift in Russia,"The winds of change blowing in the Arab East appear to have reached Russia. The ruling United Russia party has suffered big losses in Sunday's parliamentary elections in a sign of dramatic shifts in the public mood in Russian society. United Russia polled just under 50 per cent of the popular vote, almost 15 percentage points lower than it did four years ago. It will still occupy more than half the seats in the 450-member State Duma, thanks to votes cast for outsiders, but it will see its majority slashed from 90 to 15 seats. Three opposition parties represented in Parliament have made impressive gains: the Communists will have 92 seats in the new house, an increase of 60 per cent, followed by A Just Russia with 64 seats, up from the current 38 seats, and the Liberal Democrats of Vladimir Zhirinovsky with 56 seats against today's 40 seats. The reduced support for United Russia, which has controlled Parliament for the past 10 years, is partly a reaction to the economic crisis of 2008-2009, which hit people's earnings; it is also a protest against the failure of authorities to rein in corruption, which has slowed Russia's modernisation drive. The election results also indicated people's growing political activism and impatience with the overbearing dominance of the political scene by a single party.
United Russia's election setback deals a blow to its chairman, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, just as he prepares to reclaim the presidency in the March 2012 election under an agreement with President Dmitry Medvedev. Previous election successes of the ruling party — set up in 2001 to provide a political base for President Putin — have closely mirrored his popularity as a strong leader who presided over Russia's resurgence from the chaos of the 1990s. When United Russia swept to a two-thirds constitutional majority in the State Duma in 2007, it was seen as a vote of thanks for Mr. Putin who refused to cling on to power and promoted a younger leader to steer Russia along the path he had charted. However, instead of stepping back, Mr. Putin remained the dominant power behind the throne in the past four years, holding back political and economic reforms proclaimed by his successor. The disappointing performance of United Russia is the writing on the wall. It came two months after the two top leaders announced their decision to switch jobs and barely a week after the party formally nominated Mr. Putin as its candidate in the forthcoming presidential elections. Mr. Putin's assured return appears to have failed to inspire Russians. They have sent a strong message the Kremlin can ignore only at its own peril. People want political competition, they want progressive reform, and they want new leaders.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mood-shift-in-russia/article2689767.ece
5,12,2011,Football's philosopher,"For all the kicking, and the pushing and shoving, football is a thinking man's game. And for as long as he played, Socrates was its philosopher, on and off the field. The Brazilian great, who died of an intestinal infection on Sunday, was captain of the 1982 team — regarded as one of the best and most attractive of teams never to win a World Cup, ranking alongside Ferenc Puskas' Hungarians of 1954 and Johan Cruyff's Dutchmen of 1974. But he was not all art and no success. Behind the seeming effortlessness of his midfield movements, his back-heel passes, and his penalty kicks was a hard-working brain that sensed an opportunity where others could not. The ease of physical motion, which sometimes gave the appearance of nonchalance or laziness, would not have been possible without the inch-perfect anticipation of a trained mind. But the constant efforts at out-thinking opponents did not always pay off. One of his biggest failures was the botched penalty during the tie-breaker against France in the World Cup quarterfinal in 1986. Socrates walked up to the ball, and held back his shot for a fraction of a second to see if goalkeeper Joel Bats would move one way or the other. Goalkeepers tend to take a chance during penalties. But Bats had decided not to move, and was able to keep out Socrates' attempt to the top of the net. Not unusually for someone whose mind reduced the load on his body, Socrates was given to the indulgences of drinking and smoking. Whatever liberties he could take with his body, he took, especially when he knew those made no difference to his playing. But while his football did not suffer, in later years his body could not bear the cumulative burden of the abuse.
Socrates, who qualified as a medical doctor after his playing years, did not confine his free-spirited and incisive thinking to the football field. An admirer of the Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara, he co-founded the Democracia Corinthiana, a movement formed in revolt at the authoritarian ways of football club management. Besides helping to organise players and democratise football clubs, Democracia, with Socrates in the forefront, also served as a catalyst for political change in Brazil, then under a military dictatorship. Trade unions and political organisations took the cue from Democracia, inspiring strikes and protests. Along with his achievements in football, Socrates valued his contribution through Democracia highly. In his death, Brazil has lost not only a legend in football, but a truly inspirational figure. Here was a philosopher who understood that a key function of philosophy was to contribute to changing the world.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/footballs-philosopher/article2689766.ece
5,12,2011,Hillary in Myanmar,"If Myanmar's regime was looking for approval from the superpower as it goes down the road of political reform, it has got one now, even if this is somewhat cautious and with conditions attached. The visit of Hillary Clinton was the first by a United States Secretary of State since John Foster Dulles' in 1955, and for this reason, it carried symbolic value. In 1988, the U.S. downgraded diplomatic relations with Myanmar after a military crackdown on pro-democracy activists; it still does not have an Ambassador there. After the junta rejected the 1990 election victory of Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy and placed her under arrest, Washington imposed economic sanctions. But the perestroika President Thein Sein set in motion earlier this year has clearly changed the way the world looks at Myanmar now. The Thein Sein regime's decision to introduce political reforms was born out of the realisation that it needed to end its isolation and make connections with the world outside China, the ASEAN countries, and India, which have remained engaged with it over most of the last two decades. That Ms Suu Kyi is participating in these reforms, in a measured way, has given the process much credibility. Ms Clinton was careful to describe her visit to Myanmar as “a first date, not a marriage.” She stressed that further steps, including the lifting of sanctions, would depend on “real” progress towards democratic reforms, including an unconditional release of all prisoners. Washington also wants the regime to cut military ties with North Korea. Still the announcement of projects worth $1.2 million in education and health sectors is a major step forward. American restrictions on international financial assistance to Myanmar have also been eased.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/hillary-in-myanmar/article2687164.ece
5,12,2011,Evergreen hornbills,"Hornbills are beautiful birds familiar to many as farmers of the forest that ensure the dispersal of fruit seeds. Nine species of these large birds are found in India, mainly in the Northeast and the Western ghats; Narcondam island in the Andamans hosts the critically endangered Narcondam hornbill. The great hornbill, a magnificent bird reaching a length of three-and-a-half feet, is distinguished by a big yellow beak with a casque and striking tail feathers. Sadly, accelerating habitat loss threatens its future, and hunting has depleted populations. It is protected at the highest level under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, but that can do little to save the habitat. In the Western ghats, the proposed hydroelectric project at Athirapilly across the Chalakudy river will destroy precious landscape sheltering the species, and three others — the Malabar pied, the Malabar grey, and Indian grey hornbills. This area is part of the Athirapilly-Vazhachal-Chalakudy riverine region, a biodiversity hotspot. There is some hope that continuing scientific studies on hornbills in the Western ghats will save the birds; they have highlighted the role of undisturbed forests, as opposed to degraded ones, in sustaining healthy populations. It is heartening that the Kerala Forest department, in partnership with researchers and Kadar tribal people, is carrying out a large-scale exercise of monitoring nesting-holes over an extensive area of hornbill habitat.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/evergreen-hornbills/article2687162.ece
7,12,2011,Rein in the emotions,"At this point, when there is an overflow of emotions on the Mullaperiyar dam issue, the priority cannot be going into the merits of the arguments pressed by Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Suffice it to note that Kerala fears for the safety of the 116-year-old dam situated in Idukki district and wants a new dam to be built in its place. Tamil Nadu's stand is that the dam, which supplies water, mainly for irrigation purposes, to several of its districts, is perfectly safe and the fears are baseless. Both sides see vital interests — questions of life and death — at stake. The process of finding a sustainable solution is under way: in a matter of weeks, an empowered committee appointed by the Supreme Court of India will give its opinion on the safety questions after examining the reports of various experts. Meanwhile, there has been some ugly fallout — stray acts of violence reported from different locations — on both sides of the border. Chauvinistic forces have tried to exploit the situation but the major political leaders in both States have responded soberly and responsibly while reiterating their positions on the issue. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa has called on political parties to desist from making inflammatory speeches on the issue, and on Keralites not to succumb to the machinations of “mischief-mongers.” Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy has appealed for absolute restraint on the part of his State. Kerala's position was clear, he explained — water for Tamil Nadu, safety for its people — and the State government wanted to resolve the issue, keeping the good relations with Tamil Nadu intact.
The sobriety at the top needs to be followed up on the ground. Every effort must be made to deal firmly with the disruptive elements behind the violence. Equally important, people in both States need to be assured that this is an issue that can be resolved scientifically and amicably. The Mullaperiyar dispute is not about water-sharing, which would allow give and take at a political level. The resolution of the safety issues, and consequential questions, must necessarily come through the agency of technical expertise — and in this case along a legal track. But what political leadership at the top can do is to reach across the border and engage constructively to damp the overheated situation. As Chief Minister Jayalalithaa has pointed out, Kerala and Tamil Nadu can count on mutual trust, goodwill, and esteem, built up and nurtured over a long period. In creating an atmosphere conducive to finding and implementing a scientific, just, and sustainable solution to the Mullaperiyar issue, the media, writers, academics, cultural leaders, and other sections of the intelligentsia in both States have a vital role to play.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rein-in-the-emotions/article2695792.ece
7,12,2011,Futile in Bonn,"Pious pledges have been made, during this week's Bonn Conference, of continuing support to Afghanistan after NATO forces withdraw in 2014. But financial commitments cannot help paper over the dismal failure of the international community's Project Afghanistan. Even in terms of money, the cut-price promises from the frayed United States and European economies can hardly fill the gaps in the tottering country-building exercise in Afghanistan. In any case, the problem is far more fundamental. It is about who gets to control Afghanistan, which is viewed by several of the world's leading powers less as a country than as a valuable geo-strategic real estate. The U.S. and the West want Afghanistan in the hands of someone who would represent them and their interests. Pakistan, on the other hand, shares 2,500 km of an open boundary with Afghanistan, and sees it as vital to its security strategy against India; it wants its nominees in Kabul. All agree that talks with the Taliban are now necessary to end the war. Pakistan, with its ties to the Taliban and other allied militant groups, sees itself eminently placed to call the shots in the negotiations. Washington, for its part, wants to negotiate only with a weakened Taliban, expecting the Pakistan Army to join in the military effort to this end, impossibly asking it to kill its golden goose. The tensions in U.S.-Pakistan relations, on the boil after NATO's killing of 24 Pakistani soldiers on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, are a reflection of these contradictions.
Pakistan's non-participation at Bonn in protest against the killings of its soldiers was a reiteration that unless it gets it way, it will play the obstructionist in Afghanistan. Notwithstanding the futility of Bonn, Pakistan's boycott was poor tactics; it confirms the international community's worst fears of a country that seeks to bargain with a gun to its own head. It is increasingly clear that given the conflicting interests of the main actors, the only way to sort out the mess in Afghanistan is to stop treating it as a playground for international and regional rivalries. As Chinmaya R. Gharekhan and Karl Inderfurth have argued in The Hindu (Op-ed, December 5), lasting peace in Afghanistan and the region will be possible only when all the so-called stakeholders undertake not to interfere in its internal affairs. The Afghan groups made this explicit request at the first Bonn Conference in 2001; this is what the international community should be working towards. For it to succeed though, it would also need Afghanistan to declare neutrality — and pledge that it would not allow itself to be used against another country.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/futile-in-bonn/article2695788.ece
7,12,2011,Losers gain,"Although the Congress government in Andhra Pradesh has survived the no-confidence motion in the State Legislative Assembly by 160 to 122 votes, this may actually see the deepening of Chief Minister Kiran Kumar Reddy's political troubles. The survival margin might not seem small but sterner tests lie in wait outside the House. Sixteen Congress MLAs defied the party whip and voted for the motion; all of them owe allegiance to Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, the seriously rich son of former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy. If the ruling party really presses for their disqualification from the Assembly, the government will face a most unwelcome prospect — a mini-Assembly-election. Already there are seven vacancies, six on account of resignations on the Telangana issue, and one caused by the death of a member. Chief Minister Reddy might discover that ensuring that legislators stayed in line is a lot easier than winning people's votes. The 16 MLAs who cast their lot with Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy would most likely welcome the opportunity to contest again as candidates of the YSR Congress floated by him. After losing a string of by-elections in the Telangana region, the Congress looks in deep trouble in the State. While the major opposition parties — the Telugu Desam Party, the Telangana Rashtra Samiti, and the YSR Congress — have little in common, they now find themselves on the same side thanks to the no-confidence motion moved by Leader of the Opposition and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu. A united front against the ruling party is nowhere in sight — but these parties along with the Left might soon begin to see the benefits of synchronised action against a regime in disarray.
Post-YSR, the chief ministership of Andhra Pradesh has proved to be a crown of thorns. That the Congress managed to live through the no-confidence motion is largely due to the support extended by the Praja Rajyam led by actor Chiranjeevi. Although a merger of the two parties was announced, the ruling party does not appear to have kept its end of the bargain. If things do not go according to plan, Mr. Chiranjeevi, whose followers are known to be disgruntled, will have every reason to rethink the merger agreement. What the no-confidence motion might have achieved for the Praja Rajyam is increased leverage. For the same reason, another ally, the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, will take comfort from the way things went in the Assembly. A government that is being pulled in different directions by its own cadres and leaders on the Telangana issue might now come under increasing pressure from allies. Individually and collectively, other parties appear to have gained more from this floor test than the formal victor.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/losers-gain/article2692552.ece
7,12,2011,Saving Libya's heritage,"The survival of Libya's most important heritage structures, amidst the tremendous losses inflicted on life and property by brutal conflict, has brought a sense of relief. However, the organised looting of some of Libya's treasures has raised serious concerns about the implementation of international conventions that are meant to protect monuments and curb trafficking in antiquities. Ever since the armed uprising and NATO bombing commenced, concerns have been expressed over the state of Libya's rich historical heritage, including Greek and Roman antiquities. A recent report of the International Committee of the Blue Shield, an independent group of cultural organisations recognised by UNESCO, has confirmed that most of the heritage structures, including the World Heritage site of Leptis Magna, a Roman city, are largely intact. This is so not because the fighting forces abided by the Hague Convention (UNESCO, 1954), which makes it obligatory for combatants to protect heritage structures during armed conflict, but because committed people in local communities showed ingenuity. For instance, at Leptis Magna, shepherds were invited to camp inside the archaeological site with their animals — and land mining of the area was averted. However, the looting of the ‘Benghazi Treasure' — a priceless collection of ancient artefacts — could not be prevented.
As evidenced in recent conflicts, state parties that are signatories to the Hague Convention have not complied with it fully. Neither have the attacking forces, NATO in the Libyan case, provided ‘expertise and logistical support' for the protection of heritage. The Convention must be reviewed in the light of such experiences and exacting obligations imposed on occupying forces. In addition to protection, they must contribute to the mitigation of damage and restoration of heritage structures. State parties, on their part, must improve protection by adopting vital measures such as thorough documentation of artefacts. Libya's failure to do this is going to be a major impediment to the recovery of the priceless Benghazi artefacts. Unbridled trading in illicit antiquities continues to be a leading factor in encouraging heritage theft. Even reputed museums and auction houses in rich countries such as the United States seem to be intentionally slack in checking out the provenance of antiquities. Recently, the head of a Roman statue stolen from Libya in 1990 was auctioned in London. Museums and private collectors in developed countries must rethink their ethical practices — and stop being enablers of the hugely profitable traffic in stolen antiquities.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/saving-libyas-heritage/article2692554.ece
9,12,2011,What to do about internet content?,"Kapil Sibal, Union Minister for Communications and Information Technology, has set off a firestorm of protest by demanding that ‘internet intermediaries' — specifically in this round, four social networking giants, Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Microsoft, which enable hundreds of millions of individual users to publish and share on the worldwide web — remove inflammatory content as well as other text and images that might “offend Indian sensibilities.” As in other battles over free speech, both sides are claiming the moral high ground: Mr. Sibal's supporters, including the Bharatiya Janata Party, don the mantle of defenders of order, decency, and ‘Indian values'; his opponents, led by the bloggers, wear the halo that comes with wanting to protect and expand modern democratic rights. The issue is, in fact, far more complex and intriguing than either side admits. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that the claim of Mr. Sibal's detractors that the government acted not so much out of concern over inflammatory content, which has been around on the worldwide web for quite a while, as on account of blogged graphic content that targeted Congress president Sonia Gandhi is correct. The imputed motive, however, does not ipso facto undermine his argument.
There can be little question that the internet has opened up new commons for the exchange of ideas and information. But can it be exempt from the application of laws any more than the press and the broadcast media are? Obviously not — in principle. Hate speech, defamation, and incitement to offences can be proceeded against under the law irrespective of whether the medium involves ink or digits transmitted through fibre-optic cables. It is another matter that the law should be liberal, progressive, and up to contemporary requirements, which it is decidedly not in India when it comes to criminal and civil defamation, legislative privilege, contempt of court, official secrets, and incitement to offences. But the objection that Mr. Sibal's proposals are unworkable because it is simply impossible to monitor billions of web pages sounds like a practical argument — but, in a careful analysis, turns out to be opportunist and misleading. Laws are made not because they will eradicate crime, but because they allow perpetrators, when caught, to be punished. And the issue in this case is not monitoring but retaining or removing impugned content that is alleged to offend the law or norms of decency.
In an interview published in The Hindu (December 7), Mr. Sibal made the argument that the nature of the medium, the worldwide web, has blunted the instruments in the law's arsenal: for example, a blogger posting inflammatory communal polemic might be doing so using servers located in a country where it is not a crime. India's dysfunctional political culture has foisted a climate in which religious and caste groups have acquired a de facto veto over ideas. ‘Free trade' in ideas, the right to dissent, dispute, rebel, and cause outrage in robust public debate — a keystone of a real democracy, which has been repeatedly upheld by India's higher judiciary while interpreting Article 19 of the Constitution — has been steadily eroded. But intellectual honesty also demands that free speech champions acknowledge that hate speech can kill, something India's experience has long shown. Liberal democracies, almost without exception, place ‘reasonable restrictions' on certain kinds of speech, for instance by criminalising anti-Semitism or placing new kinds of post-9/11 restrictions on content that is seen to provide aid and succour to terrorism or harm ‘national security'. Some liberal democracies place fewer restrictions on free speech than others. But on matters like content featuring child pornography, intolerance and proscription have become the absolute global standard.
The question then comes down to what restrictions on free speech are reasonable, and who will make this determination. Unfortunately, the government's track record here is not edifying. Earlier this year, it sought to address the question by making it legally mandatory for internet intermediaries to censor content that is not only “paedophiliac” or “libellous” but “harmful”, “objectionable”, or merely “disparaging”. The amended version of the Information Technology Act, which became law in 2009, even proscribes the publication of “any material which contains [a] sexually explicit act or conduct” — phrasing which criminalises, arguably, everything from scientific texts to ancient temple art. The scope for over-reaching subjective interpretation can well be imagined. It takes little to see that this expansive mandate is an invitation to governmental abuse. In fact, the report published in The Hindu on December 8, “India wanted 358 items removed,” reveals that 255 of these requests made to Google fell in the “government criticism category,” with the biggest chunk accounted for by a single request from “a local law enforcement agency to remove 236 communities and profiles” from the Google-owned social networking site, Orkut, which were “critical of” an unnamed “local politician.” This strengthens widespread suspicion that the inflammatory content argument is really a cover for censoring political attacks and uninhibited criticism circulating in the social media. In the face of strong criticism, Mr. Sibal has promised further consultations. These must centre on addressing the excessive powers the government seeks to wield on what can circulate digitally. One idea that could be explored is bringing in an independent regulator empowered by law to deal with complaints about internet content, with the threshold for the admissibility of complaints raised high. India is, as things stand, readying a sledgehammer to swat some flies: the blow, when it falls, could end up undermining one of our most cherished freedoms.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/What-to-do-about-internet-content/article13369607.ece
10,12,2011,Is E.T. somewhere out there?,"Is there life on worlds other than our own? In the legendary science-fiction TV series, Star Trek, when Captain Kirk and the crew of the starship Enterprise set out “to explore strange new worlds,” they carried a nifty gizmo that could pick out life forms from afar. Present-day scientists no doubt wish they had access to such a device. Instead, they must make do with current technology. Spacecraft can be sent to planets and their moons in the Solar System, seeking clues to whether they ever harboured life. Mars looks quite promising and life might even be lurking in the icy waters of Jupiter's moon, Europa. What about the billions of stars in the universe? If life arose here on Earth, it may well have done so on planets orbiting other stars. Telescopes on the ground and in space offer the obvious way to make a start in assessing if life could have sprung up on such faraway worlds. That, of course, raises the question of what to look for. Based on the only case we know of life having arisen, the idea is to seek Earth-like planets that are just the right distance from their sun (known as the ‘habitable zone') for liquid water to exist on the surface.
In March 2009, the U.S. space agency, NASA, launched the Kepler space telescope. Its mission is to help assess how many Earth-size planets there could be, orbiting in the habitable zone in our region of the Milky Way galaxy. To do so, it stares unwaveringly at a large area of the sky, keeping watch over more than 100,000 stars and picking up signs of the faint dimming of light that occurs when a planet passes in front of its star. Recently, the mission scientists confirmed the existence of a planet, Kepler-22b, which, in the words of a press release, “is the smallest yet found to orbit in the middle of the habitable zone of a star similar to our sun.” This planet is larger than Earth, with a radius 2.4 times that of the latter. The scientists do not know yet whether it is predominantly rocky, gaseous, or liquid. In addition, the Kepler telescope has identified 2,300 planet candidates and they await further evaluation. Ten of them appear to be Earth-size and in the habitable zone. But finding a planet similar in size to Earth orbiting in the ‘Goldilocks zone' where it is getting just the right amount of energy from its sun is only a beginning. Such a planet probably also needs a ‘Goldilocks atmosphere' to be conducive for life. If, for instance, Kepler-22b has an atmosphere like that of Earth, its surface temperature would be a comfortable 22º Celsius. Such assessments of the atmosphere are tasks that must be carried out with future space telescopes like the James Webb telescope that NASA expects to have ready by 2018. Thus the search goes on.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/is-et-somewhere-out-there/article2701911.ece
10,12,2011,Libya betrayed,"Libya's interim government, the National Transitional Council (NTC), is getting no international help over the enormous problems it faces. To start with, the NTC has failed to restrain the militias that hold several areas and have killed thousands of people in attacks on alleged or real former supporters of Muammar al-Qadhafi. Reliable Libyan observers have likened the arbitrary killings, arrests, and torture to the former regime's brutalities. There have also been racist lynchings of African migrant labourers mistaken for mercenaries. A recent United Nations report characterises the militias as a major challenge to the NTC; it points out that women whom they detain are at particular risk. The NTC also faces political problems with Libya's severely divided society; five Amazigh or Berber leaders boycotted the November 24 swearing-in of the cabinet, saying that their ethnic group had not got enough posts. Nato, which deployed U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 ostensibly to protect civilians but in reality to cause violent regime change, is making no attempt to intervene. The U.N. mandate ended on October 27, and the Atlantic alliance has rejected Tripoli's request that it protect Libyan frontiers against possible re-entry by Qadhafi loyalists who fled the country as the regime disintegrated.
Furthermore, the U.N. states that both rebel and government forces committed atrocities during the uprising. Serious issues, however, have arisen over the trials of office-holders in the old regime, with some western officials calling for them to be tried in Libyan courts rather than the International Criminal Court (ICC). That would be consistent with the ICC's statute, but would also conceal key problems. First, Libya's judicial system is not currently fit for such trials. Secondly, ICC trials would enable defendants to reveal evidence of western collusion with the Qadhafi regime over many years. As it is, the British security service MI6 faces a possible criminal investigation following the discovery of documents in a Libyan government office that show U.K. cooperation with Mr. Qadhafi over the forced deportation of a Libyan dissident, Sami al-Saadi, and his family, from Hong Kong in 2004. The whole family was imprisoned; Mr. al-Saadi was held for six years, and tortured. During that period, British Prime Minister Tony Blair visited Tripoli and announced counter-terrorism cooperation, and the Shell company signed a £550-million deal with Libya. Interim Prime Minister Abdurrahim El Keib could well conclude that all Libyans have been betrayed by their so-called friends and helpers in Nato.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/libya-betrayed/article2701910.ece
12,12,2011,A preventable tragedy,"How many more lives must be lost before fire safety and rescue measures are taken seriously? Last year, 43 people died when fire gutted the fifth and sixth floors of the Stephen Court building in Kolkata. A month before that, a fire accident in a commercial complex in Bangalore claimed nine lives and injured 68. Fire safety rules had been flouted with impunity in both the cases. Now, again in Kolkata, more than 90 lives have been consumed by fire at the Advanced Medicare and Research Institute (AMRI) Hospitals at Dhakuria. This time it was even more heartbreaking — among those suffocated to death were many patients with restricted mobility. Only a few months ago, the fire service department had asked the hospital, a joint venture of two large industrial houses and the West Bengal government, to clear the encroachments in the basement and upgrade its fire safety mechanism. The directive was not followed, and the flammable material stored in the basement has now turned out to be the cause of the horrific accident. In the same hospital, there was a serious fire accident three years ago. Had the government agencies done their duty, and the hospital administrators complied with rules and stepped up their fire safety standards, many precious lives could have been saved.
When five major fire accidents occurred in large hospitals in London between January 2008 and February 2009, nobody died; in fact, not a single case of “significant adverse health affect” was reported. In Northwick Park Hospital, a large district-level health care facility, 123 patients, including the brain injured, were safely evacuated in 23 minutes. Periodic review and testing of the emergency preparedness plans in these hospitals had paid off. Attention to detail such as provision of a ski sheet and a rescue aid placed below the mattress of the hospital bed to smoothly evacuate non-ambulant patients, proved vital. Adopting more regulations but paying scant attention to compliance seems to be the Indian way. What is needed is an uncompromising commitment to safety. The central government's Standing Fire Advisory Council, whose recommendations were last updated in 1998, suggests that the response time — the period between alerting the fire station and the arrival of fire brigade at the accident location — must not be more than three minutes in the case of hazardous areas, and five minutes in others. In the AMRI hospital accident, the inordinate delay in alerting the fire brigade was compounded by the inexplicable response time of more than 15 minutes. The distribution of fire stations and their location within a large and congested city such as Kolkata need to be urgently reviewed. Every second saved and every improvement made will be critical.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-preventable-tragedy/article2706985.ece
12,12,2011,Europe's fiscal compact,"The best part of the marathon summit of European Union leaders at Brussels last week was that they could agree on a “fiscal compact” and a significantly stronger coordination of economic policies. And the worst was that the divide between the euro- and non-euro zone members, specifically, the United Kingdom, came to the fore yet again when Prime Minister David Cameron vetoed a proposal to include clauses on fiscal discipline in the EU founding treaty. His anger was triggered by the refusal of a majority of the leaders to accept concessions on banking regulation that mainly favoured the City of London. Pushed to the wall by a potential downgrade of credit rating by Standard & Poor's (S&P) and a further turmoil in the markets, the summit committed itself to a new fiscal rule that budgets of all member-countries shall either be balanced or in surplus; this will be incorporated in the national laws of member-countries. An automatic correction mechanism will be put in place, and governments with large budget deficits will face automatic penalties. Besides, the 500-billion euro permanent bailout fund envisaged under the European Stability Mechanism Treaty will be organised quickly, as early as mid-2012 if member-states deliver on their commitment to ratify it promptly.
Importantly, the summit also agreed with France that private investors (read banks) holding bonds of the countries in distress should not be made to share the bailout costs. The statement by the European Council declares unambiguously that the involvement of private investors will be decided on the basis of “well established IMF principles and practices.” This is obviously a compromise between the Big Two, France and Germany. Germany, which held the view that private investors should not be protected during bailouts, seems to have relented in return for the agreement on enforcing fiscal discipline, something it has always wanted. The stance of the European Central Bank (ECB) on market intervention though remains unclear. After stoutly resisting pressures to buy bonds of governments in distress in the run-up to the summit, the ECB bought Italian bonds the very next day to shore up prices, thus sending conflicting signals. The markets and the credit rating agencies will be watching the actions of European leaders back home. Can they secure approvals from national parliaments to the agreements forged in Brussels and implement them quickly enough? This might well be the last, and the best, opportunity to save the euro.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/europes-fiscal-compact/article2706986.ece
13,12,2011,India lost the plot at Durban,"In any reasonable reckoning, the outcome of the 17th meeting of the Committee of Parties (COP) of the United Framework Convention on Climate Change at Durban was a triumph for European climate diplomacy, placing it firmly once again in the position of a global climate leader. In the run-up to Durban, Europe had offered to support a second commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol in exchange for a “road map” that would point the way towards a legally binding agreement on mitigating global warming that would involve all parties. Precisely that agenda was realised with the establishment of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action — which is charged with producing, by 2015, a suitably ambitious “protocol, legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force,” to enter into force by 2020. In exchange, a second commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol is now on board, even if its exact duration and the extent of commitment of the developed countries remain to be negotiated in the coming year. At Durban, the European Union succeeded in putting together a substantial coalition, including the small island states, the least developed and some other developing countries, and the emerging economies of Brazil and South Africa, behind a climate agenda that is, in scientific terms, unambitious in its mitigation goals and clearly aimed at passing the climate burden on to the large developing countries.
It is clear that India was unprepared for the groundswell of support for a compact to deliver a global climate agreement binding on all nations. The Manmohan Singh government, egged on to intransigence by significant sections of civil society, sent a delegation that had no positive mandate, alienating it from all those countries whose interests lie in an early climate agreement. India, together with China, which was supportive of India throughout the meeting, was more or less isolated. The strategic mishandling of Durban is evident from the fact that after opposing for two weeks the very idea of an ‘agreement to have an agreement,' India finally assented to the Durban Platform without even the token inclusion of any of its core concerns such as equity. Repeated references to the principle without any attempt to put more flesh and bones on it made India appear more of a querulous holdout than a champion of developing country concerns. New Delhi has its work cut out in preparing for the tough negotiations due to commence next year. It needs to make up the ground ceded at COP 17. At a more fundamental level, it is high time the government realised that the interests of the 1.2 billion people that it so frequently invokes at climate negotiations lie as much in an early climate agreement as in adequate access to global atmospheric space, and grasped the complexity of translating this into negotiating realities.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/india-lost-the-plot-at-durban/article2709756.ece
13,12,2011,Mid-year blues,"The mid-year review of the economy presented to Parliament by the Finance Minister could hardly have been upbeat. Signs of slowdown, visible even during the early part of the year, have become pronounced. Official statistics too have been pointing to a downward trend. Economic growth during the second quarter of the year (July-September 2011) dropped to 6.9 per cent from 7.7 per cent in the first quarter. It was 8.4 per cent a year ago. The average growth rate during the first half of the year at 7.3 per cent is sharply lower than the 8.6 per cent recorded over the comparable period last year. Various other data such as the declining monthly industrial output numbers and the below-par performance of key infrastructure industries not only confirm the economic slowdown but, just as relevantly, indicate tough times ahead. Inflation remains a serious threat to growth. Although the government is hopeful that inflation will decline from 9.73 per cent in October to around 7 per cent by March 2012, it is obvious that the measures initiated by the Reserve Bank of India to contain it have taken a heavy toll on the growth process. Managing the twin, often conflicting, objectives of maintaining price stability and providing for the genuine credit needs of the real sector remains a key challenge for the RBI.
The government's explicit recognition that the economy will grow by no more than 7.25-7.75 per cent during this year — sharply lower than the 9 per cent assumed earlier — is, therefore, not surprising at all. Various forecasters, both official and non-official, have been steadily lowering their projections as the year progressed. Many of them think that even the revised official growth projection is ambitious. However, even a GDP growth rate of around 7 per cent would be commendable, given the difficult economic environment in India and abroad. India's investment rate has slumped to 28 per cent, from the 33-34 per cent that obtained in 2007-08. While another growth driver, consumption demand, is sought to be kept under check by monetary policy, the scope for government spending to stimulate the economy is severely limited, because of the straitened state of public finances. The Finance Minister has admitted that the fiscal deficit will not be contained within the budget target of 4.6 per cent of the GDP. The official recognition of a lower growth rate is the first step towards managing exaggerated expectations in the next few years.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/midyear-blues/article2709754.ece
14,12,2011,Gene therapy offers fresh hope,"While a quarter century of single-minded effort to find an efficacious HIV vaccine has met with only a limited success, a team of researchers led by Nobel Laureate David Baltimore has obtained promising results in prevention of HIV infection in mice by adopting a radically different approach. They deployed gene therapy, which is traditionally used for curing genetic diseases. The study builds on the seminal work by Phil Johnson from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who first showed how gene therapy protects monkeys from SIV, a virus that is analogous to HIV. The results of the study were published recently in Nature (“Anti-body based protection against HIV infection by vectored immunoprophylaxis,” by Alenajdro B. Balazs et al.) As a first step, genes from five broadly neutralising antibodies capable of preventing HIV infection were chosen. DNA, which code for the antibodies, were then inserted into the adenovirus-based vectors and injected into the leg muscles of the mice. The muscle cells containing the DNA eventually started producing the broadly neutralising antibodies. Surprisingly, two antibodies were able to prevent HIV infection even when the viral dose was a 100-fold higher than necessary to infect animals, and significantly more than what humans are likely to be exposed to. As the level of protection in mice remained high even at the end of one year, it is presumed that a single injection might be sufficient to produce long-lasting protection against HIV. Clinical trials on humans may follow soon.
While preventive vaccines containing an immunogen (antigen) prime the immune system to produce antibodies against a virus well before the body is naturally exposed to it, the new approach completely bypasses the immune system and presents the body with DNA capable of producing potent antibodies. But the real differentiator is the speed in designing and developing an effective immunisation product. For instance, the antibodies used in the current study are based on more than a dozen broadly neutralising antibodies isolated from HIV-infected individuals who were not on antiretroviral therapy. While the vaccine programme based on these antibodies is yet to design an effective immunogen, scientists using gene therapy have already completed animal studies. Despite the impressive results, there is sufficient reason to be cautious. Similar levels of success may not be seen in humans. But most importantly, once introduced into the body, there is no way of removing the DNA or turning them off, should things go wrong.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/gene-therapy-offers-fresh-hope/article2712473.ece
14,12,2011,Civil war fears on the Congo,"The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which is Africa's second largest country and covers an area equal to about 70 per cent of India's, is on the edge of another civil war. Etienne Tshisekedi of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS), the defeated candidate in the presidential election, refuses to accept the result announced by the country's independent electoral commission. It has awarded victory to the incumbent Joseph Kabila, of the People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD), by 49 per cent to 32 per cent. The election, only the second democratic one in the country's history, was dogged by problems and lasted three days instead of one. The transport infrastructure is very poor, and bad weather also prevented United Nations aircraft from carrying ballot papers to remote regions. After the polls closed, the count was delayed by staff shortages; in addition, bags of ballot papers were often so overfilled that they split in transit. European Union and some international observers have also expressed doubts about the credibility of the poll process. The 30 million voters are also electing a 500-seat parliament, with more than 18,000 candidates standing in a multi-member plurality electoral system.
Above all, the political context is highly unstable. Mr. Tshisekedi has called for calm, but his intransigence over the result is awakening fears of another civil war. The 71 million-population remembers only too well the 1998-2003 war, in which over five million died and ethnic tensions were severely exacerbated as other countries and international corporations manipulated warring groups for access to mineral resources and tropical hardwoods. In addition to oil and diamonds, the DRC has 70 per cent of the world's coltan, an essential ore for electronic goods. Parts of the East are still controlled by brutal militias, and many regions are notorious for rape of women as a war weapon. The recent election also saw 18 people killed. As poll-related clashes spread, thousands fled across the river Congo to the Republic of the Congo. Meanwhile Mr. Kabila seems willing to use the army for party purposes, and in the campaign police tear-gassed opposition supporters. The external environment is very different from that which obtained at the time of the previous election, held in 2006. For that exercise, donor states gave $460 million and approved the dispatch of the largest-ever U.N. peacekeeping force. This time, major countries have only uttered hopeful injunctions, and the U.N. mandate allows intervention only at Kinshasa's request. If civil war breaks out again, it is unlikely that the international community will be able to do anything significant.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/civil-war-fears-on-the-congo/article2712472.ece
15,12,2011,Just cool it,"With the Centre lacking in both political will and moral authority to help find solutions to inter-State disputes, it needed the Supreme Court of India to step in to cool tempers between Tamil Nadu and Kerala on the overheated issue of the Mullaperiyar dam. Putting first things first, the five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court asked the two States not to arouse people's feelings and create a fear psychosis on this issue. Clearly, the situation was threatening to get out of hand with chauvinist elements on both sides trying to shut out reasoned debate on what was essentially a question for technical experts to resolve. Neither political leaders nor lay people can contribute meaningfully to making decisions about the safety and stability of the 116-year-old dam. On the directions of the Supreme Court, the Empowered Committee, headed by the former Chief Justice of India A.S. Anand, is looking into all aspects of safety of the dam, and will soon submit its findings — on the basis of expert assessments. The proper course, as the Supreme Court pointed out, is to wait for the recommendations of the committee. The matter must not be left to fringe elements that are out to whip up emotions cynically.
The highest court in the land has made it abundantly clear that this is an issue on which politicking is inadmissible. Its merits cannot be determined on the strength of mobilised support, but only through legally sanctioned means. The two Chief Ministers, who have pursued a course of relative moderation in a potentially volatile situation, must now do more: they must take the lead in giving effect to what the Supreme Court has ordered as an immediate measure, and douse the flames in the border areas. Over the last few days, Theni in Tamil Nadu and Kumily in Kerala have witnessed violent protests and road blockades. In situations such as this, security personnel tend to give a lot of room to protesters, thus allowing public order to be compromised. Both State governments need to give clear instructions to their police forces to deal firmly with law-breakers. The process of finding a mutually acceptable solution cannot be hastened. The effort must not be aimed merely at balancing Kerala's apprehensions about the safety of the dam against Tamil Nadu's concerns over threats to its water rights. Issues of life and livelihood, which are seen to be at the heart of the dispute, need to be resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of both sides. But as long as rational principles guide the process of finding an enduring solution, there can be no cause for grievance on either side. After all, there can be no argument against science.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/just-cool-it/article2715128.ece
15,12,2011,Rupee's tumble,"As if the slowdown in the economy, negative growth in industrial output and a stubborn inflation were not enough headaches for a besieged government, trouble is brewing on the foreign exchange front with the incessant slide in the rupee, which is recording new lows by the day. A fall of 22 per cent in four months — from Rs. 43.95 in end-July to Rs.53.72 on December 14 — is something that should set alarm bells ringing. In the last month alone, the rupee depreciated by 8 per cent relative to the dollar. A combination of domestic and global factors appears to be behind this slide. Inflation has been ruling at over 8 per cent for the better part of the last two years and strangely, the rupee, defying the laws of economics, was either holding steady or appreciating marginally during the same period. Rising inflation tends to trigger currency depreciation. In that sense, the rupee probably had it coming. The forex market has its own explanation for the fall. Importers, having been lulled into complacency by the rupee's appreciation earlier, are rushing to cover their exposures, thus driving up dollar demand. Exporters are said to be holding on to their earnings in the hope of a further fall in the rupee. And then, there is the turbulence in the global financial markets and the strange sight of funds gravitating to the dollar despite the troubles in the U.S. economy. The markets obviously believe that the dollar is safer than the euro, given the economic problems of the euro zone.
The Reserve Bank of India has, so far, responded to the sliding rupee with no more than a symbolic intervention in the market. It really can afford to do no more than that, given the country's foreign exchange reserves of $306 billion. That may not be enough to defend the rupee, especially when the intervention comes as a reaction to global factors. The central bank also has to keep in mind the widening current account deficit, while formulating the strategy for market intervention. The RBI apparently thought it prudent to keep a close watch and tweak policy here and there to ease fund inflows, reserving its firepower for use should the situation deteriorate. With the macroeconomic numbers unlikely to improve in the next few months — if anything, they might worsen — the rupee appears to be really up against it. While exporting industries such as information technology, gems and jewellery, and textiles will be happy, consumers are likely to feel the pinch. The higher cost of imported inputs across a swathe of products will cause an increase in their end prices, especially in the case of fuels. A rise in petrol prices could well be on the cards as a New Year gift to consumers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rupees-tumble/article2715129.ece
16,12,2011,Quality education still elusive,"The key finding in a recent study that even top schools in major cities in India suffer from the entrenched tendency to impart rote learning may have some shock value to those who believe that private educational institutions place greater emphasis on quality and holistic education. However, for those closely observing the school education scenario, it is a re-affirmation of a bitter truth: schools in our country are, by and large, quite far from seeing education as a process of learning with understanding, acquiring knowledge through self-discovery and conceptualisation; rather, education remains a mere transmission of information in a rigid classroom atmosphere, where the emphasis is on memorisation and the objective is to rush through a pre-determined syllabus and prepare children for examinations. While on the scholastic side the WIPRO-Educational Initiatives ‘Quality Education Study,' which covered 89 schools, shows a fall in learning standards among students in classes 4, 6, and 8 over the last five years, it also flags a disturbing deficit of social sensitivity on the part of a sizable section of students. Responses to some questions relating to the education of girls and attitudes towards immigrants, the disabled, and HIV-positive patients, indicated biases that could, over time, grow into prejudices. Exploring the mind of the young at a formative stage in this way, which some might consider methodologically challengeable, is a particularly valuable part of this study. It will be a serious mistake to ignore the broad trend that indicates misconceptions of early years being carried on to a higher age and the possibility of these children imbibing biases they see in their family atmosphere or social milieu.
Over the years, there have been some serious efforts to put in place a national curriculum framework. For instance, the Yash Pal committee's progressive report of 1993, Learning without Burden, demonstrated how the curriculum load was a burden on the child and highlighted the defects of the examination system. The National Curriculum Framework 2005 was a game attempt to provide a vision of education as a pursuit of both quality and equity. Yet, despite increasing awareness that learning is not mere information accumulation and that teaching ought to be recast into a facilitation of children's discovery of their own potential and understanding, the emphasis in practice continues to be on textbooks and exams. Conceptual understanding is not encouraged anywhere near enough, and sport, art, debate, and cultural activity are kept at the distant periphery. It is time not merely for fostering greater awareness about the need for holistic education but also to chalk out more imaginative pedagogic means to make education an inclusive and quality-centric epistemic process.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/quality-education-still-elusive/article2717948.ece
16,12,2011,Now a hooch tragedy,"In less than a week after more than 90 women, men, and children died in a calamitous fire at the AMRI hospital in Kolkata, illicit brew has claimed the lives of about 150 people, at Sangrampur in the South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. Preliminary reports indicate that the hooch was sold in sachets, priced between Rs.7 and Rs.20, virtually opposite a police post in the area. Starting with a couple of deaths early in the morning, the toll kept rising through the day and touched 80 by daybreak next day. Most of the victims complained of body pain, stomach cramps, vomitting, and a burning sensation. The health authorities diagnosed the early deaths as due to “cardio-respiratory failure” arising out of methyl poisoning. Evidently, licensed liquor sold through the legal retail system was out of the reach of the poor, who fell into the trap of the hooch trade. At last report, about a hundred victims were in hospital, most of them said to be recovering.
The recurrence of heart-rending tragedies caused by the killer brew only lends credence to the thinking among political parties and State governments that it might be better to introduce legal sale of licensed liquor than let addicts go for the illicit stuff. One solution that seems to work is the Tamil Nadu model — where the State government monopolises the trade through a State-run distribution corporation that controls the supply of IMFL (Indian Made Foreign Liquor) and facilitates widespread access to it. For one thing, such a system brings in substantial revenue that can be used for financing welfare schemes. Prohibitionists might raise the objection that it also makes liquor available more easily to young people, leading to a much wider health-damaging addiction. But the evidence from across India shows that prohibition just doesn't work; in fact, it brings on all sorts of ill effects, social as well as medical. Although States that still implement prohibition, full or partial, have set up separate wings in the police department to handle cases arising out of prohibition offences and illicit brewing, it is common knowledge that connivance between the brewers and sections of the police makes the hooch flow, particularly in festival season. Most, if not all, victims tend to be poor labourers, and the families end up paying a terrible price. Alcoholism is a social menace that needs to be tackled in a sensitive, intelligent, multi-pronged way. Driving it underground, to dangerous devices, is clearly not the way.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/now-a-hooch-tragedy/article2717947.ece
17,12,2011,Move ahead on Lokpal,"While there is no consensus on the exact shape of the Lokpal Bill, it is clear the gap between the key political players on most of the contentious issues has been narrowed. Under severe pressure from Team Anna and its supporters across India, the United Progressive Alliance coalition has been obliged to go some way towards meeting the movement's key demands. After fiercely resisting the idea, it has agreed to include the office of the Prime Minister, with some qualifications, and the lower bureaucracy within the ambit of the Lokpal. Concurrently, the Union Cabinet has cleared the Citizens' Right to Grievance Redress Bill. The provision in the Bill providing for a grievance redressal mechanism needs, of course, to be closely and critically scrutinised from the standpoint of public service entitlement and efficient delivery. Expectedly, the sticking points seem to be the status and the superintendence of the Central Bureau of Investigation: should it be brought under the Lokpal, and if so, in what way?
The Congress party is reportedly willing to consider an arrangement under which the prosecution wing of the CBI comes under the Lokpal, which will however have no say in the agency's investigative role or administrative functioning. Separating the two wings in this manner is a highly dubious way of addressing what needs to be done to combat corruption in high places — insulating professionals who conduct investigation and prosecution from political and bureaucratic interference. Everyone knows that in India, such interference remains the rule rather than the exception, at the Centre and in the States. If the Anna Hazare movement has fired the national imagination and turned out to be a potential game-changer, it is because it has made a strong and effective Lokpal a synonym for a truly independent and proactive mechanism to go after the corrupt at all levels. In a country where organisations such as the CBI and the State police forces come under apparently irresistible pressure to follow the diktats of their political masters, the implications for the rule of law are plain. There is no need to concur with every demand of the Anna Hazare movement in order to recognise that it has presented 'rising' but 'flailing' India with a rare opportunity — to break the politician-bureaucrat-corporate nexus that enables corruption to neutralise, undermine, and mock at the rule of law under the Constitution. Bringing into existence a strong and effective Lokpal must not be held up any longer — and the insitutionalisation of comparable Lokayuktas at the State level must follow. It is absolutely vital to liberate the CBI and the anti-corruption wings of the State police forces from political control. Rising India must seize the moment.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/move-ahead-on-lokpal/article2721187.ece
17,12,2011,A tricky balance,"The Reserve Bank of India's decision to retain the policy interest rates and the CRR (cash reserve ratio) at their existing levels is entirely in line with market expectations. But the decision could not have been easy. There were strong reasons that would have justified a rate hike, or for that matter even a cut in the rate. High up in the first category is the stubbornly high inflation, which has remained above 9 per cent for 12 months in a row. Despite food inflation moderating sharply, November's inflation rate of 9.11 per cent, marginally down from the October figure, is a cause for worry. Quite ominously, the non-food manufactured product inflation, which the RBI regards as the ‘core inflation', rose to 7.9 per cent (from 7.6 per cent in October), reflecting higher input costs. The sharp upward revision of inflation figures for September to 10 per cent is another worrying development; it raises fears of similar revisions for subsequent months. On the other side, the clamour for a rate cut has centred on the fact that a rapidly slowing economy, especially in the industrial sector, requires a boost. Under the circumstances, the RBI's decision to maintain the status quo is sober and well considered. It ensures continuity in seeking to strike a balance between the often conflicting goals of reining in inflation and encouraging growth.
In its second-quarter policy statement (October 25), the central bank hinted at a pause in future interest rate hikes, while giving itself room to address short-term growth issues and concerns. While both inflation and inflation expectations are currently above the comfort level for the RBI, the pressures are likely to abate in the coming months, notwithstanding high crude prices and the sharp depreciation of the rupee. The year-end target of 7 per cent for inflation is retained. However, downside risks to growth have clearly increased owing to a combination of domestic factors and a deteriorating global economy. As matters stand, a growth rate of 7.6 per cent for the current year, projected by the RBI in October, will be difficult to achieve. The central bank is not hedging its bets when it says that “from this point on, monetary policy actions are likely to reverse the cycle, responding to the risks to growth.” However, as the sharp downslide in rupee shows, monetary policy must be prepared to deal with unforeseen contingencies, many of which are likely to occur due to factors outside its domain.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-tricky-balance/article2721184.ece
18,12,2011,Holy grail of particle physics,"Physicists like to describe nature in the simplest and most elegant theoretical framework. A significant development towards such a description of the sub-atomic world during the 1970s was the unification of disparate forces of nature (excluding gravity) in a single theoretical framework. But this unification came at a price. The elegant mathematical symmetry that made it possible required all elementary particles to be massless, which is not the real world we know. So the underlying universal symmetry had to be ‘broken' to some degree for particles to have a range of masses and forces to have different strengths, and yet described by a single theory. This was achieved through the introduction of a hypothetical particle called Higgs — after Peter Higgs who proposed it — and an associated force. One can imagine Higgs as an all-pervasive ether-like force-field, which endows particles with mass (or inertia) because of the drag that the field exerts as particles move through space. This model of the universe, called the Standard Model (SM), seems to be along the right lines; this is so particularly after the discovery during the 1980s of particles W and Z — the carriers of the weak nuclear force just as the massless photon carries the electromagnetic force — with masses exactly as predicted by SM (about 100 times the mass of the proton). Since then the model has held up superbly in experimental tests. But Higgs itself has remained elusive and is the only missing piece in this otherwise enormously successful theory. The model itself does not predict a mass for the Higgs. So, for the last three decades physicists have been combing the entire energy ranges available to particle accelerators for signatures of Higgs in the decays of particles produced in these high-energy particle collisions. With the advent in 2009 of the highest energy accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Geneva, which opened up a new energy domain, hopes of discovering Higgs have been high.
A discovery in particle physics is a long, painstaking process. It requires sifting through data related to trillions of collisions and picking out a statistically significant signal that stands out as an excess over the background of events from other processes that mimic a decaying Higgs. Two entirely independent experiments at CERN, ATLAS and CMS, have seen an excess of events that are attributable to Higgs. By summer, these experiments had excluded vast regions of mass where Higgs could exist, leaving just a narrow window. The latest results, announced on December 13, have squeezed the window further to around 125 times the mass of a proton. Since two independent experiments have arrived at the same conclusions, these are tantalising signals — but not good enough to be called a discovery. At present there is just about one per cent chance of the excess being due to fluctuations in the background. The golden rule for discovery in particle physics is that such a chance should be less than one in a million. A definitive statement on the existence or non-existence of Higgs requires more LHC data running through 2012. If Higgs does not show up even then, there will be an upheaval in the current understanding of the sub-atomic world, with the crucial question on the origin of mass remaining unanswered. But that, as we have seen before in the history of physics, is only likely to throw up even more revolutionary ideas.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/holy-grail-of-particle-physics/article2726660.ece
18,12,2011,Eroding civil liberties,"The National Defense Authorization Bill passed by Congress represents a further erosion of civil liberties in the United States. When it is signed into law, the military will be able to detain even U.S. citizens and lawful residents indefinitely without charge or trial. Suspicion of involvement with terrorism will be enough; existing laws already give such broad definitions that, as Senator Dianne Feinstein has pointed out, anyone with over seven days' food stocks at home, or anyone with missing fingers on a hand, could fall foul of the new law. The Bill is also procedurally questionable. The alterations were prepared not by the Senate committees on intelligence or the judiciary, but by the committee on the armed services, which has a disproportionate number of conservatives and met behind closed doors to debate key clauses written by Senators John McCain and Carl Levin. Mr. Obama, who had threatened to veto the legislation in an earlier form, has now accepted amendments that give the President power to exempt individuals from military detention.
It is significant that only Congress, led by the nose by far-Right hawks, wants this piece of legislation. The Department of Defense does not want it, as the armed forces could be used against U.S. citizens on U.S. territory; in any case, military tribunals have convicted only six defendants on terrorism charges since the 9/11 attacks, while civilian courts have convicted more than 400. The military clearly lacks the investigative experience of civilian bodies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Moreover, the Bill's vague wording will cause jurisdictional problems and could make it harder to gain cooperation from suspects held by the military. The Central Intelligence Agency and the Attorney General have voiced other doubts as well. Since the presidential exemption power extends executive reach to judicial areas, the law could well be held to be unconstitutional.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/eroding-civil-liberties/article2726662.ece
20,12,2011,A highly productive summit,"The just-concluded 12th Indo-Russian summit in Moscow has every reason to be called one of the most successful and productive bilateral meetings in recent years. Its outcome must be judged not by the number of documents signed but by the depth and range of understandings that emerged in the course of an unprecedented six hours of interaction Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had, first with President Dmitry Medvedev and then with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. The agreements covered all the key areas that underpin the “special and privileged” strategic partnership between the two countries — energy, defence, space, trade and investment, and working together on the international scene. While a formal agreement on Units 3 and 4 at Kudankulam nuclear power project was not signed, pending the resolution of the safety issue controversy in India, the sides moved forward with the project. They agreed on exceptional soft loan terms for the new reactors that will ease the financial burden for India at the time of a global economic slowdown. The talks in Moscow also firmed up prospects for India to expand its presence in Russian oil and gas through joint ventures with Gazprom and Novatek. Steel, diamonds, pharmaceuticals, and hydrocarbons have been identified as new thrust areas of bilateral cooperation. The establishment of a Science and Technology Centre with offices in Moscow and New Delhi opens the way to commercialising hundreds of successful research projects undertaken by the two countries over the past two decades.
Following Russia's entry into the World Trade Organisation, India is looking forward to signing a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) with the Belarus-Kazakhstan-Russia Customs Union, which will facilitate India's access to the vast market of the three former Soviet states. Bilateral defence cooperation, in the words of President Medvedev, has reached a “record high level.” The agreement on the military uses of the Russian GLONASS navigation system, the ongoing Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft project, the upcoming lease of a nuclear submarine, and the refitted Gorshkov aircraft carrier have reinforced Russia as an irreplaceable source of high-end technologies for India. The talks have produced a meeting of minds on burning international issues, including Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, terrorism, and security in the Asia-Pacific region. Russia has strongly supported India's bid to join the U.N. Security Council as a permanent member and to upgrade its membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. The summit reasserted the special character of the Indo-Russian relationship, which Prime Minister Singh has aptly described as an “anchor of peace and stability” in a world of shifting global power equations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-highly-productive-summit/article2729546.ece
20,12,2011,"Korea, the mourning after","The death of Kim Jong-il, the ‘Dear Leader' of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or North Korea, has occurred in a political context very different from 1994, when he succeeded his father, the redoubtable Kim Il-sung. But the international reactions have been comparable. The 69-year-old general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea died aboard his train on December 17, of a heart attack; he is believed to have suffered a stroke in 2008 and was only rarely seen in public thereafter. A joint statement by the party and other key institutions seemed to confirm speculation that Mr. Kim had chosen his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, believed to be under 30 years of age, to succeed him to the top job. It hailed the young Mr. Kim — who, after being made a four-star general in September 2010, was catapulted to the high post of vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and inducted into the Central Committee of the Workers' party — as the “great successor to the revolution” and the “eminent leader of the military and the people.” How this succession, assuming it will be officially sealed, will be received by party members and the people is uncertain.
The DPRK, with its 23-million population, stands apart from all other socialist states, past and present, through its system of dynastic leadership reinforced by a cult of personality. This time of transition and uncertainty is likely to see a rise in regional tensions. Internationally, the country's closest ally, China, has made the strongest statement, which should end all speculation about Beijing's support for its southern neighbour. Japan, for its part, hopes that “peace and stability” on the Korean peninsula will not suffer. The Republic of Korea, or South Korea, however, has repeated its actions on the death of Kim Il-sung, putting its military on high alert and strengthening intelligence cooperation with the United States. The Obama administration may delay a decision on food aid for the North, and that in turn could affect its informal contacts with Pyongyang and the resumption of the stalled six-party talks on the DPRK's nuclear programme. Everyone recognises that dealing with North Korea and its reclusive leaders on regional and international issues is no easy job. But military grandstanding, conducting provocative naval exercises in the Yellow Sea waters close to the Northern coast, and assuming a hostile political stance, as RoK President Lee Myung-bak has done, is not the intelligent way. The peoples of the region surely deserve better than this.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/korea-the-mourning-after/article2729550.ece
21,12,2011,Cleansing party and administration,"In a decision that was at once personal and political, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa expelled her close friend V.K. Sasikala along with 13 close relatives from the primary membership of the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. To cut all links with a friend and associate of nearly 30 years could not have been easy but this severance, it appears, has been in the making for quite a while. This is by no means the first time the problem of the Gang of Fourteen acting in a self-appointed extra-constitutional role and interfering in party affairs and in the administration has been faced but this time they evidently went too far. Chief Minister Jayalalithaa realised that while she could take responsibility for her own decisions and actions, she could not do this for what was being done without her approval or even her knowledge. The situation became intolerable as Ministers and officials hand-picked by Ms Sasikala began acting at her behest, behind the back of the Chief Minister. Allegations of spreading corruption also began doing the rounds. No less than the reputation of the current AIADMK government, which is backed by an overwhelming legislative majority and faces little external opposition, was at stake. The cleansing had to be total, and in full public view — half-measures would just not work.
This break is clearly in the public interest. For one thing, it gives Chief Minister Jayalalithaa the freedom — the space and the time — to concentrate on the tasks of governance and development without being distracted. The Chief Minister has made no secret of the fact that Tamil Nadu is in poor financial health, and the power situation is grim. Although several social welfare schemes are in place, especially a well-administered universal Public Distribution System that provides 20 kg of free rice to every eligible cardholder, much remains to be done in building on existing infrastructure and accelerating the overall development of the State. While the expulsions are expected to yield immediate results in governance, politically too Ms. Jayalalithaa and her party stand to gain. AIADMK cadres across the State broke into celebrations when they heard the news, bursting crackers, and making ritual offerings. It is also clear that the AIADMK's 150-member legislative contingent is solidly with Ms Jayalalithaa, whose popularity and voter acceptance are at their peak. Only the disproportionate wealth case in a special court in Bangalore, in which both she and Ms Sasikala face charges, remains a hurdle. But no matter how things pan out, Ms Jayalalithaa's bold action against the Gang of Fourteen marks a significant point in the history of Tamil Nadu politics.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/cleansing-party-and-administration/article2732610.ece
21,12,2011,Supporting the rupee,"Though belated, the government and the Reserve Bank of India have come out strongly in support of rupee that is rapidly declining in relation to the dollar. The new measures, both administrative and policy, fall into three broad categories. One, the rules governing overseas investment have been relaxed in certain cases so as to increase the supply of dollars in the domestic market and thereby correct its demand-supply imbalance. The ceiling on debt instruments by foreign institutional investors and the interest cap on external commercial borrowings have been raised. The lock-in period for overseas investors in infrastructure bonds has been reduced. Two, in a surprise move — on the day before the credit policy review last week — the RBI clamped down on forward trading in foreign exchange. The avowed objective is to curb the rampant speculation which, in its view, weakens the rupee further. In the third category are the new incentives provided to non-resident Indians to invest more with banks in India. These are significant in themselves and they need to be evaluated in a larger context and over a longer time-frame than in the immediate term.
It is fairly clear, however, that the rationale for almost all these measures is traceable to the rupee's sharp decline and the imperative of arresting it. Absent this justification, the case for introducing many of them at this juncture becomes weak. For instance, given the RBI's concerns over accumulation of short-term external debt, there is no reason for facilitating larger external borrowings by companies. Now, with the foreign institutional investors getting a greater access to the debt markets, including the gilts and corporate bond market, the external economy will be vulnerable to foreign capital flows. The RBI might have succeeded, at least temporarily, in halting the rupee's decline by sending out strong messages to currency speculators — as, for instance, by disallowing the rebooking of cancelled forward contracts in foreign exchange. But clearly these measures are in the realm of micro-management and should go once the perceived threat to the rupee recedes. The deregulation of interest rates on non-resident bank accounts cannot be justified except in the narrow context of encouraging overseas Indian investment at all costs. Past experience suggests that these deposits can exit just as easily as they enter. Besides, with the prevailing low dollar interest rates, there is tremendous scope for arbitrage with minimal exchange rate risk to the Indian expatriate. Neither individual banks nor the macroeconomy stands to gain by mobilising such funds.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Supporting-the-rupee/article13369636.ece
22,12,2011,Experiment with truth,"The much-awaited report of Sri Lanka's Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, tabled in Parliament recently, has established a key fact — that there were “considerable” civilian casualties in the final stages of the military operation that ended in the total defeat of the LTTE. This is a step forward from the Sri Lankan government's earlier insistence that there were “zero civilian casualties.” The LLRC has avoided the more difficult task of fixing blame for these casualties wherever it seems the military might have been at fault, citing a lack of evidence. But this handicap has not prevented it from blaming the LTTE for most such incidents. The LTTE's methods of using Tamil civilians as human shields, firing on soldiers from inside hospitals, and its other atrocities designed to put civilians at risk are well known. Fighting such a ruthless terrorist group posed a complex challenge for Sri Lanka. But for the same reason the LLRC critiques the 2002 ceasefire agreement as flawed — treating the Sri Lankan state and the LTTE as equal powers — the report sadly misses the point that the state is held to far higher standards of accountability than a non-state group. Exonerating the military from deliberate attacks on civilians in the No Fire Zone, the report claims the military's return of fire into the NFZs was in keeping with the “principles of proportionality” — in other words, such action was unavoidable given the objective of defeating the LTTE.
Still the LLRC report has come up with the recommendation that the government “ascertain more fully the circumstances” of five incidents in which civilians were killed, and if wrongful conduct by security personnel is established, prosecute and punish the guilty. Based on testimony from affected families, it has also asked the government to investigate the disappearance of several LTTE members who surrendered to the military. Expressing “doubts” about the authenticity of the footage in the Channel Four documentary, Sri Lanka's Killing Fields, it has nonetheless asked the government to address the allegations in it of horrific rights violations by Sri Lankan military personnel, to “establish the truth or otherwise” of these allegations. It has recommended that, despite the confusion over civilian casualties, the government pay out compensation to the affected people as a “humanitarian gesture.” Given the ethnic polarisation in Sri Lanka, these recommendations seem painfully insufficient. Even so, this is Sri Lanka's first attempt at introspection about the war. If the government is serious about reconciliation and learning lessons from the past, it must make a start by acting on the LLRC's recommendations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/experiment-with-truth/article2735656.ece
22,12,2011,An eye opener,"If complex eyes could evolve rapidly despite being an organ of extreme perfection, there is no way of confirming this. The soft nature of the organ worked against it being well preserved even in the best of depositional conditions. With the fossil record offering inadequate evidence, our understanding of the early evolution of eyes has been rather sketchy. This is true even in the case of 500-million-year-old Cambrian Burgess-Shale-type Konservat-Lagerstatten deposits in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, known for their exceptional preservation of soft body parts. But a discovery reported in June 2011 of a 515-million-year-old fossil of a fearsome predator, an Early Cambrian Anomalocaris, with well-preserved compound eyes provided the much-needed opportunity to study the early evolution of the visual organs. Each compound eye of the arthropod possessed about 3,000 individual lenses. The latest discovery of another Anomalocaris from the same Emu Bay Shale deposits (about 515 million years ago) in South Australia is even more exciting. According to a paper published recently in Nature (“Acute vision in the giant Cambrian predator Anomalocaris and the origin of compound eyes,” by John R. Paterson et al.,), each pear-shaped eye measures 2 cm to 3 cm in length and 1 cm to 2 cm in width, and contains nearly 16,700 hexagonal lenses. The number of lenses is a multiple of what some modern-day arthropods have — 3,200 in the case of common houseflies and fewer than 1,000 in most ants. With each lens behaving like a pixel, vision clarity improves as the number of lenses increases. Even the regular packing of the hexagonal lenses is a surprise, considering that the present-day horseshoe crab Limulus lacks it.
The specimens are unambiguously Anomalocaris and hence have a definite affinity with arthropods. The complex nature of the eyes is not surprising as the latest find has all the morphological features of a top predator — about a metre-long body with spine-bearing front appendages, and a mouth with teeth or tooth-like projections. But the fully armed predator lacks a hardened exoskeleton. Since another anomalocaridid discovered in 2009 has compound eyes and an exoskeleton, the researchers argue that compound eyes in arthropods must have evolved prior to the development of hardened exoskeletons. If this is true, the recent find must be considered a more primitive member (basal) than the one discovered in 2009. This has a major implication — the perfect hexagonal packing of the lenses seen in the most recently discovered fossil “pushes the origin of compound eyes further down” the arthropod evolutionary tree.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-eye-opener/article2735658.ece
23,12,2011,Wrong call,"Under pressure in an election year with the economy perched precariously on the edge and the unemployment rate staying stubbornly high, some members of the U.S. House of Representatives have introduced a bill targeting call centres overseas, especially in India. The bipartisan bill, U.S. Call Center Worker and Consumer Protection Act, moved by Tim Bishop, David McKinley and a couple of others, seeks to punish U.S. companies that outsource their customer calls by denying them all direct or indirect federal grants or guaranteed loans for five years. Operators at call centres will be required to disclose their location to customers and offer them the option of being serviced by a call centre in the United States. Companies have to give a 120-day notice before moving a call centre overseas and the Secretary of Labor will have to maintain a list of companies that have outsourced their call centres abroad. The bill has the backing of the Communication Workers Union (CWA) that claims to represent 150,000 of the nearly 4 million call centre workers, who constitute 3 per cent of the total American workforce, according to the union. The industry, which is heavily outsourced to countries such as India, Philippines, Mexico and the Czech Republic, obviously sees an election year as the best time to lobby for protecting its jobs.
Yet, as history shows, this protectionist move could turn out to be a wrong call. The Great Depression of the 1930s was partly caused and prolonged by protectionist barriers raised by countries in recession, which prevented economic efficiencies from being fully realised. This is not the first time though that the U.S. has cracked down on outsourcing — last year, it made non-immigrant job visas more expensive and the State of Ohio banned outsourcing of IT work in government-funded projects. The bill has a long way to go before it becomes law but, given that 2012 is election year, the possibility of its passage cannot be ruled out either. This is where the sagacity of President Obama will be tested. There will be more pressure to raise barriers in the months ahead and it can only be hoped that saner counsel will prevail and the U.S. will not complicate what is already a most difficult economic situation, for itself and others. While the impact of the move may not be much on India's top IT companies, for whom the call centre business accounts for less than 10 per cent of the overall revenue, the same cannot be said for standalone call centre companies, which have already been losing business to competition from countries such as the Philippines. The bill is now one more challenge they have to face.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/wrong-call/article2738977.ece
23,12,2011,New evidence of water on Mars,"The indefatigable quest for firm evidence of liquid water on ancient Mars appears to have finally succeeded. NASA's Opportunity rover recently discovered a dozen bright veins of gypsum mineral and the results were presented at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, California. The rover used an array of instruments to confirm the chemical composition of the veins as calcium sulphate. Since calcium sulphate can exist in different forms depending on the amount of water it contains, the presence of gypsum, a hydrated mineral of calcium sulphate, strongly suggests the presence of water. Although gypsum has been found on far northern locations on Mars, what makes the latest find particularly significant is its presence at the very point where it was formed. This will help scientists understand the paleoenvironmental conditions on the red planet. The veins, which are 1 cm to 2 cm in width and 40 cm to 50 cm in length, are located at the edge of the Endeavour crater where the sulphate-rich sedimentary bedrock meets the volcanic bedrock that lies exposed at the rim of the crater. Scientists speculate that gypsum got precipitated when water containing calcium sulphate flowed through fractures.
Our current understanding is that water is a key resource for life to exist. Hence scientists searching for life on Mars or other planets look out for signs of liquid water. However, the mere presence of water does not necessarily mean micro-organisms exist. Salinity, acidity, and temperature play a predominant role in determining habitability in water bodies on Earth. Extrapolating from this, the data sent by rovers from other locations over the years have revealed a very harsh environment for life to exist. Even the Meridiani Planum region located in the Martian equator, which was considered to have the least harsh environment, turned out to be inimical to life because of its high acidic conditions. Unlike other locations explored so far, the edge of the Endeavour crater does not have any jarosite (an iron sulphate mineral) deposit indicative of acidic conditions. The combination of gypsum veins and the absence of jarosite probably indicates a “possibility of water being more neutral,” which basically means a less inhospitable environment. Whether ancient Mars was habitable or not, the discovery of gypsum reveals that liquid water was once present. The recent discovery of clay minerals, which were found to be widespread in the planet's Noachian terrain, supports the same idea. After all, clay minerals arise after a long-duration interaction between water and rocks.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/new-evidence-of-water-on-mars/article2738976.ece
24,12,2011,"One step forward, two steps back","Hopelessly ineffectual and constitutionally suspect, the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Bill, 2011 is nothing less than a betrayal of national trust. It is inexcusable that a Bill, substantially weaker than the August 2011 version that was forced to be withdrawn on the widespread belief that it would be fortified in key areas, has been tabled in the Lok Sabha. The whole purpose of the exercise is supposed to be the creation of a strong, effective, and credible mechanism to go after corruption, especially political corruption, which has assumed monstrous proportions in India. The key provisions of the new Bill relating to the selection of the nine-member Lokpal, its anti-corruption functions and powers, and administrative control over India's premier criminal investigation agency mock that purpose.
In the first place, Section 4 of the Bill, which provides for a five-member Selection Committee to choose the chairman and eight other members of the Lokpal, gives the government political control over this process. Secondly, the separation of the power to enquire, investigate, and prosecute set out in the Bill is much worse than the scheme contained in the earlier Lokpal Bill, Section 20 of which gave the Lokpal its own investigation wing. In allowing the Lokpal only an Inquiry Wing headed by a Director of Inquiry “for the purpose of conducting preliminary inquiry into any offence alleged to have been committed by a public servant punishable under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988” and denying it its own investigation wing, the new Bill neuters the anti-corruption watchdog. Allowing the Lokpal “a Prosecution Wing headed by the Director of Prosecution for the purpose of prosecution of public servants in relation to any complaint by the Lokpal under this Act” may look like a step forward. But this cannot possibly make up for the failure to provide for a clean process of independent investigation that is safeguarded from executive interference. At a time when the Lokayukta in a State such as Karnataka has its own investigation wing – something it has used to very good effect – it is retrogressive to withhold this instrument from the Lokpal.
At the same time, the new Bill has sought to keep the Central Bureau of Investigation out of the Lokpal's purview ostensibly on the ground that it should have autonomy over its investigations. Given the agency's record of bowing to the diktats of its political masters, there is no reason to believe that investigations, even those that are Lokpal-referred and Lokpal-monitored, will be free of political interference. The Centre, which has retained administrative control (read: promotions, transfers, etc.) of the CBI via the Ministry of Personnel, knows better than most that he who pays the piper calls the tune. While the proposal that a new panel (comprising the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India or his nominee) selects the Director of the CBI will go some way in enhancing the credibility of the agency, the opportunity to confer on it genuine independence is being lost.
Just as problematic is the constitutional validity of some basic provisions of the Bill. The inclusion of minorities among the groups given reservation in the nine-member body is bound to be challenged on the ground that it amounts to a quota being given on grounds of religion. While this issue has little bearing on tackling corruption, the deep and seemingly irreconcilable political divisions it has created, reflected in the manner in which it dominated the parliamentary debate on the Bill, is bound to have a bearing on its passage. Is this a ploy to let anti-corruption legislation fall victim to a wholly extraneous issue – reservation? Will it be allowed to degenerate, as in the case of the women's reservation bill, into a legislative exercise that everyone claims to support but few really want?
There have also been serious concerns on another constitutional front – federalism. While it is hard to fault the principle of having comparable mechanisms and instruments to go after corruption at the central and State levels, the legislative procedure adopted is open to question. Rather than mandating the creation of a Lokpal-like structure in every State, would it not have been in keeping with India's federal structure and regional sensitivities for the central legislation to have model or enabling provisions for constituting effective Lokayuktas in States? Given the strong national public mood against corruption, it is unlikely that State governments would risk going against it.
Unfortunately, the improvements in the new Bill have been overshadowed by the slew of regressive alterations. The inclusion of the Prime Minister under the Lokpal with certain exceptions is a step up from the earlier stipulation that permitted any inquiry only after he or she demitted office. The new Bill brings both Group ‘A' and ‘B' officers under the Lokpal's ambit. While this is short of Team Anna's demand that Group ‘C' and ‘D' officials be covered as well, it is an improvement on earlier drafts, under which the Lokpal's purview was limited to Group ‘A' officers. Further, while the ‘C' and ‘D' categories will be covered by the Central Vigilance Commission, cases relating to them will be reviewed by the Lokpal. The idea of granting constitutional status to the office of the Lokpal would have had traction had the Bill vested the body with the strength and self-sufficiency to make a serious impact on corruption. Unfortunately, a mixture of bad faith and a reluctance to loosen the grip on the handle of power have contributed to the making of a Bill that has caused deep divisions in Parliament and enough disenchantment to fuel a new round of Team Anna-led protests against the Centre. The country is no closer to a consensus on the Lokpal Bill than it was many months ago.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/one-step-forward-two-steps-back/article2742291.ece
26,12,2011,Instability in Pakistan,"The alarm call sounded by Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani of a conspiracy to oust his government has brought out in the open the rift between Pakistan's elected civilian government and the military. As long as this was confined to whispers in the corridor, there was a possibility that the differences could be papered over. Chances of this are now slim. A public denial by the Army chief, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, of a coup in the making and his pledge of support to the democratic process have failed to clear the air. A military takeover does seem unlikely — the Pakistan Army has learnt that coups work badly for it in the long run. Moreover, General Kayani and the ISI chief, Lt. General Shuja Pasha, both on extended tenures, are hardly popular in the prevailing anti-American environment marked by their failure to prevent U.S. military incursions, notably to kill Osama bin Laden. But the military's loathing for President Asif Ali Zardari could still see it manoeuvring against him through other means. The opening could come from the Supreme Court, which is considering a petition by the Pakistan Muslim League (N) leader, Nawaz Sharif, asking it to investigate ‘memogate'. This is the controversy stirred up by a Pakistani-American businessman's allegation that, on behalf of the Pakistan government, he carried a ‘memo' to a top American general asking for help to stave off a possible military coup in the aftermath of the Osama raid. Mr. Zardari's opponents, including former cricketer Imran Khan, blame him for this ‘conspiracy' against the Pakistan military. The Army has added its voice to the demand that the Supreme Court hear the case. But Prime Minister Gilani's extraordinary speech makes it clear there can be no selective removal — if the President goes, the government will go too. That would precipitate a political crisis much worse than the present standoff.
Unfortunately, Pakistan will continue to be politically unstable as long as its civilian-military relations remain weighted in favour of the latter. For the region and the world, that means negotiating relations with Islamabad will stay complicated. Indeed, one reason for the present turmoil is the struggle between the Pakistan People's Party government and the military on who will reset relations with the U.S. after the killing of 24 Pakistani soldiers on the Afghan border by NATO. For New Delhi, which recently restarted dialogue with Islamabad after more than two years of a ‘pause' over the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the priority is to ensure that the turmoil in Pakistan does not pose any security risks for India and that constructive bilateral engagement can go on despite the political uncertainty across the border.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/instability-in-pakistan/article2747546.ece
26,12,2011,Thinking after acting,"The United States government, which funded two teams of scientists to research if the H5N1 influenza virus has the potential to trigger a pandemic, has developed cold feet — after reviewing papers containing detailed descriptions of the lethal strains. The papers have already been sent to two journals, Nature and Science. In an unprecedented move, the government has recommended to the authors and to the editors of the journals that they publish only sanitised versions excising sensitive details of the study. This is a typical instance of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted. The results of the study were presented recently at a scientific conference in Malta by Ron Fouchier of the Erasmus Medical Center at Rotterdam, one of the research teams funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). The details were also shared with journalists covering the event. New Scientist and Scientific American reported in detail how the team went about creating the killer virus. According to these reports, the scientists first introduced three mutations to the virus. This was sufficient to kill the ferrets (the best animal models for influenza research), but lacked transmissibility. So they used a time-tested technique to make the pathogens adapt to a new host — taking the virus from a sick ferret and infecting the healthy ones, and repeating the cycle. After the tenth repetition, the virus became infectious and easily transmissible by air. Shockingly, all the five mutations (three created in the lab and two produced naturally) are found in nature. Their combined presence in the same strain was all it took to make the virus highly contagious and lethal in ferrets. This, in turn, indicates the ease with which the virus could spread among humans.
Though people can misuse this information, there is a compelling need for scientists to be aware of these mutations so that effective drugs and vaccines can be developed. Little wonder that both editors have reacted strongly to censorship and demanded that a mechanism be put in place to ensure that bona fide scientists have full and complete access to the results. This has finally prompted the U.S. government to act. It is also working on an oversight policy to evaluate dual-use research proposals prior to approval and funding. But the biggest concern is the risk of the new strain escaping from the labs. According to Nature, scientists working on SARS at four “high-containment labs” in China, Taiwan, and Singapore were “infected.” And the 395 bio-safety breaches in the U.S. between 2003 and 2009 could have resulted in the “accidental release of dangerous pathogens from high-containment labs.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Thinking-after-acting/article13441393.ece
27,12,2011,All five together,"India does not have an election-less year. With 28 States and seven Union Territories, the world's largest democracy hurtles from one Assembly election to another. In 2012, over a period of three months beginning January, five States — Manipur, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Goa — will go to the polls. Five years ago, elections to these States were held during three separate periods: Manipur, Punjab, and Uttarakhand in February; Uttar Pradesh in April-May; and Goa in June. Unlike in 2007, this time the schedules for all five States were announced on the same day, and a common date, March 4, was fixed for counting the votes. The Election Commission of India had more than one reason to announce all five together. A shortened period is administratively convenient, but more importantly, it allows for reasoned, practical application of the Model Code of Conduct for political parties. Though essential to ensure that ruling parties do not abuse power or misuse the official machinery, and to regulate the election campaign, the model code often holds up welfare schemes and development projects. Also, quite rightly, the code is binding not only on the governments in the States where an Assembly election is being held, but also on the Central government. To collapse the elections into a single time frame, wherever possible, is therefore desirable and may even be necessary.
However, the perception is that the timing of the announcement of the election schedule was to the advantage of the Congress, the leading constituent of the United Progressive Alliance government. Although Chief Election Commissioner S.Y. Quraishi asked the Centre to bear in mind the model code while presenting the Railway and Union Budgets in February, the poll managers of the Congress already appear to have had their way with the government. Just two days before the Election Commission released the schedule, the Union Cabinet, in an instance of exquisite timing, cleared a sub-quota of 4.5 per cent for backward minority communities within the 27 per cent reserved for the Other Backward Classes in education and government employment. Whatever be the role of the EC in this, the Congress stands exposed in its cynical attempts to tap into the so-called Muslim vote-bank in Uttar Pradesh. If indeed the EC planned to hold the U.P. election prior to the school public examinations, the announcement could have been made earlier. Actually, the Uttar Pradesh government had advanced the public examinations to early March in anticipation of elections in April. The scheduling might be somewhat controversial but, in the big picture of an Assembly election, these details might not appear all that sharp.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/all-five-together/article2750060.ece
27,12,2011,Low expectations,"The eighth ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation held in Geneva made little headway in breaking the impasse over the Doha development round. The outcome was, however, no surprise, since not much was expected from the meeting. The only realistic hope was that the political leaders would finally and formally acknowledge that after 10 years of tortuous negotiations, the Doha round was going nowhere and that, in its present form, it is unlikely to reach a closure any time soon. The communiqué issued after the meeting acknowledged as much. At the same time, it urged member countries to “more fully explore different negotiating approaches while respecting the principles of transparency and inclusiveness.” The meetings of trade ministers, held normally once in two years, are meant to give political direction to trade issues. The meeting this month reached an agreement on government procurement and on streamlining the accession process for the least developed countries. It also saw the formal admission to the WTO of Russia — the only large economy that has stayed out so far — and three smaller countries. But as the lack of progress on development-related trade issues shows, the yawning gap between precept and practice continues to bedevil the WTO and its members.
Two key issues emerge from the acknowledgment of an impasse over the Doha negotiations. First, is it still possible to fix a reasonable time frame for concluding the talks? Secondly, how does the stalling of talks affect developing countries such as India? Commerce Secretary Rahul Khullar said that he does not see a deal materialising before 2014. One main reason is that the United States is entering into an election mode and a new administration is highly unlikely to negotiate a multilateral trade treaty soon after taking office. The failure of the Doha round will lead to erosion in the standing of the WTO, and that would be a pity. The negotiations apart, it has created a fair and equitable machinery for overseeing the implementation of agreements, monitoring and surveillance, dispute settlement and capacity-building. It is widely acknowledged that its initiative in these areas has helped in checking protectionism during the recent crisis. It would be unfortunate for India if, as a result of the WTO losing its pre-eminence in trade negotiations, it becomes less effective in playing these roles. Driven by expediency, many countries, including India, have entered into other forms of preferential trade agreements, either bilateral or plurilateral, although they know only too well that these are only second-best options.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/low-expectations/article2750057.ece
28,12,2011,Unsafe at any speed,"In a Twitter post on India's road safety conditions, Atul Gawande, a U.S.-based surgeon, writer, and public health researcher, noted that traffic accident deaths now exceed fatal malaria cases. In fact, there were 125,660 accident fatalities during 2009, the latest year for which data was presented in Parliament a fortnight ago. Yet the country lacks a sustained effort to reduce road-related deaths and disability. The State governments, which enforce motor vehicles rules, and the Centre, which is administratively responsible for road safety through the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, have clearly failed to respond to the crisis. They must get serious at least with the new goal proposed by the Ministry's working groups: halving the number of deaths by 2020. It is an ambitious target, given the weak state of the determinants of road safety — education, engineering, and enforcement. The working groups have submitted many actionable points, and a prolonged campaign must follow. The best time to make the start is the New Year, which begins with Road Safety Week in January.
One major lacuna, as underscored by these groups, is the absence of a technically competent national statutory agency. The current advisory body, the National Road Safety Council, is simply not equal to the task. Moreover, there would be little value in multiplying such panels at the State and district levels, if they do not have the authority to pursue the safety agenda. It is worth pointing out that the Sundar Committee of the Ministry recommended almost five years ago the formation of a National Road Safety and Traffic Management Board. Legislation to create one has run into rough weather in Parliament as several amendments to the Motor Vehicles Act are pending. What can be done immediately, however, is to strengthen engineering and enforcement. With few exceptions, Indian roads have poor safety engineering. In particular, they do not accommodate the needs of pedestrians, bicycles, and other slow-moving vehicles. This gross neglect was flagged for remedial action by the Sundar Committee, but little action has followed. In the area of enforcement, amendments to the M.V. Act seeking to professionalise enforcement and enhance penalties for serious offences — such as driving under the influence of liquor, rash and negligent driving, and overloading of commercial vehicles — await approval by Parliament. Also, driver-licensing remains the weakest link in road safety. Here, State governments have done little to reform an archaic and scandalously corrupt system. What is needed is a ‘zero tolerance' policy towards everything that makes Indian roads deadly.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Unsafe-at-any-speed/article13447422.ece
28,12,2011,Iraq on the brink,"The Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki's accusation that Vice-President Tariq al-Hashimi has been ordering the bombing and assassination of political opponents has caused the fragile coalition government to collapse and taken Iraq close to the kind of sectarian violence that followed the United States-led invasion in 2003. It has also exposed the hollowness of Washington's claim that Iraqi democracy is now stable enough to justify the December 18 removal of the remaining U.S. combat troops. Mr. al-Hashimi has flown to the Kurdistan regional capital, Erbil, where he is relatively safe for the present. The national President, Jalal Talabani, and the Kurdish regional president, Masoud Barzani, have called for an immediate political conference. But the central government's issue of an arrest warrant for Mr. al-Hashimi, and the withdrawal from parliament of Ayad Allawi's secular-nationalist Iraqiya group, bring to an end a coalition that actually took 289 days to form after the March 2010 general election. The purported quiet of recent times, in which political violence has claimed 200-300 lives a month, has been shattered by a dozen bombings in Baghdad on December 22 that left 57 killed and 176 injured. Ominously, the attacks happened mainly in Shia-majority neighbourhoods, and could provoke sectarian retaliation.
Even temporary compromise will be very hard to achieve, not least because the Iraqi constitution itself institutionalises ethnic and sectarian divisions. The violence of the post-invasion years caused Shias and Sunnis to flee from mixed areas to regions with greater numbers of their own sect. That deepened mutual distrust and suspicion, which has been exacerbated by allegations that the Shia-dominated government is denying Sunni politicians ministerial posts or is obstructing those who hold them. Now three Sunni-majority provinces on the Syrian border are trying to form a self-governing region. Moreover, the U.S. abolition of civic bodies and the invaders' destruction of physical infrastructure, on the assumption that all who ran those were fanatical Saddamites, have done more than wreck the everyday functioning of Iraq. They have facilitated arbitrary and brutal policing and judicial practices, with trials conducted as much by confession as on the basis of evidence — a tactic Mr. al-Maliki is now using against his political adversaries. Now the country faces disintegration. That will only add to the terrible price millions of Iraqis have paid already, while the main invader, the United States, washes its hands of responsibility for either causing or preventing it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/iraq-on-the-brink/article2752717.ece
29,12,2011,Medicines for all,"Achieving universal health coverage through an equitable system is among the key goals of India's 12th Plan. Within the overall objective of creating an entitlement-based health care system, one of the challenges is access to medicines. The High Level Expert Group instituted by the Planning Commission on Universal Health Coverage underscores serious policy distortions and inefficiencies that stand in the way of making essential medicines accessible to all. A far-sighted programme assuring free or affordable access to drugs can make a big difference. Today household expenditure on drugs constitutes 71 per cent of all out-of-pocket spending on health. Reducing this burden requires a carefully crafted plan, the blueprint for which has been presented by the expert group chaired by Dr. K. Srinath Reddy. What it requires is greater public investment on drugs, an expanded official list of essential medicines, effective price controls for essential drugs, and a pooled procurement system that leverages the benefits of scale to drive costs down. The substantial cost benefits of centralised procurement for the government system have been convincingly demonstrated in Tamil Nadu, encouraging Kerala to adopt the same model; Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Orissa are in the process of replicating it.
National Sample Survey data indicate that free drugs supplied during hospitalisation declined from 31.20 per cent in 1986-87 to 8.99 per cent in 2004. The high cost of medicines from the mid-1990s resulted in out-patients not receiving drugs in one-fourth of all cases by 2004, up from 12.11 per cent in the base year. It is important therefore that the central government acts urgently on the expert group's suggestion to move to a system where essential medicines are available free of cost to everyone. It is estimated that this can be achieved through a four-fold increase in public spending on drugs. Such a programme should rely mainly on quality generic drugs produced by a revitalised public sector and compulsory licensing under the TRIPS Agreement of WTO. It is worth pointing out that in the absence of social health insurance, several patented medicines are beyond the reach of the majority of Indians. More households will come under calamitous pressure, if enhanced patent provisions forming part of bilateral agreements (such as those with the European Union and Japan) lead to higher drug prices. Rising India with its hundreds of millions of desperately poor people can ill afford to go down that path. Creating a system of standard treatment, pooled procurement, and decentralised distribution by the government, which will lead to massive savings, brooks no delay.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Medicines-for-all/article13379234.ece
29,12,2011,Conserving the Taj Mahal,"The conservation of the 363-year-old Taj Mahal — the jewel among Indian monuments and one of the most visited world heritage sites — has yet again come under a cloud following reports of structural instability. Doubts have been raised about the strength of its foundation, and the Supreme Court, after taking suo motu notice of the reports, has directed the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to investigate the matter. The government's reply that the Taj Mahal is “stable in plan and also elevation” is partly reassuring. However, it would be unfortunate if the issue were allowed to rest with this, since the longevity of the monument is not the only concern. What the recent controversy spotlights is the need for transparency in heritage management, and the efforts needed to achieve excellence in conservation. The Taj Mahal is precious not only because it is a one-monument industry that attracts 3.5 million visitors every year. This ‘illumined tomb' built over 17 years by Shah Jahan, the Mughal emperor, with its picture-perfect geometry, exquisitely ornamented facades, and innovative Mughal gardens, is an exemplar of Indian design and craftsmanship. Its history and archaeology are yet to be fully uncovered.
Given the Taj Mahal's river-front location and the periodic fluctuation in water levels, continuous monitoring of the structure is imperative. In the past, the ASI often consulted premier institutions such as the Central Building Research Institute, Roorkee. However, it appears that the most recent of the structural studies was conducted about six years ago. Without waiting for any court directive or public pressure, investigations must be updated regularly, and the findings published. This is the way to enhance conservation. Attention thus far has been mostly on the buildings, and not on the gardens around, which are integral to the design of the monument. It has been remarked by a scholar that “what we have today in the gardens of the Taj Mahal is a post-colonial interpretation of a colonial intervention in a Mughal garden.” What is needed is a sensitive recreation of the original landscape based on a careful archaeobotanical survey. In addition, even if a fully functional restoration of the water works system that was originally designed to support the Mughal gardens is not possible, the physical structures should be conserved and presented. For this purpose, the ASI, which is spread thin, would do well to seek counsel and collaboration from the best expertise, wherever it is available. In this 150th year of the ASI's establishment, there is no excuse for not raising the conservation of India's most celebrated heritage site to the highest international standards.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Conserving-the-Taj-Mahal/article13444676.ece
30,12,2011,India-Japan relations,"The determined effort by India and Japan to inject life into their bilateral relationship is showing positive results. The meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Japanese premier Yoshihiko Noda, the sixth of the annual India-Japan summits, is a marker of the steady progress. It yielded the first official confirmation since Japan's devastating tsunami-earthquake-Fukushima meltdown that the country has not shut the door on a civilian nuclear deal with India. While Mr. Noda stressed the importance of learning the right lessons from Japan's nuclear accident, it appears that negotiations on a deal to assist India develop peaceful nuclear energy will continue. His pledge of $4.5 billion over the next five years for the development of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, a commitment of financial assistance for two more infrastructure projects — Phase 3 of the Delhi Metro and a biodiversity conservation project in West Bengal — and his interest in sharing high-speed railway technology with India are significant. Japan's enhancement of its currency swap arrangement from $3 billion to $15 billion will help India better manage the rupee's slump against the dollar. This should also boost financial cooperation and economic and trade ties, which are currently far below potential. The Indian side wants more Japanese investment. For its part, Japan, which has just lifted a longstanding ban on the export of weapons, will be looking to sell defence hardware to New Delhi.
Prime Minister Noda's visit capped a year of intense bilateral activity. The Foreign Ministers held a strategic dialogue in October, followed by talks between the defence ministers. In February, the two sides signed the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement covering trade in goods as well as services; it came into effect in August. Earlier this month, India, Japan, and the United States held their first trilateral strategic dialogue. It is creditable that despite the political instability in Japan, and the scandal-induced paralysis in India, both countries managed to fit in these high-level exchanges. It is crucial that growing India-Japan ties are viewed independently of each country's relations with China. New Delhi and Beijing are engaged in improving relations at various levels, including trade, eventually aiming to amicably resolve the boundary question. China is Japan's biggest trading partner; the two have a bilateral trade of $340 billion that neither can afford to endanger. The fears expressed in a section of China's news media that Mr. Noda's visit is part of a “containment strategy” aimed at Beijing are needless. The Chinese government has done well to play them down.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/India-Japan-relations/article13446005.ece
30,12,2011,"New year, new beginnings?","Comeback may seem like an inappropriate expression for those who never went away. But for the legion of fans of two of the world's greatest sportsmen, the end of 2011 — annus horribilis, for the most part — held out a tantalising promise: a return to their triumphant ways. The manner in which Roger Federer and Tiger Woods signed off at the end of the Gregorian year shows it is much too premature to conclude, as some critics have, that they are headed into the sporting sunset. Over the last couple of months, there have been intimations of a rebirth, reminders that their prodigious talent is very much alive. Federer began 2011 on a deceptive note, winning the first ATP tournament of the year at Doha. This was followed by a succession of losses, which saw him lose, for the first time since 2003, in all four Grand Slam tournaments in a calendar year. At Wimbledon, he suffered the ignominy of going down to unfancied Jo Wilfried Tsonga in the quarter finals, his first loss in a major tournament after leading two sets to love. It wasn't until early November that Federer won his second tournament in 2011 at Basel. He followed this up with two other victories, ironically defeating Tsonga both times to win the ATP World Tour Masters in Paris and the prestigious ATP World Tour Final in London (sometimes referred to as the fifth Grand Slam).
For Woods, the climb back to form, which plummeted when news of his marital infidelities broke, has been much more difficult. When he won the Chevron World Challenge three weeks ago, he notched up his first victory on the PGA Tour in more than two years. Last month, a final day rally took him to the third position at the Australian Open, which he followed up by winning the clinching point for the United States against the international team in the President's Cup. The challenges before the two men in 2012 are different. Although 36, Woods is less handicapped by his age. The competition, despite the advent of the hugely talented youngster Rory McIlroy, is pretty much the same he left behind two years ago. To return to the top, he needs to put his turbulent past behind him and focus on making the necessary adjustments in his game. At 30, Federer is confronted by much younger rivals. His year-end flourish has coincided with the decline in the fortunes of his principal rivals. World number one Novak Djokovic's dream run in 2011 ended with the U.S. Open victory, after which injury has taken its toll. And Rafael Nadal needs desperately to reverse his recent run of poor form. While Federer's challenge is principally physical, for Woods it lies mainly in the mind.

31,12,2011,Fundamentally flawed,"That the United Progressive Alliance regime was not serious about getting Parliament to legislate into existence a strong and effective anti-corruption ombudsman became clear amidst the sound and fury that marked the proceedings relating to the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Bill, 2011 in both houses of Parliament. The defeat of the Constitution (116th Amendment) Bill, which was politically sponsored by Congress general-secretary Rahul Gandhi, seemed to be a real debacle brought on by miscalculation compounded by inept floor management in the Lok Sabha. Whether the midnight collapse of the government's efforts in the Rajya Sabha was contrived or beyond the control of its floor management team need not concern us here. Suffice it to note that the legislation that made it through the Lok Sabha is fundamentally flawed. It was heartening to see that public opinion, however sceptical, displayed reasonableness and democratic spirit in giving the elected representatives of the people every chance to get the Lokpal Bill right; that might help explain, at least in part, why the Anna Hazare-led movement failed to evoke an enthusiastic popular response in this round.
One does not have to agree with every demand made by Team Anna to recognise that the thrust of its anti-corruption campaign is sound and radical, given the Indian context. And whatever one thinks of the political agenda of the Opposition players, it must be recognised that they did well, in the parliamentary debates, to highlight three vital respects in which the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Bill, 2011 fell unacceptably short. The first issue is selection of the Lokpal: it is clear that Section 4, which provides for a five-member Selection Committee comprising the Prime Minister, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, the Chief Justice of India or a Supreme Court judge nominated by him or her, and “one eminent jurist nominated by the President,” gives the government political control of the selection process. The second issue is the scheme of separation of the power to inquire into, investigate, and prosecute alleged offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Under this scheme, the Lokpal is studiedly denied any investigative mechanism or role. The full import of this fix becomes clear when we come to the third issue — the political control the government will retain over the Central Bureau of Investigation. Encroaching on the constitutional jurisdiction of States is a serious matter; among other things, it contributed to the legislative debacle in the Rajya Sabha by isolating the Congress from some of its key UPA allies. But then in the amended Bill, State legislatures have been given an option on constituting Lokayuktas as set out by Parliament, and it is quite conceivable that Part III of the Bill, which provides for Lokayuktas, will be deleted. But unless the three fatal faults are surgically corrected, this legislative exercise is bound to go the way of the previous ten Lokpal Bills, which, under one excuse or another, never became law.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fundamentally-flawed/article2761332.ece
31,12,2011,If the rich choose austerity…,"Prognosis for the global economy in 2012 remains bleak notwithstanding some improvement in the United States. Recently, IMF chief Christine Laggard reiterated that the world economy is in a dangerous situation. It is doubtful that the accord the European Union leaders struck at the December 9 summit for deeper economic cooperation in the euro zone will stem the debt crisis that began in Greece in 2009 and now threatens to engulf even France and Germany. In the U.S., there are signs of recovery across a number of parameters. Retail sales have been strong; spending on discretionary items has picked up; and the unemployment rate has dropped to 8.6 per cent. But then, there are also worrying factors. The housing sector, from where the global economic crisis originated, remains in a moribund state. The unseemly political divide between Democrats and Republicans has stalled the progress of important enactments and the budget. Even the employment figures do not look that good, if the 300,000 people who have opted out of the workforce are taken into account. Emerging economies — India and China, among others — who were the growth engines for the world economy are slowing down. As a recent UNCTAD report points out, the developing world is both unable and unwilling to accept the role of debtor of last resort.
For the global economy to mend, the leading economies must make the right policy choices and work concertedly. The key policy debate has been on whether to go back to the expansionary policies that had helped to ward off the worst symptoms of the crisis or to opt for the now-fashionable economic austerity. During 2011, most advanced economies changed course and opted for fiscal restraint which they hoped would improve the private sector's confidence and set off a wave of private investment and consumption demand. But new data from some important countries that took this route point unambiguously to a recession in 2012. Private sector confidence is touching new lows, as demand from the government and from public sector is sliding relentlessly. UNCTAD argues that, in the prevailing environment, fiscal austerity will make matters worse, not better, in the advanced economies. For most of them, high unemployment is a more pressing problem than fiscal imbalance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/if-the-rich-choose-austerity/article2761331.ece
2,1,2012,Chasing the vote in Uttar Pradesh,"With its oversized cast of fiercely competing players, continually changing caste and communal loyalties, and a host of other imponderables, political Uttar Pradesh can be a challenge for the shrewdest of pundits. As the State goes to the polls, the picture is extraordinarily hazy, with none among the many claimants seen to have a clear edge. Logic and ground reality suggest that, in the main, the fight will be between the incumbent Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party. But this has not stopped Congress propagandists from foreseeing a Rahul Gandhi-led sweet victory. The Bharatiya Janata Party, for its part, is looking to Uma Bharti to recreate the magic of the 1990s when the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and forward castes came together to propel the Hindutva party to power. Since then, of course, new caste combinations have taken hold, resulting in power shifting from the mainstream parties to their regional, ‘subaltern' counterparts. Will the trend change in 2012? For years, no party could carve a majority out of U.P's fragmented polity until Mayawati, in a remarkable display of political acumen, conjured up the numbers through a fusion experiment that united the Dalits and the forward castes. The BSP's 2007 success was based on a simple calculation. It had a transferable Dalit vote of about 15-20 per cent upon which a block of other castes could be built, making the party unbeatable. For the forward castes, disillusioned with the BJP and desperate to oust Mulayam Singh, the BSP was the perfect fit.
Five years on, the ‘Brahmin jodo' (add the Brahmins) chemistry has largely dissipated. Clearly, it was expediency rather than a genuine change of heart that brought the forward castes into the BSP fold then. The BSP, however, continues to be uniquely positioned: it has the largest committed core vote which is also transferable. Indeed, even in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, seen as a low point for the BSP, the party topped the chart in terms of votes, polling about 27.5 per cent to the SP's 23.3 per cent. The Congress was ahead of the BSP by one seat (BSP: 20; Congress: 21), but on a narrow vote base of around 18 per cent. It turned out that the Congress benefited from a concentration of votes in the constituencies it won, whereas the BSP suffered seat losses disproportionate to its three percentage point vote erosion. The SP more or less maintained its vote base. Today, the BSP is admittedly in trouble, battling anti-incumbency, internal dissent arising from the dismissal of over a dozen Ministers, and desertion by forward castes. The SP's Muslim vote is under threat from the Congress and a string of Muslim parties. The Congress, its high-pitched campaign notwithstanding, has no core vote on which to build a winning strategy. For the parties as much as the pundits, it is time for a reality check.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/chasing-the-vote-in-uttar-pradesh/article2766572.ece
2,1,2012,Criminalising forced marriage,"The British government's decision to start consultation on the possible criminalisation of forced marriages is significant. Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, Minister without Portfolio in David Cameron's Cabinet and chair of the Conservative Party, wrote in The Guardian recently that new law was needed because coercing, threatening, or blackmailing someone into matrimony was not itself a criminal offence in the United Kingdom. Civil remedies do exist, courts can issue protection orders under the Forced Marriages (Civil Protection) Act 2007, and Scottish courts can add their own conditions. Breaches of protection orders constitute contempt and can incur a fine or a prison sentence up to two years. In the three years since the Act took effect outside Scotland, 339 orders have been issued, although the number of forced marriages was estimated to be between 5,000 and 8,000 a year. For various reasons, only a minority of these get reported to the government's Forced Marriages Unit. Followers of all major faiths are involved, with origins in South Asia, north and east Africa, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan; 70 per cent of cases involve South Asian families. About 85 per cent of victims are female, one half of whom are aged between eight and 16; more male victims are starting to surface.
Unsurprisingly, the new proposal has raised concerns among the affected communities. The British government has long held that the existing criminal law on kidnapping, people trafficking, and abduction was sufficient; and as late as September 2011 Lynne Featherstone, junior Minister at the Home Office, stated there were no plans for a new offence of ‘forced marriage'. According to experts like Aisha Gill of the University of Roehampton, community and victim-support groups feel that criminalisation could discourage victims from seeking help and also work against prospective reconciliation between victims and their families. Other researchers warn that parents might evade the criminal law by sending children abroad for forced marriages. The risks of misuse of the criminal law, especially in a context of sensationalist media coverage, are real. There is a strong case for placing the emphasis on strengthening public services for prevention, protection, and victim support. But the bottom line for any civilised modern society must be absolute intolerance of such reactionary practices that denote contempt for human rights and cruelty towards the young.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/criminalising-forced-marriage/article2766568.ece
3,1,2012,Protecting the Western Ghats,"The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel reporting to the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) has made several salutary recommendations for the long-term conservation of this global biodiversity hotspot. Renowned for their flora and fauna, along with the Eastern Himalayas, these mountains and valleys hugging the Arabian Sea coast for a length of 1,500 km need an overarching protection regime that cares as much for the tribal people they have sheltered as for their biological diversity. The experts studied scientific reports and Supreme Court judgments, consulted the State governments involved, and listened to village panchayats. A central message that emerges is that the entire ghat region meets the criteria for declaration as an ecologically sensitive area. Within this broad framework, the report makes the point that there are Ecologically Sensitive Zones of three levels of significance, which can be demarcated at the taluk or block level. The MoEF, which is empowered under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to declare any region as deserving of special protection, should consider this seriously. Such protection is essential to rule out incompatible activities such as mining, constructing large dams, and setting up polluting industries.
If there is one single reason to protect the whole of the Western Ghats, it is the phenomenon of endemism. According to reliable estimates, they have more than 1,500 endemic species of flowering plants, and at least 500 such species of fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. New species continue to be reported. It is striking that the ghats represent an extraordinary sliver of diverse life in a populous country and have in fact survived with community support. The MoEF would therefore do well to heed the advice of the expert group and unhesitatingly reject environmental clearance for two controversial dam projects — Athirapilly in Kerala and Gundia in Karnataka. The locations of both come under the most sensitive ecological zone category. In this context, it is relevant that a decade ago the Kerala High Court directed the State Electricity Board to repair and restore all existing dams to maximise power output. Doing so can eliminate the need for a destructive new structure at Athirapilly. A second issue relates to mining in Goa. Here the panel has rightly called for an indefinite moratorium on clearances for new mines in sensitive zones and phasing out of the activity in fragile areas by 2016. The guidelines proposed are sound overall. Translating them into action through a statutory apex body such as a Western Ghats Ecological Authority holds the key.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/protecting-the-western-ghats/article2769353.ece
3,1,2012,"Stable, for now","The Reserve Bank of India's Financial Stability Reports (FSRs) are half-yearly assessments of the health of the financial sector. Of a comparatively recent origin, the FSR is intended to bring India's financial regulatory practices in line with the best in the world. Its key objective is to monitor and sustain the health of the financial sector. The RBI gives out its assessments and views at varied intervals through documents called variously as reports, policy statements, and reviews. For its part, the FSR distinctively focusses on the systemic aspects, rather than the individual components, of the financial sector and evaluates the soft spots in the Indian scene. Lessons are sought to be learnt from the interplay of the macroeconomic setting, policies, markets and institutions, for which the central bank claims to use the most up-to-date techniques and methodology. According to the latest FSR covering June-December 2011, the domestic financial system remains robust. The banking system is resilient enough to tide over unexpected adverse macroeconomic developments. But the good news, which is carried over from the previous FSR, was tempered by evidence of some deterioration in the macroeconomic environment and financial markets.
Notably, all components of domestic demand have decelerated. Inflation pressures remain elevated, driven by a number of factors. Risks to the external sector have increased. Trade deficit and, along with it, the current account deficit have widened. The fiscal position remains challenging and, as the recent additional demand for supplementary grants shows, the risk of fiscal slippages is real. Equity and financial markets continue to be volatile, mainly due to adverse developments abroad. Exchange depreciation, which has been particularly sharp, is beginning to impact the Indian economy through various channels. There have been large transaction losses on foreign exchange exposures. Repayment of external commercial borrowings has become more expensive. Among financial institutions, the FSR shows some deterioration in financial soundness indicators, but capital adequacy stays well above regulatory requirements, and asset quality compares favourably with what obtains in peer countries. As the year progresses, the slowdown in GDP growth will make the Indian financial sector more vulnerable. Banks will have simultaneously to address the related challenges of lower asset quality and raising additional capital, the latter also to comply with the Basel III requirements. The FSR once again gives a clean chit to the Indian financial sector, but warns of troubles ahead.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/stable-for-now/article2769352.ece
4,1,2012,Seeking answers from the GRAIL,"Despite half a century of lunar exploration with automated probes and the efforts of a dozen men who walked its surface, the Moon has lost little of its allure, especially for scientists. The twin spacecraft of the Gravity Recovery And Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission despatched by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration are the latest to go there. In recent days, they slipped into lunar orbit after taking a circuitous, low-energy passage from Earth that lasted three-and-a-half months. “We know more about many aspects of the Moon than about any world beyond our own, and yet we have barely begun to solve its countless mysteries,” remarked the U.S. National Research Council in a report issued a few years ago. Nowhere else, it went on to point out, “can we see back with such clarity to the time when Earth and the other terrestrial planets were formed and life emerged on Earth.” Probes have mapped in great detail the Moon's surface and the minerals to be found there. India's Chandrayaan-1 and other spacecraft found unmistakeable signs of water. The Apollo astronauts as well as the Soviet Union's unmanned landers brought back rock and soil samples that could be carefully studied in the laboratory.
The GRAIL spacecraft are expected to provide important clues to what the Moon is like deep inside by mapping variations in its gravitational field with much higher resolution than before. When the science phase of the mission starts in March 2012, the two satellites will be flying in formation, one behind the other, at a height of about 55 km. The spacecraft will then transmit GPS-like radio signals so that the distance between them can be accurately measured. That gap changes as they fly over areas with greater or lesser gravity. Scientists will then need to take the data and combine them with other information, such as topographical maps prepared with data from other satellites, in order to try and figure out the structure of the Moon's interior and its composition. Such analysis can provide insights into many aspects of Earth's natural satellite. Why, for instance, are the two hemispheres of the Moon so different from each another? The side we see is flat with lava-filled basins that appear as dark patches. The farside, on the other hand, is mountainous and has a much thicker crust. One explanation for this asymmetry, based on computer simulations and published recently in a scientific journal, suggested that the Moon once had a smaller companion that subsequently crashed into it. The GRAIL data could help substantiate or rule out such a scenario. Likewise, getting a handle on the distribution of materials in the interior will be invaluable in understanding the Moon's evolution. As always, such quests of scientific discovery can reveal the unexpected.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/seeking-answers-from-the-grail/article2772429.ece
4,1,2012,Nigeria's twin challenges,"The Nigerian government, headed by President Goodluck Jonathan of the People's Democratic Party, faces two major crises — brought on by renewed ethno-religious violence and the abolition of fuel subsidies. These may appear distinct but are, in fact, interconnected. The population of Nigeria is made up more or less equally of Christians and Muslims, with a small minority following traditional religion. The first crisis was triggered by deadly Christmas Day bombings near the national capital, Abuja, and in the city of Jos, about 200km away; 49 people were killed and scores injured. In addition, 52 people, including several children, have died in communal violence in the south-eastern Ebonyi state. In response, President Jonathan has imposed an emergency in four states, closing all the relevant borders. The Islamist group, Boko Haram, has claimed responsibility for the bombings. The second crisis can be traced, in part, to International Monetary Fund pressure to end fuel subsidies. The proposal has generated widespread opposition, despite the fact that Nigeria intends to put the projected $8 billion savings towards creating domestic refining capacity, and possibly towards limiting the influence multinationals such as Shell have on Abuja's policies.
Nigeria is one of the world's major oil producers. It is also one of the world's most corrupt countries. The connection between the communal violence and the fuel price issue lies in the fact that the benefits of oil have not reached the majority of the 160-million population. One result is serious dysfunctionality in public services and institutions. Survivors of the bombings have accused the emergency services of slowness and incompetence; the services even sent text messages to journalists at the scene seeking their help in getting more ambulances. Secondly, persistent and widening inequalities, with poverty especially severe in the Muslim-majority north, alienate citizens and give fundamentalists ready audiences. Moreover, leaders of Boko Haram, which demands the nationwide adoption of an extreme form of the Sharia law, claim that al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) has assisted them; AQIM has also publicly praised the Nigerian group. If the central government is to respond effectively to these challenges, it will need to dig deep and draw on the democratic and secular spirit of the Nigerian masses, who struggled valiantly to end military rule and have — since the restoration of civilian rule in 1999 — voted decisively on political, not religious or ethnic, lines.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/nigerias-twin-challenges/article2772428.ece
5,1,2012,Another atrocity in Kashmir,"For no crime other than that he stood alongside a crowd demanding the restoration of electricity supply to his village, Altaf Ahmad Sood was shot dead on Monday. This appalling murder, at the hands of a Central Industrial Security Force picket guarding a power installation at Barnait, a village near Uri in Jammu and Kashmir, makes clear the casualness with which central forces reach for their guns against the people of Kashmir. In this case, multiple rounds were fired into the crowd, aimed to kill rather than to disperse the crowd. N.R. Das, the CISF chief, has said his men were “outnumbered” — a bizarre claim, given that there is no indication that the crowd was armed or seeking to attack the police. Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has done what he can to stop the tragedy in Barnait from spiralling into the kind of clashes that claimed more than 100 lives in 2010. Learning from past mistakes, he has met with the families of victims, named the guilty, and promised to ensure their prosecution. But these measures will not be enough.
The Barnait killing raises two issues that need to be addressed by New Delhi — not Srinagar. The first is the central government's dogged refusal to sanction the prosecution of central security force personnel facing credible allegations of murder in civilian courts, thus fostering a culture of impunity. Last summer, for example, troops under the command of the north Kashmir-based 53 infantry brigade were alleged to have murdered three residents of Nadihal village. Even though the police found a mass of persuasive evidence that the men were killed in cold blood, the Defence Ministry has refused to sanction the prosecution of the military personnel involved. New Delhi is, instead, waging a legal battle to ensure that the suspects are tried in a military court — thus abusing laws meant to protect central police and military forces in the field from vexatious prosecution. Secondly, the central government's unwillingness to ensure security force accountability is rivalled only by its indifference to enhancing security force competencies. Even though tens of thousands of personnel have been recruited into the central and state security forces, they remain ill trained — and, inevitably, trigger happy. National Crime Records Bureau data show that 154 people were killed and 669 injured on 1,155 occasions when police used firearms to control riots or other forms of mass violence in 2010. Like Mr. Sood, the victims were overwhelmingly poor: farmers, slum residents, and urban workers. More than 3,300 police personnel were also injured in these operations. Put together, the figures indicate that policing in India's trouble spots is a mix of impunity and incompetence. Until New Delhi makes a serious effort to transform this situation, Mr. Sood will not be the last victim of a lethal cocktail.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/another-atrocity-in-kashmir/article2775108.ece
5,1,2012,Crime and punishment,"Capital market regulator SEBI has barred seven companies from accessing the capital market. Its ongoing investigations and surveillance revealed that these companies, which tapped the capital market recently, were guilty of malpractices — such as grossly violating disclosure norms, falsifying and withholding information, and illegally diverting the funds garnered from the share offerings (IPO). Six merchant banks that lead-managed these IPOs have also been barred. It is very likely that SEBI will wield the stick against some more companies. But the question arises whether the quantum of punishment awarded meets the ends of justice and whether it is deterrent enough to prevent perpetuation of capital market fraud. SEBI has of course said it will get other agencies to proceed against the defrauding companies under the laws of the land. But then the experience in this respect inspires little confidence. More often than not, investigations into cases of capital market fraud fizzle out, once they get away from the glare of publicity. Besides, it is unlikely that retail investors who bought shares in these companies will ever be compensated for the loss.
Investment decisions in the capital market seem to be guided mostly by the dictum, caveat emptor (buyers beware). It need not be so. Since its inception, SEBI has taken a number of steps to protect investors. Its regulatory and supervisory functions have expanded considerably to keep pace with the increased volumes and sophistication of the stock markets and their operators. A lot of attention has been paid to investor education. Informed investors can be a bulwark against sharp practices of unscrupulous promoters. Stock exchanges have been compelled to reinvent themselves and function professionally. In a masterstroke, merchant banks and other capital market intermediaries were brought under a regulatory regime in the 1990s. However, not only has there been a frequent recurrence of scams but the modus operandi has kept changing. There is the case of “vanishing companies”, where the promoters disappeared after collecting the proceeds from IPOs. In 2005, there was the demat scam in which shares meant for retail investors were cornered by a group of people who submitted multiple and fictitious applications through numerous demat accounts. Scams such as these undermine the very integrity of the IPO process, which is based on trust and requires a high degree of disclosure in the prospectus.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/crime-and-punishment/article2775105.ece
6,1,2012,Quarrelsome couple,"The Congress and the Trinamool Congress seem to be chasing each other in circles. After Trinamool supremo and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee took on the Congress at the Centre on issues such as foreign direct investment in retail, creation of Lokayuktas, and the Pension Bill, her government is now under attack from the Congress in West Bengal. Ms Banerjee's decision to rename Indira Bhavan in Kolkata after the poet Nazrul Islam has raised the hackles of her ally. Congress leaders have risen in protest, sensing in the move a slight against Indira Gandhi. Although named after the former Prime Minister to commemorate her stay there during the 1972 All India Congress Committee session, Indira Bhavan has also been closely associated with CPI(M) leader Jyoti Basu, who lived there for more than two decades until his death in January 2010. All the furniture and belongings of Jyoti Basu — who, in an extraordinary act of altruism, donated his body for medical research — were already in the process of being moved out of the Bhavan. It is not the CPI(M) that Mamata Banerjee appears to have angered with her proposal but her political ally and partner in government. The Congress is now taking the fight further into the Trinamool camp, with a rally calling for higher support price for paddy. In short, the Congress in West Bengal is doing unto the Mamata government what the Trinamool is doing unto the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre.
While these are clear signs of a widening rift, the Congress and the Trinamool are not likely to end their marriage in the conceivable future. They need each other in the anti-Left cause over the long term, even if not in the local bodies polls scheduled for next year. Ms Banerjee was not posturing when she opposed FDI in retail and the Pension Bill: these sensitive issues had a direct bearing on her political constituency. As for her opposition in Parliament to Part III of the Lokpal Bill, as it stands, she, along with other regional parties, was on strong ground, given the federal character of India's Constitution. Of course, she might have also wanted to see how far she could push the Congress and the UPA government, to extract maximum concessions for her party and government. The Congress, for its part, might have also felt the need to create a political space for itself in West Bengal. The war of words between the two parties is unlikely to result in the break-up of the alliance, but could redefine the nature of their relationship. Neither party can let the other dominate. As is true of marriages of convenience, they can neither live with each other, nor live without each other.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/quarrelsome-couple/article2778342.ece
6,1,2012,Waiting for e-services,"Delivering services to the common citizen in the digital mode remains a big challenge for the Central and State governments. Although the Department of Information Technology asserts that IT infrastructure has “largely” been put in place under the National eGovernance Plan, outcomes have been poor even for mission mode projects such as issue of passports. A lot of work will have to go into re-engineering government processes before the Electronic Delivery of Services Bill, 2011 introduced in the Lok Sabha can start delivering results. The legislation covers the whole of India except Jammu and Kashmir, and, like the Right to Information Act, aligns the States as well with the goal of serving the citizen better. The Bill mandates the delivery of public services or other services in the electronic mode, including receipt of forms and applications, issue or grant of licence, permit, certificate, sanction or approval and the receipt of monetary payments. It also provides for setting up central and State Electronic Service Delivery Commissions, an oversight mechanism that can potentially streamline the working of the bureaucracy.
Electronic governance infrastructure can serve as the backbone for delivery of services, but it cannot work a miracle in the absence of administrative reform. Making that point three years ago, the Second Administrative Reforms Commission called for a step-by-step analysis and assessment, from the standpoint of rationality and simplicity, of every service that a government organisation provides. The elimination of unnecessary steps, simplification of others, and re-engineering of the process to ensure suitability for e-governance must follow. Government departments tend to adopt notoriously cumbersome procedures, often demanding basic documents multiple times. Only if this system and mindset are overcome can the new law start providing e-services within five years of its commencement. Equally important, government must use a common data standard for uniformity and interoperability. While that task requires a fair amount of work, some electronic services can be launched well before the deadline. This is possible where transactions do not require all legacy data to be made compatible. It is welcome that specific e-services to be covered are required to be published within six months of the Bill becoming law, and progress updates provided annually. The public outcry against corruption has brought forth some measures to eliminate rent seeking and lack of accountability from a government under pressure. Now, it must show sufficient political resolve to deliver.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/waiting-for-eservices/article2778211.ece
7,1,2012,Lessons from Yiwu,"The Chinese government's decision to step in to rescue two Indian businessmen from an ugly situation in Yiwu city of Zheijiang province was timely. The two were first held by local traders demanding to be repaid $1.58 million owed them by the Indians' absconding Yemeni employer. Later, after they were freed by a court, the traders surrounded their hotel, preventing them from leaving. The reluctance of Yiwu authorities to give the two Indians adequate protection and an incident involving an Indian diplomat giving consular assistance to them forced New Delhi to put out a strongly worded advisory “not to do business with Yiwu.” The annual bilateral trade between India and China is worth over $60 billion; nearly one-third of this comprises business deals in eastern China, where the Yiwu Market — one of the world's largest wholesale commodity markets — is located. Rightly, Beijing has taken Indian concerns seriously, promising action against five Yiwu traders in connection with the incident. But the two Indians will have to stay back and face court proceedings against them by the creditors, and the Indian advisory remains. The incident holds lessons for both sides. It underscores the urgent need for a non-government mechanism to mediate in such incidents. With the number of such disputes on the rise, intervention by Beijing or New Delhi each time cannot become the template for resolving them. It is surprising that despite the booming trade between the two countries, no joint trade body, such as a chamber of commerce exists, to which businessmen can take their problems, that could give advice on finding reliable business partners, run credit checks or provide legal assistance. A recently opened economic wing at the Indian Embassy in Beijing does not have a mandate to handle disputes, while the CII and FICCI have one representative each for all of China.
The Yiwu spat has also underlined that the high level of trade has done precious little to remove the mistrust that pervades the relationship between India and China at the popular level. This runs counter to the view — often quoted in the context of India-Pakistan relations — that healthy trade between two countries and the people-to-people interactions it generates builds goodwill and lobbies on both sides for improving bilateral relations. In truth, mistrust between the people of two countries is often a product of mistrust between the states involved. Trade by itself is no magic wand. If New Delhi and Beijing are serious about creating positive attitudes at a popular level, they must actively promote people-to-people interactions, and take steps on the ground, such as encouraging educational and cultural exchanges, and travel for tourism. They must also desist from propaganda against each other.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lessons-from-yiwu/article2781186.ece
7,1,2012,Energy and security,"Which should prevail, concerns of energy security or of national security? The row the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is now confronted with is between the Petroleum and Defence Ministries over security clearance for oil and gas exploration in eight blocks off the east coast and in the Andamans. These blocks are among the 34 that the Petroleum Ministry awarded under the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) last year to Indian and foreign companies. The blocks were auctioned only after securing clearance from the Naval headquarters, according to the Petroleum Ministry. Yet, after the blocks were awarded in early 2011, the Defence Ministry refused permission for exploration activity in three specific blocks as the Navy was using these seas for submarine manoeuvres and training. Though a truce was reached, with the Navy promising to review its stand and the Petroleum Ministry agreeing to demarcate no-go zones for exploration, the stand-off continued forcing the PMO to intervene. The Petroleum Ministry has complained that its credibility in the eyes of prospective investors in oil exploration is at stake.
Energy security is important but national security is paramount, and in any clash between the two, the latter has to prevail. If oil exploration activity encroaches into the Navy's training and operational theatres, there is absolutely no way that it can be permitted. That said, there was evidently a lack of application of mind by the Navy and the Defence Ministry in the first instance — that is, when the Petroleum Ministry referred the blocks to them before the auction. Having given permission, to retract it later and that too after the blocks were auctioned, is clearly not the right thing to do. The PMO has to question the Defence Ministry on this if only to ensure that such instances do not recur. As for the Petroleum Ministry, a lot of embarrassment could have been avoided if it had decided not to auction blocks that fall in defence-sensitive areas, such as the ones the Navy is now objecting to. The problem arises because after nine rounds of NELP, all the easy-to-tackle blocks have been contracted out and what remain are the difficult ones from a technological or security standpoint. Maybe, it is time for the Petroleum Ministry to go slow on the auctions, which have not attracted much foreign investment anyway, and to focus on regulating the blocks that have been already contracted. Auctioning newer blocks is, after all, not the only way to increase oil and gas output.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/energy-and-security/article2781187.ece
9,1,2012,Boosting research in India,"Once again, we hear the promise of boosting the money India spends on research and development (R&D) from the current level of less than one per cent of its GDP to two per cent. Most recently, this found expression in Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's inaugural address at the Indian Science Congress in Bhubaneswar. It bears recall that the Science and Technology Policy of 2003, unveiled by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, at that year's Science Congress, declared that the country's investment in s&t would be raised to at least two per cent of GDP by the end of the Tenth Plan (2002-07). In January 2007, Dr. Singh, inaugurating the Science Congress held at Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu, pushed the timeline for achieving that goal to “the next five years.” Now that those five years are up, the Prime Minister has extended the target date by another five years, with the goal to be met “by the end of the 12th Plan Period.” And so it goes on. India's R&D expenditure has risen from close to Rs.16,200 crore in 2000-01 to nearly Rs.37,800 crore seven years later, according to statistics published by Union Government's Department of Science and Technology. But in the face of a rapidly growing economy, such spending has remained at no more than 0.9 per cent of the GDP. China has clearly done much better, with its research outlay rising from 0.9 per cent of GDP in 2000 to 1.4 per cent by 2006 and reportedly making further progress after that.
The bulk of India's research funding continues to flow from the government. However, such funding as a proportion of the country's total R&D expenditure has fallen from over 80 per cent in 1990-91 to 66 per cent in 2007-08. Over the same period, research investments by business enterprises have risen from about 14 per cent to around 30 per cent. The pharmaceutical and automotive industries, in particular, have invested heavily. Besides, large multinationals and other foreign companies have been creating research facilities in India. According to one analyst, Reserve Bank of India data indicate that inflows of foreign exchange for R&D services have increased from $221 million in 2004-05 to $878 million in 2010-11. India's long-term competitiveness, however, rests on making sure that domestic industry does not lose out in the process. While the Prime Minister has called on industry to invest more in research, the government also needs to recognise its role in fostering indigenous capabilities. That requires making sure that the various arms of the government work together rather than at cross-purposes. This is something China appears to have mastered.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/boosting-research-in-india/article2785862.ece
9,1,2012,No Hungarian rhapsody,"Hungary's political reforms have sparked angry unrest and are also causing the European Union serious problems. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of the Federation of Young Democrats-Christian Democrat People's Party combine (Fidesz-KDNP) is using his two-thirds parliamentary majority to make sweeping constitutional changes, with extra support from the far-Right Jobbik party, the paramilitary wing of which has been involved in racist murders and other violence against Roma. Mr. Orbán said in 2006 that the “republic is only a cloak for the nation,” and the new constitution has a preamble that asserts the country's spiritual and intellectual unity. Other new laws define marriage as solely between a man and a woman, state the rights of the unborn child, and create a new electoral system, which critics say favours Fidesz. In addition, several Christian denominations lose tax exemptions, as do Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism. Above all, judicial independence has been undermined by powers whereby the government can replace judges; the public prosecutor will also choose judges for hearing cases. The press, for its part, will come under a government-appointed body with which all media outlets have to register and which has powers to fine or close them and to make them reveal sources.
These changes flagrantly violate EU law as well as universal principles of human rights, and are a huge embarrassment for Hungary's post-Cold War associates. The country held the EU presidency for the first half of 2011; it is also a member of the Council of Europe and of Nato. Yet the EU, not for the first time in a major political matter, looks helpless, as it is reluctant to apply sanctions under the Lisbon Treaty's Article 7 for serious breaches of the rule of law and respect for human rights. Budapest is ignoring all criticism, whether by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or by EU Commissioner Neelie Kroes. Even prospective financial sanctions are making no impression. If there are signs of hope, they are that tens of thousands of protesters have been out on the streets, and that highly developed internet use and broadband in Hungary are helping citizens to organise. Mr. Orbán, by exploiting a form of ethno-nationalism with fascist undertones, is exposing the hollowness of triumphalist proclamations of democracy, prosperity, and freedom that were made when the Soviet Union and its allies collapsed. No less than the core values of the European Union are on test and all those Hungarians who resist the Orbán-led onslaught deserve the world's support at this time.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-hungarian-rhapsody/article2785859.ece
10,1,2012,"A long, long way to go","Amid the efforts to talk to the Taliban in Afghanistan, concern is frequently expressed about the fate of Afghan women if the militants were to gain a role in running that country. But the real question is what progress has been made on women's rights since the fall of the Taliban. During the five years the Taliban reigned over Afghanistan from 1996, women were subjected to atrocities and repression of the kind the world thought had ended with the medieval ages. When they were ousted in 2001, much was made of the promise the moment held for Afghan women for the first time since the 1980s, when the country descended into war. But more than a decade later, and under the west-backed Hamid Karzai goverrnment, the ground situation has shown little improvement. The recent rescue of a 15-year-old girl held captive for months in a toilet by her in-laws who had broken her fingers, pulled out her finger nails, and tortured her for resisting their attempts to prostitute her is a chilling reality check on all the upbeat buzz about Afghan women participating in public life, being recruited in the armed forces, holding fashion shows, and attending pop music concerts. The brutal truth is that for a majority of women in Afghanistan, cultural norms of ‘honour' and ‘shame' and customary practices of using women to settle disputes, combined with the general lawlessness spawned by the prolonged conflict, have ensured a life of deep insecurity.
In 2009, the Karzai government enacted legislation called the Elimination of Violence Against Women (EVAW). This law, which identifies 22 kinds of violence against women and clearly states the duties and obligations of the Afghan police and government in implementing it, was claimed to be a game-changer. However, a recent report by the United Nations found that EVAW was applied to only 594 out of 2,299 complaints of violence against women registered by the Afghanistan human rights commission from March 2010 to March 2011. Out of those, indictments were filed only in 151 cases, while primary courts used EVAW to arrive at judgments in just about 100 cases. Most complaints were processed by family or village elders, often resulting in their withdrawal. The report said women were also discouraged from registering complaints, so the numbers do not reflect the correct picture. The last time Afghan women truly enjoyed a measure of equality with men was in the 1960s and 1970s. Given the dismal uncertainties of present-day Afghanistan, it seems unlikely that its women can even regain those limited freedoms any time in the near future, let alone lead 21st century lives.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-long-long-way-to-go/article2788541.ece
10,1,2012,Building sustainable habitats,"At a time when efforts should focus on enforcing existing codes to improve sustainability of habitats, the Union Ministry of Urban Development has decided to bring in new rules to address concerns related to climate change. It has taken the first step towards putting in place legally enforceable habitat standards to promote green urban development. Regulations and control measures are effective policy instruments, but new ones will matter little if nothing has been achieved with what already exists. The Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC), which could help reduce energy consumption by about 1.7 billion units of electricity a year, came into being four years ago. It remains voluntary, and is applicable only to large commercial buildings. Barring Orissa, no State has so far adopted it. Policymakers who argue that India has modelled itself on countries such as United Kingdom, which have kept the codes for sustainable buildings voluntary, are conveniently overlooking other innovations adopted by them to push their efforts forward. For instance, in the U.K., where about 42 per cent of all carbon emissions come from buildings, owners must produce Energy Performance Certificates of their properties put up for sale or rent. This helps buyers or tenants to choose efficient properties, which in turn ensures that the building design and construction are environmentally responsible.
In the absence of clear-cut emission targets in India, the goal posts for the proposed sustainable habitat standards remain unclear. This also raises the question of how to formulate regulation standards effectively. Metropolitan regions like Hamburg, the 2011 green capital of Europe with a population of 4.3 million, have shown that setting emission targets helps devise effective regulations and propel innovative urban schemes. Hamburg set an unambiguous goal to reduce CO2 emission by 40 per cent by 2020 from its 1990 base level and by 80 per cent by 2050. To achieve this, it adopted a mandatory energy-saving ordinance binding on its buildings, designed a public transport network that provided most citizens access within 300 metres of their place of stay, and created a 1,700 km bicycle lane network. The results are striking. The CO2 emissions are already down by 15 per cent. While comprehensive regulations and benchmarks are necessary, influencing major policy shifts to create sustainable habitats should be the priority. The thrust must be on making easy-to-implement codes at the local body level, and improve the supply of sustainable building technologies and materials.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/building-sustainable-habitats/article2788415.ece
11,1,2012,The BJP's own goal,"Within the space of a week the Bharatiya Janata Party admitted into the party and dropped dismissed Bahujan Samaj Party Minister Babu Singh Kushwaha. Mr. Kushwaha, an accused in the alleged multi-crore Uttar Pradesh health scam, made a show of resigning from the BJP's primary membership, an offer party chief Nitin Gadkari only too readily grabbed. But the setback of an own goal at this stage of the game is not so easily overcome. Indeed, the Kushwaha fiasco came at a time when the BJP had just about recovered from l'affaire Yeddyurappa and had gained a measure of credibility with its Lokpal campaign. Only days earlier, leaders of the Opposition in the two houses of Parliament, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley, had pulverised the Congress, accusing it of a lack of will to legislate against corruption. Mr. Jaitley had topped his accomplished act in the Rajya Sabha with witty coinages, among them “fleedom at midnight” — a reference to the late night adjournment of the House following the government's refusal to put the Lokpal legislation to vote. Razor-sharp and ready to kill, the principal Opposition party seemed finally to have returned to form. Reports from poll-bound Uttar Pradesh suggested a partial BJP recovery resulting from two factors: the erosion in Mayawati's forward caste support and Anna Hazare's anti-corruption campaign, which drew its strength essentially from the BJP's once-core voters.
But clearly the party of the Hindu Right wanted too much too soon. Even as it breathed fire on corruption, it admitted a clutch of corruption-tainted Ministers from the BSP. Mr. Gadkari assumed that Mr. Kushwaha's OBC origins would neutralise the perceived corruption. It turned out that the party chief had not bargained for the fiery Uma Bharti, the BJP's one-time OBC mascot and current Chief Minister hopeful. Apprehending a threat to her OBC turf, Ms Bharti led a protest that threatened to consume the party. Worse, against the backdrop of Mr. Kushwaha's induction, the BJP's fight against corruption appeared hollow and stage-managed. In one stroke, Mr. Gadkari had made nonsense of Mr. Jaitley's sterling performance in Parliament. The snowballing protests and knee-jerk reactions aside, the Kushwaha episode raises fundamental questions about the BJP and its leadership. What is the party's strategy for the next general election? Can it afford to continue to be guided by Mr. Gadkari, whose surface charm and geniality have scarcely masked his inexperience in dealing with realpolitik? The BJP was banking on a reasonable showing in U.P. to gain momentum ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election. The party will have only itself to blame if that dream goes up in smoke.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-BJPs-own-goal/article13369634.ece
11,1,2012,A step closer to HIV prevention,"Time and again, HIV vaccine trials have proved right the dictum, ‘monkeys lie and mice do not always tell the truth'. Positive results in animals did not translate into good outcome in humans. However, the results of a recent study in rhesus monkeys show greater promise of protective effects getting replicated in humans. The study was published in Nature (“Vaccine protection against acquisition of neutralization-resistant SIV challenges in rhesus monkeys,” by Dan H. Barouch et al.). Monkeys get infected not with HIV but only with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which is distantly related to its human counterpart. So the monkeys were primed with SIV vaccine and then given a boost six months later. Vaccines with different combinations of genetically engineered SIV genes were tested. At the end of one year after priming, the animals were exposed to the virus six times. While 75 per cent of animals that did not receive a vaccine (control group) got infected after the first exposure, only 12 per cent of those that received the best vaccine did. And, at the end of six exposures, while all the controls got infected, only a majority of the vaccinated monkeys did. The best vaccine produced 80 per cent reduction in the “probability” of infection per exposure. Most importantly, the trial proved its ability to produce partial protection against a virulent, tough-to-neutralise strain that is different from the one used in making the vaccine.
Aside from protecting the monkeys, the vaccine was also effective in reducing the viral load in those infected. Although the precise mechanism responsible for preventing SIV infection is yet to be determined, the requirements for achieving the primary endpoint in monkeys have been found to be very different from those for reducing the viral load. Only those animals that produced high levels of ‘envelope' antibodies (in response to the Env antigen in the vaccine) remained free of infection. So critical was the inclusion of the Env antigen that the protection conferred was extended even to the virus that differed from the vaccine strain. Different immune responses against the ‘envelope' antigen and another antigen (Gag) were responsible for reducing the viral load. Incidentally, the importance of Env antigen was brought out earlier by the 2009 human Phase III Thai trial (RV144), which produced modest protection of 31 per cent. Volunteers who had produced high levels of antibodies against the Env antigen remained infection-free. There is room for cautious optimism that designing an effective HIV vaccine may become possible if the vital clues from the latest study are wisely utilised.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-step-closer-to-hiv-prevention/article2790917.ece
12,1,2012,ANC at 100,"The African National Congress celebrated 100 years on January 8. Its story, from its beginnings as a peaceful liberation movement against the British and Boer (Dutch) colonisers of South Africa, to a militant group that fought apartheid, the abhorrent system of legalised racial segregation, to a party that oversaw a successful transition to a post-apartheid South Africa in a spirit of reconciliation with its white oppressors, is a truly inspiring epic of modern humankind. Even at the height of its armed struggle, the ANC — the oldest political party in Africa, which worked hand in hand with a small but vibrant and upstanding Communist Party — was clear it was fighting for a South Africa where black and white could live as equals. Perhaps the only parallel to the iconic leadership of Nelson Mandela, marked by a total commitment to the struggle, his act of political generosity towards the hated white rulers as South Africa stood at the cusp of liberation, and the absence of vengeance and vendetta in his ideology, is Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent struggle for India's independence. But to consider the century-long existence of the ANC is also to face the reality of man's inhumanity against man, not in some distant bygone time, but as recently as two decades ago. That the post-War world order allowed a full 13 years to pass after South Africa enacted the first apartheid laws in 1949 before adopting a resolution in the United Nations against apartheid speaks volumes about the double standards rife then, as they are today. India can take pride in its solidarity with the ANC through those years: it was the first country to cut off trade ties with South Africa. It campaigned to keep South Africa out of the Commonwealth, and constantly highlighted the issue of apartheid on the world stage.
It is true that the ANC's 17 years in government have led to some loss of sheen. Recent years have seen it dogged by allegations of corruption and cronyism. The economy has slowed down; unemployment and poverty remain big challenges. South Africa was also badly damaged by the HIV-AIDS denialism of Thabo Mbeki, who succeeded Nelson Mandela as President (1999-2008). But on the whole the lot of the majority black population has improved dramatically. South Africa boasts the world's most progressive Constitution. Successive governments have spent significant resources in delivering basics — schooling, water, housing, and electricity. In its foreign relations, South Africa has attempted to keep its independence. The bottom line is that the country is a much better place today than it was before 1994, and South Africa and the world have the ANC to thank for this. As the dominant political force, it also bears a lot of responsibility for the country's future.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/anc-at-100/article2793427.ece
12,1,2012,Auto focus,"It is a biennial jamboree that generates a lot of excitement among automobile enthusiasts, the media and industry, and the 11 edition of Auto Expo held in New Delhi was no different. The gloom that pervades the global economy and the fog that has enveloped the auto industry in India in the form of slowing sales due to high finance and fuel costs did little to spoil the party. With an estimated 1,500 participants — vehicle manufacturers, component suppliers and service providers — from 24 countries exhibiting their wares, there was enough and more for the large crowds that thronged the venue at Pragati Maidan. More than 50 new products — passenger cars, two-wheelers and buses/trucks — were unveiled during the show. Except for the President and CEO of Ford Motor Company, Alan Mulally, none of the marquee names turned up. This was indeed surprising given that all the big automobile companies have a major presence in India, which is touted as the market of the future especially for passenger cars. This perhaps had to with the scheduling of the expo during the annual holiday season, or with the troubles that most of the big companies are embroiled in.
The brave show of enthusiasm notwithstanding, the fact remains that the automobile industry is up against stiff challenges on multiple fronts. The high interest rates on car loans and rising petrol prices are pulling down sales. Sales growth of all categories of vehicles put together plunged by more than half, to 13 per cent in the first eight months of the current fiscal compared to the same period last year. Not surprisingly, cars have been hit the most with growth rate winding down to zero from 32 per cent. The possibility of the government imposing a higher tax on diesel cars to correct the distortion in sales pattern due to the wide gap between petrol and diesel prices is a source of anxiety. Some of the manufacturers have invested in diesel engine plants while others are all set to do so. For those who have set up large capacities with an eye on exports, the poor state of infrastructure in ports and connectivity is cause for concern. In addition, labour unrest in some automobile hubs, notably Gurgaon/Manesar and to some extent in Chennai/Bangalore, is also weighing down the industry. There is little doubt the government has to play a big supportive role if that enormous long-term potential of this industry is to be realised. Indeed, government support is the sine qua non for the party to continue in the next edition of Auto Expo in 2014.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/auto-focus/article2793428.ece
13,1,2012,Cameron risks the union,"David Cameron's proposal for a referendum on Scottish independence might have caught opponents as well as allies by surprise. At first sight, the British Prime Minister seems to be setting the terms for the play on this issue. He appears to be outmanoeuvring Scotland's First Minister, Alex Salmond, by offering him what he wants, but with conditions; Mr. Salmond's Scottish National Party (SNP), which holds an absolute majority with 69 of the 129 seats in Scottish Parliament, is committed to a referendum on independence. The catch is that the outcome will be binding provided the U.K. parliament at Westminster and the devolved regional chamber at Holyrood in Edinburgh agree to it and provided the plebiscite occurs within the next 18 months. If held after that, the result would be only advisory. It also suits Mr. Cameron that Scottish public opinion is currently running at 32 per cent for independence; there is more support in Scotland for stronger devolved powers within the U.K. In addition, the 18-month deadline would enable a binding referendum to be held a year before the iconic 700th anniversary of the battle of Bannockburn, in which a Scottish army defeated a larger English one. Furthermore, Mr. Salmond cannot reject a referendum and is trying to influence the argument by insisting on a date late in 2014.
But Mr. Cameron's gambit is also high-risk. As he has not consulted the other pro-union parties, in particular Labour and the Liberal Democrats, it is unclear if he aims to preserve the union or merely score party-political points against the SNP. The majority of Scottish voters have backed the centre-left since the mid-1980s. Mr. Salmond has drawn on widespread resentment of Westminster dominance without slipping into ethno-nationalism; for example, SNP Members of the Scottish Parliament have taken their oath of office in Urdu, Italian, Gaelic, and English. Mr. Cameron might have played into the SNP's hands by provoking Scots to accuse him of interfering in their nation's affairs; they are also angry about his choice of Lord Forsyth, a former Cabinet Minister for Scotland who is very unpopular north of the border, to put the argument for a referendum. Constitutionally, only Westminster can legislate for Scottish independence, but it remains the case that no British parliament can bind its successor. That in turn means that even if the Prime Minister forestalls Scottish independence now, he could well generate enough opposition in Scotland to ensure the dissolution of the United Kingdom in the not inconceivable future. Ironically, Mr. Cameron leads what used to call itself the Conservative and Unionist Party.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/cameron-risks-the-union/article2796287.ece
13,1,2012,For the government,"Significant changes in regulation such as those relating to the capital market should, as far as possible, be for the common benefit of the regulated. They should not be framed so as to favour just one or few parties, however influential the latter might be. This salutary principle has evidently not been kept in mind when the capital market regulator recently authorised two additional methods of accessing the capital market. On the face of it, the two methods — Institutional Placement Programme (IPP) and Offer for Sale of Shares through the stock exchanges — offer companies flexible, cost-effective and less time-consuming options for accessing the capital market, specifically to meet the minimum public shareholding norms. But, although SEBI has not restricted these to public sector companies, it is obvious that the move is primarily intended to boost the prospects of the government's disinvestment programme. Government finances are strained at this juncture. Aggregate public borrowing during the year is slated to exceed the budget target by Rs.93,000 crore. The public sector disinvestment programme, with a target of Rs.40,000 crore, has hardly made a beginning. The markets are subdued, and fresh share issues made in conventional ways are unlikely to fetch the right price. Should it disinvest now, the government will be accused of selling family silver cheap.
With hardly three months to go, the government is evidently driven by a sense of urgency to raise revenue. Some recent policy moves affecting the external economy — such as freeing interest rates on non-resident deposits and providing greater leeway for overseas borrowings — will have the effect of raising the level of short-term external debt and are, therefore, inconsistent with medium-term policy objectives. SEBI's recent guidelines would enable the government to take one more short-cut. The IPP route will obviate the need for a government company to undertake a block deal or a follow-on offer for sale, such as the one made by CoaI India, to meet the listing guidelines. A handful of government companies will be able to place up to 10 per cent of their equity with institutional investors. The government might get the sale proceeds before March 31, but the retail investor will lose out since he will be totally bypassed. Successive finance ministers have waxed eloquent on making ordinary investors the bedrock of the disinvestment process and widening the ownership-base of public sector enterprises. Whatever the justification, it is clear that SEBI's new guidelines do not serve the interests of even the disinvestment process.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/for-the-government/article2796286.ece
14,1,2012,Over the top,"‘Colourful' is a word much associated with elections in India. The Election Commission of India has just reinforced that association, and also given new meaning to that phrase ‘pink elephants' — no longer is it an allusion only to alcohol-induced visions, or the fantasy land of ‘Dear Jessie' in the Madonna song. But seriously, can there be the slightest doubt that the EC's order to cover up all statues of Chief Minister Mayawati and those of the elephant, her Bahujan Samaj Party's election symbol, in election-bound Uttar Pradesh with the politically neutral pink-coloured cloth or plastic sheets falls in the OTT category? The order is supposed to “ensure that these statues do not influence the minds of the electors, disturbing the level playing field” during the election. What the cover-up has done is to ensure much more attention to the OTT statues than they would have received otherwise. There are other misgivings. The EC's order goes back to a 2009 petition asking it to freeze the BSP's election symbol on the ground that the statues, being put up at the time at public spaces using public funds, would jeopardise free and fair elections. Disposing of that petition in 2010, the Commission — whose mandate to enforce the model code of conduct does not kick in until the election schedule is announced — promised to take “appropriate steps” at election time to ensure that the statues would not give the BSP an “unfair advantage” over other parties. For the 2004 general election, it had ordered the covering up of hoardings of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee on national highways refurbished by the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government. The January 8 order is even more bizarre.
Let us consider the argument that the decision to erect permanent stone images of the BSP's symbol using public funds was a deliberate and pre-planned act by Chief Minister Mayawati, and hence needs to be neutralised. The problem is that there are no legal grounds to stop the BSP, or any other party, from erecting in non-election season its symbols or statues of its leaders all over the country. Especially in States that have produced charismatic mass leaders, there are countless statues of icons that the fortunate parties, whether in government or in the opposition, can play up during election season. Not that there is any persuasive evidence that this makes a real difference to poll outcomes. Petitions against the Mayawati government questioning the use of public funds for self-serving partisan ends are pending before the Allahabad High Court and the Supreme Court of India. What the Election Commission must learn to do is understand the limits of its power, even in election season, keep off the grass, and leave the matter to the people's court.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Over-the-top/article13364890.ece
14,1,2012,"Saving people, and tigers","The distressing incident of a tiger killing a farmer and devouring part of the cadaver in Maharashtra's Yavatmal district highlights the need for scientific efforts to reduce conflicts between people and wild animals. Encounters between tigers and humans are likely to occur in less than one per cent of the country's geographical area today. Tiger numbers have dwindled because they were hunted down either as dangerous vermin that stood in the way of expansion of agriculture or as prized trophies. In spite of legal protection, poaching remains a threat. Also, habitat capable of supporting the large cats has shrunk and become increasingly fragmented. Yet some communities living close to forests face conflicts. It is important to understand that man-eating is not a widespread phenomenon, and the species generally avoids human encounters. Some tigers do get involved in opportunistic attacks and may begin stalking humans as normal prey. Man-eating is more common in the Sunderbans, where such attacks are often by more than one tiger. The answer to this human-tiger conflict lies in good conservation science and in mitigation measures that help people co-exist with the carnivores at the landscape level.
To many scientists, the most effective interventions to achieve a reduction in attacks by tigers are those designed to eliminate human pressures on the habitat. Relocation of people from tiger territory with handsome compensatory packages is a superior alternative to crisis management techniques that invariably follow attacks. Problems in voluntary relocation such as lack of alternative land, corruption, and cultural factors do persist, but suitable incentives can persuade more forest residents to move out. It may still be necessary to use lethal methods to remove some problem tigers in order to avoid widespread retaliatory actions by villagers. Protective fencing of habitations is sometimes advocated, but as studies by independent and Project Tiger researchers show, encounters take place mostly in free-ranging situations, particularly in forests where villagers graze livestock. All this makes it clear that it is vital to maintain a strong prey base within the habitat. This can ensure that wild tigers do not seek out cattle. Connectivity between forest fragments free of habitations also needs to be ensured. India now has far fewer tigers than leopards. Unlike the spotted cats, they do not adapt themselves well to the presence of humans nearby. Both species are involved in conflicts, but tigers are less resilient. Creating wider undisturbed habitat will benefit both.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Saving-people-and-tigers/article13364869.ece
17,1,2012,Behind the cricket collapse,"Indian cricket is at a critical juncture. The innings defeat in Perth — the seventh successive Test loss overseas, caused by another failure of the batting in the face of consistent, quality bowling — was an illustration of how far the former World No.1 has fallen. It was not just that India was stripped of its crown in England; the abjectness of the performances in these seven Tests has made people wonder how on earth the honour was earned in the first place. That is an unfair view. In the decade since the turn of the millennium, India under Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble, and M.S. Dhoni added another string to its bow. Traditionally very difficult to beat at home, India began to travel assuredly. Series wins in Pakistan, the West Indies, England, and New Zealand materialised; there were also defining drawn series in Australia and South Africa, the first to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, the second to hold on to the No.1 ranking. India began 2011 with a Caribbean win, but gloom descended thereafter. Unlike in England, where injuries mitigated the dejection of defeat slightly, there has been no place to turn to for comfort in Australia. For the current squad is India's best at the moment; the critical mass, the great batsmen and the bowling spearhead, hasn't changed greatly from the team that had success abroad in the previous decade.
This, however, isn't a time for panic. Annihilation can be dispiriting, but it cleanses the mind, creates space for renewal. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be the case with the BCCI, judging from the tenor of the Board's awards ceremony in Chennai (where there was no reference to the 4-0 drubbing in England) and other indications. When England suffered a clean sweep in Australia, it commissioned the Schofield Report; when Australia then lost the Ashes at home, it put in place the Argus Review. There was systemic change, envisioned and executed by passionate, intelligent, thoughtful people. Thus far the reaction of India's cricket administration has been near-sighted. India got to No.1 because a group of extraordinarily skilled, singularly determined cricketers rose above the system. But dominance was always going to be beyond them; it required the next generation, developed in a world-class structure and transitioned seamlessly into Test cricket. But the BCCI wasn't proactive. Several long-term issues remain as a result. The most important is the quality of pitches domestic cricket is played on, for this has the most direct influence on bowlers and batsmen. The very structure of domestic cricket and the priorities in scheduling the three formats also need rethinking. In the short term, a transition needs planning. It will be a test of the Board's intent and intelligence, and a portent of India's cricket future.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Behind-the-cricket-collapse/article13368539.ece
17,1,2012,Anniversary of shame,"The United States's infamous detention centre at Guantánamo Bay on the island of Cuba recently marked the 10 anniversary of its founding. When the camp opened, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld called the detainees the “worst of the worst.” Among them were 21 children, a man aged 89, and naive young men like the German of Turkish descent studying among Koranic scholars in Pakistan. In all, 779 people have been held, at one time or another, in the enclave and have been treated in ways no civilised society should tolerate. Detainees were chained in tiny cages exposed to the searing sun, and repeatedly tortured. No fewer than 171 are still held, each at a cost of $800,000 a year. According to U.S. official data, 92 per cent of the 779 had nothing to do with al-Qaida, and the majority have been released without charge or trial. But all have been tortured by U.S. security forces or those of other countries, including member-states of the European Union. Shockingly, a substantial number of the detainees were sold into captivity for Washington's $3,000-a-head bounty; often someone local officials did not like was handed over, as were people involved in personal feuds. One al-Jazeera cameraman was held and grilled for information on his employers.
Washington's claim that conditions at Guantánamo are now better is no defence. Only six inmates have been convicted, and that too in military courts, which work to lower standards of proof than civilian ones. The Obama administration attempted to hold trials in normal courts on the U.S. mainland, but congressional hostility dissuaded the President, and Congress has now legislated for indefinite military detention. It has also blocked the transfer of inmates to other countries, so the 89 cleared for release face indefinite imprisonment. The U.S. Supreme Court, after ruling that detainees could file for habeas corpus, has effectively been overruled by the subordinate District of Columbia Circuit appeal court, which has refused the appellants permission to challenge official records. The superior court has declined to intervene. The congressional refusal to allow civilian trials stems mainly from fear of acquittals, and even the small number of detainees who are genuine suspects will not get such trials; in any case, evidence of torture would almost certainly result in acquittal. Guantánamo's 10 year is an anniversary of shame; moreover, even U.S. officials admit that the camp's very existence helps terrorist groups get new recruits.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Anniversary-of-shame/article13368538.ece
18,1,2012,The General and the labyrinth,"The controversy over the age of General V.K. Singh, the subject of an already heated and often unseemly public debate, is now threatening to get out of hand. With the Army Chief left with no resort but to challenge the Defence Ministry in the Supreme Court in order to “protect his integrity and honour,” the issue has the makings of an unseemly civilian-military confrontation that could easily have been avoided had plain common sense prevailed over bureaucratic thick-headedness. There are a slew of documents — including a birth certificate and a school-leaving certificate — that prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that General Singh, whose father as well as grandfather were Army officers, was born on May 10, 1951. This is the date of birth recorded in the office of the Adjutant General, the Army's official record-keeper. The controversy has arisen because the Military Secretary — another wing of Army Headquarters that maintains personal records relating to postings, transfers, and promotions — records him as having been born on May 10, 1950. General Singh has been at pains to explain that the latter date, gleaned from an application form for entrance to the National Defence Academy when he was only 14 years old, was a mistake committed by a teacher of his. He has also revealed that the discrepancy was raised with two predecessor Army Chiefs — but, strangely and for reasons the Defence Ministry has not yet disclosed, to no avail.
A brave and highly decorated officer, General Singh is recognised as a brilliant strategist and a reform-minded leader who is tough on corruption, as reflected in the hard line he adopted against erring officers in the Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society scam. The mudslinging and insinuations intended to portray him as someone fiddling with his birth date to hang on to the power and privileges of high office must be rejected with contempt. One major reason why his year of birth has become such a hot potato is that the date of his retirement will have a bearing on who will succeed him as Army Chief. By refusing to accede to General Singh's request to correct the official record on the basis of documented fact, the Defence Ministry has shown astonishing short-sightedness, and in the process tread on a proud soldier's sense of honour. Even now, rather than fight for a bad cause in the highest court in the land, a disputation that could have a bearing on the Army's morale, the government should backtrack and come up with a constructive solution. By conceding General Singh's just case and treating him with the respect and honour that are his due, it should be able to clear the decks for a smooth succession to the post he occupies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-general-and-the-labyrinth/article2808807.ece
18,1,2012,Polio – the fight must go on,"It is sobering to look back and recall that three decades ago tens of thousands of children in this country, many of them infants, were being crippled, even killed, by polio each year. The fight to vaccinate and protect our little ones from this dreadful condition has been long and hard; mistakes have been made, and lessons learnt. No Indian child was recorded as having fallen victim to the disease in the past year. Surveillance laboratories are carefully testing stool samples from children as well as sewage, making sure that naturally occurring wild forms of the polio-causing virus are not circulating. Once that has been ascertained, India will be taken off the list of endemic countries. Currently, there are four countries in the list collectively known by the acronym PAIN (Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, and Nigeria). As the other 10 countries in the World Health Organisation's South-East Asian Region have already broken transmission, the process of certifying the whole region as free of indigenous, wild viruses two years' hence can begin. The Americas, Europe, and Western Pacific regions have already been certified as such.
India cannot lower its guard in the matter of immunising its children against polio for a considerable time to come. Even if the wild virus is no longer circulating in India, there is always the risk of an imported strain sneaking in. Wild polio transmission persists in six countries; every one of them except Angola had more cases in 2011 than in 2010. That includes Pakistan and Afghanistan. Last year, another nine countries, including China, were fighting outbreaks caused by imported viruses. At this stage, it is not clear when the wild virus will be vanquished globally. Nor are wild viruses the only problem. The oral vaccines, which have been successfully deployed to battle polio in India and other developing countries, are based on live but weakened forms of the virus. From time to time, those vaccine strains revert to virulence, becoming potentially as dangerous as their wild counterparts. The endgame in polio will therefore need a carefully planned strategy to discontinue the oral vaccine without giving room for the disease to come roaring back. Such a strategy could well involve introducing the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which uses killed viruses and is injected. The government must now seriously address these endgame issues. The sort of short-sightedness that led it to shut down a public sector IPV plant being established with French technical assistance in Gurgaon in the early 1990s is impermissible. The goal of freeing ourselves from all polio viruses can be achieved only by resolutely following a clear, well-considered strategy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Polio-%E2%80%93-the-fight-must-go-on/article13369754.ece
19,1,2012,Stand up for Salman Rushdie,"Salman Rushdie is one of the world's great novelists. It is a disgrace that an unlawful fatwa, issued by the seminary Darul Uloom Deoband, has created a haze of uncertainty over his participation in the Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF). Instead of dismissing the fatwa with the contempt it deserves and declaring that adequate security would be provided to Mr. Rushdie and for the safe conduct of the festival, the central and Rajasthan governments have adopted an attitude that is opaque and obfuscatory. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has conceded that Mr. Rushdie, who has a Person of Indian Origin (PIO) card that permits visa-free travel, cannot be prevented from coming to the State's capital. But he has also said that his government, which did not want a law and order problem, had informed the Centre of the “prevailing sentiments” about the writer's visit. Reports that the State government had prevailed on the JLF to cancel the invitation to Mr. Rushdie were followed by his scheduled events being taken off its website. However, the organisers have announced that they stood by their invitation.
Following the Deobandi fatwa, an odd bag of politicians, clerics, and fundamentalist organisations — one of which offered Rs.1 lakh to anyone who hurled a shoe at him — has attempted to revive the discredited old issue of injuring Muslim sentiments. The proximity of these orchestrated protests to the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections gives the game away. The Booker Prize-winning novelist has made several visits to India following Ayatollah Khomeni's infamous fatwa of February 14, 1989 and the cowardly proscription of his novel The Satanic Verses in India; significantly, his visit to the inaugural edition of the JLF in 2007 passed without a hint of trouble. As the Supreme Court of India has underlined in a series of verdicts, including the landmark Ore Oru Gramathile judgment, it is absolutely vital that public authorities protect the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression in the face of intolerance and not resort to bans in the name of upholding law and order. Deoband may be one of Asia's largest seminaries but it has a record of staking out reactionary positions on a variety of issues. The Congress-led governments at the Centre and in Rajasthan should have sent a clear and strong signal that they would not allow Mr. Rushdie's visit to be sabotaged by those who feigned anger and hurt with an eye to a supposedly communal vote bank. It is an insult to the intelligence and good sense of India's 160 million-strong Muslim community to make out that it wants a prodigiously gifted writer, born in a Muslim family, to be treated as persona non grata in the land of his birth.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Stand-up-for-Salman-Rushdie/article13379233.ece
19,1,2012,Playing the communal card,"In the age of Baba Ramdev and countless other copycat dispensers of yogasanas, it will hardly be seen as an aberration if school and college administrations decide to promote yoga among students. However, when yoga as a popular trend becomes yoga by diktat, as happened recently in Madhya Pradesh where the Bharatiya Janata Party government mobilised support for mass surya namaskar camps, the exercise does acquire a divisive subtext. The ostensible purpose of these camps, which saw heavy participation by schools, colleges, and other organisations — many of them privately run and obviously feeling compelled to go along — was to get into the record books. Yet questions do arise when the entire State Cabinet led by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan makes a fetish of performing a particular asana that is known to cause unease among Muslims, including secular sections otherwise supportive of yoga. The surya namaskar carries with it a suggestion of sun worship, which is anathema to orthodox Muslims. Indeed, the pattern was set in 2007 when the State government sought to make yoga — and surya namaskar — compulsory in schools.
The pressure eased only after the Madhya Pradesh High Court ruled against compulsory enlisting for yoga. Earlier in 2007, the State government had controversially made the singing of Vande Mataram compulsory. Ahead of the surya namaskar mobilisation this year, the government secured presidential assent for a draconian law against cow slaughter, which was followed by reports of attacks on Muslims. Clearly, a stint in power and more than a decade of coalitional leadership have not changed the BJP, whose single preoccupation is Hindu sectarian politics. Matters have been made worse by the Congress' emulation of the BJP's communal politics — in reverse. With just a day to go for the announcement of the February-March 2011 State elections, the party blatantly unveiled a 4.5 per cent sub-quota for minorities. Subsequently, Law and Minority Affairs Minister Salman Khursheed offered a further blandishment to the U.P. Muslims in the form of a promise to carve out a nine per cent quota for minorities within the 27 per cent reserved for the OBCs. The move earned the Minister a well-deserved rap on the knuckles from the Election Commission. But it also provided a handle to a combative Uma Bharti who seized it to raise the bogey of “a second partition.” As long as the BJP and the Congress feed off each other, India cannot hope to shed its debilitating communal baggage.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Playing-the-communal-card/article13370963.ece
20,1,2012,Way forward in Sri Lanka,"President Mahinda Rajapaksa's reiteration — in his recent meeting with External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna — of his commitment to the “13th Amendment plus” approach to solving the nation's Tamil question is to be welcomed, although it is only from Mr. Krishna that we know about this in the present instance. Of course, the President has articulated this commitment several times before, including in an interview to The Hindu in 2009. But what proponents of an early political settlement, including India, are concerned about is that more than two years after the LTTE's defeat by the Sri Lankan military, the country has made little progress in that direction. In the post-war period, as Mr. Rajapaksa moved to consolidate his political gains and the government made progress on rehabilitation, it was expected that he would also swiftly seek political closure to the decades-long ethnic issue. Indeed, the government has given several indications of its seriousness about a political settlement. It initiated talks with the Tamil National Alliance, the political representatives of the Tamil minority. It also set up a parliamentary select committee to discuss a political solution. The relaxation of the Emergency in 2011 was also an encouraging sign. The government sought to address international concerns about civilian casualties and human rights violations in the last phase of the war in 2009 by appointing the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, which has identified some areas for further action by the government. And yet, there has been little by way of concrete movement forward on the Tamil question.
Given President Rajapaksa's apparent conviction that the 13th Amendment should form the basis for a political settlement, it is time for him to move towards the specifics. Thus far, there has been articulation only about those subjects the government is unwilling to devolve, that is, police powers and land administration. The “plus” appears to be a reference to an upper house — a Senate — representing all the provinces. The Parliamentary Select Committee, which the government hopes to make the mechanism for drafting a political package, should not go the way of previous committees which did not lead to any substantive outcomes, but rather became a forum for sections opposed to a settlement. As the main representatives of the Tamils, the TNA should not shy away — or be discouraged by extremist elements in the community — from playing a constructive role in this process. Aside from allaying Tamil apprehensions about the heavy military presence in Jaffna and the rest of the region, the government must plan to hold early provincial elections in the North.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Way-forward-in-Sri-Lanka/article13379221.ece
20,1,2012,FDI in the sky,"The Union Cabinet is set to decide on permitting foreign airlines to pick up 49 per cent equity in domestic carriers. Under the existing rules, foreign investors, other than airline companies, can invest up to 49 per cent in domestic airlines. The move to liberalise the norm has to be seen in the context of the financial troubles that most domestic airline companies are embroiled in, none more than Air India and Kingfisher. The thinking appears to be that easing the norm will enable these troubled airline operators to attract equity investment from foreign carriers. Though this is an infinitely better option than a bailout using public funds, the reality is that there might not be too many takers among foreign airline companies for this. The first reactions from some of them such as Lufthansa, Emirates and Singapore Airlines, purported to have been interested in investing in domestic carriers, only confirm this. They have all said that there is no immediate plan to invest in airline companies in India nor is it an important part of their future plans. Air Asia, a Malaysia-based low-cost operator, has gone a step forward and said that it would rather set up a subsidiary in India than invest in an existing carrier.
Offering 49 per cent equity to foreign airlines is obviously no magic wand to ward off the problems the airline industry is enmeshed in. It might probably help one of the most troubled operators to seek a partner but again, there is no guarantee on that. If the government is keen to rescue the airline industry, there are other things that it could do. It could, for a start, rationalise taxes and duties on aviation turbine fuel, which are at ridiculously high levels. Soaring oil prices have made fuel expensive and the high taxes only add to the burden. Fuel being the biggest item of cost for airlines, any relief on that front will be welcome. Secondly, we need a regulator who will keep his eyes open for sharp anti-competitive practices such as cut-throat fare setting by some players forcing the others to join in a fatal race to the bottom. Thirdly, applications to fly short-haul international routes should be cleared quickly, especially where there is room to do so under bilateral agreements. It is quite possible that despite all such assistance there will still be some airline companies that cannot be rescued mainly due to mismanagement or faulty decisions made in the past. Though it might be tempting to go to their aid with financial assistance, it will be best to leave them to their devices. The last thing the government should do is throw good money after bad, especially when it belongs to the public.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/FDI-in-the-sky/article13372318.ece
21,1,2012,The Lokayukta deception,"In an extraordinary judgment that must count among the sharpest indictments ever handed out to any State government, the Gujarat High Court has upheld Governor Kamla Beniwal's appointment of Justice R.A. Mehta as the Lokayukta over objections by Narendra Modi and his Council of Ministers. The single judge bench of Justice V.M. Sahai ruled that, although the Governor was otherwise required to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, she had become obliged to exercise her discretionary powers in this case, because it fell in the rarest of rare category where a “spiteful” Chief Minister and his “brazen” and “irrational” Council of Ministers had put democracy in peril by obstructing the appointment of the Lokayukta. The Gujarat government has expectedly moved the Supreme Court against the judgment. Regardless of the final outcome, what clearly emerges is the divergence between the Bharatiya Janata Party's strongly argued theoretical position in favour of a powerful and independent anti-corruption ombudsman, and the wilful disrespect shown to the same institution by one of its own Chief Ministers — a man showcased as a model chief executive at that.
The Gujarat Lokayukta has been headless since 2003, thanks to a protracted battle over the choice of nominee that saw Mr. Modi ranged against the Governor and the Chief Justice of the High Court. Mr. Modi not only insistently contested the primacy of opinion implicitly granted to the Chief Justice by the Gujarat Lokayukta Act, 1986, but remained stuck on a single name: Justice J.R. Vora, who figured in the panel initially proposed by the Chief Justice, but who subsequently rendered himself ineligible by virtue of his May 2010 appointment as a director of the Gujarat State Judicial Academy. The Chief Minister's intransigence unavoidably led to a situation of confrontation with the Chief Justice, who, after factoring in the State government's objections to Justice Mehta, concluded that he was a better choice for the office. Significantly, one of Mr. Modi's objections to Mr. Mehta was that he took part in a public hearing critical of the Gujarat Government's rehabilitation measures for the victims of the 2002 anti-Muslim pogrom. The High Court ruling has admittedly raised genuine concerns about federalism and copycat activism by other State Governors. And yet the BJP cannot easily turn this into a case of Central overreach, ignoring Mr. Modi's own disregard of institutional due process. After all, who can overlook the ironic coincidence of the BJP joining forces with Anna Hazare at a time when its own government in Gujarat was giving shape to a Lokayukta ordinance that ousted the Chief Justice from the consultation process, appointing instead the Chief Minister as the chairperson of the selection committee?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-Lokayukta-deception/article13373859.ece
21,1,2012,Restore our lost heritage,"If the fire that ravaged parts of the 18th century Kalas Mahal in Chennai this week is symptomatic of the callousness with which we treat precious heritage buildings in this country, the eagerness of the Tamil Nadu Minister concerned to demolish what remains of it suggests a disregard for history and aesthetics that is, quite simply, monumental. What is happening in Chennai is indicative of the state of heritage conservation in the country. At a time when the Archaeological Survey of India is celebrating its 150th anniversary, doubts about the protection of the Taj Mahal still persist. Many monuments have gone mysteriously missing as in Delhi. Varanasi, one of India's ancient cities, is yet to be comprehensively conserved. The greatest concern of all is the future of 700,000 unprotected heritage structures spread across many cities. As important as protected monuments, these buildings are the most vulnerable since they are in use and do not have sufficient legal protection.
Home to about 600 heritage structures, Chennai is notorious for losing its historic buildings to mysterious fires. Kalas Mahal is the fifth victim. What lies damaged, if not entirely lost, is an important piece of Indian history. The Kalas Mahal along with its adjoining structure, Humayun Mahal, is an early example of Indo-Saracenic architecture. A hybrid building style that combined Hindu and Saracenic elements originated here, spread across the country to reach Ajmer and Baroda, among other places, and eventually influenced the architecture of New Delhi. When the British took over this palace from the Nawab of Arcot in 1859, they enhanced its architectural importance and creatively used it as a public office. Unfortunately, post-Independence, this nationally significant complex was neglected. Had these buildings been properly retrofitted, much of the damage could have been prevented. Chief Minister Jayalalithaa has done well to intervene and stop the Public Works Department from hastily demolishing the Kalas Mahal. The committee she has constituted to study the condition of the building should do a scientific analysis, with nationally respected conservation experts leading the decision-making. It should also look at the entire building complex, and come up with a comprehensive plan to highlight the heritage value of the place. A well-restored Kalas Mahal will set a good precedent and Chennai could show the way for other cities to follow.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Restore-our-lost-heritage/article13373874.ece
23,1,2012,A national shame,"In a speech delivered last year to a gathering of India's finest scientific minds, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh invoked Nehru to point to the organic “link between humanism, tolerance, reason and progress.” “The practice of science,” he said, “is based on both the search for truth and the adventure of new ideas.” Precisely a year on, the government he presides over has betrayed those ideals. This newspaper has revealed how a ‘plot' to kill the eminent author Salman Rushdie had been invented by the Rajasthan Police in a pathetic but successful attempt to dissuade him from participating in the ongoing Jaipur Literature Festival. In the face of motivated protests from a gaggle of political opportunists and religious fanatics, the State government had first sought to stop Mr. Rushdie from visiting Jaipur. Upon discovering that he was, as a person of Indian origin, entitled to do so, it then resorted to a series of increasingly unsubtle coercive means to bring about that outcome. The real issue, though, isn't either Mr. Rushdie or The Satanic Verses, a book he wrote more than two decades ago and about which he has already “profoundly regret[ed] the distress” occasioned to “sincere followers of Islam.” It is that “the search for truth and adventure of new ideas” India so desperately needs has suffered a grievous blow. After the hounding of M.F. Husain and Taslima Nasreen by Hindu and Muslim fanatics, India has again betrayed its heritage of providing sanctuary to persecuted individuals and ideas, not to speak of its Constitution.
Occupying centre stage in the hall of shame is Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, who ought to have ensured his administration defended Indian law by securing Mr. Rushdie. Instead, fearful of being made a scapegoat within the Congress if the party does poorly in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh elections, he betrayed his constitutional obligations. The Rajasthan Police, for their part, must come clean on precisely who in their ranks fabricated the plot against Mr. Rushdie. Far too many Indians have lost their lives to terrorists for security to be made a plaything to serve a political agenda. The police officers concerned not just broke the law but have brought about the humiliation of the country. Self-styled Muslim leaders, as well as political groups who have opportunistically allied themselves with these forces over the years, should also be held to account for the real damage they have caused to democracy and secularism in India — and, thus, to the interests of the religious community they claim to speak for. Mr. Rushdie is entitled to a full apology for this shameful episode and to an unconditional assurance that he is welcome in India at any time and place. Prime Minister Singh must ensure he receives both.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-national-shame/article13376983.ece
23,1,2012,Good news at last,"After a long time, there has been some good news on the economic front. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for November released recently showed the output rebounding sharply; it rose by 5.9 per cent after contracting by 5.1 per cent in October. The headline inflation rate (Wholesale Price Index) that remained stubbornly high dipped to 7.47 per cent in December, its lowest since 2009. The rate of inflation was close to double digits during most of 2011, and in November it was above 9 per cent. Of special significance ahead of the Assembly elections across five States is the sharp deceleration in food inflation, which has helped push the monthly WPI inflation down. The rupee, which fell drastically in November and December last year, appears to have stabilised since the beginning of 2012. The domestic stock markets, of course, continue to be volatile, and the trading is nowhere near the peak. But it is of some comfort that they have not declined as much as many expected they would.
These are certainly welcome news, but it would be premature to conclude that the worst is over and economic recovery is round the corner. Macroeconomic data and corporate performance have not been inspiring so far, and global cues, especially from the crisis-ridden euro zone countries, have not helped either. Both industrial output data and inflation numbers need to be examined more closely to ascertain whether they indeed portend better times. The IIP numbers have been notoriously fickle. The November figures, for instance, were boosted by just two or three factors and do not suggest a broad-based revival. For one thing, electricity generation was up by 14.6 per cent. Whether this spectacular growth can be sustained is a difficult question, given the power sector's problems on the financial front and the shortage of coal. The 13 per cent increase in consumer demand was attributable to the festival season. On the other hand, capital goods production continues to shrink and the demand for credit has not picked up. Lower inflation has been possible partly because of the base effect: in December 2010 inflation had touched 9.45 per cent. Manufactured goods inflation remains elevated. All these will no doubt weigh with the RBI when it unveils the next instalment of the credit policy early next week. After hiking the rates more than a dozen times over a period of 18 months, it paused in December amidst slowing industrial production. It is doubtful that the recent good news, by themselves, will help the RBI resolve its dilemma, whether the interest rates should be cut or left untouched.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Good-news-at-last/article13376982.ece
24,1,2012,Brutality on the border,"New Delhi needs to make an unreserved apology to Bangladesh for the brutal conduct of its Border Security Force personnel who were seen in a recent video torturing a Bangladeshi man. Not surprisingly, the telltale video has caused widespread outrage in Bangladesh. A remark by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee that the incident must not be hyped, echoed by a Bangladeshi Minister, seems only to have provoked more anger and fuelled opposition allegations against the Sheikh Hasina government for being “pro-India”. With the Bangladesh Army claiming the other day that it averted a coup against the government by an “anti-India” section of officers, New Delhi needs to guard against becoming an unwitting cause for political instability in its eastern neighbour. Anti-India sentiment has been high in Bangladesh since the killing of three of its nationals by the BSF in two separate incidents on the border last month. A March 2011 agreement between the two countries not to use firearms in dealing with illegal activities on the border has brought down the number of such incidents, but the video is evidence that the guards feel free to use other forms of violence. It underlines the fact that such bilateral agreements on the management of their complex boundary are worth nothing unless accompanied by a change in the mindset of those responsible for it on the ground.
The distressing 11.56 minute footage, circulated through YouTube, is quite evidently a trophy video, the guards happy to pose as they strip their victim, tie his hands and feet, and beat him mercilessly while discussing among themselves other severe options of dealing with him. The man was a suspected rustler — the border is notorious for cattle smuggling — and it has been alleged by rights activists in Bangladesh that the guards were punishing him for not paying them a bribe. The guards appear to have such an entrenched sense of impunity that the thought of being found out and punished does not seem to cross their minds as they participate in the abuse. The BSF has suspended the eight guards involved in the distressing episode and ordered an investigation. While it may be convenient for the paramilitary to treat this as an isolated incident of “rogue” personnel, the enquiry needs to focus on the overall climate of impunity that makes such incidents possible. The BSF must also reflect if there is something missing in the training of its recruits that some of them are capable of such brutality. This is important because their conduct not only brings disrepute to the organisation but also risks jeopardising India's relations with an important neighbour.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/brutality-on-the-border/article2826161.ece
24,1,2012,Revenue's wrong call,"To the list of path-breaking income tax cases that are used to interpret the law one more will now be added: Vodafone International Holdings B.V. versus the Union of India. The Supreme Court's judgment in the Vodafone case has long-term implications for tax administration and jurisprudence, especially when it comes to taxation of cross-border mergers and acquisitions. The most significant part of the judgment by a three-judge bench led by Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia, is its acceptance of investment structures in offshore tax-havens as genuine tax planning devices. Indeed, the verdict is a boost to tax planning through use of intelligent structures within the framework of the law so long as they are not outright sham structures conceived only to evade tax. In the Vodafone case, the structure of holding and subsidiary companies registered in offshore financial centres has been in place long before the transaction under dispute was put through. It was, therefore, evident that it was not a structure conceived merely to avoid paying capital gains tax. The court held that a transaction between two foreign companies involving share acquisition is not taxable in India even if the underlying asset is located here. This knocked the base off the Income Tax Department's contention that the transaction was taxable as the asset — Hutch's telecom business — was located in India.
The landmark judgment only means more trouble for a government that is already struggling to keep the fiscal deficit under control. An inflow of Rs.11,200 crore as tax would have been handy in a truly difficult year for revenues but ironically, the government will now have to refund Rs.2,500 crore to Vodafone, along with interest at 4 per cent. Worse, there could be revenue implications down the line as there are other such deals where the tax department could lose if the Vodafone case law is applied. Of course, the judgment sends out an extremely positive signal to foreign companies and investors on the rule of law and the independence and fairness of the judiciary. The Supreme Court's observation that certainty and stability are the cornerstones of any fiscal system must have warmed the hearts of foreign investors who often complain of frequent changes in the tax laws. For its part, the government is unlikely to be a silent spectator to the loss of revenues from such deals in future. It will most certainly move to reinforce the relevant provisions in the new Direct Tax Code to specifically state that where the asset is situated in India, even deals between foreign companies involving share transfer in offshore entities will be liable to tax.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Revenues-wrong-call/article13378185.ece
25,1,2012,The RBI's balancing act,"The Reserve Bank of India has managed a delicate balancing act in the third quarter review of monetary policy 2011-12 unveiled on Tuesday. The reduction in cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 0.50 percentage point to 5.5 per cent will somewhat ease the tight liquidity conditions in the money market, while the decision to leave interest rates unchanged sends a clear signal that the apex bank is still not comfortable with the overall picture on inflation. With economic growth visibly slowing down — something the apex bank acknowledges — there was pressure to start the rate reduction cycle. But there are three major worrying factors on the inflation front. First, non-food manufactured product prices continue to be high; much of the drop in inflation in recent weeks was due to a fall in the prices of vegetables and seasonal products. Secondly, suppressed inflation in the form of artificially held down prices of petroleum products is quite significant. Finally, the depreciation in rupee value has also been feeding into core inflation. Given these, it was unrealistic to expect the RBI to embark now on the rate reduction cycle. However, the central bank has done its bit to encourage credit off-take by infusing liquidity (Rs.32,000 crore) through a reduction in the CRR. Despite the RBI's open market operations injecting Rs.70,000 crore over the past two months, money remained scarce, affecting credit flow to borrowers.
So, what are the prospects for the rate reduction cycle commencing soon? Not very bright, it appears. A lot depends on what the government does in the budget for 2012-13. The RBI is clear that the budget should come up with policy initiatives to induce investment and concrete measures for fiscal consolidation, if it is to start pegging rates down. This, especially the latter, is easier said than done. There are several factors that could impact the economy adversely. Not the least of them is the uncertainty in the euro zone, let alone the falling capital inflows in the context of a widening current account deficit. Inflation could once again spiral upwards if fuel prices, especially of diesel, are raised, as they should be. The escalating tensions over Iran portend more trouble, as they could drive up global oil prices forcing the government to pass the burden down the line. Adding wind to the inflationary sails will be a hardening of food prices, especially vegetables, which usually happens with the end of winter. All these, combined with the lacklustre investment climate as evidenced by the declining levels of non-food credit off-take, means that there is enough for the RBI to worry about before it makes up its mind on turning around the interest rate cycle.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-RBIs-balancing-act/article13379594.ece
25,1,2012,Nigeria under siege,"The series of bombings in Kano, Nigeria's second-largest city, which have killed 178 so far and for which the extreme Islamist group Boko Haram has claimed responsibility, reveal many interconnected problems. The attacks were mainly on police buildings, with a view to freeing members held for violent offences; an unspecified number of detainees escaped. Boko Haram killed 510 people in scattered attacks in 2011. The latest episode shows more planning, with police stations, government buildings, and churches being particularly targeted. The sect, founded in 2002, has changed its position over time. Its earlier demands were: the release of followers in captivity; justice for those killed; the withdrawal of the army from the north-eastern city of Maiduguri; and the nationwide imposition of Sharia law. Now, the group wants Christians expelled from the Muslim-majority north. In Hausa, Boko Haram means ‘western education is sinful', and the sect has exploited long-term neglect of the north, which has seen the country's oil-derived benefits go largely to the Christian-majority southern states. The violence has had an effect; southerners settled in the north are starting to move out.
In response, President Goodluck Jonathan says his government will not rest until the terrorists are “wiped out”. Kano is under dusk-to-dawn curfew, and various northern states remain under emergency law. But a longer term response is also essential. There is widespread resentment in the northern region because of the country's unequal development; poverty and low educational levels mean hardliners there can spread hostility to the central government in Abuja, despite the fact that the 2009 crackdown on Yusuf's group was carried out by then president Umaru Yar'Adua, himself a northern Muslim. Secondly, the bulk of terrorist attacks have been in the northern states, with Muslims being the main victims. Furthermore, the north stands to lose much more than the south by any separation, because Nigeria's greatest foreign earner, oil, lies in the southern states. Above all, the overwhelming majority of Nigerians do not take religious differences to extremes; inter-faith marriages are common, and the public are angry about the same things, such as police brutality and official corruption. They also vote mainly on political lines; in the 2011 elections, Mr. Jonathan's Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) did very well in the north. While it makes short-term sense to treat the Kano attacks as primarily a security issue, the President needs to find effective ways of leveraging these qualities of Nigerian society into an effective political weapon against Boko Haram's deadly violence.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Nigeria-under-siege/article13379556.ece
26,1,2012,"This is no way, Norway","Notwithstanding the agreement reached on Wednesday between India and Norway which puts a temporary lid on the matter, the case of Anurup and Sagarika Bhattacharya — whose young children were placed in foster care by the Child Welfare Services in the Norwegian city of Stavanger — raises disturbing questions. Last year, the couple's children, a boy of three and a girl aged one, were removed to an emergency shelter and then to a foster family, apparently on the grounds that their mother was not in a fit state to bring them up. In fact, the family court annulled the child services' decision to remove the children, but was itself overruled on appeal. Under the current order, the family will not be reunited until the children turn 18 — in 2026 and 2028 respectively. Parental access will consist of three hours' contact a year, in three separate visits. A sense of shock in India is fully understandable over this use of state power in family life. Indian anxieties are also unlikely to be assuaged by Norwegian official statements that such drastic interventions are rare, that the relevant service had visited the family weekly for several months, and that all the required procedures were followed; there is particular scepticism about the Stavanger Child Welfare Services' insistence that cultural prejudice played no role in the process.
The Norwegian authorities say they are bound by confidentiality and will neither confirm nor deny the account the parents have provided of what the child welfare officers found lacking in their treatment of the two children. However, even if their charges go beyond overfeeding, not using cutlery and sleeping in the same bed — “crimes” every South Asian family is guilty of — what seems odd is the extreme and irrevocable nature of the solution proposed. Surely a ‘nanny state' which gives itself the right to send young children to foster care till they turn 18 should also provide counselling and support for those parents whose care is found wanting, establishing a clear and transparent road map for the family to be reunited as soon as possible? If the Bhattacharya siblings are as entitled to a safe, secure and happy childhood as other children in Norway, a logical solution would have been for the grandparents to be offered the chance to take care of them till the parents are sufficiently schooled in the fine art of Norwegian child rearing. For some reason, this option was not considered important, and it is perhaps only because of the Government of India's intervention that Norway has now allowed the children to be placed in the care of an uncle. If this sad story is to have a happy ending, however, the Stavanger authorities should consider inviting a child welfare expert from India or any other South Asian country to review the case-file and help the family resolve whatever problems really exist.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/this-is-no-way-norway/article2832012.ece
26,1,2012,Cheating science,"Ever since the disgraced South Korean stem cell researcher Hwang Woo-Suk's fraud in the papers retracted by Science in 2004 and 2005 brought the spotlight back on the malaise plaguing science, the number of researchers getting exposed for data falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism has been increasing. But the sobering fact is that this number is barely the tip of research misconduct. A recent British Medical Journal (BMJ) survey of nearly 2,800 doctors and medical academics revealed that 13 per cent of respondents claimed to have first-hand knowledge of someone “inappropriately adjusting, excluding, altering or fabricating data.” Two previous surveys in 1992 and 2001 had reported slightly lower figures — 10 per cent and nearly 11 per cent respectively. Despite the problem being all pervasive, the United Kingdom has done little to tackle the issue. Last year, the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee found the “general oversight of research integrity to be unsatisfactory.” If the availability of modern tools and the pressure to publish papers is forcing many researchers to resort to unethical means, there is also little to deter them from cheating. With the exception of plagiarism, journals are not fully geared to spot all forms of cheating prior to publication. As a recent Editorial in Nature points out, libel laws indirectly prevent journals from even flagging “proven cases of misconduct.”
For reasons well known, universities and institutions have not been forthcoming in investigating cases on their own. The U.S. Office of Research Integrity has the power to block funding for a specified period to researchers found cheating. But it cannot investigate cases of misconduct on its own — it has to depend on universities for taking up investigation. Similarly, journals that identify cases of cheating do not have the wherewithal or the power to investigate. Herein lies the biggest hurdle: universities can simply refuse to cooperate. According to the BMJ survey, 6 per cent of respondents were aware of cases of misconduct not being properly investigated by their institutions. The problem is particularly heightened in the case of developing countries like India where no system for investigating such cases exists. Since research misconduct is detrimental to the development of science, it is necessary to make laws that mandate universities to investigate cases thoroughly or allow third-party investigation. A solution has to be soon found before published journal articles lose their value and pre-eminent place in science.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Cheating-science/article13380768.ece
27,1,2012,Wages of justice,"By filing a Special Leave Petition against the Karnataka High Court order directing payment of statutory minimum wages to workers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), the United Progressive Alliance government has betrayed its insensitivity to the rights of the poor. The courts have ruled that payment below minimum wage amounts to “forced labour”, which is constitutionally prohibited. The Centre's implacable stand that workers employed under the scheme are not entitled to anything higher than the Rs.100 ceiling fixed by it smacks of perversity. Its position that the flagship rural employment scheme is de-linked from, and independent of, the minimum wages fixed by the respective State governments has been rejected not only by activists and economists, but also by the judiciary. Earlier, the Andhra Pradesh High Court had struck down the Centre's January 2009 notification freezing daily wages under the scheme at Rs.100. The Karnataka High Court has now not only ordered payment of the minimum wage fixed by the State government but also payment of arrears. While admitting the SLP — filed after objections from Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh were peremptorily overruled by the Prime Minister — the Supreme Court declined to stay the High Court direction although it afforded some relief by staying the payment of arrears.
At the same time, the apex court has offered some sage advice to the government, which claims it may have to bear an additional burden of Rs.1,472 crore annually, and settle arrears to the tune of Rs.7,472 crore: that the government should not appear to abrogate the rights of the workers in a scheme meant to benefit the country's poor and, instead, it must seek to harmonise MGNREGS with minimum wages. The massive employment guarantee scheme is, admittedly, being implemented with varying degrees of efficacy and usefulness. Ranging from complaints that not everyone is paid Rs.100 a day and that not all beneficiaries work to the same level of efficiency, to a widely reported grievance that the MGNREGS has adversely affected the availability of labour for farming, the scheme is not without its drawbacks or flaws. Yet, there can be little doubt that it has been a significant social intervention that has arrested distress-induced migration, provided succour to those living below meaningful subsistence levels, and has had a salutary effect on wage structures in other sectors. Instead of fighting the wage issue to the bitter end, the UPA should do the right thing and ensure that payments under the scheme fully conform to the prevailing law on minimum wages.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Wages-of-justice/article13382044.ece
27,1,2012,Wulff at the door,"The problems surrounding German President Christian Wulff have compounded those Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing, to the point where her coalition government could collapse. The presidency is largely ceremonial, but Mr. Wulff has been involved in murky financial deals and has now tried to intimidate the press. As Minister President of Lower Saxony from 2003 to 2010, he was evasive about a €500,000 home loan, which he later refinanced at a discounted rate, from a rich friend; he had holidays in the villas of other wealthy friends in Tuscany and Mallorca; and another associate paid for the Wulff family's upgrade at a luxury hotel during the Munich Oktoberfest. The Lower Saxony assembly is investigating possible procedural breaches, but Mr. Wulff, a career politician in the Chancellor's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, has made matters worse, leaving voicemails threatening the tabloid Das Bild and its owners, the Axel Springer group, with “judicial consequences” and “war” if they published the story. The President has also pressured the daily Die Welt, inviting accusations of attempted censorship and of conduct demeaning to the presidency.
Mr. Wulff is a particular liability for Ms Merkel because he is the second successive president to be embroiled in controversy; his predecessor Horst Köhler, also from the CDU, resigned in 2010 after saying military involvement abroad was good for the German economy. Secondly, Mr. Wulff, a Merkel nominee, is less than popular with his party, which despite its majority in the relevant electoral college, the Federal Assembly, needed three rounds of voting to confirm his appointment. In addition, the CDU's coalition partners, the neoliberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) and the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), are causing the Chancellor problems. The FDP has polled at 3 per cent or less for a year now, and is riven by internal feuding. The CSU leaders, for their part, are furious about being left out of coalition discussions on tax cuts. Meanwhile, the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) leader Sigmar Gabriel has shrewdly offered to negotiate over a replacement president, while keeping in reserve the highly respected Joachim Gauck, a priest and rights activist. The CDU has its own headaches; having lost its Baden-Württemberg stronghold to the Greens in 2011, it faces provincial elections in Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony. Ms Merkel's personal ratings are good, but while losing one president may be a political misfortune, losing two presidents would look like very bad political judgment. The Chancellor and her coalition have a long, hard road to walk before the 2013 general election.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Wulff-at-the-door/article13382043.ece
28,1,2012,The republic's tree of life,"President Pratibha Patil might have meant well by using her Republic Day address to warn reformers not to shake the tree of state so hard in their drive to remove bad fruit that the tree itself is brought down but behind her arboreal metaphor lie contentious assumptions and unacceptable insinuations about the civil society movement against corruption. Nobody can disagree with the idea that India's democratic system must be safeguarded while introducing reforms in its political institutions such as a strong and effective Lokpal. Corruption in India, however, is much more than a case of some bad fruit. It is a deeply-entrenched, systemic problem that is corroding the nation, widening the gulf between ordinary citizens and those with access to power and privilege, and undermining the faith of people in democratic institutions. But if President Patil's metaphor was misplaced, so too was her analogy: equating the people's struggle for a strong anti-corruption institution with the bringing down of the entire edifice of democratic India. More than as a word of caution, her remarks seem intended to discredit the civil society movement against corruption. The easiest way to weaken a democratic movement for change is to suggest it is disruptive, inimical to long-term interests, and the cause of political instability. Through their choice of words, the drafters of Ms Patil's speech might have betrayed their intentions more clearly than they intended to.
Also, while calling for concord in dealing with matters of national importance, President Patil should have addressed her own government, and not the people of the country. It is the state that needs to accommodate the interests of different stakeholders on important issues by building political consensus and by being transparent in the way it functions. Actually, “negativity” and “rejection”, the states of mind President Patil warns the country against, are words that best describe the attitude and response-mechanism of the UPA government at the Centre. As such, introspection, and not words of advice and caution, would have suited the solemnity of the occasion better. As Ms Patil also pointed out, the country's foremost priority is to remove poverty, disease and illiteracy. The government will certainly have to do a lot more in achieving sustainable, socially equitable growth. For that, the country needs a strong popular movement that puts pressure on the administration. Of course, civil society movements too have an obligation to be open and transparent, rational and inclusive. But if the Indian Republic is to flourish and prosper, the tree the President spoke about cannot be left to the mercy of politicians alone.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-republics-tree-of-life/article13383230.ece
28,1,2012,Misdirected ire,"Jobs, jobs and jobs. That was the central theme of U.S. President Barack Obama's State of the Union address this year. Not surprising at all because there are 13.5 million Americans who are unemployed today, and the jobless rate, though on the decline in the last three months, is still at an uncomfortable 8.5 per cent. And then, of course, there is the small matter that this is election year in America and the State of the Union address is one of the few opportunities Mr. Obama has to grandstand in the remaining period of his Presidency. It is, therefore, natural that he hit out at the outsourcing of jobs, yet again, though this time his ire was directed mostly against manufacturing companies. The President proposed that companies which outsource jobs should be denied tax benefits just as those that create them in the U.S. should be rewarded. While Mr. Obama's electoral compulsions are defensible, what is not is his understanding of why American companies, especially in the high-tech manufacturing sector, are moving jobs overseas. The simple fact is that it is not just cheap labour that is driving American companies overseas; it is also the availability of trained labour per se, in the required numbers, and the existence of efficient supply chains for high-tech gadgetry. The withdrawal of tax breaks might work if it were just the first reason; unfortunately for the President, this is not the case.
Apple is one of America's most admired companies but almost all its products are manufactured overseas. And cheap labour is not the only reason. As a recent article in the New York Times points out, Apple was forced abroad by the availability of talent, and in the huge numbers that it required. That such talent came relatively cheap was a bonus. While America leads in innovation, the fact is that it lags in producing the kind of trained workforce that high-tech companies need. This is something Mr. Obama has conceded in his address, saying that these companies have twice as many openings as the availability of such workers. Investing in education and training as the President promised will help but that will only be in the long-term. American corporations are competing in a global market and national commitments mean little to them. What is important is efficiency and these corporations will migrate to wherever they can find it in the world. Impeding them in their quest will not help but boomerang on Mr. Obama and the U.S. Preventing outsourcing is protectionism and as the Great Depression of the 1930s showed, protectionism worsens an economic recession. It can only be hoped that such populist rhetoric does not get sanctified as legislation in the run-up to the election.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Misdirected-ire/article13383229.ece
30,1,2012,The revolution will not be tweeted,"A little local censorship is less of an evil compared to messages being fully scrubbed out from the public domain worldwide. That would seem to be the logic behind micro-blogging website Twitter's proposed system of reactively withholding tweets in a specific country when there is a valid request from a legal authority. Under it, if such a request is received, some of the messages of users will go missing on the service, and only show up as a box declaring that they have been “withheld”. The jury is out on whether the new system will silence activists and campaigners; already, some users are talking of workarounds. Twitter acquired a reputation for aiding mass protests and creating strong social networks, notably in the Arab Spring and Occupy movements. Whether or not revolutions are fanned by determined ‘tweeple', even 140 characters with a strong message can be too much for authoritarian regimes. Rulers in many countries are uncomfortable that Twitter is now a household name, and its reach, at a billion tweets put out every four days, nightmarish. The actual effects of the micro-censorship are yet to unfold, but activists have a point when they say internet giants are too willing to make compromises on online freedoms in return for expanded business opportunities.
If easy censorship is a happy prospect for intolerant regimes, there is also the accompanying odium of being listed on a web-based rogues gallery maintained by researchers, such as Chilling Effects, to which Twitter will pass on their demands. India, which has gained notoriety for making many requests (mostly without success) to purge search results, blogs, YouTube videos, and so on for political reasons, must resist a further slide into intolerance for online speech. The Google Transparency Report for the country shows that during the first half of 2011, the majority of demands for censoring content came from executive agencies. Only a handful were backed by a court order. What makes the loss of online freedoms particularly disturbing is the lack of due process that must accompany an invasion of privacy in the physical world — court authorisation to access personal information, enter the home, sift through materials, and make seizures. In democratic societies, it would be unthinkable for governments to violate the privacy of individuals in the way that web services and internet companies are being asked to. There is also the question that if commercial services looking for greater profit can be manipulated by governments, would it not be more attractive to develop non-profit, open source software, and social networking alternatives? Twitter and others like it who crave the support of millions must decide whose side they are on, oppressive regimes or the citizen.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-revolution-will-not-be-tweeted/article13386336.ece
30,1,2012,"Right step, not so the timing","The January 22 plebiscite has paved the way for Croatia — part of the erstwhile Yugoslavia — to join the European Union as its 28th member state in 2013. The move must be ratified in national parliaments across the EU. Regional security, access to the vast job markets, and investment inflows are among the potential benefits of EU membership. But neither was Zagreb's ‘yes' vote emphatic, nor has the imminent expansion been greeted with particular enthusiasm by existing members. All told, a far-cry from the euphoria and excitement witnessed when the EU embraced the former Eastern Europe in 2004 or when the single currency was launched in 2002. Croatia enters the EU precisely when the danger of Greece's exit from the euro zone is looming and the time-table for the accession of prospective members appears indefinite. The lack of a coherent response to the debt crisis makes a bad situation appear worse. It is tempting to interpret the 44 per cent turnout in the referendum as a measure of democratic deficit. But then, voter apathy is not quite unheard of in this trans-national context. Secondly, it should be borne in mind that the EU vote followed close on the heels of a national general election in December. In that light, the roughly two-to-one approval of EU membership is significant.
Democracy, market economy, and rule of law are among the eligibility criteria for EU membership. Abolition of the death penalty is also a precondition for admission, and this reform perforce imparts a rational and humane aspect to the administration of criminal justice. The potential of such a step to bring closure to historic wrongs and build reconciliation among Balkan countries that are torn by bloody ethnic strife cannot be exaggerated. By admitting Zagreb, the EU will send out a signal to the other Balkan states that it attaches a high premium on cooperation with the Hague tribunal which is adjudicating the war crimes of the 1990s. This is of particular relevance to Serbia, whose position on Kosovo's ‘independence' has pushed back its ambitions for EU membership. It is no mean challenge for the Balkans to balance their cherished values of national independence and sovereignty with the more current imperatives of regional integration. Consolidation of the EU would prove a formidable challenge owing to the machinations of extremist and anti-immigration parties. The bloc needs a new vision in the 21st century.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Right-step-not-so-the-timing/article13386284.ece
31,1,2012,Watch this space,"The saga of the scandalous deal that would have given a private company, Devas Multimedia Private Limited, control over a large chunk of valuable S-band spectrum has not ended. If the agreement signed with Antrix Corporation in 2005, the marketing wing of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), had been allowed to stand, Devas could have made a killing. However, doubts over the deal began to surface and, in December 2009, after K. Radhakrishnan took over the Department of Space, the parent body for both ISRO and Antrix, an internal committee was set up to review the deal under B.N. Suresh. It was Business Line, the business daily of the The Hindu group, that first brought to public notice what was going on behind closed doors. Subsequently, in February 2011, The Hindu and Business Line, published the text of the Antrix-Devas agreement and revealed the enquiries being pursued by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. Later that month, the deal was finally annulled by the Central government. In the wake of The Hindu group's exposé, the government constituted a high-powered committee made up of B.K. Chaturvedi and Roddam Narasimha to “review the technical, commercial, procedural and financial aspects” of the agreement. This committee submitted its report to the Prime Minister in March 2011. In May, a five-member high-level team headed by a former Central Vigilance Commissioner, Pratyush Sinha, was set up to examine the deal and identify acts of omission and commission by government officials. It was, the government said, after carefully considering the reports of the Chaturvedi-Narasimha committee and the high-level team that action was ordered. Four former officials, including G. Madhavan Nair who was ISRO chairman when the deal was signed, were barred from holding any government position.
But this action begs many questions. Is it the government's considered view that these four officials were solely responsible for the deal? What about the Space Commission, which has a key oversight role over the space programme? Were the members of the Commission as blissfully unaware of the deal as is made out? Mr. Nair has said the Space Commission was told about the agreement with Devas. He has also indicated that there were government officials, including some in the PMO, who were well aware of the Devas contract. That apart, how was it that members of the Space Commission who were also on the Antrix board of directors knew nothing of what was going on? The Antrix-Devas deal has raised fundamental questions about decision-making and oversight processes in the space programme. The government must come clean on what actually transpired by placing in the public domain the reports prepared by Dr. Suresh, the Chaturvedi-Narasimha committee and the high-level team.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Watch-this-space/article13387415.ece
31,1,2012,The state of our museums,"Despite budget cuts and financial difficulties, museums across the world have done well to attract more visitors in the year that has just ended, but what lies ahead? The International Council of Museums, an organisation of museums and museum professionals from 137 countries, has cautioned that the current year would be critical, with no sign of improvement in the global economic situation. More than ever, museums have to urgently innovate ways of remaining relevant to society. This advice and urging, for an entirely different set of reasons, applies unequivocally to India's museums, particularly the government-administered ones. Of the nearly 1,000 museums in the country, over 90 per cent are state-run. The visitor experience they offer is far from enriching and museum practices they adopt are way below global standards. What is of serious concern is the pathetic state of the National Museum, the premier institution in the country. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture, which looked at its functioning last year, found about a quarter of the galleries closed for more than three years, signage and labels of artefacts poorly designed, hardly 7.5 per cent of its two lakh collections exhibited, and the art acquisition committee defunct for the past 16 years.
Complacency has cost Indian museums the funds they badly need. For example, even the measly Rs. 72.36 crore the Central government allotted in 2009-10, was not fully utilised. This led the parliamentary committee to conclude that “allocation to the museums is enough.” So where, then, does the solution lie? The first step towards a turnaround is to improve the ‘quality, range and relevance' of the exhibits. Simultaneously, programmes to involve and engage people have to be put in place. The recommendations by the B.N. Goswamy Committee (2010) on improving museum infrastructure and administration ought to be implemented without delay. Museums across the world are looking at imaginative ways such as virtual displays to make their collections ‘more publicly available' and ‘show a wider volume of material'. Indian museums will do well to adopt these innovations. The Ministry of Culture has tied up with the British Museum for a modest training programme. This is commendable, but given the urgency, capacity-building should be radically stepped up and India's flagship museums placed in the hands of trained professionals selected from among the best in the world rather than babus and bureaucrats.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-state-of-our-museums/article13387414.ece
1,2,2012,"Prosecution, power, principle","All people are equal under the law, but the provisions relating to prosecution sanctions in India would suggest that some people are more equal than others. Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act prevents courts from taking cognizance of offences allegedly committed under the Act by a public servant without prior sanction of the government. And Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure lays down the general requirement of prior sanction while prosecuting public servants. Such provisions were conceived to ensure that public servants are not harassed and their work not stymied by vexatious and frivolous complaints. But in practice, these protective measures have functioned as a shield against prosecution, encouraging dishonest bureaucrats and ministers to flout the law with impunity. The Supreme Court's verdict on Tuesday, in a case related to the 2G scam, contains two important rulings relating to prosecution sanctions. First, by holding that Janata Party President Subramanian Swamy had the locus standi to seek sanction to prosecute former Telecom minister A. Raja, the Court has empowered all citizens to press for action against those public servants suspected of corrupt practices. Secondly, the Court has laid down that sanction for prosecution would be deemed to have been granted if the competent authority fails to take a decision within a period of four months. This is in broad consonance with the directives in the landmark Vineet Narain case, where the Supreme Court had ruled that while a maximum of three months for grant of sanction must be strictly adhered to, an additional one month may be allowed in cases where consultation with the Attorney General is required.
The sanction is routinely denied; in cases where it is granted, it is often after considerable delay. In the 2G spectrum scandal, for instance, Mr. Swamy wrote to the Prime Minister in November 2008 seeking sanction to prosecute Mr. Raja only to be informed six months later that this would be premature as the CBI was still investigating the matter. While Tuesday's ruling is a huge setback to the UPA, its real significance lies in the attention it has drawn to a larger question — should prior sanction be required to prosecute public servants at all. Surely, the decision about whether a particular prosecution is vexatious or not is better left to the judiciary. Significantly, the Lokpal and Lokayutas Bill 2011, passed by the Lok Sabha two months ago, had dispensed with prior sanction for launching prosecution in cases inquired into by the Lokpal. The idea that the law must differ for public servants and private citizens is an anachronism, one that has no basis in principle and has no defence in practice.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/prosecution-power-principle/article2848160.ece
1,2,2012,On a wing and a prayer,"The Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) faces many serious problems in a situation complicated by violence, tribalism and hatreds, old and new. Violent protests in the former rebel stronghold of Benghazi last month delayed the finalisation of the country's new electoral law. There are complaints about the Council's lack of openness, and demands for the resignation of all but a few of its members. Vice-President Abdul Ghoga, seen by many Libyans as a self-seeking defector from the former regime of Muammar Qadhafi, has already stepped down. Secondly, some of the volunteer and largely untrained militias which were involved in the rebellion's bitterest fighting now control key areas, including Tripoli airport, and have become self-appointed guardians of the revolution. Several have clashed with others, and there is no national army to absorb rebel units and provide essential discipline. Thirdly, the lack of central control means former rebels have inflicted revenge killings, torture, and rape on the population of Tawergha, for the aid they allegedly gave the old regime's forces. Racism may also be a factor, as many Tawerghans are descendants of black African slaves from earlier times; other Africans in Libya have suffered attacks for being suspected Qadhafi mercenaries, and even Libyan groups of ancient standing, such as the Amazigh tribe, are angry about their exclusion from the NTC.
Those problems by themselves could seem intractable enough, but the Council also has to contend with obstacles to the revival of the oil industry. Most of the oil installations were not seriously damaged in the uprising, but output is at half its earlier levels, and recovery is complicated because various militias are guarding many plants and are refusing to give up their weapons. That in turn means foreign engineers are reluctant to return and revive the country's only substantial export earner. In effect, Libya could easily slide back into the chaotic violence which preceded Qadhafi's overthrow, and given the fragmentation of Libyan society, the Muslim Brotherhood, hitherto not a key political player, is potentially the only party well placed to win a majority when the scheduled elections are held in 2013. Nato, which was so eager to support the rebels, will watch this anxiously, but it was Nato that embarked upon regime change in Libya with no apparent consideration of the consequences or of the fact that ordinary Libyans would end up paying the price for its heedlessness. If things implode, the Western powers will have a lot to answer for.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/on-a-wing-and-a-prayer/article2848162.ece
2,2,2012,Beyond the Rafale deal,"India's decision to select Dassault Aviation of France to supply 126 Rafale multi-role fighters caps a process that began in 2007 to replace the Indian Air Force's ageing MiG-21s and augment its fleet of Sukhoi 30MKIs. Given the size of the contract — which, at upwards of $10 billion, is the largest defence deal struck by India — the acquisition of the Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) was viewed in many quarters as a purchase in which political and strategic considerations would, or even should, play a role. Such a view was bolstered by the fact that each of the six competing aircraft originally short-listed had a lot to offer, the differences between them lying more along the perimeter than in the core. That technical and commercial factors prevailed over extra-contractual considerations became evident when the competition, following a slew of technical tests, was narrowed to two — the Rafale and the Typhoon, produced by a consortium of four European countries. Clearly, the selection process was uninfluenced by the United States administration, which had lobbied hard in favour of Boeing's F/A-18 and Lockheed Martin's F-16, suggesting that the acquisition of either was an important element in forging a closer strategic relationship. The rejection of the U.S.-manufactured aircraft underlined that we had, as one commentator wryly but wrongly noted, “settled for a plane, not a relationship.”
At the same time, it would be naïve to assume that arms purchases, particularly big ticket ones by a large nation such as India, are free from strategic implications or considerations. Indeed, for India, the Rafale acquisition widens its strategic options in a world where multi-polarity is a fact of life. At a more immediate level, the decision to buy the fighters, which has been greeted with unabashed glee in Paris, could provide the leverage for India to hold France to its promise of increasing cooperation across a whole range of areas, but especially in the nuclear and defence fields, including the greater sharing of technology and expertise. Of particular interest to New Delhi, is the question of enrichment and reprocessing (ENR) equipment transfers. The Nuclear Suppliers Group reneged on its 2008 bargain with India last year by banning the sale of ENR items but France — a key member of the nuclear cartel — has said it will not be bound by the new restrictions. The French must now be held to their word. As for the IAF, the acquisition of the Rafales may stem, in the near- or medium-term, the problem of the reducing number of squadrons. However, the IAF's long-term combat aircraft requirements will need to be met by developing the promised fifth-generation fighter in cooperation with Russia and overcoming the problems that have delayed the induction of the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Beyond-the-Rafale-deal/article13289240.ece
2,2,2012,Making science enjoyable,"That little children are gifted with sophisticated thinking capabilities and can solve problems like a hard-wired scientist has been documented by many studies. Instead of nurturing these talents and imparting other skills like logical thinking — so very essential for excelling in science — the system ends up blunting or even destroying what they already possess. The systemic problem can be traced to the way science is taught today in schools and colleges: through lecture-oriented, teacher-centric instruction. If this turns the students into passive learners, introducing “difficult concepts too early in the science curriculum” compels them to become rote learners and excellent reproducers of “boring, incomprehensible facts,” notes a recent editorial in Science. The system ensures that the joy of learning science is killed at an early stage. Learning by doing is regarded as one of the best ways of stimulating a child's curiosity and interest in the subject. Unfortunately, the faulty system has corrupted even this avenue. The curriculum has laboratory-based ‘experiments' that require students to blindly follow certain prescribed procedures to achieve some predetermined results. This is in stark contrast to open-ended experiments where students, like scientists, are required to raise a logical question and go about testing it in a scientific manner. This kind of a system that makes science enjoyable is neither practised nor encouraged in India.
A recent initiative by Science provides an ideal opportunity to undertake some vital course correction to inculcate interest in the subject. The journal has started publishing one inquiry-based activity a month (“An inquiry-based curriculum for nonmajors,” by David P. Jackson et al.); this will be continued for the next 15 months. The intent of the initiative is to “increase scientific literacy [and] impart a fundamental understanding of the nature of scientific investigation.” Aside from increasing scientific literacy, the modules, if properly used, can surely serve as a starting point for teachers and students to appreciate the power of learning through ‘real' experiments. In the short term, institutes in India should focus on moving away from the teacher-centric education that is in vogue to a more active student-centric instruction. The merits of such learning have been demonstrated by none other than Nobel Laureate Carl Wieman at the University of British Columbia. In his study, the active learning group scored nearly double that of the passive group and outperformed it on all counts.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/making-science-enjoyable/article2851228.ece
3,2,2012,Fruit of the poisonous tree,"When the rot runs deep, partial remedies won't do. By cancelling the 122 licences for 2G spectrum that were the product of an illegal policy process that was contrary to public interest and “violative of constitutional principles”, the Supreme Court has struck a blow for justice, transparency and ethical business practices. For those business houses used to bending or breaking laws to rake in excess profits, Thursday's verdict is a lesson that will forever remain etched in their institutional memory. The present case may relate to the telecom sector but there is hardly any industry in India today where unscrupulous companies have not sought to use their nexus with elected leaders and government officials to get ahead in their quest for quick and easy profits. Influence peddling and rent seeking have been the bane of the Indian economy and reforms do not seem to have reduced their incidence. The lesson for corporate India from the Supreme Court's landmark judgment is that there is little to be gained — and a lot to be lost — from doing business this way.
Senior ministers have gone out of their way to highlight the fact that Thursday's judgment places former Telecom minister A. Raja at the centre of the 2G scam. The Court also records how he disregarded the advice of the Prime Minister and the Finance Ministry at various points during the formulation and implementation of the policy of first come, first served. But even if the letters and notes cited in the judgment provide adequate legal cover for Dr. Manmohan Singh and Finance Minister P. Chidambaram — two weeks from now, the trial court will rule on whether the latter has anything to answer for — the United Progressive Alliance government cannot escape political culpability. Here was a case where Mr. Raja went against the stated advice of the Prime Minister. The fact that several companies were cherry-picked from the pool of spectrum applicants was known, as was the fact that some made huge profits by quickly disposing of the precious national resource they had been allocated so cheaply. Even if we accept that Mr. Raja took the UPA leadership for a ride, what is inexplicable — and unforgivable — is the government's failure immediately to investigate the scam despite its broad contours being so visible. Even after the Comptroller & Auditor General's magisterial report exposed what had transpired, senior ministers refused to accept the fact that there had been any loss to the exchequer. If today the UPA stands politically exposed, it is as much for the way it has dealt with the post-scam fallout as for the original sin of failing to sell spectrum through a transparent process.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree/article2854507.ece
3,2,2012,Not playing at a theatre near you,"First Rushdie, then the cancellation of a seminar and film screening on Kashmir at a Pune college, now Taslima Nasreen. It seems there is no end to India's capacity for easy surrender when it comes to the freedom of expression. In each instance, religious extremists of one kind or another have got away with intimidating the organisers of the particular event while the government and its law enforcing arm all too quickly abdicate responsibility for protecting a constitutionally guaranteed right, on the excuse that the event threatened the maintenance of public order. In cancelling the release of Taslima Nasreen's autobiographical book Nirbasan, the Kolkata Book Fair was advised by the local police that a group called the Milli Ittehad Parishad had complained about the event. Although the publishers of the book went ahead with a scaled down launch at a different venue, the incident has once again, within a space of three weeks, underlined a collective failure to stand up to bullying by religious fundamentalists. In Pune, it was both Hindu extremists and the local police who forced first the cancellation of the documentary on Kashmir, Jashn-e-Azadi, and then the entire seminar where it was to be screened. In another incident, even a seminar that was to be held in Hyderabad on the Rushdie episode and its implications for freedom of expression was cancelled under pressure from the police who feared it could provoke violence. All this is clearly unheeding of several Supreme Court verdicts, including the landmark Ore Oru Gramathile judgment, that public authorities must protect the freedom of expression, and cannot resort to bans in the name of upholding law and order.
That such pusillanimity has come to the fore during elections in important States where political parties are seeking votes on communal platforms — despite all the evidence that minority voters do not want to be treated in this way — is a sad reflection on the condition of the world's largest democracy and its leaders. Under the benevolent gaze of the state, a disparate but highly effective ‘Thought Police' consisting of religious reactionaries, moral guardians, and hypersensitive prigs have proliferated around the country. They have a diktat on every form of cultural and artistic expression. What is equally worrying, though, is the absence of collective resistance by ‘civil society' to this growing intolerance. While thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest the corruption of the political class, the repeated assault on the right to free expression goes almost unchallenged, even though the two are linked in fundamental ways.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/not-playing-at-a-theatre-near-you/article2854506.ece
4,2,2012,"Let water, not profits, flow","As a finite, life-giving resource, access to water must remain a fundamental right. The state, as custodian under the public trust doctrine, should uphold the right of the citizen to clean, safe drinking water. It is such a strong, rights-based approach that should underpin official policy on water in India. Many areas in the country are water-stressed, and there are simmering inter-State disputes on sharing river waters. The National Water Policy 2012, now published in draft for public comments, should ultimately take a holistic view of the issue. The draft text makes some references to the importance of water for people and Nature, but is disproportionately focussed on treating water as an economic good. Such an approach predicated on realising the costs that go into the supply of water can only distort access and prices in the long run, affecting less affluent citizens. To suggest, for instance, that the state should exit the service-provider role and become a regulator is only a step away from abandoning the equity objective. Private sector water services have clearly failed in many countries, including those in the global North, and local governments have taken over again. In the current year, for-profit private water companies in England are raising tariffs, while the publicly-owned service in Scotland is not. Just over a decade ago, water wars in Bolivia reversed privatisation moves. Evidently, private partnership imposes the burden of extra costs.
Few will argue that there is no case for reforms in the way water is managed as a resource in India. In urban and semi-urban areas, the lack of adequate public investments has weakened municipal systems. This has led to commodification and unsustainable extraction from aquifers for rising rates of profit. In this context, the proposal to separate groundwater rights from land title by amending the Indian Easements Act, 1882 merits serious consideration. Coming up with an alternative framework acceptable to all stakeholders, however, is a big challenge. Moreover, an assessment of the national water balance at the basin level is essential for amending the law. This the Centre should pursue, as the Planning Commission has suggested, during the 12 Plan. Such data can persuade the States to support comprehensive legislation to address inter-State riparian issues. Again, if there is any one factor that renders much of India's water unusable, it is industrial pollution. This issue calls for urgent action, and the policy can cover major ground if it lays greater emphasis on making the ‘polluter pays' principle work. A clean-up can make a lot more of India's water bodies and groundwater available for use by people.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Let-water-not-profits-flow/article13292283.ece
4,2,2012,Coping with disasters,"Nothing tests the political will and administrative efficiency of a government like a natural disaster. More than long-term development projects and poverty-alleviating schemes, it is the response mechanisms activated in times of emergency that people remember. In Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, a month after cyclone ‘Thane' made landfall, the affected communities are still struggling to put their lives back together. Given the magnitude of destruction in the coastal areas, especially Puducherry and the districts of Cuddalore and Villupuram, normality could not have been restored in a matter of days. The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam government in Tamil Nadu led by Chief Minister Jayalalithaa did well in the aftermath of the cyclone, clearing uprooted trees from the roads and reaching food to the victims. But with tens of thousands of electricity poles falling to the fury of the cyclone, power supply has returned only in phases, spread over a month, to the affected areas. More disconcertingly, a lot remains to be done in terms of rehabilitation for the people who lost their homes and means of livelihood. Farmlands have been ravaged, leaving farmers and workers without any means of income during harvest time. Many have resorted to taking loans or withdrawing deposits for day-to-day sustenance.
In this context, the decision of the State government to construct one lakh concrete houses at a cost of Rs.1,000 crore to replace huts damaged in the cyclone is a significant step in easing the misery of the victims. Too often, the enthusiasm shown by officialdom in the days immediately after a disaster dries up in a couple of weeks. As seen in the construction of houses for those affected by the tsunami in 2004, delays can stretch to years. Without the pressure of public opinion, governments tend to under-perform and fail to keep promises made at the time of the calamity. And almost inevitably, housing projects for disaster victims, which take a longer time to complete, drop off the priority list of the authorities. As pointed out by Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, ‘Thane' caused damage on a scale rarely seen before. Tamil Nadu and Puducherry will need substantial help from the Central government in carrying out long-term rehabilitation measures. The State, which sought Rs.5,248 crore from the National Disaster Response Fund, has so far been given Rs.500 crore. Whatever it takes, the State and Central governments must speedily ensure that the people traumatised by ‘Thane' and the North-East monsoon are able to lead a normal life again.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/coping-with-disasters/article2858034.ece
5,2,2012,A tragic impasse,"Russia and China may have acted rashly in vetoing a sharply worded draft United Nations Security Council Resolution on Syria but the United States, France and Britain – who have reacted with predictable fury — cannot escape their responsibility for an impasse which leaves the world unable to act on the unfolding humanitarian disaster in that country. The urgency of the situation is obvious; fierce fighting continues in several cities, with civilian deaths in Homs reported at up to 300 over the past few days alone. By U.N. estimates, at least 5,400 people have been killed since the uprisings started in March 2011. India voted for the draft, noting that it expressly rules out intervention in Syria under Article 42 of the U.N. Charter, and supporting the resolution's call for political dialogue between President Bashar al-Assad's government and opposition groups under the auspices of the Arab League. Moscow, however, has been hostile to all drafts on this matter, even the latest which dropped the demand that Mr. Assad step down. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says the call made for government forces to withdraw to barracks is not balanced by a similar requirement for armed opposition groups and will thereby endanger any political process.
The West has only itself to blame for alienating what could have been powerful and influential allies in this terrible and protracted crisis. Russia's unwillingness to go along with a U.S.-led process stems, in large measure, from its anger at western conduct over Libya. The U.N. resolution of March 2011 imposed only a no-fly zone but served, in reality, as a cover for NATO's aim of violent regime change there. Today, Russia and China both believe they were deceived into abstaining rather than using their veto. Though Moscow has sought to distance itself from the brutalities of the Assad regime, which is now using heavy weapons against protesters, Saturday's veto is a shot in the arm for Damascus. But Washington's approach, which has included strident calls for President Assad to go, does not open a path for an urgent political solution to the violence either. One of the problems is that the opposition to the regime is severely fragmented. The Syrian National Council is at odds with both the Free Syrian Army and the National Co-ordination Committee. Furthermore, with the regime in Damascus drawn from the 10 per cent Alawite Shia minority, Sunni extremist groups have jumped into the fray. The P-5 and Arab League, along with India, Brazil and South Africa, must go back to the drawing board and come up with a new plan of action that can end the violence and set the stage for a Syrian-led political solution.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-tragic-impasse/article2863451.ece
5,2,2012,"Come rich, come single","Immigration, we know, has long been the favourite whipping boy of the right wing and has been a dominant campaign issue in recent national elections around Europe. The compulsion of cohabitation with either the extreme fringe or the centre tests the inventiveness of traditional rightwing parties as they search for ways to appease anti-immigrant vote banks without appearing overly illiberal or undemocratic. Given the biting austerity and high unemployment they are presiding over, it is hardly surprising that the Tories in the current Liberal-Conservative coalition in the United Kingdom should seek refuge in tougher immigration rules. Immigration Minister Damian Green's recent observations on restricting British visas only to the wealthy, the highly skilled and the very best in other respects seem unexceptionable but are, if anything, aimed at preparing the ground for the adoption of a controversial policy to curb family migration. The government-sponsored Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) report of last October sets new income criteria for citizens and settled residents who wish to sponsor foreign spouses or children. It proposes a minimum threshold where a person's salary before tax would be above the amount that would entitle him or her to income-related benefits. A January 2012 report of the MAC also claims a strong correlation between non-European immigration and the displacement of British workers.
Despite the anecdotal evidence of welfare fraud periodically trotted out by the British press, the targets of the proposed family migration measures are not scroungers, potential destitutes or recipients of state benefits, but people earning average wages who have families to support. Many of these individuals are South Asians or of South Asian descent. It is ironic, given that commitment to the family is an oft repeated conservative platitude, that the Cameron government should seek to put in place policies that would allow the right to family life only to those British residents who are affluent and deny it to working people whose income is less than the cut-off. Therein lies the harshness of the new criteria. Indeed, their application could attract legal challenge for violating Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, i.e. the right to respect for private and family life. There may be an element of tawdriness involved but Britain is entitled to cherry pick and fast-track wealthy individuals seeking to set up home there. What it ought not to do is discriminate against its own residents and citizens. The right to marry and have a family cannot be means-tested.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/come-rich-come-single/article2863452.ece
7,2,2012,Battling the king of maladies,"Cricketer Yuvraj Singh's cancer diagnosis is distressing, and he will hopefully bounce back with the help of the best treatment available. But this is also a moment for India to consider how its public health policy is dealing with the long and dark shadow of cancer. An estimated 800,000 new cancer cases occur in India annually, imposing huge costs on state and society in providing tertiary care for advanced chronic cases. Mortality due to the scourge is projected to go up from 730,000 in 2004 to 1.5 million in 2030. The evidence on the causes clearly points to the need to strengthen key policy goals — preventing new cases, offering low or no-cost treatment, improving quality of life or palliation. Arguably, the single biggest intervention that public policy can make is to tighten curbs on the use of tobacco, given that major cancers in Indian men are linked to it. It is worth pointing out that India has the world's highest number of oral cancers, linked to the tobacco chewing habit. In general, screening and early diagnosis for cancer will benefit both men and women. The unfortunate reality is that India cannot quickly scale up screening in a cost-effective manner, and must therefore focus on early detection to enhance survival rates.
Seeking out the best treatment — especially in expensive domestic corporate hospitals or facilities abroad — is an option open to a minority of Indians. The imperative is to improve access to diagnosis within the country, and subsidise costly medication. The High Level Expert Group of the Planning Commission on Universal Health Coverage has suggested a sound approach to improve access to cancer treatment. The Centre should unhesitatingly accept its recommendations and devote the funds necessary to equip health sub-centres in all areas to screen and refer patients to Primary Health Centres for detailed examination, laboratory sampling, breast and cervical examination. District hospitals and higher institutions in the public system should be equipped to offer surgery, therapy and palliative care. Equally vital is the suggestion that essential medicines be made available free to all patients, and paid for through enhanced public procurement. It is relevant to point out that effective prevention programmes, detection and advances in treatment have reduced cancer death rates significantly in America. The US policy has translated into prevention of more than a million deaths in two decades, as the American Cancer Society points out in its annual report for 2012. India needs more ultrasound machines, endoscopes and training for doctors in district hospitals, to drive down death rates. If Yuvraj Singh were to be the ambassador for such an agenda, speedy progress is possible.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/battling-the-king-of-maladies/article2866491.ece
7,2,2012,"Talk less, text more","Seven months from now, all mobile phone handsets sold in India, including the imported ones, will have to meet stringent electromagnetic emission limits. The yet to be notified regulations will make mobile handsets relatively less harmful to use compared with the ones sold prior to September 1. The decision to reduce the specific absorption rate (SAR) — the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a phone — is a prudent one. India has taken a leaf out of the United States Federal Communication Commission (FCC) by adopting a stricter SAR limit of 1.6 watts per kilogram averaged over a volume of 1 gram of tissue for the head. The SAR value currently in effect is 2 watts per kilogram averaged over a volume of 10 gram of tissue. Another significant aspect is the requirement to compulsorily mention the SAR value on every handset so that consumers are aware of it. Until now, companies have been tucking this information in the handset manuals or their websites. But the worse culprits are the cheap phones sourced from a few countries that have much higher emission levels than the currently permitted SAR limit. It is quite unlikely that even the mandatory requirement of having the SAR value embossed on every unit will prevent such gadgets from being sold.
The solution, therefore, is to spread and increase awareness of the possible risks of long-term exposure to radio frequency radiation. Radiowaves, unlike X-rays and gamma rays, are non-ionising in nature and do not have the energy to damage cellular DNA. Several studies, including a 2001 and 2006 follow-up Danish study, found no link between long-term use and risk of cancer. However, a 2009 Swedish study found such a link in those people who had used mobile phones for at least ten years, especially those below 20 years of age, even though the precise mechanism by which the cancer is caused is not known. Hence it is wise to adopt a precautionary approach to minimise radiation risk as there has been increased usage and for a longer duration. The percentage of children, including younger children, using mobile phones is also rising. It is a fact that close contact of the phone with the ear heats up the tissues after prolonged use. This can be eliminated and the risk greatly minimised by using mobiles only for short calls, using texting options, and relying on hands-free modes for communication. Needless to say, younger children should be discouraged from using cellular phones as their skulls are thinner than adults and the cells are likely to be more sensitive to mobile phone radiation as they are still in a growing state.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/talk-less-text-more/article2866493.ece
8,2,2012,Trouble in paradise,"The abrupt change of guard in the Maldives on Tuesday marks the culmination of a series of events in the Indian Ocean nation in which Mohammed Nasheed, who resigned as President, emerges as a well-intentioned politician with strong democratic convictions but one who was unable to make properly the transition from activist to leader of a country. Mr. Nasheed's campaign to bring democracy to the Maldives is a story of extraordinary courage that included long spells in prison and exile. As head of the Maldivian Democratic Party, he can take the credit for overseeing the end of the three-decade reign of Maumoon Abdul Gayoom — the strongman forced by his relentless campaign to hold the country's first democratic election in 2008. “Anni”, as Mr. Nasheed is known in the Maldives, trounced Mr. Gayoom in that presidential election. But the MDP did not have a majority in Parliament, and was dependent on opposition parties, some of whom supported Mr. Nasheed in the run-off against his predecessor. Unfortunately, he failed to recognise this dependence; instead of cultivating allies, he alienated many in his haste to weed out the Gayoom legacy. Matters came to a boil in mid-2010, when opposition members forced a deadlock by blocking all legislation. Stirring the pot continuously were a range of actors, from President Gayoom's half-brother, who heads an opposition party, to Islamists, who accused Mr. Nasheed of diluting the official religion. In the past few weeks, the capital city of Male saw protests by Islamic radicals, who vandalised a mural presented by Pakistan to commemorate the November 2011 SAARC summit as “un-Islamic”, and a Buddha statue gifted by Sri Lanka.
As a section of police officers mutinied yesterday, Mr. Nasheed could have chosen to declare an Emergency and use force to remain in power. It is praiseworthy, and speaks to his progressive political beliefs, that he stepped down, enabling the vice-president, Waheed Hassan Manik, to succeed him in an orderly and constitutional transition of power. Unless early elections are forced, Dr. Manik will continue in office for the remaining 20 months of this presidency. The new leader is expected to maintain the close and friendly ties that his predecessor enjoyed with India. New Delhi has acted wisely by keeping out of the political tumult in the Maldives, and allowing events to take their own course. Entirely different circumstances dictated India's 1988 decision to send commandos to prevent a coup against Mr. Gayoom by Sri Lankan Tamil militants hired by his Maldivian opponents. In the present instance, any intervention to help Mr. Nasheed remain in power would have served neither him nor India well.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/trouble-in-paradise/article2869827.ece
8,2,2012,The law of life,"The Supreme Court last week ruled as unconstitutional the mandatory imposition of the death penalty under the Arms Act in view of the absence of judicial review. The verdict is a reiteration of current jurisprudence that for criminal offences, life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence the exception. The impugned section 27 (3) of the Arms Act stipulates capital punishment for offences that may result in the loss of life. Accordingly, even where death was a consequence of accidental or unintended use of arms, the ultimate sentence was the only penalty available under this provision — a clear violation of the Constitutional rights to equality and life, as the court observed. Moreover, the prescription of the death penalty as mandatory was a contravention of the principle of judicial review. In addition, the provision also violates Article 13(2) of the Constitution, which bars Parliament from enacting laws that may abridge fundamental rights. The provision quashed by the ruling was incorporated through a 1988 ordinance that enhanced penalties for Arms Act offences in the backdrop of the Punjab militancy. Though the threat posed by terrorism today is no less dire, the Court's message is that there must be responsibility and restraint in framing laws.
The judgment is also a vindication of the position of human rights groups the world over that the rule of law and application of due process in trials should not be circumvented even in relation to the most heinous crimes. Significantly, Parliament has already introduced a retrospective amendment to harmonise the relevant provision of the Arms Act with Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. Evidently, this correction will not preclude a sentence of death from being handed down for offences under this law. But in the absence of complete abolition, even the scope to challenge and prevent death sentences from being carried out is not an insignificant gain. That is precisely the burden of the current case globally for the establishment of a moratorium on executions in countries where the death penalty still remains. India should adopt this course since in any case the Supreme Court resorts to this punishment only in the rarest of rare cases and also because the approach has exposed successive governments to the charge of arbitrariness and inconsistency in its application. Indeed, the arbitrariness question will be tested when the court considers this month the final appeal of two men on death row — Mahendra Nath Dass and Devendar Pal Singh Bhullar — both of whom have fittingly cited lengthy, unexplained delays in the disposal of their mercy petitions as grounds for commutation of their sentence to life.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-law-of-life/article2869619.ece
9,2,2012,Dirty picture,"Legislative proceedings are usually far from stimulating and we have grown accustomed to MPs and MLAs stealing a surreptitious nap or even snoring defiantly to escape the tedium of debate. But the three Karnataka BJP ministers who were forced to resign Wednesday morning chose a most unusual way to escape what they regarded as an arid discussion on the drought situation in the State. Much to the embarrassment of themselves and their party, TV cameras caught them transfixed by, ahem, a film clip, on one of their cell phones. Laxman Savadi, who was Minister for Cooperation, may protest till he is blue in the face, but his explanation that he was watching a newsclip about a woman being gang-raped simply doesn't wash. The best that can be said in an age where our legislatures are sporadic witnesses to a range of boisterous activity — fisticuffs, abuse, screaming, overthrown furniture, ripped out microphones, torn papers and flung slippers — is that the trio were at least passing their time in quiet communion. Watching pornographic material in the House is a first in the history of Indian legislatures, but like almost everything else in the sleazy world of politics, somebody's already been there, done that. Last April, an Indonesian MP belonging to an Islamic party that campaigns for anti-pornography legislation was forced to resign after being caught watching porn in parliament, presumably to acquaint himself better with the subject matter of what he was opposing.
On a serious note, there is an important message in this, one that exposes the unalloyed hypocrisy of those who adopt conservative and hardline postures on issues relating to sex and morality. It is in Karnataka that fundamentalists assaulted women in pubs, ran campaigns against Valentine's Day, launched investigations into the so-called love jihads — all professedly to protect Hindu culture from immoral foreign influences. For a party that likes to think it is different, the porn incident is a severe embarrassment for the BJP. To have forced the three ministers to “voluntarily resign” is hardly going to check the damage caused to the party and State government, which is already under some fire for permitting a reportedly wild rave party in Udupi. When privilege motions are moved against legislators and outsiders for lowering the dignity of the House, it would be really strange if no more action is taken against the erring MLAs. But rather than reacting to what they did with blustering moral outrage, the incident should be used as an opportunity to expose the hypocrisy of the BJP and its aggressive fellow travellers in the Sangh Parivar, who, through their moral policing and self-styled vigilantism, regard themselves as the custodians of Indian morality.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dirty-picture/article2872933.ece
9,2,2012,Time to be realistic,"The gloomy picture painted by national income data released on Tuesday may not be surprising but a detailed analysis of the numbers does indeed provide grounds for concern. According to the advance estimates of GDP growth, the economy will grow by 6.9 per cent during the current year (2011-12), sharply lower than the 8.4 per cent clocked last year. The implication is that the economy, which grew by 7.3 per cent during the first half of the year (April-September), will decelerate to 6.5 per cent during the second half. That the pace of growth during the current year will be the lowest in three years need not by itself cause alarm. It may even be argued that a growth rate of almost 7 per cent is commendable given the adverse global and domestic environment. However, the signs of the slowdown continuing are discernable everywhere. Official data published during the year such as the monthly index of industrial production have captured this deceleration in unmistakable terms. That is why most forecasters, official as well as private, lowered their growth estimates as the year progressed. The government alone remained over optimistic: having pitched for a growth rate of around 9 per cent in the budget, North Block took a long time to revise this to levels which were a little more realistic but still higher than other forecasts.
Of direct relevance to the Finance Ministry's exertions in the run up to the March 16 budget is the question of what the advance estimates say about the economy for the next year (2012-13). There are indications that agriculture, estimated to grow by just 2.5 per cent during the current year, will actually post a more impressive rate of growth. There has been a bountiful harvest of wheat and rice and this has not been fully captured by official statistics. However, the production of coarse grains has lagged behind and it would be naïve to take the monsoons for granted. Among the other less hopeful factors, capital formation, a crucial indicator of future growth, appears to have fallen by a few percentage points. Manufacturing, a key growth driver, will therefore most likely remain subdued. In turn, this means Indian exporters will not be able to take full advantage of a possible global recovery. The construction industry, with a huge employment potential, is forecast to grow by only 4.8 per cent this year, down from 8 per cent. Mining, whose performance has a bearing on key industries such as power generation, has contracted. With the right policy reorientation — and a reform process that ensures transparency and regulation — it should be possible to revive these key sectors and post more impressive growth figures next year.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/time-to-be-realistic/article2872747.ece
10,2,2012,Clinical trials in the dock,"With the Supreme Court issuing notice to the Central government on the matter of illegal drug trials, the sordid state of human clinical trials is all set to be exposed. For multinational companies eager to cut corners, India offers an attractive package of weak laws, lax and almost non-existent oversight of trials, a huge illiterate, vulnerable population that can be easily exploited, very little volunteer protection and a sizeable number of unscrupulous doctors willing to compromise on ethics for gain. Recent reports of 42 mentally ill patients in Madhya Pradesh being enrolled in a trial held between 2008 and 2010 for testing the efficacy of dapoxetine in curing premature ejaculation highlights the scant regard for ethics. Mentally ill patients can be enrolled only in trials involving drugs that would directly benefit them or reduce the harm they cause to society. In fact, around 230 such patients were enrolled in several trials that do not benefit them. Cases of patients becoming a part of a study without knowing it, and of children being enrolled without obtaining informed consent from parents, have also been reported from the State. It will not be wrong to assume that in other trials the poor, unlettered parents who had signed the informed consent form — the most sacrosanct document of a trial — were ignorant or misled and misinformed of the contents. Individuals subjected to multiple trials, and principal investigators being involved in many studies have also been reported from Madhya Pradesh. The situation may be the same in other States as well. The 2010 expose of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine trials conducted without proper consent on nearly 23,500 girls in the 10-14 age group in Vadodara, Gujarat and Khammam district of Andhra Pradesh is a case in hand.
It is essential that the Central and State governments put a quick end to this sordid state of affairs. Ensuring the safety of patients is paramount as more than 1,700 persons have died in clinical trials across the country between 2007 and 2010. Doctors go scot-free despite failing to follow up serious adverse events, including deaths. Having amended the patent laws in 2005 to make India an even more attractive destination for trials, the government is duty-bound to put in place a proper regulatory and monitoring mechanism that would prevent unethical trials from being initiated and flagrant violations from taking place. Doctors and companies earning handsome profits by throwing ethics and procedures to the winds and turning vulnerable people into guinea pigs will then, hopefully, become a thing of the past.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/clinical-trials-in-the-dock/article2876316.ece
10,2,2012,Confusing signals on Afghanistan,"The confusion that passes for Washington's Afghanistan policy was once again in evidence in the statement by United States Defense Secretary Leon Panetta that the drawdown of American combat troops is expected to begin sometime in 2013, a year ahead of the earlier timetable. The statement created a stir from D.C to Delhi, and has added to the uncertainty that hangs over Afghanistan. With the Obama Administration balancing domestic calculations in an election year with international concerns about stability in Afghanistan, several U.S. officials have scrambled to explain Mr. Panetta's statement not as a change of the 2014 deadline, but an underlining of it: that the transition process would have to begin next year in order to meet the deadline. What impact these confusing signals will have on the proposed negotiations with the Taliban, in which the first steps are said to have been already taken, can only be guessed. The “reconciliation talks” are predicated on the premise that the Taliban are now a weakened force, and would therefore be willing to make a compromise agreement with other Afghan political stakeholders. The reality is that the Taliban are nowhere near defeat and the Afghan government forces are nowhere near capable of maintaining peace and security. With regional players such as Pakistan, India and Iran and international big powers all jostling to position themselves in the so-called Afghan endgame, the situation can only get more muddied.
In all this, only one thing is clear: Afghan civilians have borne the worst of more than a decade of war, and they will continue to do as long as that country is viewed more as a geo-strategic piece of real estate rather than as a nation with real people. The latest United Nations report on civilian casualties provides the depressing information that 3,021 civilians were killed in Afghanistan from January to December 2011, an increase of eight per cent over 2010 (2,790), and 25 per cent over 2009 (2,412). Of last year's toll, 77 per cent, or 2,332 deaths were attributed to the Taliban and other militants, such as the Haqqani network and the Hizb-e-Islami. Tellingly, civilian deaths from aerial attacks by security forces increased in 2011, despite the decrease in the number of such aerial attacks and the fewer number of civilian deaths attributed to the security forces. Afghanistan's tragedy today, much of it scripted by the U.S., is that civilians are bound to die as long as western troops remain on its soil, but there is no guarantee of their security if and when these troops depart, as there are no institutions or mechanisms strong enough to maintain the peace — a double jeopardy to which as yet there is no end in sight.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/confusing-signals-on-afghanistan/article2876063.ece
11,2,2012,Murder in the classroom,"Nothing is more shocking than the violence of children. For any society, children are the embodiment of innocence, free from the wiles and lies of the corrupt, adult world they are yet to enter. Not surprisingly, the murder of a school teacher by a 15-year-old boy in Chennai who was angry at being reprimanded for his poor performance in class has thrown up deeply disquieting questions on parenting, teaching, and social and cultural mores. By all accounts, the teacher did nothing beyond the ordinary routine. After the boy fared badly in the subject she taught, Hindi, she made notes in his school diary to draw the attention of his parents. Students in similar situations do tend to nurse a grudge against the teacher but, in this case, the boy went much further, planning the killing and waiting for an opportune moment to strike. Clearly, the murder was an extraordinary fallout of an everyday situation. What might otherwise have ended in a commonplace student prank against the teacher triggered a shocking, inexplicable act. This is what makes the task of guarding against the recurrence of such violence almost impossible.
Many factors are at play, some of them at larger societal levels that are not easily controllable. Blaming parenting is easy, but this is no more than a way of absolving the rest of society of all responsibility. There is nothing to suggest the boy was brought up in abnormal circumstances; all his siblings have done well for themselves. By locating the murder in the specificity of the circumstances, other problematic issues are brushed under the carpet. Of course, parents bear a greater share of the responsibility for the behaviour of their children, but bad parenting cannot explain all deviant behaviour. While several things are wrong with our education system, including the processes of examination and evaluation, these cannot be understood as major contributors to the violence in schools. Films and other forms of popular culture also have an impact on young minds, but then again, it would be simplistic to relate them directly to real-life violence. The fact is children do not occupy an innocent world of their own; they are very much a part of the nasty, adult universe. At one level, then, the teacher's murder is indicative of a collective failure of society — our schools cannot remain untouched when the world outside is not peaceful, fair and just. But we need also to pursue remedies at the school level itself, including counselling and other early warning systems that can help children cope with the stress and strain of learning.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/murder-in-the-classroom/article2879926.ece
11,2,2012,A past that will not pass,"Consider this for the volatility of present times in Gujarat. On Wednesday, the Gujarat High Court lit into the Narendra Modi government, accusing it of “inaction and negligence” resulting in the destruction of over 500 Muslim places of worship during the 2002 post-Godhra pogrom. Rejecting the State government's portrayal of the violence as a “general reaction” to the February 27, 2002 Sabarmati Express carnage, a bench of Acting Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice J.B. Pardiwala ordered compensation to be paid for the defilement and destruction, noting that in the absence of police intelligence and “appropriate” preventive action, “anarchy” had reigned “unabated” in Gujarat. Twenty-four hours after the sledgehammer indictment came news of a different kind: Mr. Modi had been cleared of the charge of abetting the 2002 violence in a final report filed to the magisterial court by the Special Investigation Team probing Zakia Jafri's omnibus complaint against the Chief Minister and 61 others. Of course, with the SIT's report locked in the secret vaults of the magisterial court and amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran taking a contrarian view in the same case, it is clear that the last word on the question of criminality will not be said for some time.
Yet none of this could stop sections of the BJP from exulting over Mr. Modi's “victory” or his imminent promotion to Prime Minister of India. Mr. Modi himself tweeted: “The history of the world is the history of a few men who had faith in themselves…” Similar misplaced celebrations had marked the Supreme Court's September 12, 2011 order, directing the trial court to hear Ms Jafri's complaint. Mr. Modi had then tweeted, “God is great”, blithely obfuscating the truth that the apex court had in fact fast-tracked proceedings in the case. The Chief Minister's camp followers will do well to show some restraint, not least because his administration has come in for repeated censure by courts in the past year. The SIT's conclusions and reasoning will be publicly known and debated, including in these columns, once the magistrate concerned makes all relevant documents available to the petitioners. The court's own decision on the matter — whether to accept or reject the closure report – will doubtless be litigated by one side or the other. But whatever the final view taken by the courts on his individual legal culpability for the tragedy of Gujarat, Mr. Modi should know this much. The fact that he remained — at best — a mute spectator to the killing of hundreds of innocent citizens and did nothing to ensure justice for the victims afterwards is a moral and political badge of dishonour that will ensure the higher office his supporters seek for him remains out of reach.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-past-that-will-not-pass/article2879925.ece
13,2,2012,The best way out,"This was a legal battle he could never have won. General V.K. Singh was determined to prove when he was actually born — a matter of fact. The Supreme Court, on the other hand, was interested in how his age should be determined as per service matters — a matter of interpretation. As a result, the raft of documents, including a birth certificate and a school leaving certificate, which conclusively establish that General Singh was born on May 10, 1951 as he insists became irrelevant in the case. What was germane was that he was shown as being born a year earlier in “the official service record” — an anomaly that was not set right. General Singh had raised this issue within the Army and with the civilian authorities in 2007. But what apparently went against him was an acknowledgement, made reluctantly and under some pressure, that 1950 could be accepted as his year of birth before he was made GOC-in-C (Eastern Command). While the Supreme Court may have forced him to withdraw his petition, it is important to highlight there was no slur on his integrity, which the Bench said it had complete faith in. Nothing can take away from General Singh's ability and accomplishments. A highly decorated 1971 war veteran, he is widely recognised as a brilliant strategist and as a reform-oriented officer who tried hard to restore the image of an Army whose image had been blighted by corruption scandals such as Adarsh and Sukna.
In a way, the Supreme Court has pulled off a diplomatic coup. By ensuring that the petition is withdrawn, it has avoided the ugly situation of having to pass an adverse order against the Army Chief. At the same time, having highlighted his commitment to the nation, the Court prevailed on the Centre to withdraw its December 30, 2011 order that had rejected General Singh's complaint against fixing his date of birth as May 10, 1950. In words infused with the pragmatism that underscored the Supreme Court's attitude in this case, the bench observed: “Wise people are those who move with the wind. We are more concerned with the morale of the army and the right message should go from here — 13 lakh army personnel are watching this court.” The Court must have been aware of the implications of making an exception for General Singh on the age issue. In a system where promotions and retirements are determined substantially by date of birth, doing so would have encouraged others to seek changes in their dates of birth. The Court was also probably cognisant of the fact that when General Singh retires has implications for the promotions of other senior Army officials, apart from his successor. All in all, the Court found the best way out of a tricky impasse.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-best-way-out/article2886264.ece
13,2,2012,Like/Comment/Shares,"In one of the world's most widely anticipated IPOs, or initial public offerings of stocks, Facebook has just taken the first important statutory steps by filing papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington. If all goes as planned, the company will begin to sell stock by May and start trading on the stock exchange soon thereafter. The prospectus has lots more information besides what is of immediate interest to investors. The IPO has the potential to change the internet sector, creating what will be one of the most valuable internet and technology companies. Analysts say that Facebook is aiming for a far greater offering than the $5 billion planned initially. Its IPO could well be the largest by any company, bigger than Google's in 2004 and Netscape's a decade earlier. Its valuation could be somewhere in the region of $75 to $100 billion, at which point Facebook would be much bigger than many long-established American companies including Abbot Laboratories, Goldman Sachs and Ford. Mind-boggling as this scale is, it suggests that stock markets in the U.S., though weighed down by macroeconomic concerns, are still willing to reward exceptional players.
Facebook, started in a Harvard dormitory room less than eight years ago, says it has 845 million users worldwide. Its prospectus sheds some light on how its meteoric run has turned it into a formidable money making machine. Quite unlike other Silicon Valley start ups which have seen plenty of growth but meagre revenues, Facebook recorded a revenue of $3.7 billion last year on which it earned an amazing $1 billion. Its free cash flow rose from $190 billion in 2010 to $470 billion the next year, while its shareholders' equity increased from $2.2 billion to $4.9 billion during the same period. A public listing of its shares will bring it even more visibility and cash flows but will make it accountable to a larger number of shareholders. The public offer will make millionaires out of its employees and existing investors and its already wealthy CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who will retain a 28.7 per cent stake, even wealthier. Analysts have however warned that small investors out to make quick money might be disappointed. Facebook's growth in the West has been slowing and for all its billions, it makes a small sum — just over one dollar last year — on a per-user basis. Ironically, Facebook does not need capital and is going public mainly to comply with regulations. Without a tangible plan to invest the bulk of the issue proceeds, the company's future profitability might suffer.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/likecommentshares/article2886267.ece
14,2,2012,Rein in Mr. Khursheed,"A firm and quick end must be put to Law Minister Salman Khursheed's brazen defiance of the Election Commission of India. It is most unseemly that someone in charge of a ministry that oversees justice and legal affairs in this country should tangle with a constitutional authority, and that too over an issue on which he has no plausible defence. If the EC was persuaded to write to President Pratibha Patil “seeking immediate and decisive” intervention — an unusual step insofar as such a course of action is not prescribed by statute anywhere — it is precisely because Mr. Khursheed chose repeatedly to violate the Model Code of Conduct in the overheated election campaign to the Uttar Pradesh Assembly. He seems far from chastened by the EC's censure for promising a nine per cent sub-quota for minorities (read Muslims) out of the 27 per cent reservation in jobs and educational institutions for the Other Backward Classes. Mr. Khursheed's defence for what he did is disingenuous. He had argued, and incorrectly, that carving out job quotas for minorities from existing reservation for OBCs was a Congress election manifesto promise; moreover, he had maintained that this was only a conditional declaration of intent in the event of the Congress coming to power and not a policy announcement. As the EC correctly concluded, the simple question that needed to be settled was whether he had violated the Model Code of Conduct by making a new promise — something the facts clearly showed he had.
The issue has become much too contentious and significant to be brushed under the carpet with platitudinous remarks. Congress general secretary Janardan Dwivedi's remark that all Congressmen must speak as “per the norms of public life and the law of the land” is a piece of unapologetic evasion. Others who suggest Mr. Khursheed said what he did in the election campaign as a Congressman and not a Minister are making light of the fact that a constitutional authority has charged the Law Minister with improper conduct. It will be a huge embarrassment for the Congress as well as the Central government if a quick and unconditional apology — coupled with an assurance that there will be no future violations of the Model Code — cannot be forced out of Mr. Khursheed. The purpose of the Code is to ensure a level playing field for all political parties and contestants — to see that our polls are as free and fair as possible. To merely distance itself from Mr. Khursheed's campaign rhetoric is not enough. It is imperative that the Central government and the Congress demonstrate their respect for the Election Commission and accept its rulings.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rein-in-mr-khursheed/article2889878.ece
14,2,2012,Regulating hospitals is healthy,"The proposed enhancement of public health expenditure in India as a percentage of GDP during the Twelfth Plan will deploy massive tax funds in a sector that is poorly regulated. If the government accepts the recommendation of the High Level Expert Group of the Planning Commission on Universal Health Coverage to increase government expenditure on health to 2.5 per cent of GDP from 1.2 per cent today, there will be an estimated five-fold increase in per capita public spending. It is inevitable that private health infrastructure is tapped to provide UHC, at least in the short term, while the government-run system is improved qualitatively and quantitatively. Such a massive increase in public spending requires a review of regulation of the entire sector, covering all categories of hospitals and clinical establishments. The Clinical Establishment Act, 2010 makes a beginning in this regard but it has a long way to go as it requires ratification by States to be applicable, except in Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Sikkim and Union Territories which are already covered. It is essential that State governments move quickly to ratify the Central Act, considering that they are committing huge public funds for health insurance schemes to purchase care from private hospitals.
Benchmarking care is a standard requirement for hospitals and clinical facilities in the developed world. India's efforts in this regard remain fragmented, with the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers, the Indian Public Health Standards, and the Clinical Establishment Act attempting to define standards. What the country needs is one integrated standards and regulatory system, requiring compulsory registration and regulation. The decision of the NABH to make surprise visits to hospitals to verify uniform adherence to its standards is certainly welcome, but incremental approaches will not do. A single empowered national standards body is needed, and the Planning Commission group has a worthwhile recommendation on forming a national regulatory body, State units and subsidiary agencies to evolve protocols, accreditation and evaluation norms. Somewhat disappointingly, a section of medical professionals has opposed such measures on the ground that it would unleash an inspector raj. Such a prospect can be avoided by building a transparent system that mandates pro-active disclosure for all stakeholders. As things stand, the medical community does have a genuine demand for clear rules under the Act. Achieving high standards in healthcare and empowerment of patients is not possible without standard-setting and strong regulation. Laissez faire cannot deliver.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/regulating-hospitals-is-healthy/article2889880.ece
15,2,2012,Painting fangs on a lamb,"Ever since Monday's near-successful assassination of an Israeli diplomat in New Delhi, India's media have opened a 24x7 barrage of speculation about who carried out the attack. The question is important, but Indians ought to apply their minds to a more important issue nearer home: the dysfunction that continues to characterise the country's counter-terrorism infrastructure. Even though the attack took place less than 500 metres from the Prime Minister's official residence, there was no system in place to cordon off the area. Closed-circuit television images are reportedly inadequate to establish details of the licence-plate on the motorcycle used by the perpetrator. For more than an hour after the bombing, Delhi Police officials continued to tell journalists the fire was caused by the explosion of the car's compressed-gas cylinder — even though, it turned out, the diesel-burning vehicle had none. Terrorist groups targeting India, rather than Israel, will be paying close attention to this depressing litany of failures.
More than three years after 26/11, this much is clear: despite their shiny new guns and made-for-TV uniforms, India's new-model police forces work just like their predecessors. Last month, Maharashtra's élite special weapons and tactics units did nothing for over 45 minutes while a crazed bus driver rampaged through Pune. The credit for stopping the carnage went to an uncelebrated local resident who chased down the bus. Emergency services were missing in action after bombings in Delhi and Mumbai, and critical evidence lost because of crime-scene contamination. India's coastal security project was mercilessly exposed when two ships — which could have been carrying anything from terrorist assault teams to chemical and nuclear weapons — washed up undetected off Mumbai. The roots of these failures lie in exceptionally poor training. India does not have a single world-class institution for teaching investigation, forensics, intelligence or tactical skills. Recent expansion of manpower has sharpened the strains; the Intelligence Bureau, for example, has slashed training time from six months to three, while the Central Reserve Police Force's academies are choked. Language experts and skilled intelligence officers are conspicuous by their absence. Later this month, Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram will open a new national counter-terrorism centre, which is meant to mate intelligence with investigation and emergency responses. The truth is this: India's intelligence is thin, investigation skills appalling and emergency response infrastructure non-existent. Painting fangs on this lamb won't fool anyone — least of all terrorists who mean India harm.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/painting-fangs-on-a-lamb/article2893820.ece
15,2,2012,"Sen, the moral universalist","The United States National Medal of Arts and Humanities awarded Monday to Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen — the first non-American to be conferred the rare honour — speaks to the universalism of his contributions in economics and philosophy over the past five decades. This has been in evidence, most recently, in the interventions of Sen, Lamont Professor of Philosophy at Harvard University, on the global financial crisis and the consequent economic meltdown. In the immediate aftermath of the 2008 housing and banking collapse, a policy consensus quickly built up in Europe and the U.S. around the adoption of more or less Keynesian stimulus policies to generate employment and productivity. But at the first, premature sign of the global crisis abating, many countries embraced fiscal austerity as the answer to balance their budgets. Professor Sen forcefully articulated his own response to tackling the crisis in the context of calls for the creation of a new capitalism. He pointed out that in all the world's leading industrial economies without exception, the major institutions underpinned by exchanges in the market were sustained and strengthened by innumerable transactions that took place outside the framework of the market. These were the provision of social welfare, pension and unemployment benefits. Citing verse and passage to show that the father of modern economics, Adam Smith, was in fact no champion of unbridled free markets, his point was to emphasise the interdependency among a multitude of institutions as key to well-functioning markets, while also underscoring the serious consequences to the U.S. economy of the removal of New Deal regulations.
Equally noteworthy is Prof. Sen's contribution on the commission headed by Joseph Stiglitz to suggest ways to measure economic performance. Of immense relevance is the point that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was conceived as a metric originally only to monitor cyclical fluctuations of the market, not to measure societal well-being. Hence, his criticism of the Indian elites for chasing GDP targets over more substantial goals such as universal guarantees of basic health care and education. Prof. Sen's widely celebrated capabilities approach to human empowerment influenced in no small measure the formulation of the United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Index. He has emphasised liberal, plural democracy as the pre-eminent and universal value of the 20th century. Popular struggles such as the Arab Spring are perhaps pointers to the widening reach of democracy into areas hitherto under the grip of authoritarian regimes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sen-the-moral-universalist/article2893817.ece
16,2,2012,A level flying field,"The government's new flight plan for flying overseas has not come a day too soon. Changes have been in the works for some time, and given the mess that national carrier Air India finds itself in, the withdrawal of the sole right to operate foreign flights was only to be expected. The Union Civil Aviation Ministry has now opened up the flights and seats under existing bilateral Air Service Agreements (ASA) to all scheduled airlines in India. With more private airlines qualifying to fly abroad under the original aviation framework of operating for at least five years on domestic routes, it has become imperative to open more routes for them. Under the existing system, Air India had the sole right to utilise capacity under the ASAs. Due to this restriction — and because of the political and bureaucratic mismanagement which robbed the airline of the ability to use these routes — hardly 20 per cent of the quota available for India under these bilateral aviation agreements was utilised. The capacity was either going abegging, or foreign airlines took permission to operate additional flights. Now, qualified private Indian airlines will find it easier to fly out to more foreign destinations and thereby improve their bottomlines. Of course, they will have to submit operation plans and satisfy the authorities on the availability of aircraft.
Viewed along with the recent permission being granted to airlines to import ATF or aviation fuel, this marks another positive step to liberate Indian airlines from the financial complications they have got into. Though India's skies opened up long ago and private carriers have overtaken Air India and Indian Airlines in many respects, they have not found it easy to secure flying rights to foreign destinations. Air India not only enjoyed exclusive rights, but also the right of first refusal because of the historic monopoly it enjoyed. Given its inability to be competitive domestically, the national carrier saw foreign operations as crucial. Stricken by persistent financial crisis, and the inability to acquire new aircraft, Air India was unable to utilise the available capacity of flights and seats under the bilateral ASAs, which India has hammered out with 109 countries. These aviation pacts may still have a place, but ultimately, the world is moving towards a clear 'Open Skies' regime in which passenger choice will hold the key. So Indian airlines will have to learn to be attractive and competitive, both in fares and facilities. It is up to the Union Civil Aviation Ministry to regularly monitor the utilisation of capacity, and also ensure that airlines in India meet the highest global standards.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-level-flying-field/article2897266.ece
16,2,2012,Greek bailout myths,"The last-minute cancellation of a eurozone ministerial meeting to confirm a joint European Union-International Monetary Fund package worth €130 billion exemplifies the chaos and mistrust around the eurozone's attempts to rescue the Greek economy, despite the fact that Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has got an austerity plan passed by 199 to 74 in the 300-seat Hellenic Parliament. The plan itself requires reductions worth €3.3 billion in wages, pensions, and jobs during the first year alone; in return, a bond swap is to cut the country's €350-billion debt by 100 billion, reducing the debt burden to 120 per cent of GDP. The Greek parliament has also voted to recapitalise banks, a process which could involve nationalisation. The public, however, has for months shown its anger at the cuts, and in the protests leading up to the February 13 vote in Athens the trade unions added to a 48-hour strike by calling for a demonstration on the voting day itself. While the media focused on violence in which 120 were injured and several buildings burnt down, 100,000 people stayed on through the violence and the tear-gas. Furthermore, New Democracy party leader and coalition supporter Antonis Samaras says he cannot promise not to revise the deal's terms after the April general election. He has thereby infuriated the eurozone leaders but he is hardly alone, as nearly 40 MPs in two of the coalition parties, his own and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), voted against the package.
Opposition to the rescue plan may well be justified. Even the business body, the Federation of Hellenic Enterprises (SEV), resists the proposed 22 per cent cut in the minimum wage and the probable end to various bonuses in private-sector jobs. Secondly, it is not clear if saving the banks will mean buyouts or bailouts; if it means the latter, then Greece could, like the United Kingdom, find that rescued banks worsen the recession by curtailing their lending. In addition, hedge funds have a vested interest in the plan's failure, as they can profit from insurance they have taken out against a national default. Above all, the evidence gives clear cause for concern. Privatisation realised only €1.7 billion in 2011 as against the projected 5 billion, but more privatisation is part of the package. Most importantly, salary cuts and slashed public spending have caused a slump in demand and, therefore, in tax revenues, with consequent calls for yet more state cuts. What Greece needs instead is systemic improvement of its ramshackle tax-collection system and far more investment in solid production, but the eurozone proposals neglect that and will almost certainly exacerbate Greece's problems.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/greek-bailout-myths/article2897270.ece
17,2,2012,Encounter at mid-sea,"Nothing can remotely explain, let alone justify, the killing of two Indian fishermen by Italian Navy marines on board a merchant vessel who mistook them for pirates. In recent years, commercial vessels have been tormented by Somali pirates who have held ships and crew to ransom, often for months. Merchant ships need to be aware of the risks involved in sailing in certain regions but there can be no cause for panic at the first sight of an approaching craft. From available accounts, the Italian personnel on board the Enrica Lexie did not follow international protocols in dealing with a suspect boat. Warning shots were apparently fired, but the Italian vessel did not do evasive manoeuvres before deciding that the fishing boat actually carried pirates, and not fishermen. The Italian ship ought to have changed course and watched for the boat tailing it before taking drastic measures. Contrary to the Italian ship's claims, the fishermen were not armed; they were waiting for the ship to pass before proceeding further. In any case, common sense would suggest that the area, 14 nautical miles off Alappuzha in Kerala, was not a danger zone. Somali pirates do range over long distances but are certainly not likely to operate bang off the south-western coast of India. Nine of the other 11 fishermen in the boat were sleeping, and no matter what the Italian ship's crew claim to have seen through their binoculars, the boat posed no visible threat.
Although India summoned the Italian Ambassador and registered its protest at the killing, this nasty incident calls for concerted efforts among governments to prevent similar mid-sea misadventures. India is part of the global effort to patrol the piracy-affected sea lanes of the Indian Ocean, but not enough seems to have been done to prevent tragic mix-ups of the kind that cost the lives of two innocent men on Thursday. If the fishermen knew that armed guards are likely to be aboard merchant vessels looking at all boats with suspicion, they would have stayed further away from the Enrica Lexie. As it happened, neither the marines nor the fishermen expected to encounter each other. One of the fishermen killed is from Tamil Nadu, where fishing boats have often come under attack from the Sri Lankan Navy for crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line. On the eve of 26/11, sailors from Gujarat were killed on the high seas by terrorists. While taking steps at the international level to guard against the killing of innocents on the high seas, India's unsuspecting fishermen also need to be made aware of the different kinds of dangers they might have to face in pursuit of their livelihood. Sadly, the sea and its creatures are no longer the only challenge facing our mariners.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/encounter-at-midsea/article2900922.ece
17,2,2012,Paper chase,"In the era of the iPad and Kindle, good old-fashioned paper still holds its own. Each year, the world consumes more than 300 million tonnes of it, and consumption has grown by 400 per cent over the past 40 years. But there are issues to address in managing its use — and re-use. Wasteful use of paper by individuals and the corporate world is one concern, although the newspaper industry, for instance, has over the years managed to bring down the wastage rate. A more important issue relates to the optimal recycling of ‘post-consumer,' or used, paper. The Union government's Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion has taken the right initiative — albeit rather belatedly — by floating a Discussion Paper on the collection and recycling of waste paper as a prelude to formulating a national policy. Such a policy could lay down guidelines and procedures and sensitise citizens and industry-consumers to improve segregation, collection and reuse to evolve a sustainable mechanism to achieve a significant level of recovery.
The use of recycled cellulosic fibre for paper-making has been picking up globally. In India, the share of this raw material has risen from 7 per cent in 1970 to 47 per cent in 2011. This has reduced dependence on wood from 84 per cent in 1970 to 31 per cent in 2011. Waste paper imports for this purpose cost India about a billion dollars in 2011; the figure was $5.1 million in 1980. This is because waste paper recovery here is only 27 per cent currently, as opposed to 73 per cent in Germany, for example. In India, the collection of waste paper and other paper products such as corrugated cartons is today an industry in itself, providing income and employment opportunities to a large workforce of semi-skilled and skilled people in the informal sector. But this operation requires a better business model to facilitate an integrated system of collection, source segregation and scientific handling, and a mandated mechanism. Projects launched by the Bangalore and Hyderabad Municipal Corporations to develop waste collection ventures are steps in the right direction. The stakeholders, especially those in the private sector, should support the government's initiative and help shape a policy that would help them, the environment, and the workforce involved by means of institutional mechanisms. Industry and chambers of commerce should evolve voluntary guidelines to contribute to an efficient system of waste paper collection. After all, removing as much paper as possible from the garbage cycle and channelling it through organised methods would not only significantly reduce the environmental load on the eco-system but also lower, even eliminate, the import bill.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/paper-chase/article2900923.ece
18,2,2012,The right to vend,"With national urban policies repeatedly failing to improve access to cities and protect the livelihood rights of those who live in them, the hope and effort of more than 10 million street vendors lies in pushing the government to enact a Central law to secure their rights. But where policies have failed, will a new law help? The recent national consultation on urban street vending has made it clear, despite four decades of struggle, that hawkers and mobile vendors still find Indian cities reluctant to include them. While cities are willing to accommodate on-street car parking, they view handcarts used for vending and providing services on roads as a hindrance. As a result, the low income, self-employed street vendors often face harassment and the threat of eviction. To correct this unfair situation, a national policy on urban street vendors, formulated in 2004, recommended that states and local bodies register street vendors, issue identification cards, and amend legislation to mitigate their vulnerability. The key proposal was to formulate Town Vending Committees at the ward level with vendor representation to identify areas for hawking. This policy had no impact. Instead of finding innovative ways to improve its implementation, the government formulated a new policy in 2009. This too has failed. Barring a handful of cities, neither has registration been completed, nor spaces adequately earmarked for vending.
The stark contrast between such a lukewarm response and the enthusiastic state promotion of organised retail is conspicuous. The Central government cannot hide behind the excuse that urban development is a state subject. If it has the will, as witnessed in the case of urban renewal projects, it can effectively influence city level policies through various financial incentives. With states also showing no commitment, and cities such as Mumbai and Ahmedabad pursuing irrational cut-off lines which bar a large number of vendors from getting a licence, the street vendors' decision to press for legislation is understandable. The logic is that a Central law, which can be enacted under the concurrent list that includes economic planning and labour welfare, will help enforce their rights through courts. However, enforcement would remain an issue and needs attention. Equally important is the creation of more spaces such as vendors' markets within existing cities and growing suburbs. The Central government must sincerely pursue its promise to secure dedicated funds in the forthcoming 12th five-year plan for such activities. Improving financial assistance and training of hawkers would also be critical. Co-opting street vendors is a necessary and important step towards making our cities inclusive and equitable.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-right-to-vend/article2904484.ece
18,2,2012,Don't ignore the adults,"The number of people around the world, including children under five, who have died from malaria has been steadily declining since 2004. But the sobering news is that the number of deaths worldwide in 2010 from this disease is more than 1.24 million, almost double the figure previously estimated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for the same year. The result was published recently in The Lancet journal. Though children under five should account for most deaths, an unexpected finding is that the proportion of older children and adults succumbing to malaria is high — “almost always more than 40 per cent.” For instance, it is 76 per cent in Asia, and 69 per cent in the case of both North America and South America. Compared with grown-up children and adults, mortality in children under five in south and Southeast Asia constitutes only a “small proportion” of the global deaths. In the case of India, in 2010, less than 5,000 younger children and 42,000 above five died. This goes against the grain of acquired resistance seen in adults living in endemic regions. While individuals of all age groups in these areas quite frequently suffer from malarial infections, younger children with naturally weaker immunity are at a greater risk of dying. Those who escape death tend to develop resistance gradually and hence are less likely to be killed later in life when infected. Hence higher mortality in adults reflects lower immunity, probably due to reduced infection during childhood. The vital message is that while continuing to focus on those below five, older children and adults cannot be ignored in any malaria protection programmes.
The research has a limitation. Part of the data used comes from less reliable verbal autopsies — where the probable cause of death is inferred based on interviews with the family of a deceased person. But researchers are often compelled to use verbal autopsies as many developing countries, India included, do not have national registries that have highly reliable and robust data of the cause of death. Hence the true scale and distribution of several diseases is never known. This not only hampers research, but greatly affects policy-building process and funding priorities. India cannot complain, and has only itself to blame, when policies and guidelines drawn by global agencies like the WHO ignore the ground reality. After all, the WHO uses sketchy data available in research papers and undependable figures recorded in registries. It is time India realised that the first step to prevent and control diseases is by having a proper registration system in place to record the cause of all deaths.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dont-ignore-the-adults/article2904482.ece
19,2,2012,Spies shouldn't police us,"In September, 1970, J. Edgar Hoover wrote a secret memo which pithily explained the difference between criminal investigators and spies: the “purpose of counter-intelligence action,” it stated, “is to disrupt, and it is immaterial whether facts exist to substantiate the charge.” Four decades on, as Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram prepares to give teeth to India's new National Counter-Terrorism Centre, the words of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's legendary — and paranoiac — founding director should help Indians understand why the idea is profoundly misguided. For years now, India's intelligence services have complained — sometimes with justification — that State governments have been reluctant to act on credible intelligence of counter-terrorism value. Political motives, they point out, have led governments as disparate as Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar not to arrest figures involved with Hindutva, Islamist or Maoist groups. India's Constitution, Mr. Chidambaram has pointed out, makes it incumbent on the Central government to “maintain internal security.” The Ministry of Home Affairs' proposal to arm the NCTC with the power to conduct searches and make arrests derives, he argues, from this obligation.
Mr. Chidambaram may be right about the Constitution but there are three sound reasons why the mounting concerns over the NCTC must be taken seriously. First, the Intelligence Bureau is not an organisation that is, or ought to be, concerned with criminal justice. Like other intelligence services across the world, its task is to gather information that the police can use to guide and inform the course of a criminal investigation, not to make judgments on whether that intelligence has value as evidence. Blurring the distinction between intelligence-gathering and policing will open up the possibility of abuses — abuses for which Hoover's FBI became notorious. The Union government already has an investigative service with a nationwide mandate, the National Investigation Agency. This makes it even less clear why the NCTC needs the same powers. In India, secondly, the concerns are amplified because the IB has historically taken an expansive view of national security — notably, by devoting extensive resources to political surveillance. Handing it the power to arrest will expand the possibility of political misuse. Thirdly, as experts have pointed out, India's counter-terrorism efforts have floundered because State police forces lack the training, resources and manpower needed to conduct effective investigations. Arming the NCTC with the power to arrest will not solve this core problem. Like other intelligence-related reforms, the NCTC's powers ought to have been subject to an informed and vigorous debate in Parliament. It still isn't too late to conduct one.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/spies-shouldnt-police-us/article2910679.ece
19,2,2012,Make the pact workable,"For Mamata Banerjee to lay at the doors of the Central government the whole blame for the delay in implementation of the July 2011 agreement for the formation of an autonomous administrative set-up for the Darjeeling hills is less than charitable. Having gone ahead and claimed a breakthrough on the long-simmering issue rather prematurely, she doubtless needs to save face as the prospect of fresh trouble looms. But the fact remains that the manner in which the tripartite agreement was signed without figuring out ways to address all the substantive questions, involved essentially a tactic of political one-upmanship vis-à-vis the preceding Left Front government that really had not spared any effort to solve the issue in a sensible manner. The Shyamal Sen Committee, tasked with looking into “the question of identification of additional areas in Siliguri, Terai and Dooars that may be transferred to the new Body,” is still at work. The territorial issue is a crucial component of the formula set out, and if presidential assent for the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration Bill that was passed by the State Assembly in September is not yet forthcoming, it is not a mystery why. The wishes of the people of the areas in question will need to be factored in before conclusive decisions are taken, in order to avoid incendiary outcomes. As yet, there does not seem to be any solution in view for this problem within the problem.
After meeting the West Bengal Chief Minister earlier this month, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leaders did seem to soften somewhat their threat to start a fresh agitation for implementation of the agreement. But their persisting with the term “statehood,” even if as a pressure tactic, does not augur well. This slogan needs to be resisted — as Ms Banerjee rightly and promptly did by stressing her opposition to any division, and underlining the importance of a unified Bengal. The liberal financial package that the Central government offered for the development of the region as an incentive for peace, and the Chief Minister's emphasis on the development of the north Bengal region, are both commendable. But for the restive region, this is not enough. It seems fair to say that as things stand, unless the GJM adopts a more pragmatic approach on its territorial claims, if necessary by agreeing to renegotiate the terms of the pact while managing the feelings of its constituency, a real and workable solution would remain elusive. Meanwhile, the Chief Minister should give up the politically expedient blame game — and stop running with the hares and hunting with the hounds.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/make-the-pact-workable/article2910680.ece
21,2,2012,The Railways need funds,"There has never been a dearth of committees and reviews in the government set up, and the Indian Railways is no exception to this. Look at the number of high-level committees, status reports, white papers, expert committees, safety reviews and what have you. The catch lies in the acceptance and implementation of the recommendations of these panels. The Kakodkar high-level railway safety review committee, which submitted its recommendations to Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi on Friday, is the latest addition to the list. It may not have said anything new or different from the past but it has chosen to tell the Railways how to mobilise the funds for a long overdue, massive safety upgrade programme over the next five years, with an estimate for Rs.1 lakh crore. What needs to be done for toning up railway safety is already well known: modern signalling, doing away with unmanned level crossings, replacing over-aged assets, and even introducing a new generation of coaches. Again, there is nothing new in recommending such a major programme. Way back in 2001, the Government of India, at the instance of the Indian Railways, set up a Special Railway Safety Fund to wipe out the arrears in major on-going projects such as track renewal, rolling stock, construction of over-bridges and so on. A minor surcharge was levied on users.
What's new about the Kakodkar committee is that it tells the Railways how to generate that level of funding. But is anybody listening? The committee has broken up the Rs.1 lakh crore programme into different components: Rs.20,000 crore for advanced signalling, Rs.50,000 crore for elimination of all level crossings, Rs.10,000 crore for new-design coaches, and Rs.20,000 crore for maintenance of safety-related infrastructure. The committee has suggested among other things, a safety cess on passengers to generate about Rs.5,000 crore every year, and doing away with the dividend payment of Rs.5,000 crore to the Government of India. After Nitish Kumar brought the Railways back from the brink, and Lalu Prasad took all the credit for prudent financial management, Mamata Banerjee had virtually brought the Indian Railways to a situation of a financial collapse. Even now, her nominee in Rail Bhavan, Dinesh Trivedi, seems utterly unwilling to raise passenger fares. For 10 years, there has been no revision. And he expects the Finance Minister to grant him a budget support of Rs.20,000 crore or more next month. It is time the Planning Commission and Finance Ministry took a serious look at the state of the Railways. For if India's biggest employer is unwilling to take even small steps towards better managing its finances, there is no sense in it having a separate annual budget.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-railways-need-funds/article2913654.ece
21,2,2012,"Maximum city, minimum will","Shiv Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray was among the few who was confident of a fourth successive victory in the Mumbai civic polls. While the Sena's tally reduced by nine, unexpectedly its chief ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), fared better. Having lost badly in the 2009 Lok Sabha and assembly elections, the Sena was determined not to give up power in its last bastion. Its extensive cadres, women candidates and the appeal of Bal Thackeray delivered the goods once again. Yet the results must worry the Sena. Its main rival, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), managed to win 28 seats in Mumbai, some in key Sena strongholds. The Sena's tally of 75 is lower than the last few elections and it has lost ground steadily over the years. The BJP is concerned about this not only in Mumbai but in other parts of the State, in Pune and Nashik too, where the MNS has made substantial inroads with a total of 112 seats in 10 corporations, roughly half that of the Sena. The saffron combine's task was made easier by the disarray in the Congress party in the city. Its alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) to unite the “secular vote” did not help as the Samajwadi Party drew away a sizable section of Muslim voters. In addition, the Congress-NCP badly missed its long-time ally, Ramdas Athavale of the Republican Party of India (RPI), who sided with the saffron parties. The Congress cut a sorry figure in the city and the constant mudslinging with the NCP robbed both of any glory or dignity. The alliance was based on past calculations which did not work.
The MNS not only cut into Sena votes but also that of the Congress and the NCP. Raj Thackeray had two road shows and one public meeting. He did not promise much and in lieu of a manifesto, there was an advertisement a day before the polls. The anti- North Indian rhetoric was not much in evidence from either Uddhav or Raj. While the race for supremacy between the Thackeray cousins is here to stay, what does a fourth term for the Shiv Sena hold for Mumbaikars? After 16 years of Sena rule, the city resembles the worst type of urban sprawl with pathetic living conditions. A glossy booklet of claims notwithstanding, can the saffron combine do something to uplift the life of people or will it be another saga of corruption and potholes? Mumbai needs planning, organisation and governance, not dug up roads, overflowing garbage and chaos. The Sena must seek pride in the running of a streamlined city and not just in the beautiful swimming pools or parks that it has built. The task before the corporation is enormous but not impossible. As one of the richest corporations in India, it has the funds. What it has lacked, alas, is the will.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/maximum-city-minimum-will/article2913658.ece
22,2,2012,Working for labour,"If the country's trade unions expected progress on the vexed question of a minimum wage guarantee at the 44th Indian Labour Conference, their hopes may have been dashed by the United Progressive Alliance government. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's inaugural address last week made no mention of implementing a National Floor Level Minimum Wage (NFLMW). Never mind that the application of the 1948 law to all establishments irrespective of the number of workers engaged was uppermost on the conference agenda. The current NFLMW fixed by the Centre in April 2011 is Rs.115 a day. But under the 1948 law, States are free to set their own minimum. As a result, the rates range from a maximum of Rs.203 a day in the National Capital Region of Delhi, to a meagre 68.96 in Andhra Pradesh as on March 2011. Significantly, as many as 21 States still fall below the national minimum, whereas 14 pay wages above that amount. Amendments to the Minimum Wages Act are thus critical to a guaranteed subsistence income for millions of unskilled labourers, including women, who fall well below the standard human development indicators.
Similarly, the Prime Minister's statements on social security for employees amount to an endorsement of the erroneous view that the protections currently available to the organised sector are coming in the way of job creation. “We must periodically take a critical look [at] whether our regulatory framework has some parts which unnecessarily hamper the growth of employment, enterprise and industry without really contributing significantly to labour welfare,” said Dr. Singh. There is a particularly hollow ring to these remarks made in the context of a country where employment in the organised sector constitutes barely seven per cent of the total workforce. Implicit in this is the reasoning that expenditure on the workforce is a burden, rather than a necessary investment to enhance value and raise the productivity of enterprises. It is necessary to emphasise here that in countries that have embarked upon the deregulation of labour markets, social and welfare protection mechanisms exist which provide a society-wide cushion to the unemployed or indigent. Moreover, attempts to dismantle these protections have met with strong public protests, particularly in Europe. India's trade unions have had a considerable and highly constructive presence in the banking, insurance and telecommunications industries in the public sector for some decades now. While they have time and again opposed the divestment of government stakes in these enterprises, an inability to organise the workforce in the information and communications technology sector has been a singular failure. It is time the concerns of this segment were also addressed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/working-for-labour/article2916971.ece
22,2,2012,Taking German lessons,"The resignation of German President Christian Wulff has diminished the standing of Chancellor Angela Merkel but the episode confirms the strength of the country's public processes. Mr. Wulff resigned on February 17 after months of scandal over murky financial dealings and more recent attempts to suppress reportage of these by leaving threatening voicemail messages for the editors of two newspapers. Mr. Wulff is the second Merkel presidential nominee in under two years to quit amid controversy; his predecessor, Horst Köhler, resigned in 2010 after claiming that deploying troops abroad benefited the German economy. The allegations against Mr. Wulff are that during his term as Minister President of Lower Saxony from 2003 to 2010, he had not told the State Assembly about a €500,000 home loan, which he later managed to refinance at a discounted rate. He had also taken holidays in wealthy friends' villas in Tuscany and Mallorca respectively, and another friend paid for the Wulff family's upgrade at a luxury Munich hotel.
The President's departure certainly damages Germany domestically and internationally, not least by exposing the Chancellor's poor judgment. German criticism of improprieties in other countries also loses weight. Germany, of course, has had other corruption problems. In 2000, Helmut Kohl, former Chancellor and leader of Ms Merkel's own party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), had to admit his party had received two million deutschmarks in undeclared donations, mainly from arms-industry lobbyists; he resigned the party's honorary presidency. As for Mr. Wulff, he has been hoist by his own petard; he himself passed strict laws on public officials' conduct in Lower Saxony, where state-school teachers have been prosecuted for accepting free tickets to amusement parks. Yet the quality of Germany's body politic is shown by public anger over the demeaning of the highest national office, which carries much power: among other things, the President can veto legislation, nominate a replacement Chancellor, and dissolve the federal parliament. In addition, public prosecutors in the Lower Saxony capital, Hanover, have asked the Bundestag to lift Mr. Wulff's immunity from prosecution. The contrast with India, where governments and prosecutors must be dragged kicking and screaming to court before they agree to investigate and prosecute politicians accused of corruption couldn't be greater. Germany has provided a clear lesson in what substantive probity in public life can mean.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/taking-german-lessons/article2916973.ece
23,2,2012,The model code ain't broke,"If elections in India have become freer and fairer over the past two decades, the credit largely should go to the Election Commission. Much to the discomfiture of political parties and governments, the EC has carried out its watchdog role without succumbing to the pulls and pressures of those in power. True, there have been complaints of over-zealousness and ineffectiveness, but within their limited mandate, successive Commissions have done a lot to detoxify the electoral system of the blatant influence of money and muscle power. In this context, the United Progressive Alliance government's reported move to “look into the aspects where executive instructions of the Election Commission of India [are] required to be given statutory shape” smacks of a devious if ingenious way to curtail the powers of the supervisory body. Although couched in language that suggests the EC's instructions would be given statutory force, the agenda note for the meeting of the Group of Ministers on corruption, as published by the Indian Express on Wednesday, seems to have been drafted with the intent of taking out of the EC's purview any and all violations of the Model Code of Conduct.
The model code is central to the EC's efforts to prevent misuse of official machinery by parties in power, and to check electoral offences, malpractices and corruption during elections. While there can and should be a debate on strengthening the code's enforceability, it is essential that the need for change be shared by the EC and by political parties and that actual changes be the product of consensus between all stakeholders. In effect, statutory shape for the model code would mean violations being tried in court; in turn, the EC's practice of using the code to restrain parties and candidates might be jeopardised. This is why the EC itself, which once favoured making the code statutory, has a more guarded position today. Even now, the EC pursues major violations by having cases filed by the police and tried in court. But the code's true power springs from the EC's active, interventionist role in real time during electioneering and polling, and not from successful prosecution in cases of violation. Taking cases to their logical end is a necessary legal process, but this cannot serve as a deterrent to political parties and candidates intent on winning an election at any cost. Courts take years to decide, and often their rulings come well after the term of the legislature is over. For parties and candidates, there is then no real risk in a long-drawn legal battle. What they do fear, however, is the EC's hawk eye and its ability to deploy moral suasion. The model code may not be perfect but it certainly ain't broke. There is no need for the UPA to try and fix it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-model-code-aint-broke/article2920736.ece
23,2,2012,"All for trade, waiting for visa","Given the political turbulence in Pakistan, it was entirely expected that Commerce Minister Anand Sharma's visit would yield no dramatic outcomes. Even so, it was evident from the visit that both sides have a clear-headed joint, if not common, vision about bilateral trade. Without doubt, Pakistan recognises that it can shut itself out from India's economy only to its own disadvantage; India realises that it needs to draw down some of its own barriers in the interests of trading with Pakistan. Mr. Sharma's visit was the first by an Indian Commerce Minister for bilateral meetings, by itself a sign of how far the two countries have travelled in improving trade relations, not to speak of breaking through the logjam of mutual hostility, mistrust and suspicion that had set in after the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Underlining the “historic moment”, the joint communiqué was unambiguous that “[the] political leadership and the business communities have extended unequivocal support for full normalization and preferential trading arrangements between the two countries”. The substance of the talks makes it clear that despite the continuing political pressures on the Pakistan government against normalisation of trade with India, there is going to be no U-turn. The two sides signed three MoUs, on customs procedures, harmonising standards, and grievance redress in case of disputes between traders. In further evidence that things are looking up, central bank representatives of both countries will meet next month to discuss opening bank branches.
The Pakistan cabinet's decision to grant Most Favoured Nation status to India has still not been notified due to the opposition stirred up against it — at this politically sensitive time for the Pakistan People's Party government — by extremist and militant groups including the Jamat-ud-Dawa, whose leader Hafiz Saeed is its most vocal opponent. But according to a schedule outlined in the joint communiqué, Islamabad seems determined to replace the current restrictive positive list with a negative list by the end of this month, which too is to be phased out by end-2012 when the transition to MFN is planned. It is disappointing, however, that the two sides have not yet been able to finalise a “liberal” visa regime, even for businessmen. The delay is incomprehensible; the project has been in the works for more than six years. It is futile to think of normalising trade, or of trade as a normaliser of relations, without first getting rid of the troglodytic visa system that governs travel between the two countries.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/all-for-trade-waiting-for-visa/article2920738.ece
24,2,2012,Taking the trauma out of tests,"If the common national examination that has been agreed upon in principle for admission to engineering courses in 2013 lives up to its promise, it will eliminate two major problems: traumatic stress for students taking multiple examinations, and high costs. That would be no mean achievement, considering that the number of student appearances for different entrance examinations is of the order of 3.5 million annually. The most important feature of the new test is, arguably, its design, which uses comprehension, critical thinking and logical reasoning under the “main” section, and problem-solving ability in basic science in the “advanced” section. It emphasises aptitude assessment, which is welcome. Students can thus avoid the folly of enrolling in a technical course where they may fare badly, and choose instead a more appropriate discipline. The modalities of the scheme will become clear in the months ahead, but its potential to create a robust framework for engineering admissions is immediately apparent. There are a few hold-out States that want more time before endorsing it, but they must strike a blow for transparency and adopt it for their own admissions on merits. In any case, the States are free to give as much weighting as they deem fit to results of their Board examinations, while laying down admission requirements. What the new test will provide is just a standardised aptitude score.
An admissions scheme that gives statistically valid weighting to State Board examination results, and also uses an aptitude score can solve one of the long-persisting problems in technical education. In a “Common Entrance Test only” system, subject-based secondary school examinations get low priority among students, as they play no role in admissions other than providing a basic qualifier status. This phenomenon led to the scrapping of the CET in States such as Tamil Nadu. However, that has produced the opposite problem, of a thriving guidebook-based tuition industry exerting unhealthy pressure on the examination process. It produces high scorers, many of whom — ironically — struggle through college or fail. A testing procedure such as the one unveiled provides a good balance, and individual institutions can decide on the weighting they wish to give to the score components. That the IITs, NITs and the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research among various Central educational institutions have agreed to go with the new procedure next year, giving 60 per cent weightage to the test and 40 per cent to State Board marks, speaks to the seriousness of the effort.

24,2,2012,Grounding the disabled,"The case of a woman passenger with cerebral palsy rudely deplaned by SpiceJet is a terrible reminder of the distance India still needs to travel in recognising and respecting the human rights of disabled people. Even a decade ago, it would have been rare to see a passenger on a wheelchair or with a white cane at an Indian airport. The increasing mobility of the general population in recent years has opened new doors for the elderly and the disabled as well. But last Sunday's incident in Kolkata is a cautionary tale about the arbitrariness with which those doors can be slammed shut. The deplaning of Jeeja Ghosh, a faculty member at the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy, is a repeat of a widely-publicised 2007 case when the now defunct Sahara Airlines refused to fly a wheelchair-bound passenger out of Chennai. The outcry which followed led the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to adopt guidelines which state categorically that no airline can refuse to fly persons with disability and reduced mobility. International norms also permit disabled passengers to carry assistive aids, including guide dogs by the blind. Moreover, the medical disqualifications on travel prescribed by the International Air Transport Authority do not apply to persons with cerebral palsy. Clearly, the captain in question was blissfully ignorant of these regulations. Worse still, he enforced his will, paying scant regard to the inconvenience and trauma this would cause a passenger who had paid for her journey and already been seated like every other person on board.
It is time the aviation industry got its act together on sensitising its personnel about handling passengers with particular needs. For his part, Union Minister for Social Justice Mukul Wasnik should impress upon his counterpart in the Civil Aviation ministry the need to discipline those who wilfully flouted the DGCA's guidelines in this case. A major weakness of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995, is the absence of a punitive clause. This is arguably the reason why its provisions remain poorly implemented. The United Progressive Alliance government is debating fresh legislation on persons with disabilities. A test of its commitment to guarantee basic rights and equal opportunities for this segment of the population will be whether it addresses this major shortcoming. Jeeja Ghosh could not fly that day because India's disability law is up in the air. It is time to bring it down to earth, anchoring it firmly in the terrain of equality that our Constitution envisages for all citizens.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/grounding-the-disabled/article2925162.ece
25,2,2012,Close encounters of the troubling kind,"“Fake encounters,” said Justices Markandey Katju and C.K. Prasad in a ringing Supreme Court judgment last August, “are nothing but cold-blooded, brutal murders by persons who are supposed to uphold the law”. They went on to prescribe the death penalty for those involved — a punishment which policemen ought to keep in mind whenever their superiors seek to involve them in an act of extra-judicial killing. Such instances, as the cases piling up in the Supreme Court demonstrate, are far from infrequent. As a way of dealing with the perceived pressure of public opinion following terror strikes or violent crimes, police forces across India sometimes resort to the custodial murder of prime suspects, often with a nudge and a wink from the top. Thanks to the judiciary's intervention, policemen who take the law into their own hands can no longer be assured of impunity. This is not to say genuine encounters never happen. They do, and the police, like ordinary citizens, enjoy the right of self-defence. What must be demonstrated each time deadly force is used, however, is the necessity of the police response in the face of violence by their victims.
The police in Chennai deserve praise for quickly identifying the suspects thought to be behind two recent bank robberies in the city. But the manner in which the five men died in an encounter in the early hours of Thursday raises a host of questions about the nature of the operation. Little about the official account, from the time of the operation to the details of the killing, neatly adds up. While the Police Commissioner claimed the force got a tip-off around midnight and that his men knocked at the door of the suspects at about 1 a.m., area residents said they were asked to remain indoors by the police as early as 10 p.m. on Wednesday. Other contradictions include the absence of aural and visual effects normally associated with several minutes of “indiscriminate” firing: neighbours heard only a few individual shots and just two bullet holes were visible to reporters who got a peek at the crime scene. None of this necessarily means the encounter was fake. Only an independent judicial probe can help establish what really happened. Such a probe must be conducted in a speedy, transparent and professional manner so that public apprehensions can be allayed. If the official story checks out, the city will heave a sigh of relief. But if there is any evidence that the five suspects were in custody at the time they were killed, all those involved must be charged with murder. If the law does not deter criminal acts by those in authority, we are in deep trouble as a society.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/close-encounters-of-the-troubling-kind/article2929337.ece
25,2,2012,Time to come out,"The Centre's embarrassing gaffe in the Supreme Court on Thursday signals one thing clearly — that it will not take a clear and unambiguous position on the issue of decriminalising homosexuality. The Home Ministry's clarification, which distanced itself from the retrograde and irrational positions staked out by the Additional Solicitor General who “unauthorisedly” represented it, is a classic piece of equivocation. It merely reiterates another instance of hedging — the Cabinet decision that the Central government may not file an appeal against the landmark 2009 Delhi High Court judgment, which legalised gay sex between consenting adults. This raises a host of questions. Under whose brief did P.P. Malhotra argue that homosexuality was immoral and posed a risk to public health? More importantly, where exactly does the Centre stand on this issue? Does it subscribe to the Delhi High Court's view that Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, inasmuch as it criminalises “consensual sexual acts of adults in private” is ultra vires of the Constitution? Or does it hold, as ASG Malhotra argued, that homosexual behaviour is out of tune with the country's cultural practices?
In a way, the inconsistency between the ASG's submission and the Home Ministry's press release is hardly surprising. The Centre has spoken in divergent voices on this issue before. When the petition challenging Section 377 was in the Delhi High Court, the Health Ministry favoured decriminalisation; its views were reflected in the affidavit filed by the National Aids Control Organisation, which argued the Section contributed to HIV infection by impeding the access of gays to safe sex. But the Home Ministry appallingly equated homosexuality with “the crime of widow remarriage,” and the Law Ministry, while distancing itself from the MHA's controversial affidavit, claimed, bewilderingly, that scrapping Section 377 would create “a law and order problem.” Although the former Law Minister Veerappa Moily later boldly described Section 377 as an “absurdity in the present day,” the hopes he raised about the Centre's commitment to scrap the provision vanished with calls that a “wide consensus” was needed — euphemism for avoiding a hard decision. This is exactly what the Centre is trying to do now by saying it has not adopted a view on homosexuality but may request its legal advisors to assist the Supreme Court on the issue. Having surrendered good sense on gay rights in the Delhi High Court, the Centre has, in the Supreme Court, surrendered opinion altogether. This fence sitting must end. The state has no right to regulate or ban love or physical intimacy between consenting adults. Why should it be so hard to say that?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/time-to-come-out/article2929336.ece
27,2,2012,"Engage, don't vilify","Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's remarks about foreign-funded NGOs stalling the introduction of genetically modified food and the commissioning of the Kudankulam nuclear power project are bound to be taken seriously by his supporters and detractors alike. For, they do not merely represent an uncharacteristic venture by him into controversial territory, but may indicate his government's growing frustration over its plans running into fierce ideological opposition. When Dr. Singh, who has a reputation for reticence on sensitive subjects, drops dark hints about a foreign hand, it is surely something that needs to be substantiated and, if necessary, followed up with action. As if to bolster his argument, the licences of three NGOs have been cancelled and the foreign remittances received by them are being investigated. Meanwhile, the People's Movement Against Nuclear Energy, the organisation spearheading the anti-Kudankulam protests, has rejected the charge and demanded the Prime Minister substantiate his remarks. Adding to the mix, Jairam Ramesh has also clarified that his decision as Environment Minister in 2010 to place a moratorium on Bt Brinjal was not influenced by NGOs, but was based on objective factors.
Dr. Singh cannot be faulted for his view that science and technology should serve as instruments for raising the standard of living of the people, and it is entirely understandable that he wants everyone, including his critics, to appreciate the development challenges faced by India and its energy requirements. At a time when agriculture badly needs infusion of technology and when a chronic power shortage is crippling economic activity in States such as Tamil Nadu, it is hardly surprising that the government looks at all opposition to genetic engineering and nuclear power as suspect. However, the idea that NGOs with ‘foreign' links are fuelling the protests seems more expedient than convincing. The charge is also, at some level, quite irrelevant. For what it's worth, tens of thousands of ordinary Indians around Kudankulam, Jaitapur and other areas where reactors will be sited are apprehensive about what the placement of large nuclear installations in their backyard might mean for their health, environment and livelihood. The government needs to engage with them in a transparent and constructive manner and allay their fears with facts and arguments rather than innuendo and slander. The same is true for those sections of the farming and scientific communities who want a careful review of the consequences of genetic engineering before its indiscriminate adoption in the country. Their concerns are best answered by science and reason, not the implied threat of a midnight knock.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/engage-dont-vilify/article2935699.ece
27,2,2012,Check the criminality,"If the cruelly apathetic handling by officers of the Kolkata police of a serious complaint brought before them by a woman of having been raped and assaulted in the heart of the city wasn't bad enough, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's misinformed or hubristic attempt to dismiss her charge as a story that was cooked up to malign her government, was even worse. Not to be outdone, the State's Transport Minister promptly wondered what the victim was doing out there late in the night, and made a further observation on her current marital status. Yet another representative of the State government openly questioned her moral credentials. Such atrocious remarks might be driven by political expediency but they are typical of how sections of Indian society continue to view crimes against women. When, after a series of twists and turns, the police finally claimed to have cracked the case by arresting three men, who turned out to be impersonators as well, it was not clear who had more egg on the face — the police, or the State's first woman Chief Minister, who also holds the Home portfolio. The inconsistencies and technical discrepancies in the complainant's statement that the police were initially harping on, have been accounted for, too. It is hard to imagine why any woman in those circumstances would falsely claim to have been raped. And, as a Supreme Court judgment has laid down, any questions concerning the character or antecedents of a woman should not be dragged in when it comes to investigating a crime committed against her.
Ultimately, the issue here would seem to boil down to the State government's ability to maintain law and order. If this crime occurred on the upmarket Park Street in the heart of the State capital, things are seemingly no better in several other parts of the State. More evidence came on February 22 from Bardhaman when CPI(M) leaders Pradip Tah, a former MLA, and Kamal Gayen were killed in an attack launched on a procession. In fact, the CPI(M) has claimed that with these deaths, a total of 58 of its workers have been killed since the Assembly elections last year. As in the rape case, the Chief Minister's instincts were to blame the victims, citing the fact that Tah had seven cases registered against him. Ms Banerjee and her team need to do some serious introspection with regard to the State government's will, and ability, to put the lid firmly on criminality of all kinds that pervade the State. She has often attributed the genesis of many evils to the ancien régime. But surely, she has had enough time already to undertake any necessary purging operations and put in place credible alternative arrangements.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/check-the-criminality/article2935702.ece
28,2,2012,The same old show,"There is surely a smidgen of irony in the fact that an industry that sells entertainment, whose very name conjures up entertainment, cannot bring itself to make its annual awards show more entertaining. Hollywood's ritual of self-congratulation, otherwise known as the Oscar awards, has become the most boring show on the planet. This isn't about the low-rent stand-up-comedy patter that kicks off the evening, a clutch of insider jokes carefully calibrated so as to not really offend anyone in attendance. This is a harmless enough crime. The real offence is in the utter predictability of the prizes. Sitting through the three-and-a-half hours leading to the announcement for Best Picture has begun to feel like going through a 1000-page book when someone's already revealed the ending. Was anyone really surprised when The Artist, a slight but charming ode not just to silent cinema but to Hollywood itself, left its competition in the dust with five wins? (It won Best Picture, Actor, Director, Costume Design and Musical Score. Martin Scorsese's much-lauded Hugo, also harking back to silent cinema, equalled this count, but with a string of less-prestigious awards in the technical categories, including Best Cinematography and Visual Effects).
The problem lies with the interminable stretch of honours announced in what has come to be known as “awards season.” First, the various critics' circles, like the National Board of Review, have their ceremonies. By the end of these announcements, there is already some sense of consensus, and this is only confirmed by the Golden Globes (awarded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association) and the BAFTAs (the British Academy of Film and Television Arts). And what the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences do, essentially, is stamp their seal of approval on these awards. About the only award that quivered with an iota of suspense was the one for Best Actress, where Viola Davis was expected to win for The Help. (Meryl Streep won, instead, for The Iron Lady.) Otherwise, it would have made no difference if they'd announced the list of winners earlier and the show had simply focused on their showing up to collect the trophies. Stifling one of many yawns, several viewers no doubt looked back fondly at the time Shakespeare in Love came out of nowhere to snatch the Best Picture trophy seen as belonging to Saving Private Ryan, or when Marisa Tomei won Best Supporting Actress for her flamboyantly comic turn in My Cousin Vinny, beating such luminaries as Vanessa Redgrave and Judy Davis. Were these upsets deserved? Perhaps not. But no one will deny that they made a stodgy evening a lot more interesting.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-same-old-show/article2939322.ece
28,2,2012,Labor against itself,"As expected, Australia's Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, has easily held off former Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd's leadership challenge with a ballot of ruling Australian Labor Party MPs following his February 22 resignation going 71-31 in her favour. After the vote, both Ms Gillard and her challenger said all the right things about unifying the party, and Mr. Rudd has acted on his stated intention of returning to the backbenches if he lost the vote. The Labor party, however, still faces serious problems, as neither Mr. Rudd nor Ms Gillard has an unblemished record in office. The former led the party to a landslide win in 2007, ending a dozen years of Liberal rule, only to alienate his own parliamentary colleagues so much that Ms Gillard won a leadership challenge in June 2010. She got Labor re-elected as a minority government later that year, but the party's poll ratings have slipped steadily for months, falling to 30 per cent at one point and possibly prompting her rival's challenge; Ms Gillard has herself acknowledged that her focus on policy means the “big picture” has not been explained to voters, among whom Mr. Rudd's current ratings are at 53 per cent to the Prime Minister's 28.
Such public perceptions could be decisive in the next federal election, because on substantive policies there is little to separate Ms Gillard and Mr. Rudd. They both want a carbon tax as well as increased revenues from the vast profits made from coal and other natural resources, and they both want reform in the health and education sectors. Ironically, the past five years have been among Labor's most successful, with the election win and then general avoidance of the worst of the global crash, including a foodgrain crisis caused by a drought in 2007-8. In effect, other countries with substantive Australian links — such as India — will not expect much policy change from Canberra. The domestic ramifications, however, are extensive. Labor's chaos is a gift to the main opposition grouping, the Liberal-National coalition, whose leader Tony Abbott, a hard-line Catholic conservative, calls Labor's internal turmoil an “embarrassment” and talks of “poison” within the government. His party leads the ratings by 53 per cent to 47 per cent, enough for a huge win. The Labor leadership, for its part, must hope there will be no public splits until the next national poll, the last date for which is November 30, 2013; a major trade union leader has warned Labor that its feuds mean electoral “suicide.” The party has been very badly tarnished; Ms Gillard will want to get on with policy, but will need to communicate far better with the voters, while reconnecting with the essence of what it means to be a labour party.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/labor-against-itself/article2939323.ece
29,2,2012,"Time to introspect, not celebrate","The celebrations that followed India's victory on Sunday in the Olympic qualifying tournament had undeserved shades of triumphalism about them. For a nation with an enviable record of eight Olympic gold medals, the very fact that it had to qualify for the 2012 London Olympics points to the gross mismanagement of a popular sport. It is true that missing the 2008 Olympiad in Beijing for the first time in eight decades was a setback. But the events that followed raised doubts over India overcoming its inadequacies. Instead of analysing the factors that led to the shocking debacle in Santiago, where India failed to make it to the Beijing Games, a blame game was triggered that led to chaos in the administration. The Indian Olympic Association's controversial move to disqualify the Indian Hockey Federation and form a new unit, Hockey India, to manage the sport shifted the focus from the players to the administrators. No worthwhile programme was framed to restore India's image. On the contrary, a slew of legal issues surfaced in different courts. Sadly, there is still no end in sight with the two factions fighting to gain control. The International Hockey Federation's efforts to settle the issue have also failed.
The decline and fall of Indian hockey started in the wake of the loss of the Olympic gold for the first time in 1960. Although, the medal was regained in 1964 in Tokyo, indications of a sharp decline in standards were obvious. There were other factors too that hastened the free-fall. Frequent rule changes in the guise of making the sport interesting to watch for spectators, along with the mandatory use of synthetic pitches for competitions compounded the problems. While countries across Europe, and even Pakistan, began adapting to the changes India failed to read the writing on the wall. Suggestions to hire a foreign coach and reorient traditional techniques and training methods were dismissed with contempt. Even knowledgeable Indian coaches who advocated fresh strategies and theories were humiliated and sidelined. All these factors contributed to India failing to make an impression in the Olympics, World Cup, and even in Continental competitions. The celebrations triggered now reflect the release of the pent up frustration of witnessing our national sport plumb the depths. But the victory in the qualifier could not have come at a better time. The qualitative improvement effected by the new Australian coach, Michael Nobbs, with the full backing of the Sports Ministry, shows that a recovery path can be charted out provided the faction-ridden administration stays focussed on consolidating what little has been gained out of the Olympic qualifier. Such an opportunity may not arise again.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/time-to-introspect-not-celebrate/article2943211.ece
29,2,2012,Let truth prevail,"Japan's Nuclear Safety chairman Haruki Madarame's recent admission at a parliamentary investigation that the “safety requirements” of the 40-year-old Fukushima Dai-ichi plant for “tsunami and power losses were too loose” goes against the grain of expecting the unexpected when dealing with nuclear power reactor safety. If overdependence on nuclear energy to power a country perched on the Pacific Ring of Fire, the world's most active earthquake zone, is bad enough, the choice of a basement to house the backup power generators that should kick in during an emergency is absurd. If the 9-magnitude earthquake of March 11, 2011 knocked off power supply from the grid, the tsunami that soon followed killed the backup power to the units. It has now come to light that Japan's Atomic Energy Commission head, Shunsuke Kondo, was fully aware of the faulty design of the plant. In fact, the rot runs even deeper. Madarame admitted that the “country's regulations are flawed, outdated and below global standards.” He said “the root of the problem lies” in Japan spending time making “excuses as to why we don't have to follow” the International Atomic Energy Agency guidelines even when other countries implement them.
The operator, TEPCO, is equally culpable. For instance, it missed safety checks at Fukushima over a 10-year period up to two weeks before the March 11 quake. The undoctored nuclear-reactor manual has revealed how ill prepared the company was in dealing with contingency measures. The 2007 earthquake that hit seven reactors at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant revealed that the company had knowingly built the reactor on top of a seismically active fault line. Fabrication and falsification of data has been its forte. Unfortunately the company was able to get away with these violations. The reason for this is not difficult to find. Nuclear regulators and operators make for strange bedfellows, but sadly, that has been the case in Japan. For instance, ignition of hydrogen has been cited as the cause of explosion at the units. But can that throw up heavy metals like plutonium-238 up to 45 km from the units? Two members of the Diet in a paper in the December 15, 2011 issue of Nature have also questioned the veracity of TEPCO's claim of meltdown magnitude. Unfortunately, the interim report submitted by the cabinet-constituted committee has failed to address such issues. Considering the recent admissions by the regulator and the track record of the operator, should the world rely on them to know the truth? Only a thorough investigation by truly impartial and independent scientists can provide the answers. That can happen only if the Fukushima plant is nationalised.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/let-truth-prevail/article2943215.ece
1,3,2012,Chasing a mirage,"However well-intentioned it might be, the Supreme Court direction to the Centre to constitute a special committee to pursue the outdated plan of linking India's rivers is based on a misplaced premise. Achieving huge inter-basin transfer of waters in the Himalayan and peninsular river systems is a complex goal for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is the displacement of a large number of people. Even if funds were not a constraint and the inter-linking idea were to be declared technically sound, the national record on resettlement of people displaced by mega dam projects does not inspire confidence. What is equally important is that the 2008 National Council on Applied Economic Research report on the “Economic Impact of Interlinking of Rivers Programme”, which seems to have guided some of the discussions, explicitly did not consider the plan's environmental aspects or cost-benefit calculus. Moving waters across river basins cannot be achieved without energy-intensive heavy lifts and destructive modification of ecologically important landscapes. Also, in the Himalaya plan component, there is the additional challenge of taking along neighbouring countries. It is no surprise then that the National Commission on Integrated Water Resources Development Plan, which went into the proposals a decade ago, favoured development of water resources within river basins over massive inter-basin transfers.
Negative externalities are a concomitant of any big river link project, and the proposals identified by NCAER involve 30 links. Sharing of river waters even under an agreed formula has not been easy, as the Cauvery issue has shown. What is more, the reaction of Andhra Pradesh and Kerala to the Supreme Court direction indicates that they remain unenthusiastic, because of concerns over proposals for the Polavaram and Pamba-Achankovil-Vaippar links. A decade ago, when water surpluses in the Mahanadi and Godavari were assessed by the NCIWRDP, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh disagreed. Given this trend, what reason is there to believe that States would be more willing to apportion waters now? As the Supreme Court has pointed out on various occasions, environmental impact assessment must be the cornerstone of any project. In this context, the Ministry of Environment and Forests found no cause to support the Ken-Betwa link and declined to clear it last year. The way forward to improve the prospects of water-deficit basins is to work on more efficient and less destructive options. These include devoting resources for rainwater harvesting programmes of scale, raising irrigation efficiency, curbing pollution and effecting local water transfers for agricultural and municipal use.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/chasing-a-mirage/article2947029.ece
1,3,2012,Syrians pay the price,"As ferocious fighting continues in Syria, particularly in and around Homs, and the United Nations puts the death toll at 7,500 since the uprising started in March 2011, it is imperative that the international community strive for an immediate ceasefire of some kind. President Bashar al-Assad's regime is increasing its use of heavy weapons such as tanks and rockets, the army has shot holes in water tanks in Homs, and telecommunications there have been interrupted for days on end. The restive city is completely under siege and the country is in a state of civil war. Mr. Assad nevertheless continues to claim legitimacy, stating that the recent referendum has endorsed his constitutional proposals with a 90 per cent vote in favour, on a 57 per cent turnout. The proposals include guarantees of free expression and opinion, elected councils in a pluralist political system, and a two-term or 14-year presidential mandate limit; the Baath Party would also cease to be the constitutional leader of state and society. Had these changes come earlier, they would have been widely welcomed despite doubts about their implementation. But coming via a questionable referendum at a time when Syria is at war with itself, the promises held out by the new constitution seem utterly farcical.
If Mr. Assad's homegrown solution seems a non-starter, prospects for effective international action also remain dismal. This is mainly because of the wider geopolitical interests at play. For the United States, regime change in Syria is a pit stop on the way to confrontation with Iran, so any settlement which leaves Damascus-Tehran relations untouched will not be acceptable. Russia, Syria's most powerful ally today, is angry about what it considers deceit by the western powers over Libya. Moscow will veto any U.N. resolution proposing intervention in Syria, and will continue to arm the Syrian regime. Iran, another strong backer of Mr. Assad, recognises what the collapse of his regime will do to regional dynamics in West Asia, especially in Lebanon. Furthermore, the failure of the Arab League mission in January and the absence of consensus and even credibility at the U.N. Security Council mean that other international options are fast disappearing. Syria as a nation commands respect in West Asia, and public feeling in the region is undoubtedly embittered by the fact that the U.S. has never allowed the U.N. to condemn Israel for its actions in Gaza and the West Bank and stand up for the legitimate rights of the Palestinians. Given the interests propelling its most powerful members, the U.N.'s helplessness should not surprise anyone.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/syrians-pay-the-price/article2947033.ece
2,3,2012,Speeding on safety,"If all other conditions were optimal, the proposed amendments to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 approved by the Union Cabinet could achieve good results in reining in the growing band of lawless drivers on India's roads. But conditions today are not really conducive to the creation of a scientific zero tolerance regime. The stronger penalties that are sought to be introduced, therefore, can at best have a patchy impact on the notorious national record on road safety. India has a tally of nearly 126,000 road accident deaths in a year, and injuries many times that number. Several high-profile accidents now involve fast cars and drunk drivers. Obviously, strengthening both traffic rules and the system of enforcement is crucial to check such trends. The proposals to enhance and escalate penalties for offences such as driving under the influence of alcohol and narcotics, speeding and failure to stop at signals are positive. Many people think nothing of using mobile phones while at the wheel, and the move to check such distracted drivers is also welcome. Similarly, vehicle users should be compelled to wear helmets and seat belts. These measures are consistent with the objectives outlined by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture — which is to upgrade the MV Act to present-day requirements and enhance penalties to achieve deterrence, discipline and road safety. But the law cannot be effective in the absence of a credible and professional enforcement machinery.
Traffic control, enforcement of rules and accident investigation fall within the realm of the police, but as the Sundar Committee on Road Safety and Traffic Management observed in its 2007 report, the entire system rests on a weak foundation. To inspire confidence in the ability of the police to enforce the law, there is a need for qualified Central and State-level agencies to periodically review the rules, and the operations and management practices employed. This recommendation from the Committee has, however, not made much progress, and the Centre must make a sincere effort to come up with enabling legislation. Greater use of cameras would bring a lot more credibility to enforcement, help determine fault, check corruption and protect rule-abiding drivers. A modern traffic system must, in addition, adopt globally recognised signs to guide motorists. Finally, the Centre must recognise the multi-sectoral nature of the issue, involving not just the police, but engineering, urban planning and public health specialists. New Delhi needs the support of the States, which hold the key to enforcement, to move ahead with amendments to the MV Act. The agenda brooks no delay.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/speeding-on-safety/article2954850.ece
2,3,2012,The ways of science,"After announcing on September 23 last year that neutrinos travelled 60 nanoseconds faster than light, the OPERA (Oscillation project with Emulsion-tRacking Apparatus) team has recently identified certain flaws. These pertain to possible “effects” in the experiment that might have led to an incorrect measurement in the arrival time of neutrinos at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy, 730 km from CERN where the neutrinos were generated. The two possible errors, pertaining to the novel use of the global positioning system (GPS) in particle physics to synchronise the atomic clocks at CERN and Gran Sasso, could have led to an overestimation or underestimation of the neutrino speed. Of the two errors, a faulty connection between the GPS signal and the OPERA master clock is seen as the main suspect for causing a mistake in calculating the neutrinos' arrival time. That the fault has been traced to the GPS should not come as a surprise as many scientists had as early as November suspected so. But the last word has not been said yet. The scientists would be conducting new velocity measurements in May using “short-pulsed beams,” reports Science.
This is not the first time that the OPERA team has had to repeat the experiment following its announcement. Though the team conducted the experiment for three years, measured the speed of more than 15,000 neutrinos and checked the accuracy of the data for about six months before announcing the results, it had to rerun the experiment soon after. This was to eliminate some uncertainty arising from proton pulse duration. Though the pulse duration used for generating neutrinos was reduced from 10.5 microseconds to 3 nanoseconds, the neutrinos still arrived 60 nanoseconds earlier than light. The focus then shifted to a possible error in the measurement using the GPS system. Regardless of whether a rerun of the experiment later this year proves or disproves the initial result, the entire exercise has gone a long way in showcasing the way science operates. For instance, this work has shown what is so basic to science — even the most fundamental laws of science will often be challenged by scientists using the most sophisticated instruments and experiments. While the results challenge Einstein's theory of Special Relativity, the team has never claimed to have proved that neutrinos travel faster than light, and that the laws of physics have been upended. In fact the team wants further “scrutiny and independent tests” before its measurements could be “confirmed or refuted.” After all, independent verification and replication of the results are central to science.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-ways-of-science/article2954861.ece
2,3,2012,The growth gamble,"The wake-up call could not have been timed better. A fortnight ahead of the Budget and the mid-quarter review of monetary policy by the Reserve Bank of India comes the news of a sharp fall in economic growth in the third quarter of the current fiscal to 6.1 per cent. In the same period last year, the economy grew at 8.3 per cent. This is the sixth time in the last seven quarters that growth has declined and is proof, if any were needed, of the seriousness of the slowdown. More than the extent of decline, what should worry policymakers is that manufacturing sector growth was almost flat — at 0.4 per cent in the third quarter — continuing a declining trend since the beginning of this fiscal. Seen together with less than encouraging data on gross fixed capital formation, which declined for the second quarter in succession, the alarm bells should be ringing loud and clear for both the RBI and Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee ahead of their respective policy statements. What the disappointing third quarter data mean is that the RBI's projected growth rate of 7 per cent for the current fiscal appears hopelessly unrealistic. In fact, the actual growth rate could be even lower than the 6.9 per cent projected by the government.
The government and the RBI are in an unenviable position. The central bank is likely to come under tremendous pressure from industry in the next couple of weeks to drop interest rates. The RBI will be keeping a wary eye on rising oil prices and also the fiscal deficit — the government has already overshot the annual deficit target in the first ten months to January. Yet, it might not be a bad thing for the Governor to allow himself to be coaxed into starting the rate reversal process in the next fortnight's review. A reduction in rates will boost sentiment, which is desperately needed now, and encourage companies to resume investment activity. As for the government, the fiscal deficit is spinning out of control and it has to either cut spending or raise additional resources, both of which are tough. Industry bodies are already raising a shrill pitch against an anticipated increase in excise duties citing the dismal growth figures. If January's industrial growth data, due on March 12, disappoint, as they well might, Mr. Mukherjee could find himself in a tight corner. Come Budget day, he has two choices: tighten the nation's belt — by raising taxes and duties and/or cutting expenditure, thereby running the risk of extending the slowdown — or hold back on raising taxes, peppering the budget with growth incentives in the hope that the fiscal belt can be tightened once the economy is back on the rails. If it boils down to a gamble, Mr. Mukherjee might just be better off wagering on the latter option.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-growth-gamble/article2951184.ece
2,3,2012,Fatal attraction,"Plagiarism is a curse that afflicts every endeavour where pen is put to paper — journalism, literature and academic research — but when it shows up in the world of science, the consequences can be far more damaging. At stake are not just individual reputations but the robustness of scholarly findings. That is why every effort must be made to stamp out the rot. It has emerged recently that a paper published in the July 2011 issue of Advanced Materials by eminent scientist and Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister C.N.R. Rao, S.B. Krupanidhi, a scientist at the Indian Institute of Science, and two students, contained about a dozen lines, including some references, lifted almost verbatim from an April 22, 2010 paper by Surajit Ghosh et al., in Applied Physics Letters. Fortunately, the scale of the infraction did not warrant rejection or retraction, as the plagiarised portions form only a part of the introduction, and description of an equation and do not in any way reduce the significance of the research work. But the scientists' subsequent justification that the verbatim reproduction does not amount to plagiarism but is only an instance of “copying of a few sentences in the text,” and text “overlap” amounts to a disservice to science. The very fact that the journal took cognisance and published their apology is proof enough of the gravity of the transgression.
The U.S. Office of Research Integrity defines plagiarism as “the unattributed verbatim or nearly verbatim copying of sentences and paragraphs which materially mislead the ordinary reader regarding the contributions of the author.” Copying is by far one of the most common forms of academic deception. Students are often the worst offenders, especially in India, due to gross ignorance of what constitutes plagiarism. Hence there is a strong case to teach students the basics of research misconduct, including the correct use of citations, at an early stage of college education, as a comment published recently in Nature points out. In the present case, the lack of such training has unwittingly got senior researchers with a hitherto unblemished publishing record embroiled in controversy. Last year, a magazine editor got into trouble when he used plagiarised inputs provided by a junior colleague for a signed column. One of the ironies of our times is that the computer makes both plagiarism and its detection easier than ever: The internet provides easy and instant access to work from all over the world, but concordance software easily red-flags copying. The end result is that those who cut and paste will be caught.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fatal-attraction/article2951187.ece
5,3,2012,Sri Lanka against itself,"Sri Lanka is engaged in an all-out effort to stave off a resolution against it at the ongoing session of the United Nations Human Rights Council at Geneva. The United States, the prime backer of the resolution, has circulated a draft among the Council's 47 members calling on Colombo to do nothing more than implement the recommendations of its own Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, as well as to initiate credible investigations into violations of international human rights laws not addressed adequately by the LLRC. Among other recommendations, the report, tabled in the Sri Lankan parliament last year, asked the government to “ascertain, more fully the circumstances” of five incidents in which civilians were killed during the last phases of the war against the LTTE in 2009, and if wrongful conduct by security personnel were established, to prosecute and punish. It also asked the government to investigate the disappearances of LTTE members who surrendered, to demilitarise northern Sri Lanka, and to arrive at a settlement for devolution of powers to the Tamil minority. In its defence, the Rajapaksa government has pointed to internal enquiries initiated by the Sri Lankan Army as “progress” on implementing the LLRC recommendations; it has also cited the setting up of a parliamentary select committee as evidence of its sincerity in addressing the Tamil question. The success or failure of a resolution at the HRC depends not so much on the merit of the issue, but on a country's diplomatic ability to line up friends and allies, in support of or against the resolution. By that measure, Sri Lanka could yet come out of its ordeal laughing.
While it is true that America's human rights advocacy is riddled with double standards, the debate at Geneva is an opportunity for Sri Lanka to reflect on why it finds itself at such a difficult pass. Over the past three HRC sessions, the Rajapaksa government was able to buy time with promises and action plans, which — had they been executed — could have saved Sri Lanka the diplomatic energy now being expended. Even the LLRC felt constrained to complain that its interim recommendations had not been implemented. Instead, the government has chosen to paper over issues of accountability for the loss of civilian lives during the war's final weeks. Much to the exasperation of allies such as India, it has also blown hot and cold about a settlement of Tamil political aspirations. Sri Lanka must realise that its own interests require it urgently to address these twin bases of national reconciliation. Sadly, its response to the Geneva challenge has been to whip up anti-U.S., anti-West, Sinhala nationalist protests at home, creating an atmosphere of an island under siege. This is hardly a constructive response; if anything, the government's over-the-top campaign may further sharpen ethnic cleavages in the country.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sri-lanka-against-itself/article2961021.ece
5,3,2012,Adrift in Andhra,"Nothing seems to be going right for the Congress and its government in Andhra Pradesh. If it's not Telangana, then it's the revolt within that keeps the Kiran Kumar Reddy government permanently in a crisis mode. Far from providing any respite, the disqualification of 16 Congress Members of the Legislative Assembly by the Speaker is likely to show up the continued erosion in popular support for the government. Indeed the delay in taking action against the 16 MLAs and in accepting the resignation of a member of the Praja Rajyam, now merged with the Congress, is indicative of the ground ceded by the Congress to the breakaway YSR Congress of Jaganmohan Reddy. The disqualification comes nearly three months after the government won the December 5, 2011 confidence vote. Not just the delay, the timing too betrays the mood disorders in the Congress camp. Clearly, the party did not want elections to be called early to fill the vacancies, fearing defeat by the breakaway Jagan group. But the disqualifications could not be delayed indefinitely, as biennial elections to fill vacancies in the Rajya Sabha from the State are due by the first week of April. What the Congress seems to have ensured is that the 17, or those who replace them in by-elections, would not be present to elect members to Parliament's upper house. However, such political tactics only bring short-term gains. Come 2014, the Congress will have to deal with both the main opposition, the Telugu Desam Party, and the YSR Congress. No tactical manoeuvre can avoid or delay this confrontation.
For now, Kiran Kumar Reddy is safe on the saddle. With the help of Praja Rajyam, led by actor Chiranjeevi, the Congress can manage the numbers in the Assembly. But the party is not expected to do well in the seven by-elections on March 18, six of which are in the Telangana region. Telangana Rashtra Samiti legislators have made a habit of resigning their seats and winning again from the same constituency. For the party, the real anxiety ought not to be about winning in the controlled environment of a confidence vote, but about coming through the dust and mayhem of a general election. At stake is not just the survival of the State government but the long-term future of the Congress in south India's largest province. Going by the way it has mishandled the political challenges posed by the Telangana and Jagan factors, the party will be struggling to hold its own in Andhra Pradesh.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/adrift-in-andhra/article2961025.ece
6,3,2012,No more at sea,"The new emphasis on maritime cooperation is a positive development in the relations between India and China. The proposal came last week from Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, and has been accepted by India in principle. The details are as yet hazy but will likely include joint operations against piracy, and the sharing of seabed research technology. Over the past two years, China has been an active participant in escort missions in the Indian Ocean, where the security of shipping routes originating in the Gulf of Aden is crucial to the country's energy imports. Last December, it initialled an agreement with the Indian Ocean nation of Seychelles for the refuelling and reprovisioning of its naval vessels on anti-piracy runs. Underscoring its inclination and capacity to engage in maritime operations beyond its own waters, the Peoples Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) carried out an operation to evacuate Chinese citizens from Libya. China is also involved in upgrading port facilities in Sri Lanka and Pakistan. On another front, the International Seabed Authority, a U.N.-established organisation, awarded China exploration rights to polymetallic sulphide ore deposits in a 10,000 sq km area of the Indian Ocean over the next 15 years. With China's increased engagement in the Indian Ocean region causing concern in some circles in India, it is good that the two sides have begun exploring ways of working together on the maritime front. A multi-ministerial group is to finalise the details of the anti-piracy proposal. Once operationalised, this may well see Indian and Chinese naval vessels cooperating with each other on the high seas.
For India, broadening its vision of maritime co-operation in the East beyond the “triangular” envisaged by the United States and Japan — or the “quad,” if one includes Australia — will also help allay Chinese concerns about Indian participation in some sort of U.S.-led alliance against it. The fact of the matter is that Indian strategic interests are not served by either a polarised maritime space or an Asia divided into blocs. As a major seafaring nation, India has a stake in the freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean — where it is a provider of security for others — as well as in distant international waters like the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean. As such, it has an interest in developing a working relationship with all navies in the region, including the PLAN, Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Forces, U.S. Navy and Viet Nam People's Navy. Apart from identifying concrete areas for cooperation, a regular Sino-Indian dialogue on maritime matters will dispel the fears both sides have developed about each other, fears the U.S. is able to take advantage of by playing the role of a balancer.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-more-at-sea/article2964376.ece
6,3,2012,Past politics,"President Nicolas Sarkozy of France seems intent on criminalising Armenian genocide denial, even after his country's Constitution Council quashed a recent bid. Parliament's vote last December for such a law had sparked off a bitter diplomatic row with Turkey, which recalled its ambassador and cut off military cooperation with Paris. The timing of the dispute and the government's unrelenting stance on how this dark episode should be viewed are hard to fathom. But there is speculation that this ratcheting up of pressure is purely to woo Armenian voters in the upcoming presidential election. The Council held this week that in approving the controversial legislation, the French Parliament caused harm to the exercise of freedom of expression. The ruling is a blow for the view that opinions on history cannot be legally enforced, relevant for France as well as other European countries where denying the Nazi Holocaust is a crime. Curiously, legislators who appealed against the December bill had originally voted in its favour, a welcome reconsideration of a regressive step. France has been dabbling with similar counter-intuitive measures in recent years. Surely, the country's large racial and religious minorities are unlikely to feel reassured by official validations of history. Of material significance would be policies that promote respect for their rights and protect jobs, mitigating a sense of alienation, especially in the current economic crisis gripping Europe.
While Turkey has hailed the decision of the French court, the country's own law banning the affirmation of the slaughter of Armenians is of a piece with the French proposal it has sought to repudiate with sanctions. Whereas Ankara has repeatedly negated the claim that the extirpation of Armenians was a matter of deliberate policy, owning up to events of history is perhaps a healthier way of righting historical wrongs. Moreover, the essence of any constitutional democracy is that historical crimes and controversies are part of a country's collective past. Surely, the politics behind attempts to deny the horrors of history must be exposed. But to clamp down on such forces betrays an authoritarian and undemocratic tendency inimical to an open polity. The European Union has acted judiciously in enacting a law against incitement to racial hatred, rather than a blanket ban on Holocaust denial. In the light of this common position, individual states could perhaps take another look at their domestic laws.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/past-politics/article2964382.ece
7,3,2012,The cycle of power,"To describe Tuesday's election results as stunning would be an understatement given that incredible stories have emerged in at least three of the five States that went to the polls over the past six weeks. Overall, the verdict dealt a devastating blow to the Congress. The party lost Goa. It failed to wrest Punjab and scraped through a virtual tie in Uttarakhand — both of whose incumbent governments had been considered pushovers. And it crashed to the bottom in Uttar Pradesh where Rahul Gandhi led a shrill, high profile campaign. Only in Manipur did the Congress sail through comfortably. This election got its edge-of-the-seat excitement from two extraordinary performances and one cliffhanger: In U.P, the Samajwadi Party led by the father-son team of Mulayam Singh and Akhilesh Yadav demolished every barrier in sight to capture more seats than any victorious party had in two decades. The SP powerhouse pushed arch rival Bahujan Samaj Party to a distant second, with the rear being brought up by the BJP and the Congress-Rashtriya Lok Dal alliance. In Punjab, the Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP combine made history by becoming the first government to retain power in 46 years. In Uttarakhand, the BJP and the Congress ended neck and neck, with the latter enjoying an edge because of the support from independents.
Mulayam Singh undoubtedly contributed to the SP's phenomenal success in U.P. but it was the affable younger Yadav who was the SP's campaign driver. Through dogged effort and a positive campaign, he transformed an ideologically fuzzy party — which had been severely weighed down by the Amar Singh-Bollywood baggage — into one that was rid of its goonish image and looked aspirationally young and modern. That the SP surpassed the BJP's1991 tally of 221 seats achieved during the Ram wave speaks for itself. The BSP, which was uniquely placed with a committed core vote, has only itself to blame for squandering away a rare opportunity. Ms Mayawati restored law and order and instituted several positive measures, especially towards the uplift of the Dalit community. But her achievements faded when measured against the corruption of the administration and her own perceived arrogance. In the end, the statues she built for herself became a metaphor for the regime's obsessive self-interest. For all this though, it would be premature to write off the BSP, which even in defeat has polled around 26 per cent, against an estimated 30 per cent by the SP. Unfortunately, there is no such consolation for the Congress: the party was routed in U.P., surrendered the anti-incumbency advantage in Punjab, was nearly edged out in Uttarakhand and performed abysmally in Goa. It does not help the Congress that the BJP has emerged with a much better score at the end of Elections 2012, which might well become a turning point for both parties in their quest for power at the Centre two years from now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-cycle-of-power/article2967556.ece
7,3,2012,Keep security on track,"That the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and policing on the Indian Railways badly need restructuring and revamping is beyond question. The more-than-million passengers that the Railways transport every day face some kind of problem or the other, and the policing and security systems now leave a lot to be desired. The limited mandate of the RPF confines it to protection of railway property, guarding railway premises, and prosecuting offenders under the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act. But it remains an armed force of the Union. On the other hand, the Government Railway Police (GRP) comes under the State police force, but provides on-board escort, mans Railway police stations, and handles crimes committed on running trains. The Centre now plans to do away with the GRP and empower the RPF to take on that role so that it becomes a one-stop force for anything to do with the Railways. Though under the jurisdiction of States, the GRP get funded by the Railways as they primarily attend to duties connected with the railways. The proposal to amend the RPF Act with a view to turning it into a full-fledged force was first mooted when West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was still at Rail Bhavan. It is now at the receiving end of the wrath of Chief Ministers such as Odisha's Navin Patnaik and Tamil Nadu's Jayalalithaa.
Objections to the proposed change revolve around questions of funding and jurisdiction, including access by regular State police forces to railway premises once the RPF takes them over. But a solution to these objections can surely be devised. There can be no doubt that the security and the crime prevention aspects of railway policing, not to speak of investigation and prosecution, need to be simplified and made passenger friendly. The plight of a passenger who is robbed in a moving train remains a standing example of how not to deal with a case. If the passenger is from Mumbai and gets robbed near Renigunta in Andhra Pradesh, the GRP in Renigunta registers the case and takes up the investigation. The less said about what happens after that the better. Before amending the RPF Act or interfering with the federal structure of the law enforcement system in operation, however, the Centre must initiate a detailed consultation with the State governments. The States too must bear in mind that the ultimate goal has to be the protection of railway passengers and not provincial prerogatives.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/keep-security-on-track/article2967557.ece
8,3,2012,"Five verdicts, one lesson","Anti-incumbency is one word for many failures. While electors have different reasons to vote out a government, these are usually massed together under this catch-all concept. Even so, this intangible factor is of great explanatory value to the 2012 Assembly elections, which actually threw up mixed results: Uttar Pradesh and Goa bringing about regime change, Punjab and Manipur voting for continuity and Uttarakhand leaving no one with a clear majority. Just as Mulayam Singh Yadav's Samajwadi Party consolidated the anti-Bahujan Samaj Party votes in Uttar Pradesh, so did the Bharatiya Janata Party the anti-ruling party votes in Goa. In Punjab and Uttarakhand, the Congress failed to do what the SP and the BJP did: attract sizeable sections of those wanting to vote against the incumbent. Punjab 2012 was an election for the Congress to lose. Since the reorganisation of the State in 1966, no party has managed to retain power in Punjab. But, although the Akali Dal-BJP combine lost a part of its vote share, the Congress gained nothing. The votes went to the Akali breakaway, People's Party of Punjab, founded by the estranged nephew of Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal. The development plank the Akali Dal chose over its traditional religious platform might have yielded some benefits, but, unmistakably, the Congress failed to bring together all the anti-Akali votes. For many, the Congress under Amarinder Singh was not the alternative they were looking for. In Uttarakhand, similarly, the Congress could not pack a killer punch; despite edging ahead of the BJP, the party was left having to try and cobble together a majority.
Goa was a different story, where the BJP made good use of its years in the opposition. Manohar Parrikar, as Leader of the Opposition, was in the forefront of efforts to expose the illegal mining scam. The Congress and its outgoing Chief Minister, Digambar Kamat, were entangled in controversies over mining irregularities and Mr. Parrikar kept up the pressure until the very end. The BJP made the opposition space its own, raising development issues while attacking the government on corruption and nepotism. In contrast, the Congress in Punjab and Uttarakhand behaved as though any benefit from an anti-incumbency sentiment would automatically accrue to it. Unlike the other four States, Manipur was in a category of its own, voting back the Congress with a thumping majority. The ruling party had no opposition worth the name. For opposition parties to take advantage of any anti-incumbency sentiment, they will have to expose each and every failure of the government, highlighting all acts of omission and commission adversely affecting people's welfare. Waiting out five years is not enough.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/five-verdicts-one-lesson/article2971202.ece
8,3,2012,The comfort of continuity,"Vladimir Putin's emphatic win against four rivals in the first round of the Russian presidential election shows that he remains the country's most popular politician by a long shot. During his two earlier terms as President from 2000 to 2008, Mr. Putin was credited with overseeing Russia's resurgence after the chaotic meltdown of the 1990s. As Prime Minister too, he helped steer Russia through the global financial crisis of 2008. In what will be his third presidential term — extended now to six years — Mr. Putin will be up against equally tough challenges. His campaign platform included an impressive programme of improving people's well-being and building a science-based economy. Honouring these multi-billion ruble election pledges will be an uphill task given Russia's critical dependence on global oil prices. Mr. Putin's overriding strategic task is to diversify the Russian economy and tap the country's intellectual talent rather than just its mineral riches. He will also need to combat the endemic corruption which is stifling Russia's economic growth and suppressing entrepreneurial initiative.
On the political front, Mr. Putin will have to address the new protest movement that has sprung up in recent months. Tens of thousands of Russians took to the streets to protest alleged falsifications in the December parliamentary election and renewed their protests after the presidential poll was marred by more violations. Mr. Putin dismissed the protesters as an elitist urban minority seeking to destabilise Russia on behalf of the West. Such denunciations may be excusable as campaign rhetoric but make for bad policy. Led by Russia's best educated and forward looking middle classes, the protests signal the rise of a mature civil society which is demanding democratic reforms that Mr. Putin's protégé, outgoing President Dmitry Medvedev, proclaimed but failed to push. Mr. Putin has promised to make Mr. Medvedev Prime Minister, a position which will allow him to pursue his reformist ideas. It is to be hoped that after the switching of roles, the duo will move ahead in this area. Mr. Putin returns as President at a time when Russia's policy of “reset” with the United States has hit a roadblock. He has vowed to counteract U.S. plans to build a missile shield in Europe and to firmly oppose the U.S. “export of rocket-bomb democracy” to other countries. The crisis in Syria has strengthened Russia's strategic ties with China, which jointly opposed regime change in Damascus, but placed India and Russia on different sides of the barricade. Re-establishing consensus within BRICS on issues like Syria must be a priority for both the new Russian President and the Indian leadership.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-comfort-of-continuity/article2971204.ece
9,3,2012,Spending for a healthy India,"An increase in public expenditure on health from an estimated 1.4 per cent of GDP to 2.5 per cent by the end of the Twelfth Plan can, if it is used wisely, bring about a revolution in health care. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's resolve to boost government spending can potentially make high quality care accessible to all. Universal health coverage, including cashless treatment, is to be achieved through greater expenditure and a system of strong regulatory oversight outlined by the Planning Commission's High Level Expert Group (HLEG). Arguably, with a significant increase in public funding, India can move towards its own model of Britain's famed National Health Service. There is some scepticism about the country's ability to shift to a good tax-funded plan for universal health coverage, but as the HLEG points out, the trajectory of economic growth makes this the opportune moment. Apprehensions raised by special interests against health reform are, naturally, self-serving and should not cloud the vision. What should be borne in mind is that the HLEG has not suggested the scrapping of the private health sector but its participation in the UHC plan on a contracted-in basis, with tight monitoring of costs and protocols.
The need for publicly-funded universal health coverage is beyond argument. At present, private out-of-pocket health expenditure constitutes 3.3 per cent of GDP, or around 67 per cent of the total spending. Moving towards universalisation of care can cut it to about 33 per cent by 2022. Clearly, a policy approach that relies primarily on for-profit health insurance and services cannot provide universal cover, as the experience in the United States has demonstrated. The key to universalisation lies in including everyone in the risk pool, through a system of means-tested compulsion and taxation. Making such a plan work requires extensive reform of standards, protocols and oversight bodies for both public and private sectors. Here, the HLEG has provided a road map that envisages setting up of public health cadres for services and management at the national and state levels, standard setting, and a timeline for merger of existing government-led health insurance schemes such as the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana and those operating at the State level. An increase in outlay on medicines from 0.1 per cent of GDP to 0.5 per cent for public procurement can ensure free universal access to essential drugs. This measure, suggested for implementation through contracted private chemists, among others, is also vital to cut out-of-pocket expenditure. The States, which are increasingly looking towards private health insurance to fund health care for the poor, should find the HLEG recommendations more sound.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/spending-for-a-healthy-india/article2974535.ece
9,3,2012,Democracy as defence,"The final results of Iran's parliamentary elections will not be known until April, as 65 seats in 33 constituencies are to go to a run-off, but enough results have been declared for a pattern to emerge. A faction loyal to the country's lifelong Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is expected to win up to three quarters of the 290 places in the assembly or Majlis; President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, who is supported by another faction, will be under considerable pressure for the remainder of his term, which ends in 2013. The Majlis has more power than many other national parliaments in the region, as it can set budgets and advise the government on foreign affairs and national security. It will now be substantially strengthened by the fact that the final say on all state matters in the Iranian theocracy still rests with Ayatollah Khamenei, who has been vali-e-faqih since June 1989. One immediate possibility is that Mr. Ahmedinejad's foreign policy statements could well become less confrontational, even if his civil nuclear policy — on which there is broad consensus within conservative and nationalist circles — remains unchanged.
The elections, nevertheless, give rise to other problems. The final result will be questionable, because a body called the Guardian Council, which is appointed by the Supreme Leader and has to approve all candidates, disqualified 36 per cent of the 5,395 people who tried to stand; international rights groups say many of its decisions were arbitrary. Opposition parties also decided not to take part, because they have no access to the media, and many of their leaders, such as Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, are imprisoned or under house arrest. These are among the consequences of the 2009 presidential poll, which was followed by long and violent repression of protests by reformist parties and members of the public over alleged rigging which gave Mr. Ahmedinejad a landslide victory. As for the current election, the official turnout of 64 per cent cannot be independently verified. Furthermore, even though the choice has been between two conservative factions, no decisive economic vision is being offered to the electorate while unemployment rises and western sanctions are starting to affect all, including the professional and upper classes. Iran is far too important — and the evolving situation in the region far too volatile — to be governed in this manner. As the clouds of confrontation with the U.S. and its allies gather, Iran's rulers need to realise their country would be stronger and more secure if it were to have the sort of genuinely representative democracy its people deserve as of right.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/democracy-as-defence/article2974539.ece
10,3,2012,"To the end, a master of timing","For nearly 16 years, fans of Indian cricket breathed easier when Rahul Dravid was in the middle, nurturing the team's innings. He batted for longer than anyone in Test cricket, but he was no mere crease-occupier. Indeed what India will most miss about Dravid, who announced his retirement Friday, is his ability, in adversity, to construct the defining innings. India's ascent to the top of Test cricket was built on two plinths: the engagement of world-power Australia as an equal, and the reformation of its reputation as an inept touring side. Dravid was central to both endeavours. He was a vital supporting act to V.V.S. Laxman in Kolkata during the magical series of 2001 and the highest scorer, despite struggling for form, in the dazzling, scarcely believable victory at Perth in 2008. In between, he engineered transformative Test wins at Headingley (2002), Adelaide (2003), Rawalpindi (2004), and Kingston (2006). Each time he simply refused to yield to the intense pressure that would have broken most men. During this period he was not only India's best batsman — in spite of Sachin Tendulkar's presence — but also the most significant wicket in world cricket.
Although Dravid's incredible achievements didn't always receive the attention they deserved, it bothered him not a bit. If anything, he seemed to enjoy “slipping under the radar”, as he once termed it. During last year's series in England — when Dravid made three hundreds against a high-quality attack in difficult conditions, while the rest of his colleagues faltered — an awestruck Nasser Hussain asked Tendulkar at a charity function what it was like to be Tendulkar. “How come you didn't ask me about being Rahul Dravid?” jested Dravid, tongue firmly in cheek. Much like Tendulkar, Dravid wore his greatness lightly. The reason his appeal wasn't wider was because his ability wasn't as obvious as Tendulkar or Brian Lara's. Dravid's batsmanship wasn't so much about stroke-production — in itself a remarkable blend of the classically orthodox, the awkwardly adjusted, and the scrupulously studious — as it was about mental and physical discipline. He was a batsman's batsman, better appreciated by his peers than the masses. In addition to being a genuinely great batsman, among the very best to have played the game, Dravid was also a first-rate slip catcher (although his catching became less secure in the final stages). He mightn't have been a natural leader, but he was tactically India's most progressive, most aggressive captain of the modern era. Above all, he was, with every fibre of his being, a team-man. It's this quality that enabled him to leave gracefully, a master of timing, to the end.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/to-the-end-a-master-of-timing/article2978746.ece
10,3,2012,Culture of intolerance,"It takes only a few people to give a whole State and country a bad name. Tamil chauvinist outfits working on the fringes of the political mainstream in Tamil Nadu have been organising protests and carrying out attacks against visiting Sri Lankan officials and academics in the guise of drawing attention to the Sri Lankan government's failure to ensure the rights of its Tamil citizens. Often, ordinary Sri Lankans on private visits have been the target of these groups claiming to act on behalf of the people of Tamil Nadu. In the latest instance, activists of Naam Tamizhar Iyakkam and May 17 Movement forced Jeeva Niriella, an academic from Sri Lanka, to cut short her participation in a function at the Manonmaniam Sundaranar University in Tirunelveli. Ms Niriella was an invited guest of the university, but, quite shockingly, the university registrar apologised to the protestors for having allowed her to attend the event held as part of the International Women's Day celebrations. That a handful of self-righteous individuals can compel a university to back off in this fashion speaks poorly not only of the university authorities, but also of the law enforcing machinery in the State. If not checked immediately, such instances can quickly lead to a culture of intolerance in Tamil Nadu, risking its reputation for peace and hospitality.
Sadly, the role of the Tamil Nadu government in dealing with episodes like these has been truly problematic. Chief Minister Jayalalithaa was well within her rights to insist that the Centre inform the State government about visits by Sri Lankan VIPs and other dignitaries to Tamil Nadu. Prior intimation would help the local authorities take precautionary security measures. But, in her letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Ms Jayalalithaa went on to urge the Government of India to discourage “such frequent visits” and allow such visits only after consulting the State government. Ms Jayalalithaa's stand appears to have emboldened the activists of fringe groups. Many people in Tamil Nadu and elsewhere in India have genuine concerns over the conduct of the Sri Lankan government in dealing with the rights of Sri Lankan Tamils. But this cannot be used as an excuse to target any and all Sri Lankans visiting the State, whether pilgrims, intellectuals or dignitaries. Ironically, some of those assaulted have been Tamils from across the Palk Strait. There are appropriate bilateral and multilateral forums and channels to raise issues such as the rights of Tamils in Sri Lanka. Little would be achieved by viewing anything and everything relating to Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans through this single prism.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/culture-of-intolerance/article2978747.ece
12,3,2012,Sonshine in U.P.,"It is a sign of the times that Akhilesh Yadav sailed into the Chief Minister's chair in Uttar Pradesh even as the Congress struggled to find a suitable candidate to fill the top post in neighbouring Uttarakhand. To be sure, Yadav junior fairly walked into the job, having beaten the odds to win a super-hero sized victory for the party. The Samajwadi Party's haul is the largest since 1985, when the Congress piled up the numbers on the back of a humongous Rajiv wave. The old guard in the SP, which was admittedly more comfortable with patriarch Mulayam Singh, had no option but to yield in the face of the cadre's emotional response to the younger Yadav, who was seen to have earned the promotion by dint of hard work rather than as a familial bequest. At 38, Mr. Yadav will be U.P's youngest Chief Minister, and fittingly so, given the demographic profile of India and its most-watched political State. The positive note Mr. Yadav struck on the campaign enabled him to connect with a generation that had clearly tired of the U.P. “badland” stereotype and whose aspirations he seemed to understand; in a poll arena crowded with pompous and hate-spewing contestants, the young SP leader was noticeable for eschewing personal attacks and outlining a forward-looking vision.
But here comes the hard part. The sheer size of the State — with a population of over 200 million spread over 2.5 lakh square kilometres, U.P could be a nation in itself — can daunt the toughest administrator, and Mr. Yadav's job is rendered that much more difficult by his youth and inexperience. It is no help that the SP has a reputation that precedes it. Though a key point of the SP's campaign was that it would not tolerate lawlessness from the ranks, the aftermath of the party's triumph appeared to confirm the worst fears about it. Indeed, what should have been a moment to savour for the Chief Minister-designate was marred by reports of large-scale violence by partymen showing off their muscle for all to see. The rampaging mobs killed a young boy, roughed up journalists and set upon Dalits. In the event, Mr. Yadav's promise to prioritise restoration of law and order will be watched keenly by observers aware of Mayawati's sterling record in this respect. There are other challenges before Mr. Yadav: Farmers are in distress, much of rural U.P. continues be haunted by power outages and corruption has made nonsense of the delivery of government services. There is also no writing off the Bahujan Samaj Party: With a 26 per cent vote share, the elephant is surely waiting for the cycle to trip up.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sonshine-in-up/article2985188.ece
12,3,2012,Don't give up on Iran oil,"India finds itself in a rather difficult situation following the West's sanctions on Iran and the overt pressure being brought on it by the United States to curtail oil imports from the Gulf nation. Iran is India's second largest supplier of crude oil after Saudi Arabia and given the growing energy requirements of the country, it is not a viable option to close the tap on Iran, even if the West has done so. India should be guided in this issue solely by its own interests and not by sanctions that the U.S. and Europe may apply outside of the United Nations umbrella. Indeed, the pressure has been on for more than a year now on India. First, the payments for Iranian oil imports through banks based in the West were choked but India found a way out by routing money through a Turkish bank. But with pressure mounting on Turkey to close the channel, India and Iran agreed to rupee payments with about half the value of imports to be paid thus. And now, there is pressure to wind down imports from Iran totally, not just on India but also on China and Japan. While Japan is negotiating with the U.S. to keep a part of its imports out of the sanctions, China has thus far ignored them.
India, however, appears to be succumbing to pressure. Recent reports speak of Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, the biggest consumer of Iranian crude, reducing its imports for the next fiscal by almost half. This is rather worrying because Iran accounts for 12 per cent of India's crude oil imports and it will be extremely tough to find a viable replacement for that quantum in the prevailing stretched market conditions for oil. The replacement price could also be higher. Policymakers should strategise to find an intelligent way out of the problem rather than giving in to American demands. Iran is said to be entering into barter deals with countries such as Russia by exchanging oil for wheat. India should offer similar bargains to Iran for not just food grain but also refined petroleum products. It is strange but true that Iran, despite being a major oil supplier, is short on refining capacity. India can undertake to supply transportation and other fuels to Iran in lieu of payments for its crude supplies. Public sector refiners who source Iranian crude can re-export refined products to that country. Iran has also offered to supply oil to India through its own tankers if India is unable to charter vessels due to insurance problems. Indeed, there are reports of some oil parcels being delivered to India thus in the last few weeks. India should engage with Iran to consider imaginative payment and transportation options to maintain supplies rather than meekly submit to unfair pressure.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dont-give-up-on-iran-oil/article2985189.ece
13,3,2012,Not out of the woods yet,"While B.S. Yeddyurappa has reasons to be pleased by the recent Karnataka High Court judgment quashing the FIR registered by the Lokayukta police against him, he has no cause to be elated. For though the Court flatly rejected the portion of the Lokayukta report that indicted him in the illegal mining scam and invalidated the sanction given by the Governor to prosecute him, the judgment should not be read as an acquittal, as some of Mr. Yeddyurappa's overzealous supporters have done. The main thrust of the verdict is directed at what the Court construed as the serious procedural infirmities in the Lokayukta's report. It held that the former Lokayukta, Santosh Hegde, had erred in recommending the initiation of criminal proceedings against Mr. Yeddyurappa without calling for an explanation from him as required under Section 9 (3) of the Karnataka Lokayukta Act. It also maintained that the portion of the Lokayukta report that related to the former Chief Minister was outside the scope of the reference made to the quasi-judicial body by the Karnataka government under Section 7 (2) of the same Act.
The fact that the High Court objected to the Lokayukta's report on such broad procedural grounds should not detract attention from two serious allegations made against Mr. Yeddyurappa and his kin on the mining issue. The first relates to the donation of Rs. 10 crore received by a trust managed by his children from a company with mining interests. The second relates to the sale proceeds of Rs. 20 crore received by his kin from another such company for a piece of land said to be worth only a fraction of the paid amount. The fact that these transactions took place is not contested. The Karnataka High Court may be correct in pointing out that there is no evidence to show that Mr. Yeddyurappa — who was neither Chief Minister nor Minister for Mines when these companies received their leases — did anything to favour them. But surely no one can deny that the facts scream out for a full-fledged investigation that satisfactorily explains these mysterious payments. If the BJP is not in a hurry to reinstate Mr. Yeddyurappa as Chief Minister, it is because the party is aware that he is not out of the woods yet. The Karnataka High Court judgment could be challenged in the Supreme Court and there are other cases pending against him. More importantly, it is possible that the Central Empowered Committee (CEC), which was appointed by the Supreme Court to probe illegal mining in Karnataka, may indict him in its report or even go as far as recommending a CBI investigation into Mr. Yeddyurappa's role — something the State government has opposed. Temporary reprieve? Yes. A permanent release? No.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/not-out-of-the-woods-yet/article2988504.ece
13,3,2012,Bodoland at a crossroads,"As the movement demanding a homeland for the Bodo people completes 25 years, it remains one of the most serious potential sources of violent political confrontation in northeastern India. The Bodoland Autonomous Council that came out of the first tripartite Bodo Accord of 1993, and the Bodoland Territorial Council that the second tripartite Bodo Accord of 2003 spawned, have admittedly failed to meet the political aspirations of the movement's leadership. These involve the constitution of a state comprising nearly a third of Assam — although the agitationists' war-cry has been to “Divide Assam 50-50.” The futility of, and the contradictions involved in, seeking the formation of separate states as a means to meet sub-national aspirations is once again in focus here. Yet another territorial division of Assam is inconceivable. It certainly cannot be done with the ease with which splits could be effected in the 1960s and 1970s. Even admitting the historical grievances behind the cultural-political rebellions among the State's “tribal communities” — and the poignancy of the Bodo cause stemming from their perception of themselves as a part of the composite “indigenous” population of Assam that has been overrun — the Bodoland demand faces singular imponderables. The most serious of these may well be the perversions that set in under the movement's umbrella, particularly the tactic of extortionist violence. This has undermined its ideological moorings. Thus, it is fruitless in the present context to dwell any more on the feasibility of a separate political entity for Bodos.
Under Sheikh Hasina, Dhaka has also done its bit to stem Bodo militancy. The handing over in 2010 of Ranjan Daimary, who led the National Democratic Front for Bodoland, was a signal to all insurgents in the region that Bangladesh would no more be a sanctuary. At a point when the government's sustained and aggressive security strategies, coupled with a push and a shove from across the border, have virtually broken the back of the other regional scourge of ULFA, the State and Central governments should wake up to the new threat — however empty it may sound — held out by the Bodo agitators at their meeting in Kamrup district on March 2 under the banner of the All Bodo Students' Union to breathe new life into their campaign. The dying embers should be doused by means of a systematic and sustained strategy that also helps meet the genuine developmental needs of the Bodo people. Yet, scepticism about the Centre's perspective on the long-term problems of the region persists. A coherent policy, not ad-hocism, should be the hallmark of its approach.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bodoland-at-a-crossroads/article2988588.ece
14,3,2012,The ABCs of RTE,"As it stands on the threshold of the Twelfth Plan, India has a historic opportunity to elevate education and healthcare as the strongest pillars of its future development. Yearning for life-building education is unprecedented today. Yet, as Amartya Sen pointed out last year, the system remains deeply unjust. Access to excellence is open to those who can afford it, while the less-affluent majority has been left behind without even full schooling. That injustice is evident in the low figure of mean years of schooling for the national working age population: 5.12 years in 2010, compared to China's 8.17 years, and Brazil's 7.54 years. In a full decade from 2000, India could not raise the mean substantially from 4.2 years. Tragically, political parties, which see education as too distant an issue to produce electoral victories, have shown little anxiety to improve the country's standing. It is time to change this sorry legacy. Going by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's affirmation, more funds will be devoted for the two key Twelfth Plan priorities, education and health. The UPA has been augmenting the resource base for some years now, using a 3 per cent cess for education, of which 2 per cent is earmarked for elementary education. That effort has raised significant funding, averaging Rs.11,000 crore a year since 2008 and it deserves to be strengthened. The challenge is to spend the funds in a manner that produces tangible, measurable outcomes.
The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act empowers all children to demand eight years of schooling, and everything must be done to encourage people to exercise this fundamental right. Meaningful use of the law requires new infrastructure. But that is the easier part. It is the lack of human resources that is more worrying. The Planning Commission identifies the twin problems of half a million existing teacher-vacancies, and the need to have another half a million teachers with requisite qualifications to meet the RTE Act's pupil-teacher ratio. Priority must therefore be accorded to start as many accredited teacher training institutions as necessary. Such a measure can improve learning outcomes, which are far below desirable levels now. Raising the gross enrolment ratio at the secondary school level from 60 per cent should be the other priority. Expansion of both primary and secondary schooling should remain the responsibility of the state. But Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the main vehicle for universalisation of elementary education, can tap non-profit initiatives for speedy infrastructure building. Strong commitment towards rising outlays for education alone can determine India's long-term development.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-ABCs-of-RTE/article13074831.ece
14,3,2012,Where sequencing helps,"The season of high decibel economic policy announcements which culminates with the Union budget on March 16 began quite unexpectedly and ahead of schedule. On March 9, just six days before a scheduled monetary policy review, the Reserve Bank of India cut the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by a larger than anticipated 0.75 percentage points. As intended, the move surprised market participants, not the least because the RBI has, in recent times, seldom stepped outside the dates of scheduled policy reviews to announce monetary measures. The central bank has justified the timing as well as the quantum of the rate cut. Expected to release some Rs.48,000 crore of impounded bank deposits, the move is meant to alleviate the liquidity shortage that has gripped the markets and which threatens to become even more severe by the middle of the month when outflows from the banking system by way of advance tax payments are expected to peak. In the RBI's assessment, its pre-policy intervention brooked no delay. A strict adherence to the conventional dates for making policy changes would not have helped at this juncture as the impounded money gets released after a lag. However, the decision to cut the CRR alone without touching the repo rates is akin to splitting the monetary policy review into two stages and raises the larger question as to whether the actual review on Thursday will be a non-event.
The government's Economic Survey, an essential adjunct to the budget process, is also due to be released on that date. The budget has been delayed this year while the monetary review is on schedule. Unless presented in a logical sequence, the surfeit of economic information covering the entire spectrum of monetary and fiscal policies can pose daunting challenges for those assessing their implications for macroeconomic policy. For instance, a repo rate cut rather than a CRR reduction would be a more potent signal for banks to reduce their interest rates. However, there is no evidence yet that the RBI has shifted its interest rate policy decisively. There are signs of suppressed inflation in key sectors such as fuel prices, fertilizer and food subsidies. Besides, inflation expectations have hardened and more than ever before, the RBI requires a firmer commitment from the government to join the battle against inflation. With the budget scheduled for the day after the monetary review, it is likely that the RBI will wait until April to act more decisively in bringing down interest rates. Important as the RBI's signals would be on interest rates, it is the budget that will hold the key to stimulating investment and savings.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/where-sequencing-helps/article2991985.ece
15,3,2012,The engine is politics,"Given India's fractious politics, a Railway budget wouldn't be a Railway budget if the Opposition didn't accuse it of being “anti-people.” But when the charge comes from the Treasury benches — and from the coalition partner to which the hapless minister belongs, whose leader then goes on to demand his sacking — the signals this sends out about the state of the government are not at all encouraging. Considering the financial crisis the Indian Railways is passing through, Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi has tried to arrest the slide. But the method he has chosen hits poor citizens the hardest. Ironically, it was his predecessor, Mamata Banerjee's pursuit of a political agenda in West Bengal that sent the railways down a dangerous financial track. The problem with populism is that it is impossible to sustain indefinitely. For eight years, successive Railway ministers took pride in never raising fares. Of course, when the deferred rise eventually comes, the one-shot hike hurts more than if there had been continuous but marginal increases over a longer period. So while Ms. Banerjee is obliged to decry Mr. Trivedi's fare increases — which range from 20 per cent to 150 per cent depending on the fare class and distance travelled — she must share the blame for this kind of crisis budgeting. The Minister tried to soften the blow by a major pre-budget revision and rationalisation of freight tariffs that should raise Rs. 20,000 crore a year. But the opposition to his budget makes a fare hike rollback for the poorest of passengers inevitable.
Where Mr. Trivedi has scored is in his focus on safety. Besides setting up a Railway Safety Authority as a statutory regulatory body as recommended by the Kadkodkar Committee, tracks, bridges, signalling and telecommunications, rolling stock, stations, level crossings and freight terminals will all be focus areas. Mr. Trivedi's decision to pursue the redevelopment of stations through the PPP mode may help upgrade passenger facilities but the contracts and projects must be carefully audited. He also said a Logistics Corporation will take on freight, and a national High Speed Railway Authority will be set up to look at the six corridors identified for development. However, the key index the Railways has to look at is the Operating Ratio — the amount spent to generate Rs. 100 in revenue — which has climbed to 95 per cent. Mr. Trivedi intends to bring this indicator down to 84 per cent in the coming year. The long-term health of the Railways depends on meeting that efficiency target and going beyond it; squeezing a few extra rupees from those passengers who may least be able to afford it is hardly the answer.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-engine-is-politics/article2995520.ece
15,3,2012,Punishing a whistleblower,"The United Nations special rapporteur on torture has just submitted his findings on Washington's prolonged and controversial detention of WikiLeaks hero Bradley Manning. Simply put, he has concluded that the punitive conditions imposed on him, before being pronounced guilty, amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. The former U.S. intelligence analyst has been under incarceration since May 2010 for allegedly having leaked secret State Department cables to the whistleblower website WikiLeaks. Mr. Manning is charged with over 20 offences, of which that of aiding the enemy could even attract the death penalty. The United States government has hampered investigations into his treatment — including solitary confinement for eight months, ostensibly to prevent him from causing harm to himself. Significantly, the U.N. special rapporteur, Juan Mendez, who has concluded his 14-month investigation, was denied a private interview with the detainee. The findings, which form part of his report last week to the U.N. Human Rights Council, is the latest attempt to elicit U.S. cooperation in the investigations into Mr. Manning's incarceration. Earlier, over 50 members of the European Parliament and hundreds of American legal scholars had written to the U.S. Congress noting that 17 months had elapsed in bringing the accused before a pre-trial court.
Mr. Manning's treatment is reminiscent of the Central Intelligence Agency's infamous enhanced interrogation techniques used with impunity during the Bush era against detainees at Guantanamo. Significantly, the White House today is guilty of supporting the very kind of extra-judicial methods that Barack Obama the candidate pledged to end and even outlaw in the run up to the 2008 elections. While the Bush administration at least allowed the Red Cross to have access to Guantanamo inmates, the current administration has taken a step back in refusing to allow the U.N. rapporteur to meet privately with Mr. Manning. The Manning case is proof yet again of the hypocrisy and double standards that govern Washington's attitude towards human rights and the rule of law. Equally disturbing, from the point of view of international precedent, is the fact that Washington seems intent on making an example of someone who is essentially a whistleblower. The financial targeting of WikiLeaks is of a piece with the same vindictive mindset. States are entitled to protect their secrets and punish those who break the law. But there is a line they must not cross in trying to do so. In the Manning case, the U.S. has crossed that line.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Punishing-a-whistleblower/article13076000.ece
16,3,2012,Dealing with Sri Lanka,"India faces a crucial decision-making moment at the United Nations Human Rights Council on the U.S.-sponsored resolution that urges Sri Lanka to address rights violations alleged against its army in the final phase of the war against the LTTE in 2009. At one level, this decision should be easy to make — New Delhi does not support country-specific resolutions at the HRC in Geneva. Sri Lanka, however, poses a special challenge. All this time, quiet diplomacy rather than grandstanding has been New Delhi's preferred path in prodding Sri Lanka towards reconciliation with the island's Tamil minority. That this has not produced the desired outcome, especially in the matter of a forward-looking political solution to the Tamil question, is evident. Three years after winning the war against the LTTE, Sri Lanka is yet to cement a peace with the Tamils. Instead, the triumphalism about the military victory, unaddressed human rights violations and the overwhelming presence of the Army in northern Sri Lanka, have deepened the political alienation of the Tamils. But if quiet diplomacy hasn't worked, India must carefully assess whether the HRC resolution will get the Sri Lankan government to move in the right direction. Western powers seem to believe it can shame Sri Lanka into doing this. In fact, the proposed censure might work in exactly the opposite way, by further fuelling Sinhala nationalism and rendering the possibility of political reconciliation even more distant.
As for the “feelings” of the political parties in Tamil Nadu, it should be clear by now that for them, the Sri Lankan Tamil issue is an opportunity for cynical one-upmanship, and nothing more. There was no clearer evidence of this than at the time of the UPA victory in 2009, which coincided with the last stand of the LTTE. After creating a furore over the war in Sri Lanka during the elections, the DMK's only concern after the results was how many and which cabinet positions the party would get in the new government. The Sri Lankan High Commissioner's suggestion that the members of parliament from Tamil Nadu are unwitting propagandists of the LTTE shows poor understanding of the dynamics at play in the State; his comment can only worsen the din. However, it should be clear to all concerned that a decision by India not to support the resolution cannot be seen as backing for Sri Lanka's record on human rights; Colombo would be mistaken if it interprets it thus. Indeed, an Indian decision to abstain or vote against the resolution would place an even bigger responsibility on New Delhi to ensure — through more effective and even hard-edged diplomacy — that the Rajapaksa government delivers on the commitments it has made on the political and human rights front.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dealing-with-sri-lanka/article2999576.ece
16,3,2012,"Two documents, common concerns","It is not at all surprising that two important economic policy statements — the Reserve Bank of India's mid-quarter monetary policy review and the Economic Survey — both released one day ahead of the Union budget, should focus on the core concerns of the macro economy. The RBI's scheduled mid-quarter policy review was hardly the non-event it was feared it would turn out to be. A cut in interest rates was not on the cards and with no expectation of one, attention turned to the RBI's views on the economy, especially inflation, fiscal consolidation and growth. Inevitably there is an overlap between the central bank's views and the Economic Survey, although they vary in their emphasis. Both agree with the official forecast that the economy will grow by 6.9 per cent during this year. However the Survey is much more optimistic about the future, predicting a pick up in growth to 7.6 per cent in 2012-13 and 8.6 per cent the following year. These numbers do not appear very realistic. In previous years, the Survey has sometimes been embarrassingly wrong with its rosy projections. Last year, for example, the forecast was for a growth rate of 9 per cent and for the fiscal deficit to be contained within 4.1 per cent of the GDP during the current year, way off from the latest consensus estimate of 6 per cent.
In contrast, the RBI has been circumspect, pointing out that government finances have been deteriorating during 2011-12. Key deficit indicators have, by January, crossed the budget estimates for the full year. Tax revenues have been sluggish and the government's non-plan expenditure, particularly on subsidies, has gone up sharply. The slippage in the fiscal deficit has fuelled inflationary pressures, whose containment will depend upon a credible action plan for fiscal consolidation. That is an area which the budget is bound to focus on but the Survey's bland assertion that fiscal consolidation is on track needs to be supported by evidence. Again, while the Economic Survey takes note of the moderation in inflation by the end of last year, it has ignored the more recent spike caused by a spurt in food prices. In fact, the battle against inflation that has dominated policy discourse is far from over. As the RBI records, upside risks to inflation have increased. Crude oil prices remain high and the rupee has depreciated. The trade deficit has widened sharply and financing the current account deficit is proving to be a daunting task. The key take-away from the RBI report is that notwithstanding a slowdown, inflation risks remain high. This is surely something the Finance Minister will have to ponder over.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/two-documents-common-concerns/article2999583.ece
17,3,2012,On a wing and a prayer,"The Union budget for 2012-13 seeks to address two primary concerns — the economic slowdown and the unsatisfactory state of government finances — but the means it employs are so cautious, and even contradictory, that the chances of success appear slim. No doubt the fiscal space for stimulating growth, either by way of tax concessions or increased public expenditure, has shrunk. But that is no excuse for the lack of policy imagination. Last year, global factors — such as the eurozone crisis — and high inflation in India constrained economic growth. The economy which had grown at a relatively fast rate of 8.4 per cent in each of the two preceding years is expected to clock just 6.9 per cent during the current year, a rate of growth which, however, is still high by contemporary global standards. Drawing inspiration from the Economic Survey, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee expects growth to be around 7.6 per cent in 2012-13, moving one percentage point higher the following year. These might prove elusive. In any case, a narrow, obsessive focus on growth rates — including the decimals — can be counterproductive, especially because it is the quality of growth rather than the actual figure that is more important. Besides stoking inflationary pressures on the demand side, India's consumption-driven growth has come at the cost of investments which alone can sustain growth in the coming years.
On fiscal consolidation, the budget has wisely steered clear of an absolutist position which calls for a drastic fiscal correction as the only way to avoid a situation of low growth and high inflation. The Finance Minister hopes to contain the fiscal deficit at 5.1 per cent of GDP in 2012-13, lower than the anticipated 5.9 per cent during the current year. There are sceptics, to be sure, but given the need to increase social spending, a correction can take place only over an extended period. In any case, the sustainability of debt is not in question. Apart from introducing necessary amendments to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, Mr. Mukherjee has come up with two new concepts: “effective revenue deficit” and “medium term expenditure framework” to better target public expenditure. He will endeavour to keep central subsidies under 2 per cent of the GDP. The flip side to fiscal consolidation, of course, is that there has been no significant step-up in social sector schemes, though the government has yet to fully show its expenditure numbers on the Right to Food front. Indeed the food subsidy allocations in the current budget will not allow the UPA to roll out the sort of robust entitlements the poor in India need.
On the tax front, the Finance Minister takes more from the taxpayer than what he has given. The increase in basic exemption limit on personal income tax, though small, is still welcome. Yet the relief is undone by the increase in service tax and excise duty. Aside from the regressive effect that indirect taxes have on equity, the hike will push up the prices of all items of daily consumption and services for the common citizen. Budgeted revenue from excise duty will rise by 29 per cent while that from service taxes will go up by 30 per cent, providing a revenue cushion of sorts to Mr. Mukherjee. The abolition of duty on coal imports by power plants for two years is a welcome measure that will provide relief to power companies that have been hit by higher prices due to policy changes in the coal-exporting nations. Allowing power companies and airlines to use external commercial borrowings (ECB) to finance a part of their rupee debt and working capital respectively will help these sectors get back on track though the permission smacks of ad hocism. However, the decision substantially to increase the cess on domestic crude oil production is a retrograde move that is bound to have a cascading effect on retail fuel prices. Also retrograde was the one move not made: thanks to lobbying by the auto-industry, the Petroleum Ministry's proposal to hike sales tax on diesel-run motor cars as a painless means of containing the diesel subsidy did not find favour in North Block.
The decision to increase duties on gold is an interesting one that is aimed at curbing the rising import of the yellow metal which, according to Mr. Mukherjee himself, is pushing up the current account deficit. Import of gold and other precious metals has risen by 50 per cent in the first three quarters of this fiscal. An unstated aim of the move is obviously also to channelise public money into productive investment avenues that will help the economy. Gold is an idle investment that has no multiplier effect. A similar objective can be seen in the reduction in the securities transaction tax from 0.125 per cent to 0.1 per cent for cash delivery transactions on the stock market. As expected, the Finance Minister also signified his intention to introduce the General Anti Avoidance Rules as a counter to tax avoidance schemes. But Mr. Mukherjee might just have set off a storm over the proposed amendment to Section 9 of the Income Tax Act, allowing the government to reopen controversial transactions like the sale of Hutch to Vodafone. Plugging a loophole that allows companies to avoid capital gains tax is a good thing, even though the courts will likely have the final word given the amendment's retrospective effect. The days ahead will show if this will be the single biggest act of what was largely a dour budget.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/on-a-wing-and-a-prayer/article3003656.ece
17,3,2012,Climbing Mt Tendulkar,"Sachin Tendulkar, if he is given to such fancies, might have felt a sense of déjà vu over the past year—a sense of experiencing his glittering career in miniature. Hardly had the Little Master enjoyed his most prolific year (2010) in Test cricket and savoured the heady success of a World Cup win when the familiar constricting pressure reappeared. The national obsession with him hadn't dimmed; it had merely been distributed among the members of a resurgent Team India. But with expectations of a 100th international hundred raised to fever pitch, and India's standards — and his own, to a lesser extent — sliding, the 38-year-old genius from Mumbai will have been reminded of the time every innings of his affected the country's mood. Typically, Tendulkar has handled the period of 12 months and 33 innings with dignity. He has said little; but he has always maintained that he plays not for records but because he loves the game. Yet it's his numbers that help put his greatness in perspective. So while a 100th hundred is no more or less significant than a 101st or 99th — indeed, it's an artificial landmark as some critics have suggested — the roundness of the figure allows us to stand back and comprehend its staggering enormity.
Longevity is the gold standard of greatness. Over the course of a long career — particularly one such as Tendulkar's, which has spanned cricket eras — every facet is subjected to the strictest scrutiny. It takes a singular individual to survive change: in his 23 years in international cricket, the great man has seen the game evolve both subtly and significantly. But it takes no less than a defining figure to dictate the course of change. As a constant presence, but not an unchanging one, Tendulkar has been a major part of the evolution, his batsmanship and the bowlers' reaction to it altering cricket. He laid down the template for greatness across formats, art customised to canvas. Cricket hasn't seen a better Test and One-Day International batsman. Sir Vivian Richards was a dominant master of both formats — and he's Tendulkar's only competitor for the honour — but the Indian has done it for longer and with greater consistency than the illustrious West Indian. Tendulkar himself will debate the point, for he holds Richards in the highest esteem. But there's no arguing with long-term numbers. Consider the list of first-rate bowlers Tendulkar has faced: Imran Khan, Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Sir Richard Hadlee, Craig McDermott, Malcolm Marshall, Curtly Ambrose, Courtney Walsh, Allan Donald, Glenn McGrath, Shane Warne, Jason Gillespie, Muttiah Muralitharan, Brett Lee, James Anderson, and Dale Steyn. A hundred hundreds against these worthies is, without a doubt, one of the finest achievements in modern-day cricket.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/climbing-mt-tendulkar/article3003779.ece
19,3,2012,Losing hearts and minds,"The prompt apologies expressed by the United States government over the recent killing of 16 Afghan civilians, including several children, by an American soldier may have damped down protests, but they will not subdue the anger and bitterness millions of Afghans feel over the war's rising civilian death toll, which the United Nations put at over 3,000 in 2011 alone. There is simmering resentment over repeated episodes of other kinds in which the conduct of Nato forces has been grossly offensive. The March 11 killings are only the latest in a long series, and Washington's claim that these are isolated incidents is not credible. U.S. troops have killed civilians for sport, cutting off body parts as trophies; their aircraft have killed children and teenagers in night air raids on remote rural areas, their units have filmed themselves urinating on the bodies of Afghans they have killed, and more. British troops have engaged in their own barbarities, some of which have been filmed. Furthermore, the film of U.S. troops burning copies of the Koran shows the contempt a number of its soldiers have for both Afghanistan and Islam. Equally offensive is the fact that the soldier responsible for the Panjwai killings has been flown out for trial in an American military court; the clear message is that Nato troops are above Afghan law, that the Afghan judicial process is not good enough to try them. This makes a nonsense of U.S. claims of respect for Afghan sovereignty.
It could well be that the U.S.-led forces have learnt nothing during their decade-long war, which has already cost the Nato allies over $500 billion, but the fact which few in the western political establishment can admit is that this war has long lost whatever little meaning it might once have had. The Taliban hold sway across a broad swathe of the southern provinces, the Karzai government is all but confined to Kabul, the drug trade continues unchecked, and the prospects of anything like democracy and its concomitant rights for women are as remote as ever. Even Washington's misguided dialogue with the Taliban appears to have run aground before it took off. As the self-imposed deadline of 2014 for the withdrawal of U.S. troops approaches, it is essential that Afghan sovereignty be strengthened and respected in word and deed. This means ensuring a greater role for the Afghan National Security Forces, particularly in combat operations, and zero tolerance towards acts by western troops which are an affront to Afghanistan's identity and sense of self-respect.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/losing-hearts-and-minds/article3009683.ece
19,3,2012,Water transport imperatives,"The Union Government has yet again announced its resolve to “fast-track” the development of Inland Water Transport. IWT for passenger and freight movement involves lower operating costs and environmental pollution than for road, rail or air options. It could relieve pressure on the other modes, which face their own constraints. The global experience offers interesting comparisons. In several countries, IWT accounts for a substantial share as a percentage of the total: 32 per cent in Bangladesh, 20 in Germany, 14 in the U.S. and 9 in China. In China, much of the increase has occurred in recent decades, in tandem with its phenomenal industrial-agricultural growth. By contrast, in India only 0.15 per cent of domestic surface transport is accounted for by IWT, compared with 68 per cent for road and 30 per cent for rail. IWT in India has over the years seen very slow growth, except in the case of the tidal river-canal system in Goa. There are examples such as Kerala where traffic has shifted substantially from IWT to other modes over the last decade. The reasons are many, but include, most significantly, lack of investment for the creation of infrastructure modernisation and lack of efficient operators. India has inland waterways with a navigable length of 14,500 km, but of this only 5,700 km is being used for navigation by mechanised vessels.
In 2006, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport criticised the government for extending ‘step-motherly' treatment to IWT, with inadequate allocations and improper fund utilisation. It noted that inadequate policy support for — and interest and investment in — the sector were compounding the problems, leading to IWT losing its competitive edge. The Inland Water Transport Policy Document of 2001 sought to give an impetus to the Inland Waterways Authority of India, the statutory authority responsible for the regulation, development, maintenance, and better utilisation of waterways. But the follow-up has been tardy. The government declared five sections as national waterways: 1,620 km on the Ganga; 890 km on the Brahmaputra; 205 km in Kerala, 1,027 km across Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, and 588 km in West Bengal and Orissa. Yet, traffic on waterways remains sparse. IWT still appears to be more of a hobby project than a serious alternative transportation option. India needs to study the viability and means to attract more investment to the sector, by creating an institutional framework. IWT should also become a part of the National Maritime Development Programme. The enhanced level of involvement of the private sector in IWT that has now been initiated is a welcome step. More waterways should be identified for development, and those earmarked given a push. IWT should power the growth of the economy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/water-transport-imperatives/article3009659.ece
20,3,2012,Congress without Trinamool,"Mamata Banerjee will do anything to enhance her political image, even if this means humiliating her senior colleagues in the Trinamool Congress (TMC). By obtaining the resignation of Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi, the West Bengal Chief Minister is hoping to project herself as the sole champion of the poor, as someone who is able to push and prod the UPA government at the Centre into working for the greater common good. Mr. Trivedi was obviously taken aback by the developments; if Ms Banerjee had only indicated what her red lines were for the Railway budget, he would have presumably found a way to oblige her. But what Ms Banerjee wanted was not a Railway budget she could praise, but one she could first criticise and then re-mould into her very own people-friendly variant. More important than not raising passenger fares was making certain that the fares, once raised, were lowered at her insistence. For the UPA government, the problem is not the exit of Mr. Trivedi, not even a reworking of the railway budget with all the attendant difficulties. What must be worrying the Congress and the rest of the UPA is the political cost of the never-ending pressure from the TMC. Whether it is the issue of foreign direct investment in retail, or the creation of Lokayuktas, or the Pension Bill, or a hike in the price of petroleum products, Ms Banerjee manages to make the Manmohan Singh government stop or pause or rewind. Each time, as she maximises her political mileage, the Congress ends up looking a clueless pivot of a rudderless government.
If Ms Banerjee continues with her tantrums, the Congress, sooner or later, might come to believe there is no future in an alliance with the Trinamool. Even in West Bengal, the TMC has been gaining over the years at the expense of the Congress. That the two parties failed to reach an agreement for the current round of Rajya Sabha elections might not hold long-term significance in itself. But given their fractious relationship, any political development could serve as the trigger for a major upheaval. While there is no immediate danger of the UPA government being voted out in the event of a break-up with the Trinamool, the Congress can at best have a hand-to-mouth existence for the rest of the tenure of the current Lok Sabha. The moment Trinamool withdraws support, others inside and outside the alliance will begin to exercise their leverage. As its options decrease, the Congress can only decide at whose mercy it should be in the months ahead. But no matter what, the UPA is unlikely to be able to set the governance agenda for the remainder of its term.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/congress-without-trinamool/article3013555.ece
20,3,2012,Let good sense prevail,"“Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way”. The opening lines of Anna Karenina could easily have been scripted for the Bhattacharyas, whose plight — after a Norwegian court placed their two toddlers in permanent foster care — has generated indignation in India and led to high-level diplomacy between Oslo and New Delhi. The parents have alleged the children's removal stems from a deep cultural bias. The Child Welfare Service in Norway has consistently denied this, saying the children were removed for far serious reasons related to their delayed development. Conscious that the truth may well lie in between, The Hindu asked its Europe correspondent, Vaiju Naravane, to travel to Stavanger to investigate. After reviewing the files and interviewing the family as well as CWS officials, the picture that emerges is a complex one that defies easy pigeonholing. The strains of negotiating a foreign culture and environment are evident — both for the Bhattacharyas and for the Norwegian authorities — but the fact that the family needed assistance is undeniable. The parents have said they themselves approached the kindergarten for help when the older child showed autism-like symptoms, now diagnosed as Attachment Disorder. The mother, too, said she was suffering from post-partum depression and was unable to cope in the Norwegian cold, with a husband who worked long hours.
Though littered with cultural misunderstandings and even insensitivity, all the reports submitted by care personnel working independently of each other saw a problem in the mother's refusal to admit the seriousness of the boy's condition or to accept help. This is largely why the CWS has insisted custody be denied to Mrs Bhattacharya and her family and has sought assurances that the boy will receive the special attention he requires once he is legally handed over to the husband's brother under the terms of a compromise worked out. On its part, the CWS is not without blame. It has shown cultural insensitivity and made serious mistakes in handling the case. The decision to place the children into permanent care contravened Norway's own Child Protection Act which states: “Due account shall also be taken of ensuring continuity in the child's upbringing and of the ethnic, religious cultural and linguistic background.” Foster parenting in Norway would obliterate that “continuity”. As the case heads towards final resolution before a Norwegian court on March 23, it is essential that the emotionalism with which it has been invested be kept aside. Now that both governments are involved, there is no reason why specialists from India cannot also be made a part of the counselling process should the court hearing prove inconclusive.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/let-good-sense-prevail/article3013551.ece
21,3,2012,The burden of power,"The Tamil Nadu Cabinet's decision to allow the resumption of work on the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project has created understandable euphoria in the nuclear establishment, consternation among traditional opponents of nuclear power and a sense of relief to industry, which has been hit hard by chronic power shortages. At no point of time in the past few months, during which work had been halted in deference to fears voiced by the local population, was there any indication that the State government had ideological objections to nuclear energy. Rather, it was always a question of engaging the people and convincing them about the safety features of the Russian reactors. The political import of thrusting a decision on unready villagers can be judged from the fact that Chief Minister Jayalalithaa assured them their fears would be addressed, got the work halted for a few months to give time to experts and political representatives to engage the people and, finally, got an Assembly by-election out of the way before clearing the commissioning of the project. There was growing unease in the higher echelons of the Union government that the delay was proving costly. Russia, too, had begun voicing concern that its engineers and other personnel were twiddling their thumbs as domestic political developments were allowed to run their full course.
However, nothing in the progression of events over the past few months can justify the police crackdown on protesters near the project site almost in parallel with the Cabinet's decision, and the arrest of those engaged in peaceful agitation. If engaging the protesters was a task the government had taken on itself during this time, little would have been lost in making an effort to convey the final decision to them properly. The aim should have been to convince them about the necessity of the project and get them to withdraw their agitation. Yet, without even any pretence of dialogue or a rudimentary attempt to get the peaceful protest withdrawn, the police moved in with a massive show of might. Already, an avoidable sideshow to the months-long Kudankulam confrontation was witnessed in recent days because of the Centre's campaign of vilification against non-government organisations and groups involved in the agitation. Having decided that the Kudankulam project will go on, it is now up to the State government to ensure that fears over its safety subside and that the situation does not cascade into a full-blown confrontation between project proponents and committed antagonists who may never be convinced by the most reasonable of intermediaries but whose right to protest peacefully must not be curtailed or criminalised in any way.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-burden-of-power/article3017383.ece
21,3,2012,No budgeting for health,"The absence of significant statements of intent or noteworthy financial outlays on health in the Union budget is glaring, given that these are the two identified priorities for the Twelfth Plan starting this year. Both these sectors need inspiring governmental leadership to realise the demographic dividend from a young population. On healthcare, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee announced only an incremental increase of about Rs. 2,700 crore in the allocation for the National Rural Health Mission. He referred to the planned launch of a National Urban Health Mission and improvements to some government medical colleges for better tertiary care. This is all very welcome, but none of this measures up to the scale and scope of the reform proposals now before the Planning Commission, seeking to provide a certain level of guaranteed, tax-funded Universal Healthcare (UHC) to all Indians through public and private hospitals. It must be emphasised that this issue, along with education, deserves the same level of commitment from government as Defence. In his speech, the Finance Minister said the outlay of Rs. 1.93 lakh crore for Defence Services was based on present needs, and any further requirement would be met. The approach to healthcare during the Twelfth Plan should be no different. If State governments join the effort, as indeed they should, a suitable taxation regime by the end of the Plan can make UHC self-sustaining.
Significant government support would be required to make progress on a National Health Package offering free treatment under UHC. Several tasks have to be accomplished in parallel. These include creation of trained public health cadres, setting up of a National Health Regulatory and Development Authority to evolve norms for treatment, costs and so on, and developing an Information Technology platform to administer the massive enterprise. The challenge to achieve quality and access is staggering. The global average of hospital beds to population is 2.9 per thousand, but India has 0.9 beds. If there is a focus on preventive care, a lower ratio of 2 per thousand would be able to meet the national requirement by 2022, estimates say. But what is particularly worrying is that half of the beds now available in government facilities are listed as “non-functional”, along with 30 per cent in the private sector. It must also be pointed out that rural citizens have shockingly low levels of hospital bed access, especially in central India, compared to urban counterparts. Evidently, it will take a Herculean effort over the next five years to create a foundation for UHC. The finalised Plan and the financial outlays will reveal whether a revolution is on the anvil.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-budgeting-for-health/article3017385.ece
22,3,2012,A different poverty trap,"The Planning Commission had no choice. The results of the 2009-10 edition of the five-yearly large sample survey of consumption by the National Sample Survey Organisation are in the public domain. So it had to release the official estimates of poverty that are based on them. They point to a seven-percentage-points reduction in the national incidence of poverty between 2004-05 and 2009-10. Rather than serve as an indicator of the UPA's achievement on the human development front, however, those estimates are turning out to be an embarrassment for the government. Public attention is focused on the fact that the “poverty lines” on which these estimates are based appear ridiculously low: a per capita daily consumption expenditure of Rs. 28.35 and Rs. 22.42 in urban and rural areas respectively. The government has only recently been subject to ridicule because of an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court suggesting that a measly per capita expenditure of Rs. 32 in urban areas or Rs. 26 in rural areas in 2010-11 would serve as the benchmark to define those who would be treated as being below or above the poverty line.
This is not a mere statistical issue. That line was also initially presented as the benchmark to determine who would or would not be eligible for access to a range of state subsidies and benefits. Having come under attack for excluding much of the poor, the government had to retract. It held that eligibility for state support would be determined using a different methodology with data collected by a Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC). That exercise is nowhere near complete. The official poverty line has a sanctity derived from its role in identifying “below poverty line” beneficiaries. That ‘line' is, however, controversial. It was meant to identify those with an average daily per capita calorie intake below 2400 calories in rural areas and 2100 calories in urban areas. But the result underestimated severe deprivation and was far below the figure yielded by the direct evidence on per capita calorific intake. So the Tendulkar Committee used a set of arbitrary principles to arrive at a new poverty benchmark that would be more “inclusive”. But even that figure is now seen as absurdly low. In the event, the government is caught in a statistical trap over poverty. It would do well, therefore, to give up its effort to find a benchmark for targeting its flagship social programmes and opt for universalisation, which has much else to recommend it as a principle. The poverty estimate would then not matter much.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-different-poverty-trap/article3025574.ece
22,3,2012,How to ignore Somalia,"The London conference on Somalia held last month with participation by 55 countries and international organisations concluded with a communiqué which gives as much attention to Somalia-based piracy as it does to stability and recovery of the country. The emphasis on the former is understandable given that 62 seafarers have been killed in the last four years, that nearly 200 attacks on merchant ships have been logged in the first 10 months of 2011, and that ransoms now stand at $4 million per ship. But unless the fight against piracy is part of a comprehensive plan to help Somalia reacquire a functioning government, it will never fully succeed. The world's shipping powers collectively spend $2 billion a year on anti-piracy operations spread across an area the size of mainland Europe. Many countries have also approved the use of armed guards on board their ships. On the political side, U.N. Security Council Resolution 2036, passed on February 22, widens the mandate of the African Union Mission in Somalia and increases the size of its troop contingent. The London communiqué, for its part, notes that the current Transitional Federal Government (TFG) mandate ends in August, and proposes that a caretaker authority govern Somalia until a new constitution is endorsed by a referendum and a new executive and parliament are elected.
The communiqué, however, says nothing about standards for shipboard guards, rules of engagement, or liability for harm or damage to third parties. Secondly, it rules out impunity for pirates, but ignores the warlords who have devastated Somalia. Thirdly, a purely military response sidesteps the need to address the absence of sovereign authority. Somalia's TFG was represented in London, but so were representatives of three northern provinces; moreover, the Joint Financial Management Board created by the conference will mean de facto western economic control over Somali finances. In the war-torn south, the TFG has recaptured most of the capital, Mogadishu, from the extreme Islamist al-Shabaab grouping, but the Kenyan and Ethiopian forces which helped them will not leave soon, especially as instability on the border could cost Kenya tourism revenue. Sadly, the London communiqué makes no attempt to address the creation of physical infrastructure in Somalia, which would enable the flourishing, clan-based Somali civil society to provide a foundation for the political reconstitution the country needs. The conference, in effect, focused more on the threats piracy poses to foreign commercial interests than on Somalia itself. Which is a pity, since a lasting solution to the problems at sea can only be found on land.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/how-to-ignore-somalia/article3025577.ece
23,3,2012,A wake up call for Colombo,"The passage of the United Nations Human Rights Council resolution on Sri Lanka is proof that the international community disapproves of the manner in which the Rajapaksa government is addressing the fallout of its Armageddon moment of mid-May 2009. The resolution, backed by India, asks Sri Lanka credibly to investigate allegations of rights violations in the course of its war against the LTTE. The wording of the resolution was tweaked by India to say the implementation assistance the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights will provide must be with Sri Lanka's “concurrence”. Yet, Colombo must not misread this concession. Thursday's resolution is the first real sign that the world will no more let itself be guided solely by Sri Lankan claims that it has the will to carry out its own probe. It also means that gentle prodding and quiet diplomacy will not be the main means the world will adopt towards the island nation. Few would dispute that Sri Lanka took too long to acknowledge the allegations of extra-judicial killings and enforced disappearances and delayed moves towards a political settlement indefinitely. Ultimately, its own ‘Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission' came out with some constructive recommendations, but these have not been followed up. President Rajapaksa may not like the Geneva resolution but he has brought it upon himself.
India's vote has already aroused consternation in some sections in Colombo but it is crucial that its intentions not be misread. There is no change in the Indian defence of the unity and integrity of its southern neighbour, only a realisation that the tardy progress towards reconciliation could undermine the prospects for peace and stability there. For the first time in decades, New Delhi is in concord with popular sentiments in Tamil Nadu but it would be wrong to look at its Geneva vote as merely the product of domestic political pressure. Over time, the false assurances on devolution and implementation of “the 13th amendment and beyond” it received from Colombo have frustrated South Block and forced it to reconsider its diplomatic options. What is welcome in India's latest stand is that it has outgrown its misplaced fear of the growing regional presence of China. Having voted for the resolution, the onus is now on India to remain engaged with the Lankan authorities, as its interests lie in promoting reconciliation and supporting the quest of Tamil Sri Lankans for justice, equality and dignity. The solution has to be Lankan-led. Persistent emphasis on accountability from outside may jeopardise the larger goal of reconciliation by giving a fresh thrust to Sinhala nationalism. India needs to brace for extraordinary diplomatic challenges ahead.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-wake-up-call-for-colombo/article3155816.ece
23,3,2012,A round for regional parties,"Sometimes, the loss of one seat can hurt a lot more than the loss of 10 seats. In Andhra Pradesh, the Congress drew a blank in the latest round of byelections, losing all seven seats. But more significant than the six seats it surrendered in the Telangana region was the loss of Kovur in coastal Andhra to the YSR Congress led by Jaganmohan Reddy. For the Congress, this is a clear warning of things to come. The ruling party has been ceding ground to the breakaway faction and Jagan can no longer be dismissed as a pretender. The next round of byelections will be for 17 seats vacated by his supporters, 16 of whom were disqualified by the Speaker for voting against the confidence motion in December last. If the battle for Kovur is any indication, the Congress will have a tough time keeping the YSR Congress at bay. As for the six seats in the Telangana region where elections were held on March 18, the Congress had written them off. Except in Mahbubnagar, where the votes were polarised on communal lines, the statehood sentiment pushed all other issues to the background. Not surprisingly, the Telangana Rashtra Samiti, which supports a separate Telangana, won four of the seats.
But the byelections were not a complete disaster for the Congress. Indeed, overall, it fared better than the BJP, its principal national rival. In the Piravom Assembly constituency in Kerala, the Kerala Congress (Jacob), a constituent of the Congress-led United Democratic Front, won, allowing Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, surviving on a wafer-thin majority, to breathe easy. An even more creditworthy victory for the Congress was in Gujarat where the party beat back Narendra Modi's BJP in Mansa. Significantly, Mr. Modi had raised the stakes in the seat, personally campaigning for his party candidate. Also, the Chief Minister's high-profile sadbhavana fast last year was staged within this constituency. The victory will at least serve as a morale booster for the Congress in a State where Assembly elections are due year end. In Karnataka, similarly, the victory in the Lok Sabha byelection in Udupi-Chikmagalur was doubly sweet for the Congress as the loser was the BJP. That the seat was earlier held by Chief Minister Sadananda Gowda added to the flavour. Elsewhere, in Sankarankoil in Tamil Nadu and Athgarh in Odisha, the ruling parties won. The AIADMK and the Biju Janata Dal ensured that the current round of byelections belonged to the regional parties. Looking for one underlying theme in the results of 12 byelections in six States is meaningless, but, quite unmistakably, regional forces are gathering strength. And, the Congress's losses are unlikely to translate into the BJP's gains.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-round-for-regional-parties/article3155818.ece
24,3,2012,A risky way to save tax,"Most of the financial sector reform measures which figure in the Finance Minister's budget for 2012-2013 do not have immediate fiscal implications. However, since their primary objective is to seek more efficient market intermediation between savers and investors, they do have a place in the most important economic policy announcement, which the budget has become. The belief that such announcements contribute to a feel-good factor and blunt negative perceptions flowing from say, tax proposals, also explains why they figure prominently in all recent budget speeches. Important measures of this genre in the latest budget include (a) permitting qualified foreign investors access to bond markets; (b) simplifying the process of initial public offers (IPOs) to lower their costs and make them easily accessible to retail investors in small towns by utilising the nationwide electronic network of stock exchanges; (c) promoting shareholder democracy by harnessing technology. These reform measures are best appreciated as being part of a broad strategy of encouraging the flow of private, including foreign, capital. As much as Rs.50 lakh crore of additional investment will be required by infrastructure sectors during the Twelfth Plan period, half of this coming from the private sector. Further, the budget announcements complement ongoing legislative initiatives aimed at strengthening the financial sector.
A new equity-linked scheme meant to augment the flow of funds to the capital market has evoked mixed reactions. The Rajiv Gandhi Equity Savings Scheme seeks to encourage the flow of savings in financial instruments and improve the depth of the capital market. The scheme, which has a lock-in period of three years, would allow for income tax deduction of 50 per cent to new retail investors who invest up to Rs. 50,000 directly in equities and whose annual income is less than Rs.10 lakh. While more details on the scheme are awaited, it is clear that the primary motivation for a prospective investor would be the tax rebate it confers. For many in the salaried class — the target group for the new scheme — tax-driven investments such as in public provident funds, national savings schemes and so on are the only form of savings. It is highly questionable whether they should be lured to invest in inherently risky equity investments with attractive tax concessions. It is hoped that the definition of equity investment will be expanded to include mutual funds which, after all, have been the officially recommended investment vehicle for first time investors. Along with usual safeguards, investor education on a continuous basis will be absolutely necessary.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-risky-way-to-save-tax/article3207076.ece
24,3,2012,Einstein stands tall,"That neutrinos travel 60 nanoseconds faster than light must be an “artefact of measurement,” after all. The results announced last week by the ICARUS team means that Einstein's 1905 theory of Special Relativity that nothing travels faster than light — the cornerstone of modern physics — is still valid. The reconfirmation of light's eminent place comes in the wake of the September 23, 2011 announcement by the Oscillation Project with Emulsion-tRacking Apparatus (OPERA) team that the subatomic particles travelled faster than light. Both the teams used the same extremely short duration neutrino pulses to reconfirm the time taken for the neutrinos fired at CERN to reach the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy located 730 km away. The ICARUS team led by Nobel Laureate Carlo Rubbio analysed the speed of seven such pulses using a different technique. While OPERA continued to find the neutrinos travelling faster than light by 60 nanoseconds (with an uncertainty of 10 nanoseconds), ICARUS found that the speed of subatomic particles was just four nanoseconds faster than light, well within the “experimental margin of error.” “These [the neutrinos] arrived in a time consistent with the speed of light,” notes the CERN press release.
Researchers have been poking holes ever since OPERA first published its results. Nobel Laureate Sheldon Glashow's immediate criticism that the superluminal neutrinos did not exhibit any effect similar to Cerenkov radiation that would essentially reduce the particle's energy during its journey was strengthened by the ICARUS group's observation last November. The team did not find any evidence that the neutrinos travelling faster than light had lost energy during their 730 km journey. Though this observation had an element of implausibility, the remote possibility of some unknown mechanism playing a role could not be ruled out. But Rubbio's latest results settle the issue. Fresh measurements by both the teams are to be made when the experiment is repeated in May. But there is only a slim chance of OPERA proving to be right as it had recently disclosed two possible faults that could have led to an error in the speed calculation. While many would criticise OPERA's researchers for their haste in announcing the extraordinary results before checking for all possible errors, the way the team conducted itself was perfectly in line with the methods of science. The group had checked the accuracy of data of more than 15,000 neutrinos for about six months before going public. It never claimed to have proved that neutrinos travel faster than light. In fact, it wanted a reconfirmation of the results by others. Publishing its data was one of the best ways of achieving this end.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/einstein-stands-tall/article3207080.ece
26,3,2012,An officer and a lady,"It was in March 2010 that the Delhi High Court struck a definitive blow for the claim of women to be granted permanent commission in India's armed forces beyond the traditional medical branches. Three years down the line, as the matter remains on appeal before the Supreme Court for final orders, the armed forces seem to be still holding themselves back as one man from going ahead wholeheartedly to do the just, fair and right thing. Following the High Court order, the Navy and the Air Force agreed to grant women permanent commission posts, but the Army rushed to the Supreme Court to challenge the decision on the grounds that such a step could create operational difficulties. Even if one were to accept the argument that in the Indian context, women are not yet ready for full-combat roles — some armed forces elsewhere have gone the distance — there are surely a number of other areas in which women could contribute their potential. Defence Minister A.K. Antony has time and again gone on record that he favours the opening up of more and more streams of the armed forces to women. But that policy prescription seems to remain largely on paper and the needed momentum has not been built up. Just recently, he merely restated that Short Service Commission women officers were eligible to join the Judge Advocate General branch, the Army Education Corps and corresponding branches in the Navy, as naval instructors, and the Air Force, in the accounts branch. But he remained silent on the demand for a categorical across-the-board decision to recognise women's capabilities and their commitment to a full-fledged career, on a par with men, in the different branches of the three services.
As the Delhi High Court pointed out in 2010, grant of permanent commission without any caveats whatsoever is not “charity being sought by women officers but enforcement of their constitutional rights.” The court, rightly enough, found the situation to be discriminatory. At last count (November 2011) the Army had just 1,055 women short service commission officers, while the Air Force had 936 — and both figures were lower than in the previous year. The number for the Navy, a mere 288, was marginally higher than in the previous year. There is a case not only to step up these, but also to increase the overall percentage of women at all levels of the armed forces. Rather than having to be prodded every step of the way, the government should show the requisite level of sensitivity on the issue of granting permanent commission to women officers in more non-combat streams and end a patently iniquitous situation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-officer-and-a-lady/article3223568.ece
26,3,2012,No substitute to good policing,"Extraordinary powers can be invoked only in extraordinary circumstances. Taking a leaf from their counterparts in cities like Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai, the police in Chennai have invoked emergency powers to compel landlords to furnish the name, photograph, phone number, occupation and other details of their tenants. Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure grants any executive magistrate the power to issue orders in urgent cases of apprehended danger, though its use for something like tenant verification is highly questionable. Claiming that it was likely that “terrorist/anti-social elements may seek hideouts in the guise of tenants,” the Chennai police have sought particulars of tenants in the city. Landlords who fail to comply are threatened with six months jail. The context for this drive is the looting of two banks allegedly by a gang of persons from north India who were subsequently shot and killed in their rented apartment. Of dubious legality, the move raises disturbing questions relating to civil rights, public safety and privacy. Above all, it is a bad idea. Singling out tenants for scrutiny seems to betray an age-old bias against migrants and those without property. True, the details of property owners are available with the land registration department, but the police have, so far, not shown any intention of accessing them for integration with their centrally collated data on tenants.
The invocation of Section 144 powers may have been going on in different cities for years to compel landlords to provide information but it is high time this was challenged. If the police are allowed to read such sweeping powers into the CrPC, there is no limit to the kind of information they may seek in future. Citizens could be told to maintain a register of family and friends visiting them from other parts of India, for example. In 2001, public outcry forced the erstwhile NDA government at the Centre to scrap the Foreigners (Report To Police) Order, 1971, under which citizens were threatened with imprisonment if they didn't inform the police about the presence of foreigners in their homes. If the authorities want to gather information on landlords and tenants as a means of streamlining the rental process in cities, let them do so through a specific statute. Using emergency powers is overkill. The police should also not labour under the illusion that tenant verification will help fight crime. Terrorists and anti-social elements have the means to prepare fake identity papers. Crime prevention requires better policing methods and intelligent deployment of manpower. This is where law enforcement priorities should lie, not in turning landlords into spies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-substitute-to-good-policing/article3223570.ece
27,3,2012,More questions than answers,"That defence procurements, like other government purchases, are not exempt from corruption is hardly a secret. But Army Chief General V.K. Singh's revelation that he was directly approached with an offer of a Rs. 14 crore bribe to clear the acquisition of sub-standard vehicles is a shocker. His disclosure, made to The Hindu in an interview and the subject of an uproar in Parliament, deserves a thorough and scrupulous investigation. While a CBI probe has been ordered, the controversy raises questions that are crying to be asked — both of the defence establishment and General Singh himself. For instance, if it is true that the Army Chief had reported the attempt to bribe him to Defence Minister A.K. Antony, why wasn't a probe ordered at once? Did it require a newspaper expose and a parliamentary upheaval to initiate one? What was Mr. Antony's response when he heard the Army Chief's story? As for General Singh, why did he choose to go public with the bribery charge now and not earlier? The question is pertinent because as early as March 6, 2012, the Army put out a press release accusing a retired Lt. General of offering a bribe on behalf of a company that supplies trucks. Inexplicably, while the press release did not fight shy of naming the person who allegedly offered the bribe, it was silent on who he tried to induce. Moreover, the bribery charge was virtually an aside in the press release, which focused on the alleged bribe-giver's role in putting out false stories relating to de-bugging operations at the Defence Minister's office.
An officer of impeccable integrity, General Singh's attempts to crack down on corruption in the Army, particularly the Sukna land and Adarsh Housing Society scams, shows he has what it takes to be a tough reform-oriented leader. Which is what makes the seemingly casual handling of an alleged attempt to bribe him somewhat puzzling. If the Raksha Mantri did not take his complaint seriously, the Army Chief could have pursued the matter in a variety of ways. Whatever the reason for this reluctance, it is clear that the controversy over his age — a matter strictly between himself and the defence establishment — has caused collateral damage in other areas and spawned unrelated disputes that have the potential of causing divisions in the Army, particularly in the top echelons, and in the Ministry of Defence between uniformed men and babus. Too much dirty linen has been already washed in public. While it is important to establish the truth about General Singh's allegation, it is just as important to ensure that civil-military relations are not unduly strained.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/more-questions-than-answers/article3248177.ece
27,3,2012,Buses should move cities,"With our cities facing a severe mobility crisis, nothing could be more perverse and unintelligent than to argue against improving public transport. Strange as it may seem, Delhi, which is reeling under chronic congestion, has been doing just that. Following the recent State government's announcement to expand the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) in the city, vested-interest groups are aggressively promoting debates that question the usefulness of bus transport, and denounce the virtues of the proposal. They criticise the move to dedicate lanes in 38 important road corridors exclusively for bus services because this would reduce the space used by private vehicles. Delhi has one of the largest urban road networks in the country, but it has not benefited from this because low-capacity transport modes such as cars occupy a substantial part of the road. Though the road network cannot be expanded much more, private vehicles are rapidly growing — at the rate of 1000 vehicles a day. As a result, the roads carry traffic volumes exceeding their capacity, leading to congestion. This has reduced journey speeds and helped ruin the environment. The recent air quality data shows Delhi is now the worst polluted city in the country.
Not only Delhi, other large Indian cities must radically rethink their transportation plans. City managers need to realise that the only way to ensure urban mobility in the long run is if more and more people make trips using public transportation. Hence, in any future proposal, buses have to remain as the major mode of transport. The BRTS, in particular, would play a critical role in shifting modal behaviour because it would offer the best door-to-door connectivity, and at relatively low cost. Realising this, the expert group on urban transport constituted ahead of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan has recommended an investment of more than Rs. 50,000 crore to augment bus transport in the next five years. As the pilot BRTS project in Delhi and the success story of Ahmedabad show, plying well-designed buses and opening dedicated lanes alone will not deliver. Integrating other modes of travel, installing an efficient signal system, improving travel information and running a reliable and safe service are imperative. European cities which have proactively invested in public transport have gone a few steps further. Using intelligent transport systems, they have delivered smart electronic ticketing and payment, and managed travel demand better. Equally important is the need to improve pedestrian paths that bring people to the buses. This is where the future of Indian urban transport lies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/buses-should-move-cities/article3248186.ece
28,3,2012,Why only Africans?,"The first conviction at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the tenth year of its functioning is a good time to take stock of how well an institution that was designed to counter war crimes and crimes against humanity around the world has performed so far. The guilty verdict on the Democratic Republic of Congo rebel warlord, Thomas Lubanga, for conscripting children under 15 is a welcome sign that individuals can be brought to justice for grave violations of human rights even if “their” governments lack the will or capacity to prosecute them. The ICC has a mandate to probe atrocities and prosecute individuals up and down the official chain of command in over 100 countries where its writ runs. Despite its virtually global mandate, however, all prosecution cases in its 10-year history come from Africa: Uganda, the DRC, Sudan, the Central African Republic, Kenya, Libya and Côte d'Ivoire. The silence of the court on major crimes committed elsewhere on the territory of state-parties needs some explaining. Is it because only Africans are committing the sort of offences covered by the court? Or is it because other state-parties are more diligent and effective in effecting national prosecutions?
The fact is that the ICC's reticence to consider crimes committed elsewhere are partly legal-procedural but mostly political. The ICC has jurisdiction over crimes committed on the territory of a state that accepts its jurisdiction, by the citizens of a state which accepts its jurisdiction regardless of where the crimes are committed, or in a situation referred to it by the U.N. Security Council. The United States is not a member of the ICC but its citizens can be prosecuted if they commit grave crimes on the territory of a state-party. Like Afghanistan, for example, or the various European countries from which individuals were “rendered” and tortured. Despite the American failure to properly investigate and punish CIA officials and soldiers suspected of crimes against humanity in such situations, the ICC has never seriously considered exercising its jurisdiction. In January 2009, after having suffered heavy Israeli bombing in civilian areas in Gaza, the Palestinian National Authority lodged a declaration with the ICC under a provision of the court's statute allowing states voluntarily to accept its jurisdiction. Despite hundreds of civilian deaths and a U.N. report which spoke of Israeli war crimes, the ICC prosecutor has yet to make up his mind on the matter. And it's already been three years. Such wilful disregard of its mandate only ends up undermining the credibility of a court that is potentially one of the noblest products of international law in modern times.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/why-only-africans/article3251754.ece
28,3,2012,The hard ecumenical road,"With the announcement by Rowan Williams, the 104th Archbishop of Canterbury, that he is resigning, the world's 80 million Anglicans are losing a spiritual head who is also a rare human being. Dr. Williams, a brilliant student at Cambridge who then took a doctorate at Oxford and was appointed to the Lady Margaret's chair of divinity there in his thirties, is acting on his stated intention of standing down after a decade as Archbishop. He will be remembered both for his unassuming and accessible personality, which did much to halt the decline in church attendance, and for his intellect. He has, however, had to work very hard within the Church. As an ecumenicist, he holds that disunity would do the gravest harm to that body's mission and he told The Hindu during a visit to India in 2011 that dialogue is for him the recognition of the serious. Nevertheless, the Church has come close to schism, with traditionalists in the United Kingdom and Africa bitterly opposing Dr. Williams's advocacy of women bishops and gay clergy. Indeed the Archbishop backed down when his nomination of a gay priest to the Suffragan See of Reading caused heated controversy. His own position is in keeping with broader attitudinal changes in the global North, including the Church's North American branches; but liberal Anglicans, for their part, are disturbed by what they see as authoritarianism in the covenant Dr. Williams has drafted in response to the Roman Catholic demand for a more structured Anglican church before talks on reunification can proceed.
Those issues stand yet. Much is at stake, not least because the Church of England has strongly countered many of the evils of our time. It opposed apartheid in South Africa, and by appointing Desmond Tutu Archbishop of Cape Town, provided a figure who was crucial to the peaceful change of state and to the subsequent reconciliation process. Individual bishops have also publicly criticised the global arms trade, which now exceeds $400 billion a year. In the U.K., the church's 1985 report Faith in the City infuriated Margaret Thatcher's government by showing how widening inequalities were damaging community life. Dr. Williams himself was against the 2003 invasion of Iraq. More recently, the Bishop of Oxford has implied a continuing Anglican commitment to inclusion by suggesting that the church's schools admit more pupils from other faiths; the Church of England started universal free education in Britain. The new Archbishop, who will be one of two recommended by the Church to Prime Minister David Cameron, is likely to be more of a conservative than Dr. Williams. Whoever is chosen will have a hard act to follow.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-hard-ecumenical-road/article3251755.ece
29,3,2012,Budgeting for a new vision,"One of the biggest challenges in governance is to not lose sight of long-term goals and objectives in the urgent pursuit of short-term imperatives. Four days before the Tamil Nadu budget for 2012-13, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa unveiled Vision Tamil Nadu 2023, a document that lays the roadmap for improving social indices, infrastructure, and income levels of the people within the next 11 years. It envisages Tamil Nadu as India's most prosperous and progressive State with no poverty, where people would enjoy all the basic services of a modern society. Ms Jayalalithaa was not speaking of Tamil Nadu racing ahead of other States, but was inviting comparison with developed countries. The document was specific in outlining growth strategies and plans for boosting investment. Tamil Nadu would aim to increase its GSDP at 11 per cent or more per year for 11 years, which is about 20 per cent more than the projected growth rate of India's GDP over the same period. The State budget that followed was of a piece with the vision document: there was equal emphasis on economic growth and social security. While Rs 1,000 crore was allocated for the Tamil Nadu Infrastructure Development Fund, spending on social security remains high, as does the expenditure on the government's freebies, a dubious form of welfarism to say the least. Tamil Nadu already has in place a strong universal Public Distribution System. With a stronger social safety net, the State might well be on the way towards the stated target of poverty elimination by 2023.
While Tamil Nadu has done well in the services sector, thanks to the boom in information technology, agriculture, like in the rest of the country, lags behind. Because of investments by global automobile majors, the manufacturing sector has also contributed substantially to growth. However, with the IT and related sectors garnering all the attention of policymakers in recent years, the manufacturing sector is now in need of some handholding. As a much needed corrective, the agriculture sector has been given Rs.3,804 crore, with the focus on raising production by increasing yield and coverage, and enhancing disbursement of crop loans. There is now a greater recognition of the importance of modernisation of the sector through adoption of new techniques that would not require corporatisation or radical changes in the landholding pattern. Efforts are also on to attract more multinational firms in the manufacturing sector. But good planning and efficient budgeting are only the first steps in bringing about the necessary changes in the lives and livelihoods of the people. The toughest part, as always, is from paper and drawing board to field and finished product.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/budgeting-for-a-new-vision/article3255120.ece
29,3,2012,The art of schooling,"A good public education produces citizens who think freely, show initiative and possess a questioning mind. That progressive idea is increasingly under threat from lobbyists for market dominance. But even these campaigners would be surprised at Sri Sri Ravishankar's bizarre logic for privatisation — that students from government schools become naxalites and take to violence. Foolish though they are, such assertions prop up the falsehood that government-funded education is a ghettoised ruin, while private sector institutions uniformly make the cut. Such a proposition is particularly offensive because it strikes at the heart of the belated effort by the Indian state to make tax-funded elementary education free and accessible to all children as a right. The national goal is to rapidly expand quality education on an unprecedented scale and reach out to the remotest parts. There is a role for private schools in the overall scheme, as laid out in the approach paper of the Planning Commission on the Twelfth Plan, but it can only be to top up a sound education system run by the state. Genuine thought leadership must, therefore, dwell on questions such as improving the skills of 600,000 teachers in public schools who are officially described as untrained.
The logic that public education as a system is below par stems from the neoliberal idea that government works less efficiently compared to private entities and even non-governmental organisations. It is unsurprising that Sri Sri Ravishankar's NGO tried to explain away his controversial remarks on Twitter with the argument that it was running 185 free schools in “naxal-affected” areas, and the comments were not directed at all government institutions. Even if that were true, it is no reason to dismantle the government education system in conflict zones. If anything, weaknesses underscore the need to bolster the education infrastructure in these parts, with the active participation of local communities. Also, contrary to the pernicious logic advanced against public education, the beneficiaries of that system work harder to overcome their social disadvantages, compared with well-to-do counterparts in private institutions. As Noam Chomsky has pointed out, elite education is oriented more towards preserving the status quo, and emphasises the following of orders, control and discipline. This is antithetical to the concepts of freedom of thought, challenge and inquiry that are the core goals of education. India's public education lacks adequate human resources and infrastructure, and it evidently needs supportive policies to achieve its potential. What it does not need is a sermon on things that it is not.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-art-of-schooling/article3255114.ece
30,3,2012,Halt all hangings,"With only three days left for his execution, Balwant Singh Rajoana has got a temporary reprieve — ironically against his own steely determination to go to the gallows. Rajoana admitted his part in the suicide bombing of Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh, rejected counsel, refused to cross-examine witnesses, and accepted the death penalty, arguing that he would not ask for mercy from a government that called him a terrorist but was unconscionably insensitive towards the victims of state-sponsored communal pogroms. Rajoana's stand cannot take away from the enormity of his crime, for which he has been duly and correctly convicted by a court of law. Yet, he must live if only for the state to demolish his belief that it is a “monster” ready to turn on its own people. Abolitionists around the world argue against the death penalty mainly for two reasons: it has not been proved to be a deterrent and a flawed judicial process can wrongly, and irrevocably, send a person to his death. But over and above these reasoned considerations is the sheer barbarity of taking a human life even under the due process of law. Besides, there is no humane way of executing the death sentence. Death by hanging — the preferred method in India — is unspeakably cruel.
The pain and anxiety of the death-row prisoner going to the gallows — “cutting a life short when it is in full tide” — was brilliantly captured by George Orwell in his searing 1931 essay, ‘A Hanging'. Eighty years on, India is still to abolish capital punishment even as 96 countries around the world have done away with the practice with another 34 countries observing unofficial moratoria on executions. In India, a curious pattern has emerged lately. Courts are increasingly imposing the death penalty on convicts even as pending executions are put off to avert untoward political and social consequences. Just months ago, the Tamil Nadu Assembly made a plea for presidential clemency for the three death-row convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. Sonia Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra showed extraordinary strength of character when they pleaded for the commutation of the death sentence awarded to Nalini. Punjab under Parkash Singh Badal observed a violent bandh in response to the news that Rajoana was to be hanged — the pressure forced the Centre to stay the execution. Unfortunately, these collective pressures and the uneven response they generate have added yet another element of arbitrariness to the entire process. It has been The Hindu's consistent stand that we must do away with capital punishment. Mahatma Gandhi's India cannot afford to lag behind other countries in embracing this progressive step.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/halt-all-hangings/article3259077.ece
30,3,2012,Shifting sands in Mali,"Apart from bringing an abrupt end to two decades of elected government, the March 22 coup in Mali could exacerbate problems extending far beyond the region. The coup — in which army officers led by Captain Amadou Sanogo overthrew President Amadou Toumani Touré — was relatively free of violence, and loyalist soldiers are apparently protecting Mr. Touré, though his exact whereabouts are not known. Some heavy weapons, however, were used, and the capital Bamako suffered four days of looting, some of it by soldiers, before the junta, the National Committee for the Reinstatement of Democracy and the Restoration of the State (CNRDRE), ordered them back to barracks. The stated reason for the coup is military disaffection with the government over the Tuareg rebellion in northern Mali, where fighting has displaced over 200,000 people. The 7,000-strong army has lost important towns; the Tuaregs demand control of the Azawad region, which includes key centres like Timbuktu and Gao, but also stretches into Mauritania, Algeria, and Niger. The northern rebels have been strengthened by returnees from Libya, who have sophisticated weapons from their time as mercenaries for the former ruler, Muammar al-Qadhafi, and a faction of the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad seeks to impose sharia law; al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) has a presence in northern Mali as well.
The coup has, unsurprisingly, caused strong reactions. The public has demonstrated for a return to constitutional government, and 38 political parties, including the largest in parliament, the Alliance for Democracy-Pan African Party, have condemned it, demanding that presidential elections be held as scheduled on April 29. President Touré, incidentally, is not eligible to run again and was quite happy to move on. The African Union has suspended Mali; the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is threatening military intervention, and the United Nations Security Council has condemned the coup. Mali's main donors, the United States, Canada, the EU, and the African Development Bank, are restricting aid to humanitarian assistance. Given the decidedly mixed results that ECOWAS military interventions elsewhere in the region have produced, it is important that West African states do not precipitate an armed showdown with the putschists. The goal has to be early presidential elections, a return to constitutional order and a peaceful resolution of the Tuaregissue. Mali is one of the world's poorest countries and can ill afford conflict. More than anything, its people deserve their democracy back.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/shifting-sands-in-mali/article3259081.ece
31,3,2012,BRICS starts building,"The forceful and positive statement of intent with which Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa concluded their fourth annual summit on Thursday is entirely appropriate for five countries which between them account for 43 per cent of the world's population and 18 per cent of global trade, and attract 53 per cent of global financial capital. While the BRICS five have repeated their criticism of the slow pace of reform in the International Monetary Fund and called for modified international financial institutions which better reflect today's global pattern of economic power, their key Delhi move has been the plan for a new development bank modelled on the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank; major steps towards this are the respective agreements on credit facilities in BRICS currencies and on letters of credit. These are intended both to finance development and to reduce the vulnerability of member states to the vagaries of the currently under-regulated international financial system. The declaration explicitly notes the risks volatile food and energy prices pose for the world economy, as well as the problems of equally volatile capital flows caused by the “aggressive” actions taken by advanced countries' central banks in response to the world economic crisis. While the BRICS bank idea will likely take years to fructify, the key lies in deepening the channels of economic and financial flows within the five.
In political terms, the Delhi Declaration is a clear signal that the states concerned have global weight and mean eventually to use it. If the BRICS consensus on Syria evaporated during the initial Western push to pressure Damascus via the United Nations Security Council, the five countries now appear to be back on the same page. Russian determination to prevent enforced regime change of the sort that was brutally inflicted on Libya in 2011 has made the UNSC call for an all-party dialogue in Syria and the BRICS endorsement is a further shot in the arm for diplomacy. On Iran too, the five have emphasised the need for patient dialogue and warned the West not to pursue a path of confrontation. Of course BRICS' new energy is not boundless. Its members see and recognise the limitations of Western power but are, as yet, unwilling to push for new ideas and bold solutions to festering problems like, for example, the Israeli occupation of Palestine, or to insist on something so basic as merit being the sole criterion for choosing the next President of the World Bank. No doubt, the Delhi Declaration marks a definite new milestone for BRICS. But the grouping has some way to go before it becomes a real factor in international affairs.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/brics-starts-building/article3263418.ece
31,3,2012,Perils of short-termism,"The Union budget's unrelenting focus on infrastructure development is both understandable and justified. The infrastructure deficit has been widening year after year and is one of the principal reasons holding back economic growth. Finding money for infrastructure projects, which have long gestation periods, has been an especially challenging task. The requirements are huge. Besides public investment, the government is betting heavily on public-private partnerships. Commercial banks are generally loath to provide the long-term finance that infrastructure projects require. Dependent as they are on short period deposits and inter-bank borrowings to meet their liabilities, they run the balance sheet risk of an asset-liability mismatch in funding infrastructure projects. The Finance Minister has proposed strengthening financial institutions dedicated to infrastructure. The pool of tax free infrastructure bonds for domestic investors is being expanded. Other specific measures aim at widening the capital market to encourage overseas provident and pension funds and insurance companies — the largest providers of money for infrastructure — to invest in India.
Obviously such initiatives will need to be pursued to enhance the supply and improve the quality of infrastructure finance. Less useful and inherently more controversial have been the relaxations in the rules pertaining to external commercial borrowings (ECBs). Companies can now use the ECB route to retire rupee loans and fund working capital. A number of restrictions on the end-use of funds have been removed. In a significant fiscal concession, the budget has proposed to reduce withholding tax on ECBs from 20 to 5 per cent for three years. The new policy is not the panacea that it is claimed to be. On the contrary, it is a reversal of past policies that sought to restrain such borrowings. Typically of a short duration, such borrowings carry a huge exchange rate risk, which is magnified by the recent volatility in the foreign exchange markets. Many domestic borrowers, who have either been unwilling or unable to hedge their risks, have come to grief in the recent past. A spurt in ECBs will inevitably pose strains on the external sector. A steep increase in short-term external debt is something that needs to be avoided. India's reserves, though still at comfortable levels, have been coming down. The trade deficit and current account deficits have been widening and are unlikely to contract any time soon, with high oil prices being just one factor. The clear message is that short-termism does not pay, not even in the limited context of infrastructure finance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/perils-of-shorttermism/article3263420.ece
