1,1,2015,CBI’s credibility impugned,"The discharge by a Mumbai special court of Bharatiya Janata Party president and former Gujarat Minister >Amit Shah in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case is a boost for the BJP and a setback to the Central Bureau of Investigation, which seems unable to live down its reputation as an agency that is ever eager to please its political bosses. With the judge of the Special CBI Court, M.B. Gosavi, ruling that there was substance in the defence argument that the case was foisted on Mr. Shah for political reasons, the CBI will have a tough time recovering its credibility as the country’s premier criminal investigation agency. That the judge decided to discharge Mr. Shah from the case, and saw no need for him to go on trial, says a lot about the nature of the evidence put together by the CBI. Not only was the agency’s mode of investigation faulted, but political motives were attributed to its actions. However, if the CBI framed Mr. Shah in the case for political reasons to please the previous Congress-led government at the Centre, then could it have made out a “weak case” against Mr. Shah to please the present BJP-led government? After all, Mr. Shah is seen as the second most powerful person in the country, and as a close friend of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This indeed is the question raised by Rubabuddin Sheikh, brother of Sohrabuddin. Given the track record of the CBI in recent times, this is not a question to be dismissed casually. If political pressures did indeed force the CBI to frame Mr. Shah, then, quite plausibly, similar pressures could now have been at work to facilitate his discharge in the case.

The observations of Mr. Gosavi further underscore the importance of freeing the CBI from the influence of those in power. Although the CBI Director now enjoys a fixed tenure, and the appointment is on the basis of the recommendations of a high-level committee, the investigating agency is still subject to the pulls and pressures of the government at the Centre. At the end of a civil rights movement against corruption in high places, the Lokpal Act, 2013 was introduced with provisions to insulate the CBI from political interference. But in high-profile, politically sensitive cases such as the one involving Mr. Shah, the investigation can still be tailored to suit the requirements of the rich and the powerful if the higher courts do not take to strict and constant monitoring. Sohrabuddin’s relatives have decided to appeal against Mr. Shah’s discharge, and some of the evidence will again come under scrutiny. At this stage, if anything at all is certain, it is that the CBI’s handling of this case against Mr. Shah does not inspire confidence in the public mind.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-discharge-of-case-on-amit-shah-in-the-sohrabuddin-sheikh-fake-encounter-case/article6742587.ece
1,1,2015,Departing with a mixed legacy,"The timing of >Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s retirement from Test cricket is consistent with his earlier choices as a cricketer and a team leader. Despite his cult following and camera-friendly smile, Dhoni was always a private sort of person who kept major decisions under wraps until the last minute. In the event, the fact that he chose to call it a day in Tests when everybody is asking why rather than why not, is not at all surprising. But he might have better served the cause of Indian cricket had he completed the series — the fourth Test against Australia begins on January 6 in Sydney — before handing over the reins to Virat Kohli. Perhaps he wanted to leave quietly, without fanfare. Through much of India’s successful run, whether in Tests or limited overs cricket, the man who emerged from Indian cricket’s backwaters in Jharkhand has had no qualms about letting others take centre stage. This was never more obvious than when he allowed Sachin Tendulkar to hog the limelight after winning the World Cup at home in 2011. Dhoni, for the most part, has preferred to remain in the background. This is in stark contrast to his style of play on the field — something that is at once flamboyant and awe-inspiring when he is at his best. Some of the big shots with which he brings the spectators to their feet — including his patented ‘helicopter’ shot — are more readily associated with an extroverted personality.

Read: >All you need to know about Dhoni
For all his success in the longer form of the game, especially at home, Dhoni’s image was overwhelmingly shaped through his exploits in limited overs cricket. Yet, his 90 Tests, 4,876 runs, 256 catches and 38 stumpings prove that he could shine in the longer version too. His 224 against Australia at Chennai in 2013 altered the series. Earlier this year, when the rest of the batting, barring Murali Vijay, struggled in England, Dhoni scored 349 runs with four 50s. The numbers state that he was India’s most successful captain, but that record of 27 wins and 18 losses from 60 Tests hides a disturbing statistic — his men lost 15 away games, most of them in the last three years. His failure to rouse an outfit suffering the pangs of transition, his refusal to speak when the squad he led in the Indian Premier League, Chennai Super Kings, was mired in controversy, or even his questionable sense of humour — as evident in him talking about Virat Kohli stabbing Shikhar Dhawan — are all blips that are part of a complicated personality. India will miss him in Tests, but thankfully he is still available in an arena in which he excels — the pulse-pounding abridged contest under lights. His ultimate test will come in a few weeks’ time when India begins its defence of the World Cup in challenging conditions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-mahendra-singh-dhonis-test-retirement/article6742588.ece
2,1,2015,Hasty changes in land law,"When a law is enacted after considerable debate and consultation, it will be wise to study the experience of its implementation for some time before it is amended, in order to address perceived difficulties. Any such amendment within the first year of its entry into force, especially one pushed through as an ordinance, will be inevitably perceived as hasty, even if on the positive side it is meant to eliminate delays in land acquisition. In this backdrop, the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Amendment) Ordinance, 2014, is bound to face criticism that the changes constitute a significant dilution of a progressive law. >The Congress and the Left parties are likely to oppose the changes when the law comes to Parliament in the form of a bill to replace the ordinance. In substance, the ordinance makes a significant change by omitting in respect of a wide range of projects the requirements of a social impact assessment study, the informed consent of a large section of the families affected by the acquisition of land. These projects include those that are vital to national security and defence, rural infrastructure, affordable housing and housing for the poor, besides industrial corridors and infrastructure and social infrastructure projects. The vital element of making acquisition a consultative and participative process may thus be subject to bureaucratic discretion.
The principle of ‘eminent domain’, which justifies the compulsory acquisition of land by the state for a public purpose, normally ought to be accompanied by a duty to give fair compensation. However, the colonial Land Acquisition Act of 1894 had in effect reduced compensation to a mere token in relation to the market value, and for decades it was used to deprive many, mostly farmers, of their land for a pittance. Last year’s law radically altered this relationship between citizen and state and created a fair compensation right, as well as a new structure for rehabilitation and resettlement. It also cast a duty on the government to create specified amenities in every resettlement area. Thankfully, the ordinance does not dilute these provisions, but additionally extends them to a list of Acts that were previously exempted. However, this is not its own contribution, as the original Act itself said such a provision shall be enacted within a year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has projected the amendments as those that strengthen protection for the affected families and also removes difficulties in implementation. Perhaps the regime’s intentions could have been better understood had the changes been introduced as a bill in Parliament and referred to a committee for appraisal.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-land-acquisition-act/article6745655.ece
2,1,2015,Uncertain outcome in Greece,"Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, who recently lost his gamble of holding an >early presidential vote in order to shore up the terms of a fresh economic package from the European Union, forced a snap general election within two years of coming to power. The January 25 poll has brought centre-stage the main opposition party, the radical left-wing Syriza that takes an anti-austerity stance. Equally, the uncertainty over the Greek election outcome brought into sharp focus the capacity of European Union leaders to influence national governments to implement unpopular economic reforms. The developments in December, involving three rounds of voting by the Greek Parliament which eventually failed to elect a President, are reminiscent of the high political drama of 2011. On that occasion, George Papandreou had announced that the issue of approval of the Eurozone debt deal for Greece would be decided in a popular referendum, sending shock waves across European capitals and causing a splutter in the financial markets. Amid the groundswell of public anger against crippling cuts in government spending and reductions in wages and pensions, a plebiscite would have potentially risked a Greek exit from the Eurozone.
Syriza’s support has seen a steady surge over the past decade, culminating in its emergence as the second largest party in the outgoing Parliament. Under the charismatic leadership of Alexis Tsipras, it won the May 2014 European Parliament elections handsomely, relegating the country’s ruling New Democracy to the second position. Since then, Syriza has led in the opinion polls. The party rapidly rose to prominence since the debt crisis in Greece unravelled, by portraying the terms of the bailout with European and international institutions as a harsh and arbitrary imposition. In more recent months, it has spoken of softening the terms of the bailout and of having the country’s debt written off by half. Syriza’s sharp rhetoric in recent weeks seems to have been muted, perhaps from a recognition of Athens’s European obligations under the existing arrangements. The party may or may not capture power in the elections. But even if it comes anywhere close, it can be expected to exert considerable influence on the manner Athens negotiates with Brussels the terms of its economic reforms. Syriza’s performance would also be watched closely in countries where the appeal of anti-austerity, and even anti-EU parties, has been on the rise and where elections are due this year. Gradually, a scenario may be evolving where domestic forces exert greater influence on the trajectories of European integration. This may lay bare the limits of the post-War vision in a globalised world.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-greece-general-elections/article6745654.ece
3,1,2015,Birth of a new institution,"In line with the Government of India’s approach of less government and a move away from centralised planning, the NITI Aayog with a new structure and focus on policy will >replace the 64-year old Planning Commission that was seen as a vestige of the socialist era. The new body, conceived more in the nature of a think-tank that will provide strategic and technical advice, will be helmed by the Prime Minister with a Governing Council of Chief Ministers and Lt. Governors, similar to the National Development Council that set the objectives for the Planning Commission. The NITI Aayog seeks substitute centralised planning with a ‘bottom-up’ approach where the body will support formulation of plans at the village level and aggregate them at higher levels of government. In short, the new body is envisaged to follow the norm of cooperative federalism, giving room to States to tailor schemes to suit their unique needs rather than be dictated to by the Centre. This is meant to be a recognition of the country’s diversity. The needs of a State such as Kerala with its highly developed social indicators may not be the same as that of, say, Jharkhand, which scores relatively low on this count. If indeed the body does function as has been envisaged now — and the jury will be out on that — States will, for the first time, have a say in setting their own development priorities.
Also Read: >An ode to the Planning Commission
One significant change of note is that one of the functions of the body will be to address the needs of national security in economic strategy. Nowhere is this more relevant than in the area of energy security where India, unlike China, has failed to evolve a coherent policy over the years. Similarly, networking with other national and international think-tanks and with experts and practitioners, as has been envisaged, will add heft to the advice that the NITI Aayog will provide. To deflect criticism that this will be a free-market institution that ignores the deprived, the government has taken care to make the point that the body will pay special attention to the sections of society that may not benefit enough from economic progress. How this operates in practice will bear close watching. Interestingly, though it will not be formulating Central plans any more, the NITI Aayog will be vested with the responsibility of monitoring and evaluating the implementation of programmes. Thus, while the advisory and monitoring functions of the erstwhile Planning Commission have been retained in the new body, the executive function of framing Plans and allocating funds for Plan-assisted schemes has been taken away. But who will now be responsible for the critical function of allocating Plan funds? Hopefully, there will be greater clarity on this aspect in the days ahead.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-niti-aayog-formation/article6749228.ece
3,1,2015,A step in the right direction,"Yet another bold initiative was taken on the last day of 2014 when the Union government made public the draft National Health Policy 2015. The policy is a first step in achieving universal health coverage by advocating >health as a fundamental right, whose “denial will be justiciable”. While it makes a strong case for moving towards universal access to affordable health-care services, there are innumerable challenges to be overcome before the objectives become a reality. The current government spending on health care is a dismal 1.04 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), one of the lowest in the world; this translates to Rs.957 per capita in absolute terms. The draft policy has addressed this critical issue by championing an increase in government spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP (Rs.3,800 per capita) in the next five years. But even this increase in allocation falls short of the requirement to set right the dysfunctional health-care services in the country. Citing the health-care system’s low absorption capacity and inefficient utilisation of funding as an alibi for not raising the spending to 3 per cent of GDP is nothing but a specious argument. Insufficient funding over the years combined with other faulty practices have led to a dysfunctional health-care system in the country. Undivided focus is an imperative to strengthen all the elements of health-care delivery. The failure of the public health-care system to provide affordable services has been the main reason that has led to increased out-of-pocket expenditure on health care. As a result, nearly 63 million people are driven into poverty every year. The Ebola crisis in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, which underlined the repercussions of a weak public health-care system, should serve as a grim reminder of this.
>Draft on National Health Policy 2015
The national programmes provide universal coverage only with respect to certain interventions such as maternal ailments, that account for less than 10 per cent of all mortalities. Over 75 per cent of the communicable diseases are outside their purview and only a limited number of non-communicable diseases are covered. It is, therefore, crucial for the Union government to undertake proactive measures to upgrade the health-care services of poorly performing States such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. As it stands, health will be recognised as a fundamental right through a National Health Rights Act only when three or more States “request” it. Since health is a State subject, adoption by the respective States will be voluntary. Though a different approach has been taken to improve adoption and implementation by States, the very objective of universal health coverage that hinges on portability will be defeated in the absence of uniform adoption across India.

5,1,2015,A case to share more information,"The dramatic photograph of a fishing boat ablaze on water and the assertions by the Indian Ministry of Defence (MoD) that it was an “explosives-laden” vessel from Pakistan that blew itself up on being intercepted, has provided some comfort that a force guarding the country’s coastline was able to avert a 26/11-type horror on New Year’s-eve with a timely chase across the Arabian Sea. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar has commended the Coast Guard for a job well done. Pakistan has denied the boat had anything to do with it. Particularly as vital questions of foreign relations are involved, the MoD would do well to shed more light on what happened off the Gujarat coast that night. So far, the version provided has left several questions unanswered. Given the Coast Guard’s suspicion that this was a boat carrying terrorists from Karachi, why was the Navy not involved in the incident, at least in a supporting role? If there were intercepts of communication between the boat and handlers in Pakistan, surely the Coast Guard needed to mobilise more help. It should have at least called out more of its own vessels. The blaze is said to have started when the crew went below deck and set the boat on fire after the Coast Guard caught up with it. There was also an explosion, according to a statement put out by the MoD. An expert examination of the photograph provided would confirm whether there was a blast. A statement that the four-member crew aroused suspicion because they were not dressed like fishermen is also worrying, indicating as it does the Coast Guard’s belief that clothes are a good indication of a person’s occupation and intentions.
On top of it all is the opaqueness on locations, 365 km west-southwest off Porbandar providing only a general direction and an assurance that it was within the Coast Guard’s 200 nautical mile jurisdiction. A full-fledged investigation into the incident would not be out of place. With India-Pakistan relations not yet out of the shadow of the 26/11 attack, an allegation that a boat loaded with explosives that set off from near Karachi tried to get close to the Indian coast is a serious matter. Those who make the allegation must be able to provide better grounds for their suspicion than the single input that a boat was set to make an “illicit transaction”. After all, smugglers abound in those waters. In the last six years, New Delhi has built up much international support in the diplomatic battle against India-directed terrorism emanating from Pakistan. A wrong call can erode that support, just as the right one can strengthen its hands. This is why it is very important to provide adequate information to support the account of the incident.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-a-case-to-share-more-information/article6754049.ece
5,1,2015,Arbitrary use of power,"The Union government recently blocked 32 websites, including globally popular ones such as Vimeo, GitHub, Dailymotion and archive.org that support data-archiving, video-sharing and software development, evoking serious questions and criticism. The action was sought to be justified on the grounds that these websites were being used for “Jihadi Propaganda” by “Anti-National groups” encouraging Indian youth to join organisations such as Islamic State (IS). Such a justification may in principle seem reasonable, yet it does not instil confidence in citizens given the weak track record of Internet regulation and a deficient legal framework coupled with the arbitrary use of state power. Following the arrest of Bengaluru-based Mehdi Biswas, suspected of operating a pro-IS Twitter account, the government officially banned IS in India only last month. A 2012 United Nations report titled “The Use of the Internet for Terrorist Purposes”, warns of terror groups using the Internet for their “propaganda”. For instance, al-Qaeda uses the Internet to announce its latest attacks and strategic alliances, promote its interests and so on. Robert Hannigan, from the Government Communications Headquarters in the U.K., spoke in an interview about how IS uses popular hashtags to boost its viewership, sending “thousands of tweets a day without triggering spam controls”. Undoubtedly, terrorists use technology with some level of sophistication.
The scepticism is with regard to implementation rather than the principle behind the action. First, the government invoked Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and relevant “Blocking Rules” were framed under it to take down the sites. These provisions, the constitutionality of which is under challenge in the Supreme Court, are riddled with vagueness and are open to arbitrary use. Second, reasonable restriction on free speech under Article 19(2) of the Constitution is to be interpreted to include only cases where there is a direct relation between the offending speech and public disorder or national security. But in blocking URLs, the government speaks of not just content that poses a direct threat to public order and security, but also the spread of “propaganda” — which is a perilously vague term with the potential to impinge on fundamental rights. Third, blocking websites is rarely an effective method to curb terror activities. Competent users can circumvent with ease such restrictions through Proxies and Virtual Private Networks. Instead of blocking websites outright, a more coordinated public-private dialogue should be the way ahead. Giving national security precedence over all else, including fundamental rights, is an often-exploited narrative that needs to be closely scrutinised, without reducing this scrutiny to a “with us-or-against us” logic.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-arbitrary-use-of-power/article6754050.ece
6,1,2015,Mythology and science,"The 102nd Indian Science Congress being held in Mumbai will be remembered for a very long time to come, but for all the wrong reasons. For the first time, the science congress had a session on “Ancient Sciences through Sanskrit”. If the Indian Science Congress had long lost its eminence as a forum where results of serious science being done in the country are presented and discussed in most sessions, the inclusion of Ancient Sciences through Sanskrit has only lowered its standing further. Even as a public session, there is no real reason whatsoever for it to have been included in the proceedings. At best, a session could have been devoted to the history of Indian science which has real and substantial achievements to celebrate, with serious scholars working on the subject presenting papers. With Prime Minister Narendra Modi setting the tone for this antiquity frenzy with his implausible claims that cosmetic surgery was practised thousands of years ago and in-vitro fertilisation-like procedure was resorted to long back, and different political leaders following it up with several other incredulous claims well before the start of the national event, the reason for the inclusion of the session becomes supremely clear. Instead of fostering scientific temper, the congress has provided a forum to seed the minds of young people with pseudoscience. Some of the papers presented were about Indians’ “knowledge of making aeroplanes” that could undertake interplanetary travel, between 7000 and 6000 BC, and “radars” that worked on the principle of detecting energy given out by animate and inanimate objects and finding out if a body was dead or alive.
Science is grounded on the principle of reproducibility of results. The claims of advanced science and technology in the ancient world are based on some references in ancient scripts that may be wholly imaginary. Flying, for instance, has caught humankind’s imagination across cultures right from ancient times. Such references should be taken for the myths they are, not as scientific facts. Scientists have been able to create animal chimeras that have cells/organs of different species, much as what Greek mythology describes. Should the Greeks then be taken as pioneers in the science of chimera production? Thanks to our understanding of genetics and the ability to fertilise eggs outside the body, producing designer babies is no longer in the realm of science fiction. Should the creators of the science fiction then be credited with devising the procedures? Compare this with how Sir Arthur C. Clarke documented his idea of communications satellites in a concept paper published in 1945. Dozens of geosynchronous satellites launched each year do precisely what Sir Arthur had visualised there.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-mythology-and-science/article6757521.ece
6,1,2015,Moderation warranted,"The recent narrow defeat of a resolution in the United Nations Security Council on Palestinian statehood should be read in the context of resistance from the United States and Israel to the territory’s bid for UN membership. In 2012, Washington and Tel Aviv opposed a landmark UN General Assembly vote by 138 countries to upgrade Palestine’s status from Observer to Non-Member Observer State in the world body. Introduced by Jordan, the resolution last week called for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the West Bank by 2017 and the creation of a capital in East Jerusalem — territories captured by Israel besides Gaza Strip in the so-called Six-Day War in 1967. Against the backdrop of the failure of peace talks, the Palestinian Authority (PA) under President Mahmoud Abbas has pinned its hopes for any meaningful progress on taking recourse to international legal instruments. Accordingly, Mr. Abbas has moved swiftly to accede to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) once the UNSC resolution was defeated in December. Earlier in the month, Palestine was invited as an observer at the annual meeting of states that have joined the ICC.
The Palestinians expect the step would eventually lead to the trial of certain Israeli leaders for war crimes in The Hague court. But a determination has yet to be made on whether its jurisdiction would commence from 2012, when the status of Palestine was revised at the UN, or after its accession to the Rome treaty is completed. It is also uncertain whether the nature of the violence during the conflict would qualify for prosecution by the ICC. What is clear, however, is that the activities of both the PA and the Islamic militant group Hamas would also come under scrutiny should the court deem it fit to investigate Israel. But paradoxically, the U.S. and Israel continue to regard any attempt by the PA to gain international recognition as confrontational, insisting that direct negotiations are the only possible avenue to find a lasting solution. Both have threatened retaliation in the form of severe economic sanctions against Palestine and travel restrictions on their leaders. Such a stance is unhelpful considering the PA is the main moderate voice wedded to a two-state solution, unlike Hamas that refuses to recognise the state of Israel. But international opinion in support of Palestinian self-determination is growing, as is evident from the overwhelming backing accorded to the European Parliament resolution. The Palestinian bid to join the ICC is expected to strengthen Israel’s hardliners in the elections in March. The larger interests of peace in the Middle East warrant moderation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-moderation-warranted/article6757522.ece
7,1,2015,The accidental Chief Minister,"Jitan Ram Manjhi became the Chief Minister of Bihar in unusual circumstances. As he himself never tires of saying, he owed his position not to the support of his followers but to the backing of his leader, his predecessor and Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar. A member of the backward Dalit community of Mahadalit, Mr. Manjhi is now busy building his political constituency, even if it be at the expense of Mr. Kumar’s own vote base. The Bihar Chief Minister won new followers in his community with his assertive speeches, even if, in the process, he lost some of the goodwill of his leader. From the very outset he seemed to know what he did not want to be: a political tool in the hands of Mr. Kumar, who stepped down as Chief Minister only to lessen the degree of criticism of his political decisions that led to the drubbing that the JD (U) received in the Lok Sabha election. With his latest statement, during an interview to The Hindu, that a Mahadalit should be the Chief Minister of Bihar after the Assembly election later this year, Mr. Manjhi not only succeeded in irritating Mr. Kumar further but also ensured that Mr. Kumar could remove him as Chief Minister only at great political cost. In October last year, Mr. Manjhi had stated that he did not become the Chief Minister on his own but was made the Chief Minister, and that Dalits would be able to choose their own leader if they had greater political awareness.
If Mr. Kumar thought that in Mr. Manjhi he would have a loyalist who would keep the Chief Minister’s chair warm for him till the Assembly election, he was clearly mistaken. Even when he stepped down as Chief Minister, the JD (U) had indicated that Mr. Kumar would indeed lead the party in the next Assembly election. The Manjhi government was meant to be nothing more than a stopgap arrangement. But the Mahadalit leader, who began his political career with the Congress and switched his allegiance to the Rashtriya Janata Dal during the period that party was in power, seems ever-ready to outmanoeuvre his own party leadership. While he does not have much to show in terms of governance during his seven months in power, Mr. Manjhi demonstrated political tact and cunning in carving out an independent political space in the caste-dominated politics of Bihar. The JD (U) is now in the process of merging with the Samajwadi Party, the RJD, the Janata Dal (Secular) and others in a coming together of the Janata Parivar, and there is no guarantee that Mr. Kumar will be the automatic choice as Chief Minister if the combination comes to power. But whatever the changes in the political equations, Mr. Manjhi will be a factor in everyone’s political calculations. And that is no small achievement for this accidental Chief Minister.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-the-accidental-chief-minister/article6760855.ece
7,1,2015,Unending confrontation,"An ill wind is blowing through Bangladesh once again. A year after the controversial election that returned the Awami League and Sheikh Hasina to office for a second term, the political turmoil and uncertainty refuse to go away. While the Opposition still refuses to accept the results of an election that it boycotted, the government has certainly not helped matters. When Opposition leader Khaleda Zia announced a rally to observe the first anniversary of the election on January 5 as “Death of Democracy Day”, the Sheikh Hasina government, which was planning a “Victory Day of Democracy” responded by disallowing the protest and locking up the Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader in her office. Clashes between activists of the ruling party and the BNP have claimed four lives. The government has now threatened to slap a murder case on Ms. Zia, which could lead to her arrest. She, meanwhile, has called for an indefinite and nationwide ‘blockade’. The BNP wants fresh elections to be held under a non-partisan caretaker government, while the Awami League insists it will continue in office for its entire term that is to end in 2019. There seems to be no meeting ground between the two parties, unable as they are to turn the page on their history of confrontational and violent politics.
At the heart of the confrontation between the two parties are of course the unsettled questions from Bangladesh’s violent birth in 1971, including the question of who was on which side in the movement for liberation from Pakistan. Settling those questions was never going to be easy. But the ham-fisted manner in which the Awami League has gone about the task from its first term in office in 2008, setting up war tribunals that have dispensed speedy verdicts including the death sentence to several in the senior leadership of the Jamaat-e-Islami and life terms to others including BNP leaders, has proved particularly divisive. Despite the nation-halting “hartals” and protests, Bangladesh’s economy turned in a surprisingly good performance. The country’s GDP growth was estimated at 6.1 per cent for the fiscal year ending with June 2014, half a percentage point higher than what the Asian Development Bank had projected. For 2015, the projection is higher at 6.4 per cent, on the hope that private sector investment will also pick up given some political stability. Perhaps Bangladesh might have done better and set an example for the entire region but for the unending political conflict. For India, which has seen ties improving with Bangladesh under the Sheikh Hasina government, the challenge is to ensure that the instability in Dhaka does not spill over to its territory and pose security problems on its eastern borders.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-unending-confrontation/article6760856.ece
8,1,2015,Spectrum auction realities,"The fine print of the spectrum auction coming up in February, shows that little has been learnt from experience with similar auctions in the past. The 3G auction held in 2010, for example, fetched a windfall for the government but dealt a blow to the telecom industry from which it has yet to fully recover. On that occasion, a limited quantity of spectrum put on auction, a high upset price and keen competition among bidders combined to push up the value beyond levels that made business sense for the telecom companies, that had no choice but to participate. The consequences of that frenzied round of bidding are still being felt in the form of large loan dues of banks that funded the bidding, frayed balance sheets of telecom operators and poor services for consumers as operators cut down investment on network expansion. The story for the upcoming round is the same as the government attempts to exploit scarcity value to maximise its own revenues. Not only is the price set for the three bands — 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1,800 MHz — considerably higher than what was recommended by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) but the quantum of spectrum on offer is also limited, especially in the crucial 900 MHz band.
At least three operators — Vodafone, Idea and Bharti Airtel — will be bidding to stay in business as their licences in some circles expire this year. Their desperation is bound to push up the bidding price, especially if others such as Uninor and Reliance Jio step into the fray. The government has also offered just one slot of 5 MHz in the 2,100 MHz band which is critical for 3G operations and has said that it will release a further 15 MHz later. The strategy is obviously to capitalise on the scarcity value now. While optimising revenues for a public asset such as spectrum is not wrong, the attempt here seems to be to maximise them — which can come only at the cost of the industry and consumers, as experience shows. There is time still to change things as the Cabinet will be meeting soon to clear the pricing of the 2,100 MHz band. The government should strive to put on auction the entire 20 MHz that it has in the 2,100 MHz band and also fix the upset price at realistic levels. Quite apart from this, serious thought should be given also to the TRAI recommendation to reduce the licence fee from 8 per cent of adjusted gross revenues to 6 per cent as the present fee was set before the auctions era. The government’s keenness to maximise revenues and to prevent windfall gains to telecom operators is understandable, but it should be balanced with the interests of the long-term development of the industry and of the consumers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-spectrum-auction-realities/article6764554.ece
8,1,2015,Watershed in judicial history,"The Supreme Court of India and the High Courts, described as the most powerful judiciary in the world, are witnessing dramatic changes in their institutional structure. Pending notification, the legislature has passed the Constitution (121st Amendment) Bill, 2014 and The National Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, 2014 to regulate the procedure for recommending the appointment and transfer of the Chief Justices and Judges of these higher courts, marking a watershed in judicial history. The new law provides for the setting up of the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), a six-member panel headed by the Chief Justice of India, and includes two senior-most Supreme Court judges, the Union Minister of Law and Justice and two ‘eminent persons’ nominated by a committee comprising the Prime Minister, the CJI and the Leader of the Opposition. Although controversial, this represents a much-needed reform of the older collegium system. That system was a judge-devised practice of appointments that evolved out of the ‘three-judges cases’ (1982, 1993 and 1998) wherein the Chief Justice along with a panel of senior-most judges would make a binding recommendation to the President on the appointees. This model was a reaction to blatant favouritism by the executive that marked appointments until the Supreme Court decided to change the procedure. To avoid charges of favouritism, the collegiums relied on seniority, which only encouraged more mediocrity.
Although such an inter-institutional model has the potential to enhance merit and diversity in the judiciary, it is the fine print of law that raises questions. With three of the six members being judges, a decision of the Commission can be vetoed by any two members. The judicial members of the NJAC lack the preponderance in voice necessary to maintain independence. The fear is that the NJAC may encourage High Court judges to give pro-government rulings with the object of gaining eventual promotion to the Supreme Court. This problem was dealt with by the Venkatachaliah Committee, endorsed by the Vajpayee government, which suggested a panel of three judges, the Union Minister and only one ‘eminent person’, thus reducing the scope for executive interference. Having a relook at this report might have been of value. But the BJP has ignored it and instead demanded more say in the NJAC; the Opposition did not seem to have any complaints about the procedure either. With several influential lawyers criticising the law for being a political assault on judicial independence, the constitutionality of the law is about to be challenged in court. Whether this would eventually lead to a conflict between the two wings of the government, is something to be seen.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-watershed-in-judicial-history/article6764553.ece
9,1,2015,The attack on Charlie Hebdo,"The horrific terrorist attack in Paris at the office of the French magazine Charlie Hebdo is a direct assault on the freedom of speech, thought and expression, the fundamentals on which all open, democratic societies are built. Ten staff members at the satirical weekly, including four of its top cartoonists, were gunned down by masked men who entered the building and targeted the editorial meeting in what seemed to be a well-planned and professional operation. They left shouting Allahu-Akbar, killing two policemen on the street outside before driving off in a getaway car. Since 2006, when it first published the Danish cartoons of Prophet Mohammed, Charlie Hebdo had been under threat of violent attacks by Islamist groups. Refusing to be intimidated, the publication continued to caricature Islam even after a firebombing in November 2011, just as it also relentlessly lampooned Christianity and Judaism — its Christmas week cover caricaturing the birth of Jesus was designed to provoke and cause offence. Self-censorship in order not to hurt religious sensibilities is now the norm in most parts of the world, so too in India, where media and expressions of popular culture including cinema, art and writing have to walk the tightrope daily in deference to what Salman Rushdie in an interview to this newspaper described as the non-existent “right to not be offended”: the fracas caused by Hindutva groups against the film PK is the most recent example of this. In truly democratic societies, this should not be the case, and that is what Charlie Hebdo believed and practised. Irrespective of what anyone thinks of its editorial policy, all who believe in freedom of expression and the democratic way of life must express solidarity with the magazine, and condemn this unspeakable act of violence against them.
Attacking democratic freedoms is part of a larger agenda. Whether it is al-Qaeda, IS or any other group, extremist ideology thrives best in a polarised society. If the sizeable numbers of people adhering to the Muslim faith have been able to resist Islamism, it is because French republicanism has been able to surmount even the most divisive controversies, such as the ban on wearing the hijab and niqab in public and the Islamophobic discourse by the French right-wing parties that surrounded it. While the inevitable security measures will have to be taken, it would be most unfortunate if the attack on Charlie Hebdo were to give rise to a backlash against French Muslims. That would result in precisely what Islamist groups want — an alienated Muslim population that would become a recruiting ground for their violent cause. Maintaining freedoms and equality before the law in the face of a severe challenge to security is the most difficult test for any democratic polity and society.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-the-attack-on-charlie-hebdo/article6768461.ece
9,1,2015,"Unnatural death, unnatural probe","The belated decision of the Delhi Police to treat the death of Sunanda Pushkar in January 2014 as a case of murder may have ended the year-long uncertainty about the fate of a meandering probe that has been bogged down in forensic and medical investigations, but it also raises troubling questions about the functioning of the force. Whatever the initial circumstantial clues that made suicide a more probable cause of death, there was little justification for the police to delay the registration of a first information report until a year after she was found dead in a hotel suite. And even that has been done more than three months after a medical report categorically said Ms. Pushkar’s death was unnatural and due to poisoning. The latest report of December 29, 2014, largely reiterated the finding. While the circumstances — signs emerged that not everything was all right between Ms. Pushkar and her husband Shashi Tharoor when she had a spat on Twitter with a foreign journalist just a day before her death — did indicate that she may have been under great psychological stress, there appeared to be some reluctance on the part of the police to address suspicions of foul play. There were suggestions that she may have died of a drug overdose, and adding to the theory was evidence found on the crime scene. Two used strips of a drug meant to treat panic and anxiety disorders, were found, but it was neither prescribed for Ms. Pushkar nor was it consumed, as the viscera analysis showed. It would not have been difficult to trace their origin by using the batch number or ascertain if it was prescribed for her and by whom.
The theory that she suffered from Lupus has been proved wrong by the final report that states categorically that Ms. Pushkar was a normal, healthy woman with no ailments. It is to be hoped that the police will probe the evidence that seemed to bolster the suicide theory, besides getting to know the exact nature of the poison involved, through overseas experts. The formation of a special team to carry forward the probe from now on is a positive sign, but the lapse of nearly a year bodes ill for the prospects of gathering credible and relevant evidence to unearth the whole truth. The investigation has undoubtedly been tardy, hesitant and overcautious: a clear sign that it has been weighed down by the stature of Mr. Tharoor. Some caution is justified when political personages are involved to avoid the impression of favouritism or vindictive targeting, but it should not be at the cost of a free and impartial investigation. Sensitivity towards the privacy of individuals involved cannot detract from the quest for the truth.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-unnatural-death-unnatural-probe/article6768464.ece
10,1,2015,Democracy wins in Sri Lanka,"When Mahinda Rajapaksa called a fresh presidential election two years ahead of the scheduled January 2016 end to his second term in office, he did so because he was confident of being voted back for another six years. There was no real challenger on the horizon at that time, and Mr. Rajapaksa, who had made the 2009 military victory over the LTTE the main theme of his government, believed that Sinhalese voters would once again repose their faith in him. Indeed, so entrenched had he become that few imagined he would lose, and that too to a relative unknown like Maithripala Sirisena, who was the Health Minister in the Rajapaksa Cabinet. Mr. Sirisena’s sudden emergence as a candidate of an opposition alliance took Mr. Rajapaksa by surprise. He had been unable to see, surrounded as he was by a cabal, that his one-family authoritarian rule had angered senior members of his Sri Lanka Freedom Party, and taken the shine off his image among the majority Sinhalese as the President who ended a 30-year war. The Tamil voters in the North and East, alienated as they were by the Rajapaksa government’s abject failure to face up to the challenges of post-war ethnic reconciliation, were always going to vote against him. The foot-dragging on investigations into alleged war crimes, the militarisation of the Tamil-dominated North, the hardships that this posed for the people, and the huge political failure on devolution of powers all ensured that the Tamil vote would go against him. Another significant minority, the Muslims, also shifted their allegiance away from Mr. Rajapaksa as a thuggish group of Sinhalese hardliners, the Bodu Bala Sena, went on the rampage against the community every now and then, with no apparent attempt by the government to crack down on communal violence even after a bout of deadly rioting in 2013. The departure of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress from the ruling coalition to the Sirisena camp just days ahead of the election, was the final blow against the Rajapaksa regime.
Mr. Sirisena rode to victory on an out-and-out anti-Rajapaksa vote that rendered irrelevant his own perceived handicaps: the absence of personal charisma; a late start; doubts about whether a candidate of a diverse opposition group could provide a stable leadership; and the lack of resources in comparison to what the incumbent had at his disposal. He had to his advantage a rural base in the north-central districts of Sri Lanka, and aside from the backing of a ginger group of the ruling SLFP that defected along with him, the backing of the main opposition United National Party, and the Jathika Hela Urumaya, a party of Buddhist monks. With this he managed to poll nearly half of all Sinhalese votes cast, sweeping up in addition the Tamil and Muslim votes to win 51.28 per cent of the vote share compared to his opponent’s 47.58. The outcome is an unequivocal victory for democracy and a lesson to the whole region in peaceful regime change.
The new President of Sri Lanka has his work cut out. To begin with, the focus is bound to be on Mr. Sirisena’s campaign promise to abolish the powerful Executive Presidency, which will require a constitutional amendment supported by two-thirds of Parliament, a difficult proposition. One option before him is to dissolve Parliament and call a fresh election a year ahead of schedule. The coalition itself is made up of disparate and mutually antagonistic parties that must learn to work together. UNP leader Ranil Wickramasinghe has already been named the new Prime Minister. Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who, after retiring from politics in 2005 re-emerged on the scene to mentor the SLFP defectors, may well emerge as a third power centre. Quickly, Mr. Sirisena will need to repair the much-eroded confidence in Sri Lanka as a country that respects the rule of law, independence of the judiciary and media freedom. Most importantly, the new dispensation must waste no time in addressing the Tamil demand for a just peace, because on this hinges the future of the country itself. With his vast powers, Mr. Sirisena can immediately redress some long-standing demands including returning to Tamils the land owned by them that the Army took over in the 1990s and has stubbornly refused to vacate. Devolution of powers to the Northern Province should also be high on his list of priorities, and if a new Constitution is being planned with a Westminster-style government, just power-sharing with the Tamil minority should find a place. The new dispensation will also need to move speedily on addressing alleged war crimes, starting with ascertaining how many Tamil civilians actually died in the last phases of the war. But Tamil stridency on these demands will hinder rather than help matters. As the main and most credible political representative of the Tamils, the Tamil National Alliance must play a responsible role.
Tamil Nadu’s political parties must desist from fanning any extremist demands, for which there is no place on either side of the Palk Strait. For New Delhi, the change in Sri Lanka presents the opportunity to build a bilateral relationship that is based on mutual trust and honesty rather than on mutual suspicion. In recent months, the growing military relationship between Colombo and Beijing was one of the big concerns in New Delhi. As a sovereign country, Sri Lanka must be free to choose its friends and allies. But the least New Delhi can expect is that its defence concerns will not be compromised by a friendly neighbour. India’s relations with Sri Lanka are civilisational, not contractual, and despite all the ups and downs, the ties between the people of both countries, based on culture, religion and trade, have continued to flourish. Both countries have a common strategic interest in a peaceful Indian Ocean. It is from this large base that both must now work to strengthen mutually beneficial ties.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-democracy-wins-in-sri-lanka/article6772537.ece
12,1,2015,Waiting for government,"After a bitter campaign and a hotly contested election, political parties in Jammu and Kashmir could not possibly have come to a quick agreement on power-sharing and government-formation. With the post-poll negotiations complicated further by the nature of the verdict — different communities in different regions voted differently — Governor’s Rule was perhaps inevitable in the short term. Clearly, there was a polarisation along religious lines with the Peoples Democratic Party winning most of its seats in the Valley, and the Bharatiya Janata Party failing to get a single seat outside of the Jammu region. Ladakh, incidentally, favoured the Congress. As the single largest party with 28 seats in the 87-member Assembly, the PDP took the lead in the negotiations to form a government. But contrary to what PDP leaders would have the people of J&K believe, the sticking points in their negotiations with the BJP are not Article 370 or the Armed Forces Special Powers Act. Assurances on such serious issues cannot possibly be obtained or given by political parties as part of bargaining for power. What is at stake for the PDP is the chief ministership for the entire six-year term. For the BJP, similarly, getting a shot at the chief ministership, even if only for half a term, is extremely important as a step forward in its expansion plans in J&K.
The offer of support from National Conference leader and former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah only made matters worse for the PDP. Although the BJP is its ideological opposite, the PDP would have preferred a power-sharing agreement with the saffron party than with its main rival in Kashmir, the NC. With the opening up of the possibility of support from the NC and the Congress, the PDP now will have more trouble explaining to its support base any tie-up with the BJP. For the PDP, sharing power with the NC would also have meant conceding some of the ground it had wrested from that party in the last few years. The PDP can hope to expand only at the expense of the NC, and too close an identification with the NC could harm the PDP’s long-term prospects in the Valley. Forming a government under these circumstances is certainly difficult, but J&K surely deserves an elected government after the people turned out to vote in large numbers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke with justifiable pride about the peaceful election and the high voting percentage, but the democratic process would not be complete until J&K gets an elected government committed to its growth and development. All parties might need to rethink their negotiation strategy. What is required of them is the scaling down of personal ambitions, and a readiness to be more accommodative to political rivals.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/waiting-for-government/article6778033.ece
12,1,2015,No room for choice,"Following massive protests over the death of 13 women who underwent the sterilisation procedure of tubectomy in Bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh last November, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has written to all States reminding them that every person should be counselled about the different family planning options available. The letter completely contradicts the Union government’s intent of achieving population stabilisation almost exclusively through sterilisation. In a letter sent in October 2014 to 11 high-focus States, the Ministry had noted that the 2020 family planning goals had “underlined the importance of sterilisation” surgeries in these States. Even the recently released draft National Health Policy 2015 highlights the “challenge” of population stabilisation in six of the 11 States. In order to achieve the annual targets, the government recently increased the compensation given to women/men, motivators (Accredited Social Health Activists) and doctors. If the revised incentive given to motivators is Rs.200 for tubectomy and Rs.300 for vasectomy, the amount is as high as Rs.1,000 for a “permanent limiting method” (tubectomy or vasectomy) in the case of couples after up to two children. The higher incentive earmarked for permanent limiting methods is another reason why more women will now end up on the operating table. The government recently added a new component — post-partum sterilisation done soon after or within seven days of delivery. This approach works to the government’s advantage as more women are opting for institutional delivery to avail of the cash incentive earmarked for it.
Given the government’s primary focus on permanent and irreversible family planning options, the question of counselling women on the different options and giving them full freedom to choose the best one, will at best remain on paper, and not in practice. Sterilisation is the most prevalent form of contraception in the country, constituting nearly 75 per cent of the total cases. The proportion of tubectomies to total sterilisations has been around 95 per cent since 2005; nearly 4.5 million tubectomies have been performed each year since 2000. With a high number of tubectomies conducted every year and in a camp-based approach, tubectomy-related deaths as a result of poor quality of care will be inevitable even when they are done in health-care facilities. Unfortunately, the camp-based approach is set to continue. The pressure to meet targets, the incentives given to motivators and doctors and the permanent nature of sterilisation would mean that the question of counselling men and women of the different options may remain on paper.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-room-for-choice/article6778032.ece
13,1,2015,Striking truths in the coal sector,"The government may have won the first round in its tussle with employees of public sector monolith Coal India, but stiffer challenges lie ahead as it attempts to reform an industry that is critical to the country’s growth. Last week, Coal India employee unions called off on the second day what was to have been a five-day strike. This was after the government managed to convince them that there were no plans to denationalise Coal India, and set up a high-level committee to study the contentious provisions of the ordinance to auction coal blocks that was issued late last month. The unions were also exercised about the disinvestment plans of the government. In the event, assurances from the government that workers’ interests would be protected and that disinvestment did not mean privatisation of Coal India were enough to prematurely end what would have turned out to be a debilitating blow for the economy. Coal stocks, never healthy in power stations across India, dipped to critically low levels within two days of the strike. Ironically enough, the key lesson to be drawn from the strike is exactly what the employees’ unions were protesting against — broad-basing the industry by opening it up to private commercial mining. It is unhealthy for a critical infrastructure industry to be the sole preserve of a single, monolithic enterprise.
Statistics prove the point. Coal output in the country has grown at an average of 6 per cent over the last five years even as power generation capacity — three-fifths of which is coal-based — has raced ahead at a much faster pace. Coal India has failed to meet its targets for each of the last six years, with the result that India is now the third largest coal importer in the world despite boasting of the fourth largest reserves. Last fiscal the country spent around $17 billion of precious foreign exchange to import 168 million tonnes of coal to cover up for Coal India’s inability to meet demand. Mercifully, coal prices have been on the downswing in recent times, helping importers. However, imports are projected to rise to as much as 240 million tonnes in 2015-16. This is where private investment in commercial mining comes in as the latter can add to incremental output and reduce imports. Coal India’s unions need to be reassured by the government that there is space for both — Coal India and the private sector — as GDP grows and along with it, power demand. If anything, the terms of work and wages will only improve with the entry of the private sector; telecom and banks are good examples of this. The government needs to take Coal India’s unions into confidence about its plans as the company is crucial to meeting the Prime Minister’s target of round-the-clock power for all by 2022.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/striking-truths-in-the-coal-sector/article6781586.ece
13,1,2015,Policy distorts gender equity,"The Supreme Court recently refused to hear a petition challenging the Rajasthan Panchayati Raj (Second Amendment) Ordinance, 2014 on procedural grounds, sending it back to the High Court. The controversial ordinance introduces a set of educational qualifications of secondary education in order to be able to contest panchayat elections. For the post of sarpanch, Class VIII is the minimum qualification, while posts in the zilla parishad require a Class X pass. The petition is currently being heard by the Rajasthan High Court. The ordinance was challenged by several non-governmental organisations and political parties including the Congress. The BJP, which had inexplicably taken the ordinance route in the State, welcomed the decision of the Supreme Court and hailed it as a “victory of truth”. The rationale of the law is to encourage education and literacy. The problem is not with the ends, but with the means. Although the ordinance may be constitutionally valid as the facts are analogous to the reasoning of the Supreme Court in Javed (2003), it is at the level of policy that the law is weak. In Javed, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a provision that stipulated that no person who has more than two children could be elected as the sarpanch or panch of a panchayat. A similar reasoning may be applied in the case of this ordinance as well. The Javed judgment was criticised for its reasoning as also its consequences, such as instances where men gave their daughters up for adoption to be able to contest elections. Ironically, it is not difficult for those who are influential to obtain false Class X certificates either.
In India, the right to vote is only a statutory right, but the act of voting is a constitutionally protected ‘freedom of expression’ under Article 19, as a fundamental right ( PUCL, 2013). The freedom to vote is inseparable from the freedom to contest in elections, and hence a policy of encouraging education cannot arguably prevail over fundamental rights. The law is a major setback to the constitutional mandate of ensuring gender equality in panchayati governance where the Rajasthan government has provided for 50 per cent reservation for women. In rural areas, the literacy rate of women is only 45.8 per cent — in tribal areas it is 25.22 per cent — as opposed to the corresponding male literacy rate of 76.16 per cent. The law therefore excludes the majority of potential women contestants. The educational qualification norms, on top of the existing massive inequality in literacy rates, will reduce women’s participation in politics. Lastly, several grassroots activists argue that panchayat governance requires ethical values and an understanding of local issues gained from experience, more than Class X certificates.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/policy-distorts-gender-equity/article6781584.ece
14,1,2015,Another election in Delhi,"A lot has changed in Delhi in the last one year. Between the last election in December 2013 and the next in February 2015, Delhi would have seen the ups and downs of both the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Aam Aadmi Party. After the hung Assembly of 2013, when the AAP made a brilliant debut and formed a government with the support of the Congress, Delhi voted overwhelmingly for the BJP in the Lok Sabha election in 2014. Now, however, the contest seems more even in the Assembly election, called after no party was able or willing to form a government. What was without doubt a vote for the BJP and its prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi last year in the Lok Sabha election is unlikely to be repeated this year in the Assembly election, when the issues and the candidates are very different. AAP firebrand Arvind Kejriwal is not taking on Narendra Modi, but just another BJP leader. Unlike in a Lok Sabha election, when the AAP could not have expected to be accepted as a serious contender, in the Assembly polls the fast-growing party is attracting more volunteers and resources. Mr. Kejriwal and his advisers, who messed up their chance in government by first pursuing unsustainable populist measures and then opting out of governance, seem to have learnt from their mistakes. After raising doubts in the public mind over their ability to govern, AAP leaders now appear keen to demonstrate that they are more than a bunch of anarchist protesters and that they intend to back systemic changes and push for Delhi’s development in a practical manner. In 2013 they rode on the promise they held; in 2014 they paid for failing to deliver; and this year they have more of a programme to offer.
As for the BJP, whether in Maharashtra, Haryana or Jharkhand, it has been unable to rise to the levels of its Lok Sabha success in Assembly elections. Mr. Modi seems to find it harder to win individual States for his party than he did to win the Lok Sabha election. Of course, some of the difficulties have been on account of the BJP’s own chosen strategy of ditching alliance- partners in the search for absolute glory. In Delhi, a traditional stronghold, no ally could have added greatly to its vote share, and the party is preparing for a straight contest with the AAP. In 2013 the BJP had to fight the Congress and the AAP almost with equal vehemence; now, however, the Congress, no longer in power at the Centre or in the National Capital Territory of Delhi, is seen as a lesser threat. The AAP, with a more sober style that is very different from the idealistic foray of 2013 and the overambitious leap of 2014, is seeking to close the gap with the BJP. In any case, this election is likely to be more decisive than 2013.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/another-election-in-delhi/article6785730.ece
14,1,2015,Silencing a sensitive writer,"Noted Tamil novelist Perumal Murugan’s Facebook page went blank on Tuesday in a virtual closure of his identity as a writer, in a shocking illustration of the growing intolerance of fringe groups constricting public discourse. It is ironic that the author was made to virtually recant to buy peace after the recent controversy over his novel Madhorubhagan, first published in December 2010, purportedly offended the sensibilities of some dominant sections of society in the western ‘Kongu’ belt of Tamil Nadu. This, ironically at a time when many parts of the world are uniting in solidarity to uphold freedom of expression in the wake of the terror attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. At a ‘peace committee’ meeting in the Namakkal Collectorate on Monday, pro-Hindu caste outfits whose protests took the form of burning copies of the book and organising a hartal in Tiruchengode town, reportedly consented to call off their protests after the author “agreed to issue an unconditional apology, delete controversial portions in the book, withdraw unsold copies from the market and not to write on controversial subjects hurting sentiments of the people”. This pact, at the intervention of the local administration, is notwithstanding the fact that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the State unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party had distanced themselves from the protests, saying they were localised popular stirs.
Set in the backdrop of a pre-Independence era belief system involving ‘consensual sex’ ritually associated with the annual car festival of the Sri Arthanareeshwarar Temple in Tiruchengode, Perumal Murugan’s fifth novel is by most accounts in Tamil literary circles “a very sensitive and poignant portrait” of the dilemmas of a poor childless couple. (Lord Siva in the Arthanareeshwarar form is in Hindu mythology and traditional philosophical understanding a reassuring symbol of the unity of purush, or self, and prakriti, or nature.) The Penguin-published English version, One Part Woman, is about “how far would you go to conceive a child?” Politics may have no patience for such conflicting values, but in Indian intellectual traditions from ancient times, the spirit of orthodoxy and heterodoxy have coexisted. Sectarian disputes are nothing new, while writers being able to reflect on socio-economic-cultural issues in the light of received knowledge is the key to an open society. The rights under the Constitution are designed to protect the freedom of expression of writers like Perumal Murugan who may seek to question uncomfortable truths from the past. It is a pity that a range of forces conspired to silence him.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/silencing-a-sensitive-writer/article6785729.ece
15,1,2015,Voting from abroad,"The Union government has agreed, “in letter and spirit”, to implement the Supreme Court direction and the Election Commission’s recommendation to allow Non-Resident Indians to vote from overseas through postal ballots. Given the large NRI community dispersed globally, this move will undoubtedly have an impact on the country’s electoral politics in significant ways. Parliament passed the Representation of the People (Amendment) Act in 2010 to introduce Section 20A that enables a person who is a citizen of India, and is away from her ordinary residence in India for employment, education or other reasons, to be eligible to be registered as a voter in the constituency mentioned in her Indian passport: before that amendment, only “ordinary residents” could cast their vote. Although the 2010 amendment intended to include NRI participation in national politics, Section 20A had required NRIs to be physically present in their respective constituencies at the time of elections. Making it impractical for voters, this requirement defeated the intention of the legislature. A petition was filed in the Supreme Court praying that Section 20A of the Act be read down so as to allow NRIs to vote from abroad without having to be present in India. The petition argued that the provision was in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution to the extent that it impliedly treated persons on a different footing based on economic classifications. The Supreme Court and the government agreed with this contention without hesitation.
The traditional argument against such external voting has been that only citizens who are present in the territory and affected by the consequences of their vote should be entitled to vote. As per this argument, since NRIs lacked sound knowledge about domestic conditions, they would be irresponsible in their electoral choices. But this argument is fast being disproved by empirical evidence. With the rapid increase in cross-border migrations, the concept of nationhood and political membership is increasingly being decoupled from territorial locations. India’s move towards enabling voting from overseas is an instance of a larger global trend towards increased citizen participation. The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, an inter-governmental organisation, lists different voting methods that can be employed, such as “personal voting”, where voters can cast their vote at diplomatic missions abroad; “postal ballot method”, where votes are sent by regular post; “proxy vote” and “electronic voting”. From amongst these alternatives, the government has decided to employ the postal ballot route that the electoral system already uses for absentee-voters on official duty.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/voting-from-abroad/article6789567.ece
15,1,2015,Expansion and crisis,"To see Lithuania’s euro adoption this month as an entry into a losers’ club is to miss the geopolitical picture wherein several of the ex-Warsaw Pact states have staked their future on forging a European identity — to the consternation of Russia. The admission of Vilnius into the single currency bloc represents a landmark of sorts. The move completes the accession of the three Baltic constituents of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — to the three main western institutions. These are the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union (EU) and now the eurozone. The European ambitions of another erstwhile Soviet state, Ukraine, as demonstrated by its Parliament’s vote in December to join NATO, underpins in no small measure the ongoing separatist conflict in Kiev. Slovenia and Slovakia are the only other former Eastern bloc regions that have similarly acceded to all the three institutions. Against this backdrop, the flow of western investment, greater export potential and low borrowing cost resulting from integration into the eurozone would seem far more attractive to the Lithuanian population of a few million.
The country has long felt the lock-in effects of a fixed exchange rate as the litas, the national currency until 2014, was pegged to the euro some years ago. Lithuania’s entry was not without its share of controversy when some legislators expressed scepticism about the country’s preparedness to sacrifice the flexibility of a national currency. But the continuing crisis in the eurozone would have deterred Vilnius. With the exception of the United Kingdom and Denmark, accession to the EU implies a commitment to eventual adoption of the common currency by member-states once they have complied with the economic convergence criteria. Lithuania has so far been the lone euro aspirant whose 2006 bid was put on hold as Vilnius narrowly overshot the inflation limit for eligibility. But the expanded euro area comprising 19 countries is not expected to witness further enlargement in the foreseeable future. Except Romania, which has set itself a 2019 target, none of the other states has even given itself a euro-entry deadline. Realising the eurozone targets on fiscal deficits has been among the more ticklish issues within the bloc, with major economies and the architects of the rules themselves found to be in violation. Greater macroeconomic policy coherence is an admirable objective and an imperative for countries that use a common currency. But such an ideal must be balanced with political pragmatism as long as national capitals remain in charge of policy-formulation. That is the lesson from the euro’s 15-year history so far.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/expansion-and-crisis/article6789566.ece
17,1,2015,RBI’s surprise rate cut,"The ability to surprise the markets is an important trait of central banking and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan displayed that when he cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points early on Thursday. Given the favourable economic data releases of the last one week on inflation and industrial output, a rate cut was expected, if at all, in the next bimonthly monetary policy of the RBI scheduled for February 3, but Dr. Rajan chose to act ahead of that. In a way, the Governor was only keeping a promise he had made at the time of the last policy announcement in December, that monetary policy stance could change outside of the policy review cycle if circumstances justified the same. The rate cut, given its quantum, may be largely symbolic and not lead to a significant drop in borrowing costs for individuals and companies, but it signals an important shift in the monetary policy position of the central bank. The signal is clear: the easing cycle has begun and more, deeper cuts are likely if inflation and the Centre’s fiscal deficit remain under control in the near future. Little wonder then that the stock market reacted with such exuberance to the first rate cut in 20 months and also the maiden one of Dr. Rajan’s tenure — the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex shot up by 729 points or 2.66 per cent as hopes soared of a revival in investment and consumption.
Having delivered on a long-standing demand of India Inc, the Governor has now shifted the onus on to the Centre to ensure that the rate easing cycle is sustained. He left little doubt in anybody’s mind, clearly pointing out that further easing is contingent on the continuation of the disinflationary process in the economy. Also critical will be the success of the government in meeting its stiff fiscal deficit target of 4.1 per cent this fiscal. In addition, Dr. Rajan has also pointed, correctly, to the need for continuing efforts to overcome supply constraints and ensure availability of inputs such as power, land, minerals and infrastructure. With tax revenues growing at well below the expected rate, the telecom spectrum auction coming up in February and the disinvestment programmes in public sector companies assume crucial importance. The Budget for 2015-16, which will be presented in February, is also important as it will reveal the fiscal consolidation plans of the government. As for corporate India, the rate cut may appear small and might not translate into significantly cheaper funds as yet. But it should be taken for what it is: a cue that the central bank is now comfortable with the macro economic indicators and has started the rate easing process. It is now up to the corporate sector to get back to the drawing board and start investing afresh.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rbis-surprise-rate-cut/article6794465.ece
17,1,2015,The year of Paris,"As the world heads towards a new climate treaty by the end of the year, with Lima providing a bare-bones launching pad, many of the issues that have dogged negotiations will reach a flashpoint. Countries need to do more as was evident during the UN climate talks but there is not much ambition reflected either in terms of finance or technology transfer. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) has reached just over $10 billion, far short of what developing countries need to carry out urgent actions. The Synthesis Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has clearly laid a strong scientific basis, and adaptation alone will not save the earth from warming to levels which will have irreversible effects. The way the developed world is positioning itself, it is doubtful whether the issue of its historical responsibility will be the mainstay of the new treaty, post 2020. India maintains that developed countries have to pay for their pollution, and technology transfer cannot be entangled in intellectual property rights. Funding for mitigation and adaptation in the developing world becomes crucial but the principle of common but differentiated responsibility (CBDR) has taken a hard hit in recent times. Countries like the United Kingdom have already ruled out a separate allocation of funds in addition to development aid for climate actions.
The developed world contends that emerging economies like China and India cannot be treated on a par with other developing nations and that they have an equal responsibility to curb emissions. The polluter pays principle is already wilting under pressure from the first world, and will be tested as erstwhile polluters develop cleaner technology and pass it on to their poorer cousins. A case in point is the investment Europe has made in solar energy with feed-in tariffs which has brought down the costs of photovoltaics. Renewable energy becomes the focus in countries like India and China, which has already reached a bilateral agreement with the U.S. on climate. During President Obama’s visit to India, India and the U.S. are expected to firm up agreements on renewable energy and new technologies. India has volunteered to reduce the energy intensity of its GDP by 20-25 per cent by 2020 as compared to the base year of 2005. The government has tightened norms for the cement industry and will introduce new norms for fuel emissions but its National Action Plan on Climate Change lacks a unified approach. The world will know by November if the aggregate national contributions are adequate to keep global average warming less than 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Alternatives to an unsustainable path are in plenty; only the commitment needs to be scaled up, and that’s why the year to Paris will be decisive.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-year-of-paris/article6794466.ece
19,1,2015,Crisis among the censors,"The >resignation of Leela Samson as the chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), and of several other members of the body, is a pointer to a deeper malaise in the institution. Ms. Samson has spoken of corruption, and interference by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in the Board’s functioning. Her stand has the endorsement of many other members, who have also resigned, while Ministers have refuted the charge. Whatever the truth behind the resignations, the outgoing CBFC chairperson and members, while being on the right side of the debate on the functional autonomy issue, are clearly on the wrong side of the issue so far as the certification of one film is concerned. Their decision to deny a certificate to Messenger of God, featuring Dera Sacha Sauda sect leader Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, has been overturned by the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal with some riders. Apart from claiming that >Messenger of God promotes blind faith and encourages superstition, the CBFC had advanced no substantive argument on why it should not be exhibited. Ram Rahim Singh is a controversial figure and faces some charges, but merely because his film makes claims about his godly stature and miracle-making abilities, can it be denied a certificate? Many films are the products of creative imagination, and more absurd and obscurantist films have been allowed in the past. As a quasi-judicial body, the CBFC cannot really be aggrieved by the appellate forum’s verdict. Ms. Samson’s appeal to colleagues to quit en masse, saying they had been “made a mockery of by the powers of the Ministry of I&B over the film”, is not an appropriate reaction.
Perhaps it is the culmination of a series of unpalatable incidents, but if film certification in the country is indeed subject to “interference, coercion and corruption”, she and the other members ought to have raised the matter earlier and not in the context of their decision on one particular film being reversed. The government has contended that corruption, if any, must be a legacy of the earlier regime, and has asked for proof of interference in the Board’s functioning. However, it has been remiss in not reconstituting the Board even after the tenure of its members had ended. Fast-tracking an appeal, as in the case of Messenger of God, is a good thing in normal circumstances, but it has also to be seen in the context of the ruling party’s closeness to the Ram Rahim sect whose support it secured in the recent Haryana Assembly election. The situation presents an opportunity to reform the CBFC’s functioning, liberalise its approach and end the perception that it is packed with regime favourites who may not necessarily be best suited to evaluate the content of films.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/leela-samson-resignation-crisis-among-the-censors/article6799478.ece
19,1,2015,School system fails students,"Considering Nobel laureate Amartya Sen’s caution regarding the insecurity that people face over a lifetime due to the deprivation of basic education, the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2014 calls for a hard look at the situation. Its findings amount to a distressing catalogue of the failures inherent in the pedagogic methods of instruction in vogue. The foremost among them is the overemphasis on a curriculum that is geared to outcomes in the form of examination results, at the expense of a process of learning that is oriented to a mastery of concepts. These shortcomings underlie the original assumption that students of a particular grade would not measure up to commensurate standards; and that any such evaluation would hence be an exercise in futility. That is the apparent rationale behind the ASER assessment of actual student performance based on a lower set of metrics. The report points out that just a small proportion of third-graders are able to read even a text from a lower grade, let alone their own. Any improvement in later years is at best marginal, says the report. The fact is that reading skills are not imparted as part of classroom activity.
ASER also shows that pupils from the higher classes are unable to perform even simple tasks of division or subtraction. This may have to do with the inadequate reinforcement of concepts over the years owing to the structure of the syllabus. For instance, the use of logarithms that were once taught from Class 9 has been dropped from the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) curriculum. Students are hence denied the opportunity to learn complex mathematical computations. Besides, the mathematics knowledge that people need in daily life is mostly arithmetic-based. Yet, the latter has been omitted from the Class 9 and 10 syllabus. Time was when students could opt between a basic and advanced level of math from Class 8 or 9 under some State boards. The current CBSE paper, tailored to the requirement of engineering aspirants, may be imposing an undue burden on students inclined to pursue different academic streams. A healthy pupil-teacher ratio could also help overcome many of these shortcomings. The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act stipulates a 30:1 ratio. ASER notes that the country has come consistently close to universal enrolment in the 6-14 age group for six consecutive years. That may have afforded some consolation in an age where the prevailing wisdom held that poor families are disinclined to send children to school. In today’s competitive environment, the ability of students to read, write, count and measure is a bare minimum. The country cannot continue to fail its children.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/school-system-fails-students/article6799479.ece
20,1,2015,Ceding ground to the Army,"Earlier this month, Pakistan’s elected representatives voted to cut the ground from under their own feet. Despite the misgivings that some political parties and several individual legislators had, the National Assembly and the Senate ushered in the 21st Amendment to the Constitution under which military courts are to be set up for a period of two years to adjudicate on terrorism-related cases. The political establishment seemed to have fallen in line with the observation of the Army chief, General Raheel Sharif, that military courts had become the need of the “extraordinary times”, a reference to the horrendous attack on a school by Taliban militants in which more than a hundred children were killed. The last time Pakistan had military courts was during the martial law regime of General Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s. The next military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, did not promulgate martial law; there were no military courts during his nine-year regime. That Parliament sanctioned the assumption of judicial powers by the Pakistan Army during the time of an elected government led by Nawaz Sharif, who knows only too well the perils of military rule, is a further irony. The move has undermined the hard-fought 2007 struggle of the judiciary for the separation of powers, and is a blow to the country’s fragile democratic structure. There was immense public pressure on the government to do “something” to contain terrorism after the Peshawar attack. Instead of using the opportunity to strengthen investigations into terrorism offences, and put in place mechanisms to protect witnesses and judges from intimidation by terrorist groups, the government grasped all too easily the hand offered by the military, an admission of civilian helplessness.
The courts are to begin trying cases soon. In the eyes of the public, the Army is bound to be seen as being more efficient than the elected government — military trials do end quickly and military-appointed judges may be more daring than those in Pakistan’s civilian antiterrorist courts. But speed does not always serve the interests of justice, and opens up the danger of misuse of the process against innocent civilians, including those involved in legitimate political activity. Years of patronage by the security establishment of terrorist groups have radicalised all sections of society. Pakistan can tackle this malaise only by strengthening its democratic institutions. For New Delhi, the military courts present an interesting albeit double-edged opportunity. India could now possibly make the demand that the cases against the accused in the Mumbai attack should now be shifted to a military court. But while this may speed up the case, there is no guarantee that the chances of conviction would improve.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ceding-ground-to-the-army/article6802552.ece
20,1,2015,Loosening a stranglehold,"The war against tobacco has gained further vigour and momentum with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare recently placing in the public domain a draft Bill that seeks to amend the provisions of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003. Among the changes proposed, the one that will have an immediate and lasting impact on reducing tobacco consumption is the prohibition on using a “name or brand of tobacco products for marketing, promoting or advertising other goods, services and events”. Falling within the ambit of indirect advertising, the use of a brand name of a tobacco product to market and advertise a non-tobacco product is a clear case of brand-sharing, which the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) prohibits. Using the brand name of a tobacco product to market a non-tobacco product is a ploy that is routinely resorted to by companies to get round the ban on tobacco product advertising, which has been singularly responsible for the dramatic reduction in tobacco consumption in India and across the world. It is one of the changes that the government can easily implement and effectively enforce.
The draft Bill removes the ambiguity around point-of-sale display by banning the showcasing of tobacco products at the entrance to or inside a shop; it is in line with the FCTC recommendation to keep these products “out of public view”. Displaying tobacco products prominently inside a shop is a “key means” to promote them. Besides effectively bypassing the ban on tobacco product advertising, it fuels impulse buying. While the prohibition can further reduce tobacco consumption, putting it into effect will be a major problem as tobacco products are sold predominantly at small shops. For the same reason, banning the sale of these products to anyone under the age of 21 can hardly be enforced. The very fact that 15- to 24-year-olds account for over 27 per cent of tobacco consumption in India clearly indicates that sale to those below 18 years, which is currently not allowed, is a reality. The outcome will be no different in the case of a ban on the sale of cigarettes or bidis in the loose. Since ensuring that users are forced to notice the pictorial warning and message on the packets is one of the main reasons for banning the sale of tobacco products except as a whole packet, the amendment, on paper, will have a significant impact, particularly on bidi-smokers. Bidis constitute nearly 85 per cent of all tobacco smoked in India, involving mainly those in the lower economic stratum, on whom pictorial warnings could be expected to have the maximum impact.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/war-against-tobacco-loosening-a-stranglehold/article6802553.ece
21,1,2015,Short of stalwarts,"A prize catch or a liability, a master stroke or a mistake? In projecting new entrant >Kiran Bedi as its chief ministerial candidate in the Delhi Assembly election, the Bharatiya Janata Party must have entertained visions of beating the principal rival Aam Aadmi Party at its own game. Ms. Bedi, whose post-retirement political activism was centred on Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, was seen as the ideal counter to Arvind Kejriwal, who too was a prominent member of Team Anna before forming the AAP. The saffron party’s strategy was to cut into the freshly built vote bank of the AAP: the aspiring middle class that had tired of the political class, perceived as corrupt and inefficient. But in leaning too heavily on a newcomer to lead the campaign, the BJP showed itself up as a party that was short of stalwarts in Delhi. After Harsh Vardhan, who was propped up as the clean, incorruptible face of the party in Delhi in the last election, moved to the Lok Sabha and then the Union Cabinet, the BJP was left without a widely acceptable leader. Whether Ms. Bedi can unite the warring factions of the BJP, or whether she would end up adding one more faction to the mix, is the big question. What is certain is that Ms. Bedi’s entry will not be smooth; she was earlier a strident critic of the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Already there are murmurs of protest at the manner in which she was made the chief ministerial candidate without broad consultations within the party.
Like Mr. Kejriwal before her, Ms. Bedi failed to >win the support of Mr. Hazare for her political ambitions. Mr. Hazare has stayed away from all political parties, but for a brief spike in interest in the Trinamool Congress. Although she was a prominent face in Team Anna, Ms. Bedi is unlikely to win the backing of all those who had joined the anti-corruption crusade behind the Gandhian at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar in 2011. She might match Mr. Kejriwal’s crusading spirit, but whether she will be able to capture the popular imagination remains to be seen. At one level, her entry — just days before the election — comes across as politically opportunist. For the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah team, Delhi is of a different order from the Assembly polls held after the Lok Sabha election. Here the BJP has no ally to shed, and there can be no excuse for falling short of an absolute majority. Anything short of a majority will likely be seen as a failure, and not as the success of a bold experiment of going it alone. In that sense, Delhi will be a greater test than Maharashtra or Haryana or Jharkhand. How far Ms. Bedi, who is expected to turn the campaign into a direct contest between her and Mr. Kejriwal, will help the BJP in this endeavour, remains to be seen.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dlehi-assembly-polls-short-of-stalwarts/article6805733.ece
21,1,2015,Focus on public investment,"The idea that the government should lead investment revival by spending from its purse seems to be gaining ground quickly. The thought was first expressed by Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian a month ago while releasing the government’s mid-year review of the economy. Mr. Subramanian was of the opinion that public investment may have to play a greater role to complement and “crowd-in” private investment. Of course, this had to be done within the constraints of the fiscal situation. In an interaction with industrialists in Chennai on Monday, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley endorsed this view, saying that the government would take some “special steps” to increase public investment while pointing out that it would be a challenge to do so within the constraint of the fiscal deficit. Mr. Jaitley expressed the government’s predicament well. It is a fact that private investment in infrastructure is in a comatose state thanks to over-leveraged balance sheets and excess capacities that may take a long time to be absorbed. The banking system is groaning under the collective weight of the overdues of private borrowers, and banks are clearly unwilling to lend for new projects.
Of course, some companies have already started to repair their balance sheets by shedding assets through mergers and acquisitions and using the proceeds to settle their dues with banks. Clearly, though the de-leveraging process has begun, it will be a while before the private sector cleans up its act and goes for fresh investment. The onus to stimulate a revival is, therefore, clearly on the government now. The Centre has been appropriating a part of the bounty from falling global oil prices in the form of higher excise duties, and the Finance Minister is on record as saying that this money will go directly towards building new roads and highways and not into the Consolidated Fund of India. This will give an impetus to the highways expansion programme that has been struggling for want of adequate interest from private developers. But then, the scale and quantum of public investment required is much bigger, and this is where the government will run into the fiscal wall. With 99 per cent of the projected deficit for this year already accounted for in the first eight months, headroom for additional spending is non-existent this fiscal, even if one were to account for bountiful proceeds from the spectrum auction that is due next month. The focus is therefore on the coming fiscal, and the Budget will provide an insight into the government’s plans on this front. Clearly, some tightrope walking will be required as the Centre seeks to increase spending on infrastructure projects to compensate for private investment.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/focus-on-public-investment/article6805734.ece
22,1,2015,The President’s counsel,"President Pranab Mukherjee’s >pointed reminder to the government on the constitutional restrictions on the resort to the ordinance route will, it is hoped, temper the present regime’s proclivity to push through legislation by invoking the extraordinary power repeatedly. Having signed a series of ordinances in recent weeks on the government’s advice, once or twice reportedly after seeking a clarification on the nature of the urgency that necessitated them, President Mukherjee has the moral and constitutional authority to drive home the message to the government that it ought to be mindful of the limitations of the ordinance route. He has underscored that ordinances can be promulgated only “to meet certain exigencies and under compelling circumstances”, setting out the legal context in which the power may be invoked. And by concurrently speaking out against the tendency to use disruption as a means of parliamentary intervention, Mr. Mukherjee has subtly questioned the traditional wisdom of opposition parties that extracting an assurance or concession across the floor by wilfully obstructing proceedings is part of a legitimate exercise of parliamentary duties. In practice, both issues are intricately interlinked. It is often the combination of obstinacy on the part of the Treasury Benches and the Opposition’s obstructionist tactics that lead to legislative impasse and, further, to the promulgation of ordinances. Governments are increasingly eager to avoid constructive engagement with the opposition because the option of legislating through the use of presidential power is available to them.
Adding impetus to this tendency is the even more complacent belief that a lack of majority in the Upper House can be compensated for by convening a joint session of both Houses under certain circumstances. In a Westminster-model parliamentary democracy, Presidents may choose silent acquiescence with Cabinet decisions and avoid questioning the rationale behind executive advice. However, sometimes they are justified in speaking their mind and voicing their concerns on broad constitutional issues. What ought normally to occasion such concerns is any hint of impropriety, the cavalier resort to ordinances being one example. The disruption of Parliament to the point of making it dysfunctional is another example. The occasional piece of advice from a President may be easily dismissed by some as the feeble articulation of outdated principles incompatible with what is needed to survive the unsavoury contestation that electoral politics brings with it. However, it behoves a responsive government and a responsible opposition to avoid breaching the limits of constitutional propriety in their actions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-presidents-counsel/article6808920.ece
22,1,2015,Reasserting a friendship,"The visit by Sri Lankan Foreign Minister >Mangala Samaraweera to New Delhi, days after the new government in Colombo was sworn in, sends the clear message of an >enduring friendship between the two countries. As with all such friendships, there have been phases of turbulence, but the impression that ties had hit rock bottom under the previous government in Sri Lanka is not correct. New Delhi remained deeply engaged with the Rajapaksa government until the end. There were difficulties for sure, and these have not disappeared. Sri Lanka’s list of complaints against India is probably long, and these would include baiting by extremist Tamil groups in Tamil Nadu and trespassing by Indian fishermen into its waters. Differences over the former President’s reluctance to address post-war political and human rights issues relating to the Tamil minority led to India voting against Sri Lanka twice at the UN Human Rights Council and abstaining once. There was also concern when a Chinese submarine docked in Colombo twice in a span of two months last year. Statements by Mr. Samaraweera that his government would correct the “pro-China tilt” in foreign policy have gladdened India. At the same time, any suggestion of a “pro-India tilt” by the new government is likely to make it unpopular at home, and will be in neither side’s interests in the long term. What the two countries can do is to maximise the advantages of their geographic proximity and age-old bonds to further common economic and strategic interests.
India’s foremost expectation from the new government would be an early settlement of the Tamil question. The top priority that President Maithripala Sirisena has committed to give to the abolition of the executive presidency should ideally go hand in hand with plans to address the political aspirations of the Tamil minority, even as it comes up with a plan to address allegations of war crimes, disappearances and other violations of rights of Tamil civilians. This is likely to come up when the Sri Lankan President visits India next month. Secondly, New Delhi is hopeful that Colombo would upgrade the existing Free Trade Agreement with a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, for which a draft was finalised in 2008. Sri Lanka is reluctant to sign off on it, fearing India would swamp its economy. Given that Sri Lankan businesses only recently began to accept that the FTA has benefited them, a turnaround will come on CEPA too — if India is not seen as exerting pressure. Third, the two sides finalised a draft defence cooperation pact in 2003. Domestic political compulsions in India ensured it did not progress. It could be revisited given the potential for maritime security cooperation in the Indian Ocean region.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sri-lankan-foreign-minister-visit-to-india-reasserting-a-friendship/article6808921.ece
23,1,2015,The science of saving tigers,"India is unique in having a significant number of tigers in the wild, in spite of growing population and resource extraction pressures on their habitat. The latest estimate of tigers in various landscapes published by the Ministry of Environment and Forests claims an appreciable rise in numbers of the big cat. That there could be as many as 2,226 tigers in the country — up from 1,706 four years ago — in nature reserves ranging from the hills in the Northeast to central Indian forests and the Western Ghats, besides the mangrove-rich Sundarbans delta, gives India a special place on the global conservation map. Clearly, some States deserve credit for strengthening the protection of wild tigers since the notorious wipeout in Sariska a decade ago. Such conservation measures, notably the extension of protected area boundaries, must continue. Yet, as credentialed scientists are pointing out, the numbers available from the latest count may merely indicate the presence of tigers in a given area, rather than serve as the conclusions of a definitive census. What they highlight is the need to improve those aspects of the ecology that lead to a rise in numbers — voluntary relocation of forest-dwellers from core forests, a severe crackdown on the hunting of prey animals, improved patrols against poaching, safeguards against harmful land-use changes and constant monitoring using scientific methods.
The science of conserving tigers, arguably the most charismatic animals on the planet, is increasingly focussed on saving ‘source populations’ of the cat. These are defined in the literature as sites where more than 25 breeding females can be hosted, in turn embedded in a larger landscape that can potentially have more than 50 female tigers and which enjoy protection. By some accounts, 70 per cent of the world’s tigers are to be found in such sites; in India, 90 per cent of the population is part of 30 or 40 major source populations. As the Wildlife Conservation Society has pointed out, conservation of this stock holds the key to achieving a significant rise in their numbers in the coming years — potentially, India could have several thousand more if it provides them the requisite space and the connected landscapes that facilitate dispersal. In the current counting exercise, the Centre has done well to include non-governmental experts and rely on improved methods such as camera trapping, although it is yet to move to continuous monitoring and annual assessments. The government must be open to the idea of more intensive research within forests to protect the tiger and other endangered species, and adopt a liberal approach to permit bona fide independent scientists to work in protected areas. The encouraging status report on tigers awaits refinement and confirmation in March.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-the-science-of-saving-tigers/article6812248.ece
23,1,2015,Dispute over ICC intervention,"The recent decision of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Fatou Bensouda, to open a preliminary examination of alleged war crimes committed during Israel’s military offensive on Gaza in June 2014 is once again stirring up Israel-Palestine relations, and polarising the global politics around it. This decision of the ICC follows Palestine’s accession to the Rome Statute earlier this month and its acceptance of the jurisdiction of the ICC over crimes committed “in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014”. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas as well as Hamas have welcomed this move, while Israel, which has signed but not ratified the Rome Statute, has strongly denounced it. Until Palestine joined the ICC, Israel was principally in favour of the Court, but is now clearly infuriated by it. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the ICC’s move outright and is lobbying with states such as Canada, Australia and Germany to withhold their funding to it. Attempting to delegitimise the Court, Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman told an Israeli radio station: “This body represents no one. It is a political body… There are quite a few countries that also think there is no justification for this body’s existence.” Israel has frozen tax funds it collects on behalf of Palestinians.
Some of the points of criticism against the ICC are in fact valid. These are that the juridical nature of the ICC tends to hinder the peace process rather than build it, and that with an arguably grim record the Court has been ineffective and slow in investigating crimes. Also, Israel claims to be fighting the war against Hamas that it considers a terrorist organisation; so the move of the ICC, it argues, amounts to an absurdity. Such reasons, although partly true, still do not trump the need for an international criminal justice system to adjudicate war crimes. First, the role of the ICC must be clearly understood. The ICC is not meant to be a political body mediating a peace process; it is envisaged as a judicial body meant to end impunity and hold accountable those who have committed the gravest of crimes. Given this, even if the ICC may harm a peace process, which in the case of Israel-Palestine is anyway in deadlock, the politics of peace cannot prevail over justice, accountability for heinous crimes, and the upholding of dignity, women’s rights and other human rights. Second, even if the ICC is a slow and ineffective mechanism, holding those responsible for human rights violations in war crimes is necessary. Third, the investigation is against any person who may have committed war crimes during the conflict. So, both Hamas and Israel would be under the ICC’s investigation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-dispute-over-international-criminal-court-intervention/article6812247.ece
24,1,2015,Restoring cricket’s purity,"For far too long, an impression had gained ground that the Indian cricket board is but the fiefdom of a few individuals. The Indian Premier League case in the Supreme Court garnered attention among the public mainly in the light of the possible consequences it could have for its president-in-exile and International Cricket Council chairman, N. Srinivasan. The Court has now dealt with his conflict of interest issue firmly, barring him and others with an interest in IPL teams from contesting elections in the Board of Control for Cricket in India. However, it has declined to hold him guilty of the charge of wrongdoing and rejected the charge that he tried to cover up the betting charges against his son-in-law and Chennai Super Kings team official Gurunath Meiyappan. It rejects the position of the BCCI that there is nothing wrong in allowing its office-bearers to have a commercial interest in events such as the IPL that are organised for commercial purposes, unlike representative cricket. By striking down the amendment that enabled such conflicts of interest, and mandating an independent committee to streamline the Board’s functioning, the Court has done the groundwork for removing some of the malaises afflicting sports administration in India. It marks the beginning of what ought to be a long process of cleaning up a game that has an enormous following in the country, but is also struggling to preserve its purity in an era of unbridled commercialism. It is also an affirmation of the Mukul Mudgal committee’s findings.
The most welcome feature is that the verdict addresses the BCCI’s credibility deficit in more ways than one. First, it bars an office-bearer from holding a commercial interest in events organised by it; or, conversely, it bars those with such an interest from contesting for elective office. Second, it places the interests of the game, especially its reputation among its fans and its institutional integrity, at the heart of cricket administration, which will now be treated as a public function, even though the BCCI is a private body. And thirdly, it has taken the disciplinary jurisdiction regarding individuals and teams found guilty of wrongdoing in the betting scandal of the IPL’s 2013 edition out of the BCCI’s hands and vested it in a committee of three eminent former judges. Finally, the same committee, comprising a former Chief Justice of India and two others formerly with the Supreme Court, will suggest reforms and changes in the rules and regulations. In essence, the Court has sought to emancipate cricket administration from the whims of individuals and impose much-needed restraints on overweening ambition, non-transparent practices, and the cover-up of unsavoury developments.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-restoring-crickets-purity/article6815842.ece
24,1,2015,Another Ebola battle won,"On January 18, the World Health Organization and the Malian government declared Mali free of the Ebola virus disease. Mali is the third country after Nigeria and Senegal to become free of the deadly disease. A country should have had no new cases of Ebola for a continuous period of 42 days, which is a cycle of two incubation periods of 21 days, for it to be declared free of the virus. This is a particularly remarkable achievement for Mali, given the fact that it shares a porous, 800-km-long border with Guinea. After all, on December 26, 2013, the first case of Ebola virus that led to the unprecedented crisis in West Africa was found in a remote village in Guinea. Also, Mali became the sixth West African country to record a case of Ebola when a two-year-old girl with symptoms arrived from Guinea in October last year. Even in this moment of victory, Mali has to remember that it has now only won a battle. As long as the war against Ebola remains unfinished in West Africa as a whole, Mali must not lower its guard as new cases can always come up. After all, the country once experienced a similar situation in November 2014 when it came so close to being declared free of the Ebola virus, before a “second wave” of infections delayed such a declaration. The good news is that there has been a “turning point” in the Ebola crisis with the number of new cases reported in the three worst-affected countries — Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea — falling in recent weeks. According to the WHO, as on January 21, 2015 all of 8,683 people have died of Ebola, and the number of cases so far is more than 21,759.
In all, if only eight cases and six deaths occurred in Mali, which are fewer than Nigeria with 20 cases and eight deaths, the reason for that is the unprecedented efforts to contain the disease from the very beginning. Starting with tracing every person who had come in contact with the sick girl on her journey from Guinea and, at one point, placing nearly 600 people under daily observation, the government, health workers and citizens acted aggressively to stamp out the disease before it turned into a crisis situation. The massive public awareness campaign, monitoring along the border, a fully geared public health system and precautions taken by people on their own helped Mali to stamp out the virus. Of course, the sombre awareness of the crisis playing out in the three worst-affected countries had a major role to play in this process. India has a lesson to learn from the way Nigeria and Mali have handled the Ebola outbreaks. Though some vital precautionary steps were taken, the small number of centres that are capable of testing for the virus and the lack of quarantine facilities at major airports indicate a low level of preparedness to counter the virus.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-another-ebola-battle-won/article6815843.ece
26,1,2015,Critical transition in Saudi Arabia,"The death of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, at the age of 90, beckoned a cautiously orchestrated transition of power to his successor Salman in the Al Saud dynasty that holds power in the nation. King Salman has pledged that the succession would be managed smoothly, with continuity in policies and stability in internal as well as foreign relations. Given the rising violence and political instability in the region, and the glut in oil supply and consequent fall in prices, this transition of power is a critical moment. Salman, who has been crown prince since 2012, is now 79 years old and not in the best of health. Clearing any sort of uncertainty, Prince Muqrin, followed by Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, 55, have been declared the crown princes to succeed King Salman. Although the monarchic succession plan seems to be clearly mapped out, the House of Saud is said to be riven by factions and internal feuds. Whether order will prevail within the royal family is hard to speculate, given the secretive nature of its internal affairs.
The transition of power is happening at a time when politics in the region is beset with uncertainty. Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia and Shia-dominated Iran, with their decades of rivalry, are closely following the turmoil in Yemen since the resignation of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. The Shiite rebel group Houthi, suspected to have affiliations with Iran, has often accused Saudi Arabia of meddling in the country’s internal affairs. Riyadh has been praised for its effective counter-terrorism activities, especially with the Islamic State-dominated Iraq on its northern borders. Saudi Arabia continues to have favourable strategic partnerships with the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe. Even with the global glut in supply, King Salman is likely to continue pumping crude, keeping prices low, with no apparent intention to alter policies anytime soon. India maintains significant economic ties with Saudi Arabia, which is its biggest supplier of oil, accounting for 20.18 per cent of the imports in 2013-14. India accounts for 11 per cent of Saudi Arabia’s exports and 7.2 per cent of its imports. Remittances from Indians in Saudi Arabia amount to a substantial sum. From a socio-economic perspective, India has a lot at stake in the stability of the country. Given the centrality of Saudi Arabia to western economic interests, the West has often treated the country as an exception when it comes to human rights issues. The fact is that Saudi Arabia has an incredibly poor record in the matter of ensuring civil and political rights. Public flogging, beheading, and a general climate of intolerance are hallmarks of its criminal justice system. Women still do not have even the fundamental rights of speech, movement and assembly.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/critical-transition-in-saudi-arabia/article6821484.ece
26,1,2015,Yet another QE programme,"Even as the global economy grapples with the after-effects of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing (QE) programme and its withdrawal, QE is back with a bang again, this time from Europe. Though it was expected, the scale of the European Central Bank’s (ECB) bond-buying programme, declared last week, stunned markets, economists and central banks across the world. As per the terms of the programme, beginning March the ECB will buy as much as 1.1 trillion euros worth of bonds from eurozone governments over 18 months. The programme will last till September 2016 or until there is a “sustained adjustment in the path of inflation”. The planned infusion of cash into the eurozone is double the size of what the markets expected, and the ECB has said it would continue to buy government debt until inflation rose to a targeted level of “near 2 per cent”. It is not surprising, then, that bond prices rallied and the euro fell by 2 per cent versus the dollar to the weakest level seen in over 11 years. ECB president Mario Draghi has pointed to the deflationary trends in the eurozone — exacerbated by falling oil prices — as justification for the QE programme, which is bound to raise the hackles of central banks in emerging economies that were impacted by the U.S. stimulus and its withdrawal.
The ECB now joins the Fed, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan in the list of central banks of developed economies that resorted to unconventional monetary policies to ward off recession and deflation. While such policies may or may not work for them, they certainly are a cause for serious problems for emerging economies such as India. The effect of the withdrawal of the U.S. stimulus programme on India’s markets, currency and the economy is well-documented. The inflation in stock prices driven by generous capital flows and the subsequent problems when the bubble was pricked are too well known for elaboration. And that is precisely why Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan questioned the extended application of unconventional monetary policies; in a public speech last year, he decried the “competitive monetary easing” by developed economies without regard to how it affects other countries. Already, Switzerland and Denmark have felt the impact of the ECB stimulus; the Swiss National Bank was forced to delink the franc from the euro last week leading to a massive jump in its value overnight, while Denmark had to cut rates to maintain its currency’s peg with the euro. The EU is India’s largest trading partner and any depreciation of the euro will affect exporters even as there is the likelihood of strong capital flows into the Indian markets, driving up asset prices. It is time to brace for volatility, once again.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/yet-another-qe-programme/article6821486.ece
27,1,2015,Momentous vote in Greece,"The momentous victory of the radical left-wing Syriza party in Greece is certain to send shock waves through Brussels, already trying to contend with the rising popularity of forces lined up against the European Union. The impact will be felt most notably in Spain and Britain, where elections are due in weeks. But the outcome of Sunday’s poll would have surprised few in Greece, whose macroeconomic indicators must cause near-disbelief considering that the country is clubbed with the states of the developed world. Nearly a third of the population is below the poverty line and about a quarter of the workforce is jobless. The hundreds of health clinics, social kitchens, education centres and legal aid hubs that sprang up in recent months testify to the collapse of Greece’s welfare state under the weight of half a decade of austerity. It is this Solidarity for All movement that constitutes the backbone of Syriza’s political programme that swung its fortunes: from being the principal Opposition in the outgoing government it has become the largest party in the new Parliament.
The coalition government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s Syriza and the right-wing Independent Greeks party has a common objective: of giving citizens a swift respite from the painful austerity of the recent past. To what extent the left extreme factions within Syriza would countenance this pragmatic arrangement remains to be seen. Equally crucial will be the ability of the ruling combine to rise above the ideological divide. The new coalition’s first — and arguably the biggest — challenge in office will be to renegotiate the terms of the international bailout that is to run out at the end of February, and to secure a write-down of Greek debt by half, as it had promised. That will also be the moment to watch for the EU’s broader response to the threat from protesting parties in different countries of the 28-member bloc. The Finnish Prime Minister’s recent conciliatory tone at Davos on renegotiating the Greek debt burden is significant considering Helsinki’s previous unwillingness to relax the terms. As the largest creditor-nation, the domestic fallout in Germany to the EU’s economic rescue programmes has been enormous. Berlin will look to such accommodation from fellow eurozone members. Syriza’s triumph must also renew hope within the European Left that has largely remained politically divided and electorally decimated since the end of the Cold War. Its critical role in forging strategic alliances with the political centre to counter the forces of the far-right could not be overstated. Mr. Tsipras himself attributed the rise of the extreme right as a reaction to the failure of austerity. The Greeks have voted for change; their hopes should not be belied.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/momentous-vote-in-greece/article6824144.ece
27,1,2015,The deadlock in Nepal,"The political turmoil in Nepal continues as the prospects of reaching a consensus over a new draft Constitution still appears bleak. The Constituent Assembly was expected to promulgate a new Constitution on January 22, but the political parties were unable to resolve their differences in order to complete the task. The intense optimism that accompanied the nation’s transition from being a monarchy to a republic about a decade ago has turned into dismay with the political parties repeatedly failing to deliver on their promises. Nepal witnessed a transition in 1990 from authoritarian monarchic rule to a constitutional monarchy, followed by a decade-long Maoist insurgency that ended in 2006 with a peace agreement and the overthrow of the monarchy in 2008. The Interim Constitution of 2007 created a 601-member Constituent Assembly that also doubled as Parliament until a new Constitution was enacted. The Maoists emerged as the majority party in the April 2008 elections, but the Constituent Assembly failed to meet its 2012 deadline and so the Assembly stood dissolved and fresh elections were called. The second Constituent Assembly that was convened in January 2014 also failed to draft a Constitution. Rivalry and squabbles amongst parties are the main reasons for the state of political dysfunction. In the majority is a coalition of the Nepali Congress and the Unified Marxist-Leninist (UML) party that has a two-thirds majority in the Assembly. The Maoist party, which performed dismally in the second round of elections, has partnered with the Madheshi Morcha, a coalition of regional parties from the southern plains.
Federalism has become one of the most contentious issues to be resolved by the Assembly. This debate is closely tied to issues of identity and equality in a diverse nation with hundreds of communities, dialects and cultures. The ethnic and regional parties demand a federal structure that recognises and grants political autonomy to their groups, while its opponents warn that such sectarian politics threaten the country’s unified national identity by fuelling ethnic conflicts among groups. This genuinely significant problem of creating and redefining the essence and identity of a new constitutional democracy is, however, being jeopardised by power struggles among political parties that are exploiting and polarising the diversity of the regions for their own personal gains. On Sunday, Constituent Assembly Chairman Subash Nembang announced the formation of a proposal committee to prepare a questionnaire on the disputed issues of the new Constitution, which will then be voted upon by the Assembly. But with an Opposition that is vehemently opposed to the move, there is little room for optimism on this count at this point.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-deadlock-in-nepal/article6824146.ece
28,1,2015,A new chapter of openness,"As he listed the reasons why he believes the India-U.S. relationship is the “defining partnership” of this century, Barack Obama dwelt in his > farewell speech on all the similarities between the two nations: as diverse, multi-religious, tolerant democracies that respect human rights. Over the last three days, he made a much more vivid enunciation of where the future of India-U.S. ties lies as well. From the joint statement, to a declaration of friendship, to a strategic vision for the Asia-Pacific region, rarely has the state-of-play between New Delhi and Washington been so clearly mapped out during any Indo-U.S. summit. In inviting President Obama at short notice, having him > officiate over the Republic Day parade and make a series of public appearances together, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has gone where his predecessors have often shied away from — in seeking to take bilateral ties with America to a new level. The strategic defence framework, say officials, will see their militaries move to a new level of closeness, for example. Whether it is about defence exchanges, joint production of the four projects outlined, or the MoU between national defence universities, it is clear that the interaction planned between the Indian and U.S. armed forces will be unprecedented.
The openness in ties was clear in other spheres of the relationship: from the frank discourse over economic issues, to the obvious agreement on countering climate change, to the details of the Obama-Modi personal “chemistry” that they referred to with ease. Mr. Modi went so far as to say that > India and the U.S. had benefited from the bonhomie he shared with Mr. Obama. However, while the exuberance and optimism in the relationship is a positive and welcome development, especially as it comes after a period of intense negativity, it should not come at the cost of other relationships. President Obama’s criticism of Russia while in India, calling it “a bully”, was hardly something that Prime Minister Modi could have anticipated, yet it may make a dent in relations with Russia. The vision statement on the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean region is likely to have a more lasting impact on relations with China, as it seeks to portray an India-U.S. front against diplomatic, economic and security challenges in the region. It will be External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj’s task, as she heads to Beijing shortly, to assuage any fears that the pact is directed in that direction.
Meanwhile, as the euphoria from the successes of the visit subsides, Mr. Modi will need to explain domestically just how he was able to achieve the visit’s biggest “breakthrough”: on nuclear issues. For the past six years, India and the U.S. have been unable to conclude the “administrative arrangements” that would enable commercial cooperation between Indian and American companies under the civil nuclear deal. While diplomats are to be congratulated on having cleared this hurdle, the Indian public must be informed about exactly what assurances have been given to U.S. officials in return for their acceptance of the Indian liability law, and what the added costs would be. The UPA government came in for much criticism from the then-in-Opposition BJP and paid a heavy price for its lack of openness and clarity on liability issues. Mr. Modi and his government need to be more forthcoming about the details of the agreement. Since the Indian taxpayer will be the consumer, the underwriter and the potential victim of any untoward nuclear accident, the subject of liability in the > nuclear deal is of utmost importance. The “coming out” of the India-U.S. relationship is indeed a welcome “new chapter” in relations, but it cannot be written fully without complete openness on the nuclear deal as well, which has been described as the “centrepiece” of India-U.S. understanding.
On the business side, there were no significant outcomes to talk about except for the resolve to expand trade ties and a > $4-billion commitment from the U.S. in investment and loans. To put this in perspective, Mr. Modi returned with a $35-billion investment commitment from Japan when he visited Tokyo last year. Ironically, half of the investment committed by Mr. Obama will go into the renewable energy sector where the U.S. and India are locked in a trade dispute at the WTO. The dispute is over India’s imposition of local content requirements on solar cells and modules as part of the projects awarded under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission. The U.S. is also unhappy with the Make in India policy, especially in the renewable energy sector where it sees great prospects for its own companies. It remains to be seen how much of the investment committed by Mr. Obama actually happens, given that it is linked to Indian companies sourcing technology and products from the U.S. If the Indian IT sector was hoping for an agreement on the issue of H1B visas, then it must be disappointed for Mr. Obama did not go beyond giving an assurance that the U.S. would look into all aspects as part of overall immigration reform. Given that both the Senate and the House of Representatives are under the control of Republicans, it would be rather difficult for the President to push through deep immigration reform; he can accomplish only as much as is possible through executive action. Mr. Obama also had India on the back foot on the subject of Intellectual Property protection, pointing out that U.S. companies were hampered by the lack of adequate protection in India. Mr. Modi also found himself defending the > Make in India initiative even while promising that adversarial taxation policies would be phased out. Evidently, there are issues where the two countries have a lot of work to do to align their respective positions; but that may just have got easier now after Mr. Obama’s high-on-optics visit and the understanding struck between him and Mr. Modi.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-new-chapter-of-openness/article6827269.ece
29,1,2015,Going beyond symbolism,"On its 66th Republic Day, during a mighty parade in the national capital, India showcased “woman power” with all-women contingents of the three Services for the first time. A day earlier, Wing Commander Pooja Thakur became the first woman to lead a ceremonial tri-service guard of honour, which the visiting U.S. President inspected. But when it comes to the overall status of women in the Indian armed forces, especially in the Army, all this represents a travesty of gender justice. Since being inducted into the Army in 1992 under the Women Special Entry Scheme (they were in even earlier in the Military Nursing Service from 1927 and in the Medical Officers Cadre from 1943), women Army officers are still denied permanent commission on a par with men: they have to be content with the short service commission. On a batch of petitions filed in 2003 by women officers demanding an end to the discriminatory practice, the Delhi High Court in March 2010 granted their just and fair claim for permanent commission — with the singeing words that it was not some “charity being sought… but enforcement of their constitutional rights”. While this prompted the Air Force and the Navy to grant women officers permanent commission, the Army took a different stand, arguing, among other things, that “the bulk of the army’s Junior Commissioned Officers and other ranks hail from rural India, who are not yet ready to accept a woman as their leader in combat situations”. In an affidavit filed before the Supreme Court in 2012 while appealing against the High Court order, the Army added: “In theory women in the army may sound good but in practical terms the arrangement has not worked well in the Indian Army and as a concept also our society is not prepared to accept women in combat role.”
As the issue remains in the Supreme Court for more than four years now, the Army needs to get real, and persuade itself to go beyond symbolic and cosmetic steps. It needs to recognise women’s capabilities — as many advanced armed forces across the world have done, even committing them to combat roles — and their right to a full-fledged career in the force, on a par with men. During the 14-year short service commission tenure they now enjoy, women officers in various corps are assigned duties similar to those of men officers without distinction, to all possible field units with men officers. If it is the Army’s claim that beyond that point in permanent commission tenure women could be exposed to hostile environments — it has cited “the unique nature of responsibility and organisational requirement that… the Army Act” necessitates — that truly smacks of gender discrimination. The time has come for the Army to end this iniquitous situation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/going-beyond-symbolism/article6831124.ece
29,1,2015,The dynamics of inequality,"Occupational and geographic mobility across the region are bridging income and consumption-related disparities, says the World Bank report, ‘Addressing Inequality in South Asia’. The findings accordingly underscore the role of urbanisation and private sector participation as being critical to mitigating socio-economic disadvantages. Inequality should be understood in terms of monetary and non-monetary dimensions of well-being, contends the report. The share of the poorest 40 per cent of households in total consumption shows that inequality in South Asia is moderate by international standards. The comparison is valid even though estimates elsewhere are based on income per capita. Significantly, but not surprisingly, economic mobility of the recent decades has proved beneficial to the population at large, cutting across traditional divides and challenging stereotypes. This finding, if anything, underscores the positive effects of legal safeguards for the protection of minorities. Indeed, monetary inequality of enormous significance is manifested in India’s highly disproportionate billionaire wealth, amounting to 12 per cent of gross domestic product in 2012. The ratio is considerably large even compared with other countries at a similar level of economic development, says the report.
Conversely, non-monetary indices of well-being pertain to opportunities available to people in the early years, outcomes during adulthood and support systems through the life-cycle. Thus, although it is not the poorest region, South Asia accounts for some of the worst human development outcomes in basic education and health care. Besides the highest rates of infant and child mortality that prevail in many parts of the region, more than 50 per cent of poor children below five years of age in Bangladesh and Nepal are stunted; the proportion for India is over 60 per cent. Pervasive tax avoidance and regressive fuel and electricity subsidies are primarily responsible for the inadequate provisioning of public services. Of no insignificant value is the non-dogmatic stance the report adopts on a fundamental moral question such as inequality. Drawing upon influential academic debates in economics and philosophy, the study argues that the rewards linked to hard work and entrepreneurship serve as incentives to give one’s best and enhance overall well-being. It would be fair to infer that non-monetary inequalities are arbitrary and potentially more detrimental to economic growth over the long term. To bring such ideas into the public and political mainstream would enhance the quality of the debate, and further consolidate contemporary competitive electoral democracies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-dynamics-of-inequality/article6831125.ece
30,1,2015,Obama and religious freedom,"The first public reactions to U.S. President Barack Obama’s soul-stirring “Address to the People of India” at the Siri Fort Auditorium in New Delhi before winding up his three-day historic trip to the country on January 27 have, rather predictably, displayed a binary logic. A good section instantly saw in Mr. Obama’s candid views on “dealing with diversity of beliefs and of faiths” and the need to uphold the constitutionally guaranteed ‘Right to Freedom of Religion’ without fear of persecution or discrimination, a well-meant yet stinging reminder to the Narendra Modi-led BJP Government to rein in its religious fundamentalist elements. But an equally vocal section seemed to resent his homily to a nation whose “Sanatana Dharma has been extremely tolerant” of all religions. However, holistically there is more substance to Mr. Obama’s 34-minute speech, set in the context of two emerging scenarios. First, the possibility that America can be “India’s best partner” in a whole range of activities including the ‘next wave’ of economic growth, and second, at a more personal level how India for Mr. Obama represents “an intersection of two men who have always inspired me” — Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi — in striving for equity and peace in a non-violent way.
It is from this perceptual bedrock that the American President has sought to re-engage India on a much wider socio-political canvas of cultural pluralism and religious diversity under an overarching universal humanism. Mr. Obama’s admission that “in our lives, Michelle and I have been strengthened by our Christian faith”, may at best elevate traditional religious notions like ‘God’ and ‘all of humanity being God’s children’, to a secular plane in a complex, interdependent world in guarding against sectarian divisions and dark violence which threaten to rapidly undermine ‘foundational human values’. This universalism for Mr. Obama, looking beyond “any difference in religion or tribe and rejoice in the beauty of every soul,” seem to be first premises for articulating a new global ethic of peace and harmony. The entry point may be Hinduism, Christianity, Islam or any other faith, but the goal is enabling ‘compassion and empathy’ in human affairs. This is a utopian task, but this is what ‘world leaders’ like India and the U.S. should be doing, he hinted. The late Philosopher-President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, in his work, The Spirit of Religion said: “The world has got together as a body; it is groping for its soul… If we can have a United Nations Organization, cannot we have a United Religions Organization?” Mr. Obama’s plea for religious freedom aims to give that vision a chance under very different circumstances.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/obama-and-religious-freedom/article6835414.ece
30,1,2015,Sending the right signal,"The government’s decision not to appeal against the adverse verdict of the Bombay High Court in its Rs.3,200-crore tax case against Vodafone is the first concrete demonstration of its resolve to do away with what Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley termed “adversarial” taxation policies of the erstwhile UPA government. Though the BJP had during its election campaign, referred to “tax terrorism” in its election campaign there was little that happened in the first eight months of the new government to show that such policies would be reversed. The latest Cabinet decision sends out a strong signal to foreign investors that this government will be fair in its tax policies and avoid needless litigation. The decision not to appeal has implications for other such similar cases involving multinationals and is, in that sense, a significant one. It is also an acknowledgment that the Income Tax Department’s assessment of the case was erroneous. The Vodafone case was about wrong classification of a capital receipt as taxable income at the hands of the company. Applying transfer-pricing guidelines, the I.T. Department held that Vodafone had underpriced its shares issued to the parent. So it revalued the shares and deemed the difference to be a loan given to the parent. This was clearly high-handed and a wrong application of transfer-pricing regulations.
The government’s decision to accept the High Court verdict is also a signal to assessing officers that they should refrain from making unreasonable tax demands, relying on aggressive and faulty interpretations of rules and sections. Yet, it is also true that the government turns the heat on these officers when it decides that tax collections need to be augmented. If the tax official is confused he cannot be blamed. What is needed is a stable policy that sends out the signal to both assessing officers and taxpayers that the government will crack down on evasion but within the framework of the law; there will be no extraordinary interpretations of rules and sections even in times of revenue distress. The focus will now shift to whether the government moves to neutralise the mischief caused by the retrospective tax amendment; this is a major demand of foreign investors who were disappointed that it was not addressed in the first budget of this government in July last year. The General Anti Avoidance Rules, or GAAR, are a cause for worry for taxpayers and foreign investors as they confer wide discretionary powers on the I.T. Department. It will be interesting to see if Mr. Jaitley makes a Budget announcement to postpone its implementation once again as per the recommendations of the Parthasarathi Shome Committee.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sending-the-right-signal/article6835416.ece
31,1,2015,Interference sans responsibility,"Jayanthi Natarajan’s explosive letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, with its stunning revelations about Rahul Gandhi’s interference in the functioning of the Union Environment Ministry when she headed it, only underscores what was long known in party circles. As heir apparent, Mr. Gandhi would sporadically interfere in policy decisions depending on his particular pet belief at a particular point in time. Worse, the positions he took were often inconsistent. As > Ms. Natarajan points out in her letter, Mr. Gandhi’s espousal of the interests of tribals and fisherfolk was soon superseded by his advocacy of industry: at a FICCI meeting, shortly after she was sacked as Minister, he complained about delays in environmental clearances (something Ms. Natarajan implies happened because of his interference), and promised there would be no further bottlenecks. If, from time to time, there were whispers in the party about similar > interventions by Mr. Gandhi, the one that played out in front of television cameras was in September 2013, when he tore up a controversial ordinance on convicted lawmakers, as well as the Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill that sought to replace it. Five days later, the Union Cabinet withdrew the ordinance, but not before it had deeply > embarrassed the then Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh.
Differences on policy issues exist in all political parties and governments: the proper way is to settle these issues through internal debate, a practice the Congress abandoned long ago. In UPA-I, in Sonia Gandhi’s National Advisory Council the Congress created an institution through which the social welfare dimension could be introduced into governance: Dr. Singh did not always agree with the NAC’s formulations, but through a process of discussion, a via media would be found — as in the > Food Security Act. But in the case of Mr. Gandhi, there was always great anxiety amongst his minders to ensure that he got the credit for any governmental or party success, sometimes with comic effect. Towards the end of UPA-I, after the government had already decided to > expand the coverage of the MGNREGS to the entire country, Mr. Gandhi took a delegation to the Prime Minister to press him to do it! The key problem for the Congress has been that while Mr. Gandhi was repeatedly entreated to join the government in a Ministry of his choice, he stayed away, saying he preferred to build the party. The uncharitable view in the party was that ministerial responsibility would have brought in its wake accountability, anathema to the heir apparent. Today, Mr. Gandhi’s spin doctors may question Ms. Natarajan’s timing, but if he does not draw the right lessons from her > dramatic exit from the Congress, there could be more departures.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/interference-sans-responsibility/article6839853.ece
31,1,2015,Climate change deniers,"The passage of the Keystone XL pipeline bill, the first priority of the new U.S. Senate controlled by Republicans, hit a roadblock on January 27 when the Senate managed to muster just 53 votes in its favour, seven shy of the 60-vote threshold to limit debate. The nearly 1,900-km-long proposed pipeline, which will transport 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta’s (Canada) vast oil sands to Nebraska, is a highly controversial project. Unlike conventional crude, mining and turning tar sands into oil is highly carbon-intensive and hence has far worse consequences for global warming. It is for this reason that President Barack Obama had threatened to veto the bill. But the bill produced some interesting results before it reached the stage when the Senate voted on it. For the first time, the Republicans’ slowly but surely shifting position on climate change became evident. When the first measure — climate change is real and not a hoax — offered as an amendment to the legislation that will pave the way for the Keystone XL pipeline project was put to vote on January 21, except for one Republican the entire Senate agreed that climate change is for real. Interestingly, Republican Jim Inhofe, the veteran climate change denier in the Senate, was one of those who voted for the amendment. For him, the hoax was that “some people think… they can change climate”.
Though a majority of the Senators also agreed that humans are singularly responsible for climate change, two crucial amendments that pointed a finger at humans failed to cross the 60-vote threshold. While an amendment affirming that humans contributed to climate change was just one short of 60, the third amendment, that “human activity ‘significantly’ contributes to climate change”, got only 50 votes; just five Republicans voted for it. Apparently, the emphasis on human contribution turned out to be the sticking point. The Senate has till date refused to widely agree that man-made climate change is real. Despite a body of evidence unequivocally proving that human activity has been the causal factor for climate change, the deniers are in no mood to change their stand. So long as policymakers fail to acknowledge the havoc created by human activity, there is little possibility that anything substantial will be done to address it. The consequences will be terrible and irreversible if ideology continues to stand up to science. With reckless emission of greenhouse gases continuing, the Earth is already on “track to warm by 3.6° Celsius”, as the International Energy Agency estimated last year. This is way beyond the goal of limiting the increase in global average surface temperature to 2°C above the pre-industrial level.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/climate-change-deniers/article6839854.ece
2,2,2015,A needless controversy,"Union Minister and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ravi Shankar Prasad calling for a national debate on whether the words “socialist” and “secular” should continue to be part of the Preamble to the Constitution in the wake of the controversy over the Central government using a “watermark of the original Preamble” in advertisements released in the print media on the occasion of Republic Day — which did not have those words — has set off a debate on a constitutional amendment made during the period of the Emergency. It followed the Shiv Sena’s demand that the two key words be dropped altogether from the amended Preamble. In conceptually adding the words to the Preamble by means of the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976, wherein the words “Sovereign Democratic Republic” were substituted with “Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic”, the Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to that Bill said it was to “spell out expressly the high ideals of socialism, secularism and the integrity of the nation, to make the directive principles more comprehensive and give them precedence over those fundamental rights which have been allowed to be relied upon to frustrate socio-economic reforms for implementing the directive principles.” That the working of the Constitution shows shortcomings, that the insertion of these two words was done during the period of the Emergency under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and that the Indian ethos is ‘inherently secular’, making the inclusion redundant, are the main arguments put forward by the ruling dispensation now.
As many legal pundits have convincingly shown, the Preamble embodies the “basic philosophy and fundamental values on which the Constitution is based”. The inclusion of the words “socialist” and “secular” is best seen as an explication of the ideals modern India has drawn directly from the freedom struggle. Upendra Baxi, citing the great constitutional historian Granville Austin — despite his differences with him — recalls how the “roots of the directive principles” could be traced to the 1931 Karachi Congress resolution, and to the “two streams of socialist and nationalist sentiments in India that had been flowing ever faster since the late 1920s.” Even the Morarji Desai-led Janata Party government, in which the Jan Sangh was a constituent, did not think it necessary to delist these two words when they enacted the 44th Amendment to nullify the objectionable features introduced in the 42nd Amendment Act. Political scientists also emphasise that in the S.R. Bommai case, the Supreme Court held that “secularism is an integral part” of the Constitution’s basic structure. With or without the amended Preamble, the Indian Constitution will remain secular, but the signal the dropping of the words would send will be disconcerting to the minorities.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-a-needless-controversy/article6845573.ece
2,2,2015,Sanitation in schools,"The inequities in infrastructure could not be starker. While several schools continue to deny the most basic sanitation facilities for poorer children, a select band of them dangle air-conditioned classrooms and dormitories and other accessories before the more affluent ones. Repeated knuckle-rapping by the Supreme Court over the years has evidently had little effect on State administrations, as the case of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana illustrates. In October 2012, the Court had issued orders for the building of toilets in all schools within six months. That stricture was a sequel to a similar kind of intervention the year before. The Supreme Court had stepped in yet again last year, but to little avail. Matters have got no further in 2015. In this latest instance, a two-judge Bench has been constrained to spell out to the governments of the two neighbouring States as to what type of structures were acceptable as safe and clean toilets. That is proof enough that official specifications were violated both in letter and spirit. Such complacency on the part of the authorities would hopefully be history given the increase in funding for the purpose ever since >Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence day address.
Not unrelated to the situation in schools is the equally callous attitude of many States with respect to the enforcement of the ban on manual scavenging that was legislated over two decades ago. Underlying the indignity heaped on public sanitation workers, as well as the insanitary conditions in schools, is a mindset of complete denial; that, if anything, compounds the problem. The detrimental long-term effects, especially upon girls, of prolonged lack of access to toilets have been well-documented. Where facilities exist, they are effectively rendered dysfunctional because of the most unhygienic conditions in which they are invariably found. This aspect may be linked also to the  ratio of toilet facility to user of 1:40 for girls and 1:80 for boys, as per norms laid down by the Union Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation. Conversely, the UNICEF standard provides one toilet for 25 girls and a toilet and urinal for 80 boys. The adoption of best practices in one area would critically influence behaviour with respect to other health and sanitation indicators. Schools thus play a pivotal role in inculcating clean and healthy habits among children, families and the wider community. Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu is a torch-bearer of the country’s information and technology revolution. His counterpart in Telangana, K. Chandrasekhar Rao, won statehood on a promise of development for the people. They have both committed themselves to realising Mr. Modi’s >mission of Swachh Bharat . They have their task cut out. A toilet is not a luxury — not for human beings.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sanitation-in-schools/article6845574.ece
3,2,2015,End the ambivalence,"Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah did well to try and quell the controversy over the demands for dropping the words ‘secular’ and ‘socialist’ from the Preamble of the Constitution. In his interview to The Hindu, he could not have been more unequivocal: “The BJP believes that the Preamble, as it stands today, should remain. There is no need to change it.” What is now needed is for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to endorse his political aide, Mr. Shah, and give a public assurance on retaining the two words, to remove any doubt about the stance of the government on this issue. The point of concern is not whether India needed the word in the Preamble to be secular, but as noted in The Hindu’s editorial, “A needless controversy” (February 2, 2015), the disconcerting signal that the dropping of the word would send to the minorities of the country. While there is little doubt that Mr. Shah’s thoughts on the subject are aligned with those of Mr. Modi, the Prime Minister can make a big difference by distancing his government from the controversy fanned by the BJP’s far right ally, the Shiv Sena. Otherwise, Ministers and party functionaries would feel free to stoke fresh controversies of this nature every now and then.
While Mr. Shah seemed keen to end the controversy over any change to the Preamble, he did not think the political storm over the ghar vapsi programme undertaken by Hindutva outfits would derail the development agenda of the government. Indeed, the BJP president was intent on using the heat generated by the programme of reconversion to Hinduism as an excuse to push for a specific law on banning forcible religious conversion. Mr. Shah, while defending U.S. President Barack Obama’s speech on religious freedom in India, stuck to the Hindutva line that conversion is a problem, and sought support for an anti-conversion legislation without seeing a need for any further debate on the subject. Actually, the divergence within the BJP on these crucial issues is becoming increasingly evident with Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh saying that ghar vapsi had no place in India, even while describing Mr. Obama’s remarks on religious divides in the country as “unfortunate”. This is another reason why Mr. Modi must step in with an assurance that his government has no plans to bring in changes to the Preamble, or to encourage communally divisive politics. Without his intervention, the government and the party will appear to be speaking in different voices on issues of national importance. Development cannot bloom miraculously on a separate track insulated from the subversive political challenges of the day.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-end-the-ambivalence/article6849477.ece
3,2,2015,An ICBM becomes more versatile,"India’s intercontinental ballistic missile, Agni V, has been turned into an even more potent weapon of war. On Saturday, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) demonstrated that this missile, capable of sending a nuclear warhead to targets over 5,000 km away — thereby bringing much of China within its reach — could be launched from a truck-mounted canister. The ability to move ballistic missiles around makes it difficult for an enemy to locate and destroy them. Placed in canisters, the missiles can be easily transported and launched with great rapidity in all sorts of weather conditions. The canisters have another advantage as well — they make decoys possible. While these large truck-borne missile containers can be detected by spy satellites passing overhead and may well be noticed by observers on the ground, it will be impossible to tell those that actually carry missiles from ones that are empty. Thus, any attempt at a first strike to take out India’s nuclear-armed missiles becomes far more uncertain and therefore a risky undertaking for any adversary.
However, launching a missile from a canister is more difficult, especially when it involves a large missile like the Agni V. The missile must be ejected from the container, using a gas generator, before its first stage can be ignited. Although the DRDO had previously carried out canister launches with the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile and the 700-km-range Shourya missile, launching the Agni V in a similar fashion was still a considerable technological challenge. Hurling this 17-metre-long, 50-tonne missile clear of its container requires far greater force, which must be provided by large amounts of gas produced very rapidly. In doing so, neither the missile nor its launch system should be damaged. Saturday’s flawless launch shows that the country’s defence scientists have indeed mastered this complex technology. Three successive Agni V flight tests have gone without a hitch over the last three years and DRDO officials say the missile will be ready for induction into service after just one more trial, which will be carried out later this year. However, India’s strategic planners will need to bear in mind the fact that Pakistan and China have deployed nuclear weapons on their missiles in a way that goes beyond conventional nuclear deterrence. Rather, their strategy appears to create ambiguities over the escalation of a conventional conflict into a nuclear one. Consequently, enhancement of this country’s long-range ballistic missile capabilities must go hand-in-hand with proper planning to deal with situations that might lead to such apocalyptic weapons of mass destruction being launched.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-an-icbm-becomes-more-versatile/article6849478.ece
4,2,2015,On expected lines,"A fortnight after surprising the markets with a 0.25 percentage point cut in benchmark interest rates, the Reserve Bank of India has opted for a standstill policy on rates in its bimonthly monetary policy review, which is along expected lines. When it cut rates on January 15, the RBI had clearly said that any further easing would be contingent upon data confirming the disinflationary trend and sustained high-quality fiscal consolidation. Given that there has been no significant development on either front, the central bank has decided to maintain an unchanged stance on interest rates. However, to improve liquidity, and in line with its policy of lowering the Statutory Liquidity Ratio to increase availability of funds for infrastructure lending, the RBI has reduced SLR by 0.50 percentage points to 21.50 per cent. This is expected to release about Rs.45,000 crore into the system. While the RBI is doing its bit to reduce lending cost and increase funds availability, banks seem reluctant to pass on the benefit to borrowers. After the RBI reduced rates last fortnight, only a couple of banks have so far attempted to reduce their lending rates. Though the transmission of policy rates by banks is always sluggish in the down-cycle, the current reluctance by banks is striking and is a direct result of the strain caused on their balance-sheets by non-performing assets (NPAs).
Meanwhile, the RBI’s bias towards further easing of rates is very clear, but the downward momentum will be determined by the pace of disinflation and the government’s fiscal stance in the coming Budget. Though inflationary expectations are at their lowest in 21 months, the risks stem from the traditional upswing in food prices at the onset of summer, the progress of the monsoon and a turnaround in global crude oil prices that have already rebounded from their lows in the last couple of days. The RBI will also be closely watching the government’s fiscal math and its commitment to keep the deficit within targeted levels. While the current account deficit is projected at a very comfortable 1.3 per cent of GDP for 2014-15, exports could suffer in the coming months thanks to the problems in the eurozone, which is India’s largest trading partner. The central bank also has reasons to be wary about the effects of the quantitative easing programme of the European Central Bank on India’s financial and currency markets. The projection of 6.5 per cent growth in GDP in 2015-16 is realistic, but a lot depends on the return of investment momentum and increase in consumption, both of which are sluggish at this point in time. Cautious optimism could well be the catchphrase to describe the country’s economic prospects in the near-term.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-expected-lines/article6853386.ece
4,2,2015,Terrorism threatens Japan,"The purported beheading by Islamic State (IS) of two Japanese journalists, and its warning that Japan would be one of its military targets in future, pose a challenge to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government. Its impact would perhaps mark a critical shift in Japanese foreign policy and public opinion. Japan has largely been insulated from international terrorism in the past decade and radical Islam has little or almost nil hold in the country. Japan’s pacifism is embodied in its Constitution of 1946, through which it has renounced war and outlawed belligerent responses to international disputes. Japan does not maintain an army with war potential, except for the de facto Japan Self-Defence Forces (JSDF) that is intended to maintain peace and order. With a pacifist foreign policy that strongly distances itself from militaristic ventures, why is Japan now a target of Islamic terrorism?
The fact is that Japan’s foreign policy has been undergoing several changes in the past few years. Prime Minister Abe, a conservative-nationalist, has been gradually rewriting the pacifist Constitution, especially since his 2012 re-election. The defence budget was considerably enhanced, the ban on arms exports was lifted and the capabilities of the JSDF were expanded. A reinterpretation of Article 9 of the Constitution now allows Japan to use force to defend its allies under attack. Also, Japan’s relations with the Middle East are becoming more central — and controversial. Being a resource-poor country, it is one of the largest importers of crude oil from the region. Political stability in the Middle East is in Japan’s own interests. Mr. Abe, during his recent visits to Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel and Palestine, pledged $200 million in non-military aid for countries fighting IS. He also promised humanitarian and infrastructure assistance for those fighting terrorism, as well as for refugees displaced from Syria and Iraq following IS activity. Mr. Abe’s attempts to gain prominence on the international stage by playing a bigger role in the West’s counter-terrorism policy has clearly drawn bitter reactions from IS, as reflected in the outrageous beheadings. With the widespread shock at these recent events, the Japanese public will be faced with important questions on how to judge Prime Minister Abe’s proactive and gradually militarised foreign policy. Regardless, Mr. Abe has unequivocally stated that the country “will not give in to terrorism” and will “work alongside the international community to make them pay for their sins.” It is evident that Japan’s emerging foreign policy is in for some testing times.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-terrorism-threatens-japan/article6853387.ece
5,2,2015,Coal India success and after,"The government can justifiably feel a sense of relief at the success of the recent round of Coal India Limited (CIL) disinvestment which has brought in some much-needed funds to its anaemic coffers. In what was the biggest equity offering ever in the country, the offer for sale of 10 per cent of its stake in CIL fetched the government a whopping Rs.24,557 crore, more than half of the budgeted proceeds of Rs.43,425 crore from disinvestment this fiscal year. To put the CIL sale in perspective, the government had managed to raise just Rs.1,719 crore until now in this fiscal through the sale of shares in Steel Authority of India. If the government is to keep its promise of keeping the fiscal deficit at 4.1 per cent of GDP in 2014-15, achieving the budgeted revenues from disinvestment is crucial. The budgeted fiscal deficit for the entire year was exceeded in the first nine months until December 2014 since tax revenues did not grow at the expected pace. The government will also have to look at non-tax revenues such as from disinvestment to fill the fiscal hole. Hence the spectrum auction, coming up in March, and the disinvestment in other PSUs such as ONGC and NHPC, assume great importance.
The CIL disinvestment may not have been so successful but for some generous help from domestic institutional investors, particularly insurance companies. As much as Rs.11,360 crore, which is half of the total sum raised, came from insurance companies led by the LIC, with the latter accounting for a bulk of the applications in this category. Of course, the LIC may have seen genuine promise in CIL while investing its money. Yet, this is nothing more than money moving from one hand of the government to the other given that the LIC is wholly owned by the Centre. Of course, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have also put in Rs.5,919 crore in the CIL offer, which is encouraging. The government would do well to reappraise the entire disinvestment programme which has so far, disappointingly, amounted to nothing more than selling off a few pieces of family silver to tide over difficult times. What is required is a privatisation programme whose objective will not merely be to raise funds for the exchequer but to reform the public sector space. The government should identify public sector units that are languishing for want of capital and technology and bring in strategic private partners to rejuvenate them. The trade unions too will be on board to support such schemes that will safeguard jobs in these companies. Eventually, the Central government should divest itself of enterprises in sectors such as steel and cement production, focussing instead on improving social services such as health care and education.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-coal-india-success-and-after/article6857459.ece
5,2,2015,Cruel and unusual,"On January 30, the U.S. State of Ohio postponed all the seven executions scheduled for 2015 to procure a different anaesthetic drug and develop a new protocol to execute death row convicts using lethal injection. The announcement came three weeks after the State decided not to use a controversial anaesthetic, Midazolam, and two days after the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the execution of three Oklahoma death row convicts using the same drug. Midazolam is used to put a convict to sleep before other drugs are injected to stop the heart. Though the intent behind using the anaesthetic is to reduce pain when another injected drug causes death, the outcome has been nothing but disastrous. Last year, the unproven anaesthetic failed to completely sedate prisoners, resulting in a few prolonged and possibly excruciatingly painful executions in Ohio and Arizona. For instance, in January last year, it took 26 long minutes of “choking, gasping and writhing” before a convict in Ohio died in a bungled execution. That the experimental anaesthetic drug was chosen not on the basis of scientific merit but information available on an unreliable Internet website, reveals the downright callousness involved and the mindless pursuit of executions. In 2011, when European countries banned the export of sodium thiopental and other anaesthetic drugs used in executions and a sole American manufacturer halted sodium thiopental production, many States turned to compounding pharmacies, which are beyond the purview of the Food and Drug Administration, for the supply of untested and unreliable drugs.
There is no scientific basis to support the effectiveness of lethal injections using different drugs with randomly chosen dosages and questionable quality and administered using varied protocols: Ohio has a two-drug protocol while Oklahoma has a three-drug regimen. Another vital issue that makes the method highly repugnant is the failure to administer the drugs into a vein. Such a fiasco in April 2014 led to a convict in Oklahoma remaining alive for 43 minutes, often “writhing in pain” and “breathing heavily” before dying of a heart attack. The botched executions clearly demonstrate that the punishment very often ends up being disproportionate to the crime, thus violating the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment. If capital punishment by itself is abhorrent and has no place in a modern society, executing prisoners using lethal injections is outright barbaric. The U.S. has the dubious distinction of being a country with one of the largest number of executions in the world. Ironically, 13 States account for almost all the executions; 18 States and the District of Columbia have repealed it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-cruel-and-unusual/article6857461.ece
6,2,2015,Dealing firmly with transgressions,"By giving the marching orders to Union Home Secretary Anil Goswami for trying to stall the arrest of a well-connected politician by speaking directly to Central Bureau of Investigation officers, the Narendra Modi government has sent out a strong signal to the bureaucracy that it will not tolerate such transgressions. And coming at a time when political functionaries and their associates are increasingly embroiled in criminal cases, it contains a message to high-profile suspects too, that the government will not brook any attempt to use power or influence to protect themselves from legal action. It is also an unmistakable sign that the present regime wants to insulate itself from any criticism that the CBI is under its thumb. The United Progressive Alliance regime failed miserably on that score, repeatedly rendering itself vulnerable to the criticism that it slowed down or stalled investigation into several scams. In a refreshing change of approach from a time when only judicial prodding or media exposure led to some action, Home Minister Rajnath Singh moved quickly to ascertain the facts from both the CBI Director and Mr. Goswami himself before apprising the Prime Minister of the development. While the details of what Mr. Goswami had by way of explanation are not available, it is quite obvious that his continuance became untenable as soon as he admitted to making the controversial telephone call even as former Union Minister Matang Sinh was being questioned by CBI investigators. Any hesitation on the part of the government at this point would have been indefensible.
The image of the CBI had taken a beating only recently when its Director, Ranjit Sinha, was ordered by the Supreme Court to keep away from the probe into 2G spectrum allocation cases after it was found that he had entertained some of the accused at his residence. In the light of this, the latest action aimed at insulating the agency from interference will come as a shot in the arm for its officers. However, it is a matter of concern that Matang Sinh, a former Union Minister arrested recently in connection with the Saradha chit fund scam, and whose arrest was sought to be stalled, could have such access to the higher echelons of the government. Reports suggest that long after his party, the Congress, lost power, and his own political fortunes waned, Mr. Sinh continues to wield influence in the national capital. Were his connections limited to efforts to save his own skin, or did he influence appointments or postings? The government should probe all the leads it may have that indicate the extent of his clout. It would do well not to treat the matter as closed but order a full investigation into a possible deeper nexus between bureaucrats and tainted politicians.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-dealing-firmly-with-transgressions/article6861709.ece
6,2,2015,Reconciliation in rainbow land,"The release on parole of a high-profile apartheid-era police officer convicted on 89 charges and sentenced to 212 years in 1996 is yet another reminder of South Africa’s struggle to balance justice with reconciliation. The overriding imperative of securing peace and stability between the once brutally oppressed majority black communities and their erstwhile Afrikaner white minority rulers underlay the constitution of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in 1994. Its vision entailed the avoidance of the potentially tortuous course of divisive prosecutions and the award of amnesty for all those who would come clean during public confessions before the TRC. Notably, the grant of amnesty was to be examined equally for those complicit in politically motivated crimes perpetrated against the white supremacist regime, as well as those in defence of apartheid rule. Although about 1,000 security personnel and others admitted to brutalities they had committed against activists of the African National Congress, just one Cabinet Minister pleaded guilty. A former apartheid-rule President, whom a court had implicated for unlawful acts, refused to testify. Another former President never sought amnesty, pleading ignorance about atrocities committed by the regime.
“Prime Evil”, as Eugene de Kock was described, is now to be released after 20 years in jail. But the 66-year-old convict is not the first of his ilk to be set free. The grant of amnesty in 1996 to a top police official within less than five years of the start of a life term was seen by critics as an attempt by the TRC to encourage others to atone for their crimes. Another decision to pardon a notorious killer was surrounded by questions about the veracity of the confessions. Such has been the chequered history of bringing closure to past wounds. A perception that he was made a scapegoat for actions authorised by political higher-ups, as well as his expression of genuine remorse to the relatives of victims, have influenced the grant of parole to de Kock. The question of the nature of activities that should qualify for pardon was controversial in the aftermath of the release of Nelson Mandela and the restoration of democracy in the 1990s. The ANC had insisted that guerrillas charged with crimes in the armed struggle against white minority rule were also eligible. On the eve of the TRC hearings in 1996, there was even a legal challenge from the kin of some of the victims arguing that they could not be denied the right to settle disputes in a court of law. To balance justice with reconciliation is akin to making a choice between reason and emotion. There is much to learn from South Africa on this.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-reconciliation-in-rainbow-land/article6861708.ece
7,2,2015,The battle for Delhi,"Elections to the Delhi Assembly have always attracted disproportionate national-level attention. It is voting today, February 7, for the second time in a little more than a year. The elections in December 2013 resulted in a hung Assembly. A government formed by the then-fledgling Aam Aadmi Party, with the support of the Congress that was pushed to the third slot after being in power for three consecutive terms, lasted just 49 days. Rapid turns in Delhi politics since the announcement of fresh elections have brought to the fore several questions that have lingered since the parliamentary victory of the BJP under the leadership of Narendra Modi. These relate to the sustainability of Mr. Modi’s centralised model of Hindutva politics in a diverse polity such as India’s, the possibility and the nature of an alternative to it, and the future of the Congress.
The central figure in the Delhi campaign is AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, who transformed a loosely knit anti-corruption movement that had social activist Anna Hazare as its mascot, into a thriving political movement and party. Today it appears to be a credible challenger to the Modi juggernaut. The party’s impressive revival after its rout in the parliamentary elections of May 2014 has put the BJP on the back foot and made Delhi the first real contest for Prime Minister Modi. The BJP had an easy ride in the 2014 rounds of Assembly elections in Maharashtra, Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir and Jharkhand, sustaining a certain perception of Mr. Modi being unbeatable. Halfway into the campaign in Delhi, the BJP declared its newly inducted member and former police officer Kiran Bedi as its chief ministerial candidate, restoring a practice it had abandoned since Mr. Modi became its supreme leader. But Ms. Bedi’s arrival on the scene seems to have only added to the BJP’s troubles — and she has failed to provide Mr. Modi an alibi to distance himself from a possible failure. If the BJP falls short of a majority, that will expose Mr. Modi’s vulnerability, force him to hold back on his unilateral, ongoing overhaul of the party, and put him at a disadvantage ahead of the Assembly election in the crucial State of Bihar in November. Inversely, a BJP victory will keep it on the winning trail, and tighten Mr. Modi’s personal grip on the BJP and politics in general. Indeed, an AAP victory could hold out the prospect of an alternative to Mr. Modi. The AAP could seek to expand outside Delhi, but at the very least it will stand out as a model where an unconventional leader with some credibility galvanised public opinion for change. In the midst of all this, the Congress commands limited space in Delhi. Yet, these elections hold significant lessons, and prospects, for its revival bid too.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-the-battle-for-delhi/article6866025.ece
7,2,2015,"India, China and an opportunity","Keeping up the momentum in India-China relations, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj came back from her three-day visit to China with several deliverables — including a new Chinese openness in seeing India take up permanent membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). Previously, the Chinese had linked SCO membership with a greater role for Beijing in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Ms. Swaraj, during her first visit to China as External Affairs Minister, built on the three meetings Prime Minister Narendra Modi has had with Chinese President Xi Jinping. She also called on the Chinese President, a rare opportunity for any visiting Foreign Minister. Clearance for the early operationalisation of a new route to Kailash Mansarovar and a decision to hold a session of talks between the Special Representatives tasked by the two sides to resolve the boundary dispute, are other takeaways. Her trip was also part of preparations for Mr. Modi’s visit later in the year. As reported in the Chinese media, President Xi himself has set the agenda for taking bilateral ties to a new level by suggesting that the two countries seize the “opportunity of the century” by combining their development strategies. With a slowing economy and sluggish European recovery, China may be focussing on the Indian market. It also appears willing to invest, following Prime Minister Modi’s “Make in India” call.
It is in such a scenario of contact and consultation that “strong leaders” such as Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi can think about making some hard decisions when it comes to the decades-old boundary dispute that keeps surfacing during major bilateral visits. So far, the coalition nature of Indian governments has been seen as a major obstacle to the give-and-take, compromise approach on the border question. Today, Mr. Modi is in the happy situation where he can take a political call on issues, rising above intra-coalition pressures. In 2005, the Agreement on the Political Parameters and Guiding Principles for the Settlement of the Boundary Question signed by the two countries had raised hopes for an eventual settlement, but those have been belied. It would also seem that President Barack Obama’s successful visit to India around Republic Day has not dampened Beijing’s willingness to take relations with Delhi to the next level. Interestingly, India while talking to the U.S. and its other allies in the Asia-Pacific about safety in the sea-lanes, has agreed to set up a “consultation mechanism” on Asia-Pacific affairs with China and Russia. India’s diplomatic success lies in keeping several balls in the air at the same time.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-india-china-and-an-opportunity/article6866027.ece
9,2,2015,Silence is not an option,"Two successive statements by U.S. President Barack Obama within a span of nine days on the shrinking religious tolerance in India have created some flutter. In the first instance, as he wound up his India visit on January 27, Mr. Obama >underscored the point that countries that are divided within along religious lines cannot progress; in the second one, on February 5, he said the acts of religious intolerance that are being reported in India >would have shocked Mahatma Gandhi. Though the White House later said that the President’s remarks were not aimed at anyone in particular, they have embarrassed the Narendra Modi government. The Congress has seized the opportunity to attack the government for inaction in the face of the acts of intolerance, while hardline Hindutva groups such as the Vishwa Hindu Parishad have seen in Mr. Obama’s remarks a pattern of unwelcome interference. It is curious that Mr. Obama invoked two motifs that Mr. Modi has repeatedly claimed to have been guided by — first, the Constitution, and second, Gandhian ideals. It is also curious that Mr. Modi invokes Gandhi on issues ranging from cleanliness to diaspora concerns, but not when it comes to the question of religious harmony.
Finance Minister >Arun Jaitley’s statement — that “India’s huge cultural history of tolerance” cannot be altered by aberrations — is perfectly valid, but such well-meaning statements by themselves just would not do. The point of concern is that the tradition of tolerance that Mr. Jaitley — like most Indians — takes pride in, is being attacked and weakened. Liberties and values will have to be nurtured in order for them to be enduring. That is the reason why Mr. Modi’s silence on recurring reports of desecration of churches and intimidation of religious minorities by extremist groups has become a matter of concern, as noticed also by the outside world, and reflected in a recent >editorial in The New York Times. More troubling is the fact that these acts are being committed by groups that belong to the larger ideological universe that Mr. Modi has been associated with. This is not to overlook violence promoted in the name of other faiths, but the question here is about the links of intolerance to political power that controls the state. Mr. Modi has told his party colleagues that he does not want to be distracted from his economic agenda by contentious issues. Tolerance, though essential for growth, cannot be reduced to an instrumentality of growth, and the amiable coexistence of diverse religious and cultural traditions is an end in itself. The Indian Constitution enshrines a set of fundamental freedoms and rights. The government of the day has a constitutional duty to uphold these rights and freedoms. A government should not only be fair but also be seen to be so, and needs to be outspoken in the defence of constitutional values.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/silence-is-not-an-option/article6871561.ece
9,2,2015,For a stitch in time,"Every year, hundreds of precious lives are being lost to the H1N1 influenza, described by medical experts as just another >preventable and curable form of seasonal flu. This year, the >toll has already crossed the 200-mark, and over 2,500 people are being treated in hospitals and in homes. Rajasthan, Telangana, Gujarat and Maharashtra are bearing the brunt of the pandemic. In >Rajasthan alone, 85 people have died — the highest in the country so far. Last year, 937 cases of swine flu, as the influenza is commonly known, were reported, leading to 238 deaths. In 2012 there were 5,044 reported cases, which claimed 405 lives, while there were 5,253 cases and 699 deaths in 2013. The pandemic has been a regular occurrence in India since 2009 when the first case was reported. Even then the public health system is unable to stop these entirely preventable deaths. The level of preparedness of the States affected by H1N1 to manage an outbreak is often reviewed only after deaths are reported. This time it was done after a former Chief Minister of Rajasthan, the State Home Minister, and a Member of Parliament from Andhra Pradesh tested positive.
The situation was >reviewed by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in terms of adequacy of medicines and the readiness and training of doctors and paramedical staff in public health institutions in the States. A round-the-clock Outbreak Monitoring Cell of the National Centre for Disease Control is attending to public queries on H1N1 to keep people informed and to dispel apprehensions, since January 24. On their part, the States concerned have done their bit to tackle the crisis, with Rajasthan going a step further by issuing an alert, providing free treatment, and announcing the setting up of task forces right up to the district level to monitor the situation on a daily basis. Curiously, the information, education and communication campaigns to create awareness among the masses to protect themselves from the infection, and steps for timely treatment are launched only when the rounds of outbreak peak. The States have now been advised to ensure that steps are taken to prevent any increase in the number of casualties by encouraging people to approach public health facilities on time, and to educate them on preventive methods. The simple flu becomes deadly as patients come in for treatment only when things go out of hand. Advance planning and readiness to deal with the annual seasonal outbreak by means of simple and cost-effective awareness creation by the public health authorities, would go a long way in preventing deaths.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/for-a-stitch-in-time/article6871562.ece
10,2,2015,The churn in Bihar,"Outgrowing, even undercutting one’s political mentor is nothing unusual among politicians. To cite contemporary examples, Narendra Modi and Arvind Kejriwal had to walk out of the shadows of their respective mentors, L.K. Advani and Anna Hazare, to establish themselves as figures of political authority. Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi’s revolt against his former mentor and Janata Dal (United) leader, Nitish Kumar, is however in many ways one of its kind. For one, it was Mr. Kumar who won the mandate in 2010. He had made it for a second consecutive term riding a popularity wave he had created on account of two features that defined his politics — good governance and social empowerment. Mr. Manjhi was an accidental inheritor of that mandate, when Mr. Kumar decided to step aside after the setback his party suffered in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Mr. Manjhi had not earned what he now claims to be his — the Chief Minister’s chair.
Mr. Manjhi began to dissociate himself from Mr. Kumar soon after becoming Chief Minister, and sounded the bugle of revolt in an interview to The Hindu on January 6, 2015, where he declared that his achievements in social empowerment were better than Mr. Kumar’s, and that the next Chief Minister of the State should be a Mahadalit, the lowest section of the Dalit community that he belongs to. From then on, Mr. Kumar had no option but to replace Mr. Manjhi, whose rebellious reaction has complicated the matrix of caste politics in Bihar. Mr. Kumar’s attempts to build a broad social coalition ahead of the Assembly elections in the State, due in October, by bringing together the backward communities, Dalits and Muslims, in an alliance with the RJD, the Congress and the Left, will now have to be fine-tuned. The BJP, with which Mr. Kumar split in 2013 after a 17-year-long coalition arrangement, opposing Mr. Modi’s projection as Prime Minister, is hungering to bid for power in the State. Attracting a good chunk of Dalit votes has been a component of the BJP’s winning strategy in Maharashtra and Haryana recently. The party is using the chance to widen the gulf between Dalits and the backwards to its own benefit, yet is wary of getting too closely identified with the unremarkable track record of Mr. Manjhi in governance, often marred by allegations of impropriety and corruption. The ability of the regrouped factions of the erstwhile Janata Party to resist the Modi-led BJP will also be tested in the crucial State that elects 40 Lok Sabha members. It is going to be an uphill task for Mr. Kumar to recover the ground, but this is a fight he cannot avoid, and it will have national resonance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-churn-in-bihar/article6875321.ece
10,2,2015,Fast-tracking disputes resolution,"Recognising the optimism in Indian markets, driven by a government that is encouraging growth in trade and commerce, the Law Commission of India (LCI) in its recent 253rd Report has recommended reforms that can support this economic growth from a legal perspective. These are much-needed reforms in a growing economy where commercial disputes are often complex and of high value. The LCI has recommended the establishment of a commercial division in the High Courts to ensure speedy disposal of high-value commercial suits. It has proposed a bill, titled The Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts and Commercial Courts Bill, 2015, and substantive procedural changes in the form of amendments to the Civil Procedure Code, 1908. The bill will define ‘commercial disputes’ so as to include ordinary transactions of merchants, bankers, financiers, joint ventures, partnerships, insurance companies and so on. These courts will have jurisdiction to hear only those disputes valued at Rs.1 crore or more. A commercial appellate division will hear appeals on the orders and decrees of the commercial courts. The Chief Justice will nominate judges with expertise and experience in commercial matters to the commercial and appellate courts. All pending commercial disputes beyond the specified value will be transferred to the commercial division. These recommendations are aimed to ensure disposal of cases expeditiously, fairly, and at reasonable cost.
The LCI had, in its 188th Report, recommended the setting up of specialised commercial courts, but the Rajya Sabha did not pass it then. The proposed bill is the consequence of a re-examination of the previous version tabled in Parliament in 2009. The LCI considers the suggested measures to be a pilot project that would lead to more expansive structural reforms. In the five High Courts with original jurisdiction, there are 32,656 civil suits pending, marking a 6.27 per cent increase in pendency over the previous year. One of the reasons for the large pendency is the shortage of judges in the original side of the High Courts. For instance, in the Madras High Court only four judges were allocated for the 41,702 cases pending on the original side in 2013. So the judiciary has to first tackle the root problem of high pendency rates and the mismatch between pending suits and the number of judges hearing it. Launching grand programmes or pursuing foreign investment without making necessary internal reforms in an already slow and overburdened judicial system will render these policies ineffective in the long run. The LCI’s recommendations are undoubtedly timely and need to be taken up without undue delay.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fasttracking-disputes-resolution/article6875322.ece
11,2,2015,The Delhi Spring,"Arvind Kejriwal has done something uncommon, extraordinary and outstanding by scooping up 67 of the 70 Assembly seats in Delhi, leading a two-year old outfit, aptly named the Aam Aadmi Party or the common man’s party. The sweeping scale of his victory shows that the aspirations of the common voter for transformational politics have embodied themselves in a wave that swept all the other parties including the BJP to the fringes. It underscores the rising expectations of ordinary people for transparent and accessible governance, delivering on promises. The party and Mr. Kejriwal were ridiculed and caricatured by opponents for the agitations — first over the right to information and later against corruption — that built him as a politician. The AAP did not win a single seat in Delhi in the Lok Sabha elections. But Mr. Kejriwal stood his ground. He mobilised the widespread discontent among ordinary people with conventional politics, offering them a new hope, of politics that offers clean and sensitive governance. A cross-section of Delhi’s population cutting across age, class, caste and gender appears to have voted for the AAP, obliterating the Congress and reducing the BJP to single-digit status. They put their money where their hearts were, generously contributing from their hard-earned, tax-paid wealth to AAP funds, which were open to public scrutiny.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the people of Delhi to elect a Chief Minister who “feared Modi”. By electing a Chief Minister who is far from being scared of Mr. Modi, and has often dared to take him head-on, the people of Delhi have refused to accept fear as a driving force in their electoral choices. The Delhi result is a categorical repudiation of the unilateralism that has come to characterise the Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of Mr. Modi and party president Amit Shah. This tendency was most sharply exemplified in the act of imposing a rank outsider, Kiran Bedi, as the party’s chief ministerial candidate at the last moment. Only eight months ago, the BJP had won all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi and led in 60 Assembly segments. The dramatic downfall requires the BJP to look within and acknowledge that sledgehammer politics, which may be convenient in the short run, can rebound with disastrous results not only for the party but also for the polity at large. Mr. Modi represented change in May 2014. The AAP’s victory in Delhi must remind the BJP of the possibility that there can be change beyond Mr. Modi too. As for the humiliated Congress, which failed to get a single seat, the election result is another signal that it must get its house radically in order. We wish Mr. Kejriwal’s Delhi Spring well. But we also urge him to recognise that the widespread expectations of his commitment to accessible governance are what have brought him to power. Only then would it really be the rule of the Aam Aadmi.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-delhi-spring/article6879314.ece
11,2,2015,The long road to justice,"The recent International Court of Justice (ICJ) verdict absolving Serbia and Croatia of crimes of genocide in the 1990s Balkan wars underscores the political sensitivities involved in holding sovereign states liable for serious atrocities. The litigation dates back to 1999, when Croatia alleged genocide by Serbia during the 1991-1995 war over its secession from the former Yugoslavia. In the bombing campaign, over 12,000 civilians were killed; many thousands were incarcerated and fled their homes following the occupation of about one-third of its territory by Serbian separatists. In its 2010 counter which similarly alleged genocide, Belgrade contended that thousands of ethnic Serbs were forced to flee their homes in Zagreb’s 1995 military offensive to reclaim lost territory. In its ruling, the ICJ held that despite large-scale atrocities and displacement of people on both sides during the break-up of Yugoslavia, the intent to destroy an entire population could not be proved under the 1948 UN Convention on genocide.
Significantly, the ICJ had adopted a similar stance in its 2007 verdict on the infamous July 1995 Srebrenica massacre of about 8,000 Bosnian Muslims by Serb forces. There again, the court had opined that Belgrade was not responsible for genocide, even as it maintained that the 1948 convention had been breached insofar as the country’s leaders failed to prevent the brutal killings. Clearly, the fine line between ethnic cleansing and genocide is a politically ticklish matter for the Hague court to determine in relation to inter-state disputes. Conversely, the conviction of a number of top individual leaders for genocide by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) established in 1993 serves as an instructive comparison. The Tribunal has already pronounced a guilty verdict on at least five Bosnian Serb army officers of crimes of genocide in the Srebrenica massacre. Although the verdict on the notorious wartime leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, is still pending, the many hurdles that have been crossed to bring the trial to fruition are a reassuring sign. Undoubtedly, prosecutions in various tribunals continue to encounter formidable obstacles in bringing perpetrators, often influential individual politicians and others, to justice. Nevertheless, global humanitarian law has evolved degree in recent decades to provide victims of brutalities and witnesses a critical forum to testify to violations. Enforcing transparency and accountability within and across national boundaries is a long and arduous process. But the framework is critical to render the world as a whole humane.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-long-road-to-justice/article6879315.ece
12,2,2015,Congress Zero,"The Congress’s >failure to win even a single seat in the Assembly elections in Delhi, a State it ruled for an unbroken 15 years till end-2013, only confirmed its members’ worst fears. The Grand Old Party is in free fall and in the nine months since it lost power at the Centre, its leadership has done little to arrest the downward spiral. In quick succession last year, the Congress lost Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir, States it had been in power on its own or in a coalition. Its ranks have witnessed a steady depletion with several high-profile exits, such as that of G.K. Vasan and Jayanthi Natarajan in Tamil Nadu, Krishna Tirath in Delhi, Jagmeet Brar in Punjab and Birender Singh and Rao Inderjeet Singh in Haryana (the last two before the Lok Sabha polls), making headlines. Further, the division of Andhra Pradesh, a Congress bastion till recently, has virtually wiped the party out in both halves. Continuing feuds in State units, from Punjab to Maharashtra to Haryana, to name just three, simmer on. Yet another Antony Committee report, the post-mortem after its Lok Sabha rout, has predictably not been shared even within the party. A series of structured discussions led neither to a plan of action nor a reorganisation of the party. All decisions were postponed, citing the need to focus on the slew of Assembly elections, now all over, and this year’s scheduled party organisational elections.
But the real reason for the delay in instituting changes is the resistance within the party — and not merely, though primarily among members of the old guard — to installing heir apparent Rahul Gandhi as party president this year. The resistance comes not only from those who fear they may be pensioned off, but also from those younger leaders who do not see a future for themselves under his leadership. An overwhelming majority in the party believes he does not have what it takes: he has neither demonstrated the ability to sustain an idea or the hard work demanded of a full-time politician in a leadership role. There are now open whispers in party circles of a possible split in the party should Mr. Gandhi be elevated. The electoral verdict from Delhi has not come a day too soon: if the BJP was trounced, the Congress lost almost its entire vote base to the AAP. The Congress party has to urgently recover this lost ground by ensuring a return to its foundational principles that had won it the faith of millions in the past decades. Otherwise it will face the prospect of extinction as other political formations take its place in the contestation with the principal party in power, the BJP.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/congress-zero/article6883341.ece
12,2,2015,For cooperative federalism,"The views expressed by Chief Ministers at the maiden >meeting of NITI Aayog’s Governing Council last weekend, demanding greater freedom to frame their own development plans, vindicate the thought process that went into conceiving the body that has replaced the 64-year-old Planning Commission. Promoting cooperative federalism and giving States greater freedom in designing their development plans were two of the key objectives behind the setting up of the NITI Aayog. >Chief Ministers, cutting across party lines, demanded that they be given such freedom, with Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy pointing out that schemes such as Jan Dhan Yojana or Beti Bachao were of little relevance to his State which already boasted of superior metrics in both fields. Similarly, Rajasthan’s Chief Minister demanded that the number of Centrally-sponsored schemes be reduced to 10, while Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar wanted such schemes to be dispensed with altogether. If these demands prove something, it is this: there can be no one-size-fits-all approach to development in a diverse country like India. And no longer can development be orchestrated from the Centre alone; it is as much the preserve, prerogative and responsibility of the States. Thus, the NITI Aayog will stop with making recommendations; implementing them will be the responsibility of the States.
An important decision made at the meeting was to constitute a subgroup of Chief Ministers who would study the 66 Centrally-sponsored schemes to assess whether they should be continued, transferred to States or dropped altogether. While doing this assessment, care should be taken to ensure that socially important inclusion schemes are not either downgraded or dropped. There could be examples of schemes that may not have national relevance but have resonance with particular States; these should be identified with due care and alterations should be made only after a consensus is evolved in the Governing Council. In this regard, it is encouraging to note that inclusion of the vulnerable and marginalised sections and redressing identity-based inequalities are at the top of the seven guiding principles for the Aayog as laid out in an e-book published by the government. This should also reassure those who see the body’s mandate as promoting a free-market economy which could come at the cost of the less-developed States. Of course, the true test of this government’s commitment to inclusive policies will come in the Budget’s allocations to social sector schemes. All the lofty ideals of the Aayog will come to naught if the government, forced by fiscal considerations, decides to set aside lower sums for social spending.

13,2,2015,Playing poker in Sri Lanka,"The Tamil question has been brought centre-stage with the elected council of Sri Lanka’s Northern Province passing a resolution accusing successive governments in Colombo of carrying out genocide against the minority community over six decades. Moved by Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran in the Provincial Council, the resolution demands that the  U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights investigate “historical” and “recent” instances of genocide and submit its report at the session of the Human Rights Council next month. It also asks the UN Security Council to refer the matter to the International Criminal Court. Thirdly, it asks courts in countries with universal jurisdiction over the alleged events and perpetrators, “including but not limited to the United States”, to prosecute the crimes. The resolution roundly rejects any domestic investigations. The timing of this strongly worded resolution is no mystery. In the five weeks since President Maithripala Sirisena has been in office after his stunning election victory, he has been preoccupied with the task of fulfilling his 100-day charter of promises, which ambitiously includes the abolition of the executive presidency. Pulling together a diverse coalition with conflicting agendas is his primary challenge. For these reasons, there has been significant diplomatic chatter that the international community must permit the new government some time before it takes up the twin tasks of investigation of alleged war crimes and human rights abuses against Tamils and demilitarisation of the North. The HRC session in Geneva is seen as crucial in this context. Clearly, the Tamil National Alliance, which is the main political grouping representing the Tamils and rules the Northern Province, wants to ensure that these issues stay on the global agenda, and at the same time test the will of the new Sri Lankan government at a crucial point.
While the resolution may serve that purpose, its maximalist tenor does complicate the political ground for the Sirisena government even before it has properly articulated a plan for addressing Tamil demands for a just peace, harden as it will Sinhala opinion. The political and legal contestation over the use of the word genocide will prove divisive too. Soon after the election, the new government gave an assurance of a credible domestic investigation into war crimes allegations. New Delhi is rightly concerned about the impact this could have on its diplomatic efforts aimed at persuading Colombo to act on full devolution of political powers to the Tamil minority, a matter that is certain to be on the agenda when President Sirisena visits next week for a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Colombo must be counselled against any knee-jerk response on the resolution, and encouraged to come out with a full-fledged plan for reconciliation with the Tamil minority.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/playing-poker-in-sri-lanka/article6887749.ece
13,2,2015,A challenging title defence,"It is amid grim expectations that India embarks on its defence of the cricket World Cup. The team has been in Australia since November and failed to win a single competitive game of cricket; the batting, on bouncy pitches, has wobbled; and the less said about the bowling the better. It is fair to say that the public’s confidence in the side will not be particularly massive when the campaign begins with a high-voltage fixture against Pakistan in Adelaide on Sunday. Yet, India under M.S. Dhoni has proven itself adept at limited-overs cricket. The team that first came together at the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013 — and won it against expectations — is not ranked second in the world without reason. In the likes of Dhoni, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Suresh Raina, India has a set of genuine match-winners, capable of influencing the outcome on their own. Pitches in Australia and New Zealand may not be conducive to India’s style of cricket, but then no team, except the hosts, can claim to be truly comfortable with local conditions. The tournament returns to Australasia after 23 years; it was in 1992 that cricket became a wonderful televisual spectacle with floodlights, white balls and coloured clothing.
The curtain goes up on Saturday, when New Zealand meets Sri Lanka in Christchurch. The Black Caps have made at least the semi-finals in 10 major ICC tournaments, but have only one trophy to show for it. Later on Valentine’s Day, the game’s oldest rivals meet at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Australia should consider itself among the favourites, although the pressure of playing at home can have an adverse effect on performances. In contrast, even England’s most optimistic supporters carry little hope of success. South Africa, a team that has somehow lost in the most inexplicable of ways time after time at the World Cup, appears overwhelmingly strong on this occasion. The ghosts of tournaments past can be banished if A.B. de Villiers and his lot play to their potential. Pakistan and Sri Lanka, teams of contrasting character, cannot be written off either. The format of the World Cup — 14 teams in two groups — means it will be a month before the first quarter-final match is played, with the eight major nations all but guaranteed a berth in the last eight. It has left the tournament obscenely bloated — at 44 days it lasts almost two weeks longer than the FIFA World Cup and more than twice as long as the Olympics. The ICC has announced that the 2019 edition will be limited to 10 teams; it is a welcome development.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-challenging-title-defence/article6887750.ece
14,2,2015,Need to temper expectations,"Fresh revelations about the existence of a list of 1,195 Indians with accounts in a bank in Switzerland, estimated to contain funds to the tune of Rs.25,420 crore, has escalated the pressure on the government to make renewed efforts to trace unaccounted money stashed away abroad. There is little doubt that the probe will now have to be widened to take the new disclosures into account. However, the publication of the list by an international consortium of investigative journalists may not automatically mean that all these accounts are illegal or that the funds in them are tainted. That some prominent industrialists and other individuals have found a place in this ‘black’ list is cause for some excitement, but should not give rise to heightened anticipation that the country is closer than before to bringing home wealth hoarded away in safe havens. In the public imagination, the archetypal holder of a Swiss bank account is the businessman who parks money in a jurisdiction famed for its banking secrecy, or the political leader hiding corruption-tainted cash. It is not known how many of those >named in the fresh list of offshore accounts said to be held by Indian nationals in HSBC’s banking arm in Switzerland fall under either of these categories. Some of them have denied that they had any illegal accounts or that they had any overseas bank account at all.
The need, as pointed out rightly by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, is not for names, but hard evidence to show that these accounts held black money. These accounts will have to be scrutinised first to assess whether its holders were entitled to operate them, whether the money was legitimately acquired and liable to be taxed in India. After scrutiny of an earlier list of 628, the government found that 428 of them were actionable, and there were 128 orders of assessment. It has launched prosecutions in 60 cases for wilful tax evasion. The process ought to be completed by March 31 this year. These numbers provide some perspective on the mammoth task at hand, and the clear absence of any shortcuts. Expectations arising from these disclosures will have to be tempered. The government will do well to continue efforts to act on the suggestion by the Special Investigation Team that treaties signed with other countries to curb black money be renegotiated. The Attorney General has also spoken about new legislative measures on the treatment of unaccounted money abroad. Even while strengthening transborder measures to check tax evasion, domestic laws also require amendments to curb the menace. Dealing with the black economy is a complex issue that involves managing jurisdictions where confidentiality is the norm, and negotiating an exchange of information based on an applicable legal framework.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/need-to-temper-expectations/article6892687.ece
14,2,2015,The Internet’s tempting presence,"Toward the end of last year, there was an uproar when India’s leading telecom carrier Bharti Airtel decided to charge subscribers extra for use of applications such as Skype to make free calls over the Internet. Airtel was criticised for violating a key principle influencing Internet traffic, which is that all data must be treated equally and there must be no discrimination. The principle goes by the name Net neutrality. Within days, the company beat a retreat on its pricing move, saying it would wait for the regulator, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s consultation paper in this regard. The paper is still awaited. In contrast, there was hardly a whimper when a few days ago social media giant >Facebook tied up with Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communications to bring to India a service that critics globally believe presents a huge challenge to Net neutrality. The reason is not hard to fathom. Facebook’s offering, internet.org, unlike that in the Airtel example, is free. The stated intention of the social media network is to make available Internet to those who don’t have it. It is hard to find fault with such a mission. Despite fast growth in recent years, the percentage of individuals using the Internet in India is less than 20 per cent. China and Brazil, in comparison, have already got about half their populations accessing the Internet.
The catch then is in how internet.org has been implemented. In every country where it has been launched — India is the sixth — internet.org offers a preselected bouquet of websites free to subscribers of Facebook’s telecom partner, under a practice dubbed zero-rating. Yes, this does mean millions of Indians could for the first time in their lives access the Internet, albeit an extremely limited version of it. But there are numerous reasons why it is difficult to see it as an altruistic endeavour. One, the subscribers have no say in selecting the websites. Two, the Internet ceases to be an open platform where everyone has an equal chance to succeed. Three, in the long run, internet.org could present a huge competitive advantage to some, to the disadvantage of many. This is all the more significant, because newer Internet adopters are going to do so via smartphones, which are becoming cheaper by the day. India’s smartphone sales are exploding, almost doubling to 80 million units in 2014 compared to the previous year, and expected to double once more this year. Also, Facebook and Reliance, both having more than a hundred million users in India, are not small entities trying out a novel practice here. In this context, it will all boil down to what India’s official position is on this. The telecom regulator’s much-awaited consultation paper will make that amply clear.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-internets-tempting-presence/article6892686.ece
16,2,2015,AAP’s day in the sun,"Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has clearly indicated that he is a man in a hurry. Even before assuming office on Saturday, he had placed before Prime Minister Narendra Modi his government’s priorities. His tenor was conciliatory, his arguments seemingly reasonable while he took care not to include in his Ministry controversial Ministers from his first tenure. In his inaugural speech as Chief Minister, Mr. Kejriwal said he impressed on Mr. Modi the point that Delhi would not prosper without “constructive cooperation” between the Centre and the State. The unstated part of Mr. Kejriwal’s message was that he intended to set the agenda for Delhi. Yet the AAP’s demand for full statehood — that, if accepted, would give the Delhi government control over two critical areas of governance, land and the police — will be contentious, not least because the Centre would be loath to give more powers — and greater independence of action — to the new AAP regime. Mr. Kejriwal has already broached the subject with Mr. Modi, who has been non-committal. This is an issue that has larger dimensions, and it remains to be seen how it unfolds in the dynamics of relations between the AAP and the Modi government.
Having come to power primarily on an anti-corruption plank, Mr. Kejriwal’s first goal will be to enact the controversial Lokpal Bill. The failure to clear it in his first stint in office had made him take the ill-judged step to quit. Now, with 67 MLAs in a 70-seat Assembly, Mr. Kejriwal should have no problem pushing it through but, after that, it will require ratification by the Centre. How that turns out depends on the BJP’s disposition. The last time, the 32 BJP MLAs in the Delhi Assembly had opposed the Bill. While senior AAP leaders have indicated that the party has learnt from its first innings in power that a path of confrontation has its limits, the likelihood of flashpoints in the coming months cannot be ruled out as the tussle for the control of Delhi continues. In governance terms, what can Mr. Kejriwal do without getting full statehood? He may be able to reduce electricity and water tariffs, but will remain dependent on neighbouring States and the Centre for supply. He may also be able to fulfil his promises on education if funds are forthcoming, and certainly he can make a difference in reducing everyday corruption. Going forward, with the heightened public expectations of the AAP as the party of the common person, Mr. Kejriwal must demonstrate that his is a government with a difference. He should take transparent steps to unveil a governance structure emphasising accountability and accessibility. That is the real hope that the AAP embodies to thousands of its well-wishers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-aaps-day-in-the-sun/article6898852.ece
16,2,2015,Prospects for peace,"Doubts over the durability of peace in Ukraine despite the ceasefire that formally came into effect on Sunday, represent a dangerous augury in the months-long, bloody and bitter conflict between government and separatist rebel forces. Prospects of any swift cessation of hostilities were thrown into jeopardy after differences surfaced even as the deal was being drawn up, with some players advocating an immediate suspension of violence and others insisting upon some preparatory delay. During the run-up to Sunday, the objective of the opposing forces seems to have been to consolidate their respective positions. The sea coast near Mariupol and the city of Debaltseve, which are in Ukrainian control, are said to be critical for the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. Thus, uncertainty seems to have been written into the accord brokered last week by the leaders of France and Germany with their Russian and Ukrainian counterparts. The current developments remind you of how the September 2014 ceasefire fell apart almost as soon as it was agreed upon, leading to a further escalation in the crisis that has now claimed more than 5,000 lives and led to the displacement of a million people.
The fluid situation on the ground is bound to strengthen the Congressional hawks, who have been urging Washington to rethink the current provision of non-lethal aid in favour of backing Kiev with arms. Conversely, the conservative and social democratic partners in Germany’s ruling grand coalition, with French President Francois Hollande, have been almost categorical in their opposition to any military solution to the crisis in Europe’s eastern flanks. The German Chancellor, in fact, made an analogous reference to the erection of the Berlin Wall as she elaborated on Europe’s position on Ukraine at the annual Munich security conference the previous weekend. Angela Merkel pointed out that the western powers did not resort to force to counter the action. Republican Senator John McCain’s allusion, in his speech at the same conference, to the response of the western powers to the Berlin blockade provided shades of the American stance. An unequivocal commitment to finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict is imperative, given the interdependence between Europe and Russia in the areas of economic and energy cooperation. The conflagration in Ukraine also demonstrates that the prospects for peace over the long term depend in no small measure on containing nationalist tendencies in the states of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). In this context, the continued expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) into Russia’s neighbourhood about 25 years after the end of the Cold War, could prove counterproductive.
Corrections and Clarifications:
A clarification: The Editorial refers to the leaders of Russia and Ukraine as counterparts of the French and the German leaders in the sense that all the four personalities in question are heads of their respective governments. As Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Angela Merkel is head of the government in the same way that President Vladimir Putin of the Russian Federation, President Francois Hollande of the Republic of France and President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine are all heads of government of their respective countries.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-prospects-for-peace/article6898853.ece
17,2,2015,Weakening the JD (U) in Bihar,"Whether or not Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi wins the battle against former mentor Nitish Kumar, he is ensuring his opponents will have a political cost to bear for seeking to unseat him. Mr. Manjhi, who was chosen to succeed Mr. Kumar after their party, the Janata Dal (United), suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Bharatiya Janata Party in the Lok Sabha election last year, is now wooing both JD (U) members of the Assembly and the BJP leadership in an attempt to stay on in power. In order to win over some of the MLAs, the Chief Minister is keen on a Cabinet expansion before the trust vote. But given that the vote is only a few days away, and the majority of Mr. Manjhi is in serious question, Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi would be well-advised not to accede to Mr. Manjhi’s request. Neither the demands of governance nor political propriety require a Cabinet expansion at this stage. Whatever Mr. Manjhi’s explanations, ministerial berths cannot be blatantly on offer in exchange for political support. Indeed, allowing a Cabinet expansion at this stage will put a question mark on the propriety of the Governor’s decision to give Mr. Manjhi time till February 20 to prove his majority.
For the BJP, the only incentive for supporting Mr. Manjhi is the prospect of an early election. The incumbent Chief Minister, who has been busy trying to carve out his own political constituency among Dalits and the poorer and weaker sections of Bihar, is also working on longer-term plans. After offering free power to farmers with agricultural land up to five acres, he held out the promise of extending it to farmers who own up to ten acres if he got another chance at power. By refusing to resign at the prodding of his party leadership, and offering sops to farmers and teachers, Mr. Manjhi is eyeing Mr. Kumar’s support base. Already Mr. Kumar has been deliberately cast in a bad light by his successor, with hints that the JD (U) leader is restless and unwilling to wait till the next election to return to the chief ministerial helm. Mr. Kumar’s plan to resign as Chief Minister to own responsibility for the party’s electoral defeat appears to have done him more harm than good. In the popular perception the resignation might have a taint of insincerity, however unintended in the initial gesture. Instead of edging out the BJP in the manner of Odisha Chief Minister and Biju Janata Dal leader Naveen Patnaik, Mr. Kumar appears to have left the field wide open to the BJP to gain dominance even as other formations could take the JD (U)’s place in political contestation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-weakening-the-jd-u-in-bihar/article6902379.ece
17,2,2015,The menace of plastic waste,"If there is one type of municipal solid waste that has become ubiquitous in India and most developing countries, and largely seen along the shores and waterways of many developed countries, it is plastic waste. Much of it is not recycled, and ends up in landfills or as litter on land, in waterways and the ocean. For the first time, researchers have estimated the amount of plastic that makes its way into the oceans. While the estimate of eight million tonnes of plastic being dumped into the oceans by 192 coastal countries in 2010 may appear staggeringly high, in reality the quantity would be many times more. Besides estimating the total quantity, a paper published recently in the journal Science has identified the top 20 countries that have dumped the most plastic waste into the oceans. At twelfth position, India is one of the worst performers. It has dumped up to 0.24 million tonnes of plastic into the ocean every year; the amount of mismanaged plastic waste per year is 0.6 million tonnes. In the case of China, the No. 1 polluter, the coastal population sends up to 3.53 million tonnes of plastic waste into the oceans each year. Besides the 11 Asian and South East Asian countries, the U.S. figures in the list.
A study published in December 2014 estimated the quantity of plastic floating in the ocean at nearly 270,000 tonnes. This is but a fraction of the total that finds its way into the oceans. Other studies suggest that the surface of the water is not its final resting place. Alarmingly, an unknown quantity of degraded plastic in the form of particles enters the food chain. Besides affecting marine life, plastic that gets into the food chain has serious health implications for humans. With the latest study estimating that the annual input into the oceans is set to double by 2025, there is an urgent need to tackle the problem. A two-pronged approach has to be adopted by the worst polluters to reduce per capita plastic waste generation and cut the amount of mismanaged waste by employing better waste management practices. Recycling is the best available way to tackle the waste, though it is not the ideal solution. India, which hardly recycles plastic waste, has its task cut out. It dumps a huge quantity into the ocean although it generates a relatively small amount of this waste per person — 3 per cent of 0.34 kg per person a day of all solid waste generated. The huge population offsets the advantage of low plastic consumption in the country. Cutting down on the use of plastic should also begin in earnest, and the first item that has to be targeted is the single-use plastic bag. The Union government recently refused to ban the manufacture of single-use plastic bags; the least it could do to reduce consumption is to make such bags expensive, employing the same rationale that has been applied for tobacco products that are taxed heavily to reduce consumption.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-the-menace-of-plastic-waste/article6902381.ece
18,2,2015,New thrust in India-Sri Lanka ties,"Relations between India and Sri Lanka have not just been reinforced during the visit of President Maithripala Sirisena but have also gained new direction and momentum. As Sri Lanka’s closest neighbour that has ethnic links to its most significant minority, India is a huge influence in the island nation’s political, economic, social and cultural consciousness, and its world view. President Sirisena was hewing to a long and unbroken tradition of newly elected leaders making New Delhi the first port of call for foreign visits. But in a departure from the routine nature of such visits, both sides signed four substantive agreements. Of these, the agreement on Co-operation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy was the most significant as it imparts a new strategic element to bilateral relations. Since 2010, Sri Lanka has wanted to utilise nuclear energy in industrial applications as well as in fields such as medicine and agriculture. Two years ago, Colombo had indicated it was exploring such an agreement with Islamabad, with which too it has a warm bilateral relationship. Its decision to move ahead on this front with India shows the maturity of the new Sri Lankan leadership and the importance it attaches to its relations with New Delhi. The agreement envisages “exchange of knowledge and expertise, sharing of resources, capacity building and training of personnel in peaceful uses of nuclear energy”. Two years ago, Sri Lanka had also expressed safety concerns arising from the geographical proximity of the Kudankulam nuclear reactors. That the signatory to the agreement on the Sri Lankan side was Power and Energy Minister Champika Ranawaka who had voiced the concerns, shows that Colombo is now sufficiently reassured.
The two sides have also agreed to enhance their defence and security cooperation in the existing trilateral format with the Maldives. New Delhi should press any security concern it may have, such as that which arose with the docking of a Chinese submarine in the Colombo harbour, without dictating Sri Lanka’s choice of friends and allies. The travails of fishermen on both sides of the Palk Bay received attention with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Sirisena pledging to resolve them in a “constructive and humanitarian” way. Sensibly, fishermen’s associations on both sides are to continue talks begun two years ago to find their own solution. There were no public statements on the Tamil question during the President’s visit. Nevertheless, this remains top of the agenda in bilateral relations. New Delhi must encourage Sri Lanka’s new leadership to be determined in addressing the issues of ethnic reconciliation and power-sharing with Tamils.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-new-thrust-in-indiasri-lanka-ties/article6905808.ece
18,2,2015,Egypt strikes back,"Egypt seems to have set its foot deep into the Islamic State (IS) quicksand. Since Monday, the Egyptian military has been carrying out raids on IS camps and weapon storage areas in northeast Libya. These attacks were in response to the brutal beheading of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians kidnapped by militants claiming allegiance to IS. The tragic fact, by now obvious, is that Egypt’s military strikes are only a very partial solution to a continuously expanding IS threat. To make matters worse, these air strikes on Libyan soil would be seen as an assault on Libya’s sovereignty. About seven civilians, including four children, have been killed in these air strikes, which have damaged several residential areas in the city of Derna. Having a relatively stable base in Syria and Iraq, IS is now gradually carving out its presence in Libya. Libya has been in a political vacuum since the 2011 uprising which led to the overthrow of Muammar Qadhafi. The revolution has since been undermined by political factions and rebels struggling for power. Egypt’s attack on Libyan soil will only add to the existing lawlessness of that state, giving IS a better opportunity to dig in and strengthen its presence there.
Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has been leading an internal battle against political-religious groups, especially the Muslim Brotherhood, his largest opposition. But Mr. Sisi’s error lies in declaring the Brotherhood a terrorist group and equating it with more violent ones such as IS and al-Qaeda. His crackdown may even lead some local groups to pledge allegiance to the IS in order to resist Mr. Sisi. This is in fact a strategy that IS has been deploying to destabilise other states as well. Jordan, for instance, was similarly provoked recently into a military strike following hostage beheadings, magnified by IS’s use of carefully crafted visuals in the media. But King Abdullah’s commitment to “fight back” against IS was not echoed by Jordanian public opinion. To be clear, IS ultimately aims for greater territorial sovereignty and a Caliphate, maintaining a top-down model of power. But it is still through affiliations and decentralised networks with local groups, spread from Yemen to Libya and parts of Africa, that IS is attempting to gain political legitimacy. The recent “lone wolf” terror attacks in Sydney, Paris, Copenhagen and so on are also instances of groups having ideological affiliations to the IS brand. It is this decentralised and spectral nature of the enemy that may frustrate Egypt’s military strikes as well. But the crucial difference between IS and all the previous Jihadist groups is that IS will hope to exploit these decentralised networks to eventually strengthen its territorial, sovereign political order.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-egypt-strikes-back/article6905809.ece
19,2,2015,Secularism is not a policy option,"In speaking up against violence and incitement of hatred on the basis of religion, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was seeking to correct a growing perception that his government passively encouraged Hindutva groups that indulged in physical and verbal attacks on religious minorities in the country. Although the Prime Minister carefully avoided making a distinction between ‘majority’ and ‘minority’ religious groups while promising action against those inciting hatred, there was little doubt that he was making an effort to reassure religious minorities in the face of provocation from Hindutva groups. Indeed, the venue and the event where he spoke provided the context for the speech: a meeting organised by the Catholic Syro-Malabar Church in New Delhi, where churches have come under attack in recent weeks. But the assurance as such does not amount to much. Until now, Mr. Modi had appeared reluctant to publicly reprimand or rein in Ministers and Members of Parliament belonging to his party when they crossed the lines of political propriety with provocative speeches against religious minorities. If his words are not followed up by action, and if he continues to allow his Ministers and party colleagues to incite communal hatred, the assurance would be bereft of all meaning. In the last few months, the Modi government had been sending out confusing signals. While those at the top in the government were careful and correct in their speeches, those in the middle and lower rungs tested the limits of law and propriety with virulent remarks. As a party, the Bharatiya Janata Party looked as if it was torn between its role as a politically responsible ruling party, and its need to cater to its core Hindutva constituency.
Contrary to what many in the BJP seem to think, secularism is not a policy option for a government, but one of the original principles that inform the Constitution. ‘Secular’, as a word to describe the Indian Republic, might have been added to the Preamble only in 1976, but the freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion under Article 25 is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution. Protecting the right of all persons to freedom of religion is the constitutional duty of the government of the day. Indeed, freedom of religion is integral to any democratic society, and India, by definition, cannot remain a democracy without allowing its citizens the freedom to practise a religion of their choice. A government that cannot ensure the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution equally to all its citizens will quickly lose its political legitimacy and representative character. Certainly, Mr. Modi would not want his government to hurtle down that path.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-secularism-is-not-a-policy-option/article6909602.ece
19,2,2015,Marching to its own beat,"That the Indian Premier League (IPL) is a self-contained world, with an internal logic all its own, was abundantly clear from Monday’s player auction. Unlike 2014, this wasn’t a year for overhauls. With the exception of Delhi Daredevils, which had Rs.39.75 crore to spare after releasing 13 players, most teams were looking to fix holes, not build from scratch. And yet — for all the talk of it being a muted affair, in the shadow of the World Cup, without the bombast of some of the earlier auctions — the event was evidence that the IPL marches to its own beat. Two of the best batsmen in the world — Sri Lanka’s Kumar Sangakkara, the maker of more than 27,000 international runs, and South Africa’s Hashim Amla, the quickest to 2000, 3000, 4000 and 5000 One-Day international runs — went unsold. New Zealand’s Kane Williamson, who cannot stop scoring at the moment, attracted a mere Rs.60 lakh. But K.C. Cariappa, an untested mystery spinner yet to play a first-class match, commanded Rs.2.40 crore. And Yuvraj Singh, not deemed good enough for a spot in the Indian team for the World Cup, fetched Rs.16 crore, becoming the biggest buy for the second year running.
The cases of Yuvraj and Cariappa offer an insight into both the dynamics of the auction and what the IPL has become. Daredevils saw the appeal of Yuvraj’s all-round skills; his form in the Ranji Trophy suggested he wasn’t a spent force. There was also a desire, as one team official put it, for “an iconic player who will also make us attractive to brands”. The unique mixture of commerce and cricket that Yuvraj still offered was compelling. And so Royal Challengers Bangalore, which had released Yuvraj to buy him back at a lower price, found itself in a bidding war. Once the price escalated, the team with the bigger purse — Daredevils — had the last word. But the Delhi franchise didn’t have its way when Cariappa’s name came up. For, Kolkata Knight Riders’s need for a spinner with the element of surprise was more pressing. With its star slow-bowler Sunil Narine under scrutiny after being reported for a ‘suspect action’ last September, the franchise, as CEO Venky Mysore said, was willing to “take a punt”. It was a revealing line: there is something of a gamble in most choices, a hope that the player eventually justifies the money. But this is not to say decisions are not well-considered. Rajasthan Royals has built a reputation for unearthing value nobody else divines and did just that while Chennai Super Kings, which has put its stock in continuity, recalled Michael Hussey. That both teams remain under a cloud in the outside world, but went about their business as usual in the auction, was merely more proof of the IPL’s success at creating an alternate reality.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-marching-to-its-own-beat/article6909601.ece
20,2,2015,Maximum City,"Shiv Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray has given a new spin to the term SEZ. His proposal to make Mumbai truly the Maximum City and open up select non-residential areas for a vibrant nightlife has been welcomed widely in Mumbai, especially by the young. He wants business districts such as Kala Ghoda, Nariman Point and the Marine Drive promenade in South Mumbai, and the Bandra Kurla Complex and the Carter Road promenade in the western suburbs to come alive at night. Flame-throwers, jugglers, live music without speakers, and open-air cafes on Queen’s Necklace are alluring sights for the young. The proposal now includes the conversion of malls and mill-malls, a phenomenon unique to Mumbai, into Special Entertainment Zones (SEZ). The malls have private security, and large parking spaces that can accommodate heavy footfalls. Clearly, the idea has the potential to boost the night economy of Mumbai, generating mass employment, opening up a new stream of revenue for hoteliers, big malls deprived of footfalls till the weekend and even night taxi-drivers. The government can rake in much-needed revenues as tourism would inevitably get a shot in the arm.
Devendra Fadnavis, one of the youngest to become Maharashtra’s Chief Minister, has accepted in principle the idea of creating designated night zones which can be open 24 x 7. But, this idea requires deeper debate on whether the city’s already stretched infrastructure can seamlessly absorb the additional burden — of adequate security arrangements, especially for the safety of women, increased means of public transportation, enhanced street lighting and additional power, traffic chaos, and the prospect of noise pollution. To make this a demonstrable reality, two laws that govern Mumbai need to be amended — the Bombay Shops and Establishments Act, 1948, which mandates that employees at eateries should not work after 12.30 a.m., and the Bombay Police Act, 1951, which provides for establishments to be shut by 1.30 a.m. With the budget session of the Maharashtra legislature days away, these amendments could be passed during the monsoon session in July-August. However, it is natural for a city, scarred by five major terror attacks since 1993, a series of shocking drunk driving cases (523 on New Year’s-eve 2015), brutal gang rapes at dusk, and incidents of molestations in crowded venues, to approach this issue gingerly and cautiously. Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria’s clearance to the proposal has boosted the chances of the idea turning into a reality. The challenge for the City that Never Sleeps is to ensure that the dream of a Maximum City with high energy levels is a fulfilling prospect for its citizens.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-maximum-city/article6913536.ece
20,2,2015,Political boost in challenging times,"Ruling parties tend to have an advantage in by-elections, but even so the victories of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in Srirangam in Tamil Nadu and of the Trinamool Congress in Bongaon and Krishnaganj in West Bengal are stunningly spectacular. For both AIADMK general secretary Jayalalithaa and Trinamool chairperson Mamata Banerjee, the success in the by-elections came in challenging circumstances. Ms. Jayalalithaa, who was disqualified as a member of the Assembly on being convicted by a special court in a corruption case, saw in her party’s decimation of the opposition in Srirangam the strength to defeat the “conspiracies” hatched by political opponents. A setback in Srirangam would have boosted the morale of the opposition in Tamil Nadu, and given rise to claims that the people had lost faith in Ms. Jayalalithaa after her conviction. That the AIADMK candidate, S. Valarmathi, bettered Ms. Jayalalithaa’s victory margin in the previous election was itself a sign that nothing had changed politically in Tamil Nadu in the months after the trial court judgment against her. In the Lok Sabha election last year, the AIADMK, contesting without alliances, had won 37 of the 39 seats in the State. That the legal obstacles have not lowered her stature in the eyes of the voters must have been comforting for Ms. Jayalalithaa, who is trying to get her conviction overturned before the end of the current term of the Assembly in 2016. The opposition parties are even more divided now than they were at the time of the Lok Sabha election, and the AIADMK’s biggest challenge comes not from its political rivals but from the legal cases against her.
Like Ms. Jayalalithaa, Ms. Banerjee is also fighting her way through scams. Several senior Trinamool leaders are under investigation for their role in the Saradha chit fund scam, and Ms. Banerjee is backing them to the utmost politically. Again like Ms. Jayalalithaa, Ms. Banerjee spoke of people having replied to “conspiracies” hatched by the opposition. With the Left parties in disarray in West Bengal, Ms. Banerjee is concentrating her political attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party, accusing its government at the Centre of using the Central Bureau of Investigation for political ends. But while legal setbacks can hurt politically, political victories cannot help with the legal battles in criminal cases. Ms. Jayalalithaa and Ms. Banerjee would have to meet the legal challenges separately. With a little more than a year to go before Tamil Nadu and West Bengal go to the polls, both Ms. Jayalalithaa and Ms. Banerjee are on a good political wicket. That their main worries relate to courts and cases, is a telling commentary on their political supremacy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-political-boost-in-challenging-times/article6913537.ece
21,2,2015,Dealing with broken marriages,"Shelving the decision to allow an amendment of the marriage laws to include ‘irretrievable breakdown’ as an additional ground for seeking divorce will be a regrettable step. This progressive amendment, conceived mainly on the recommendation of the Law Commission and on the strength of suggestions from the Supreme Court in a number of cases based on the experience of administering divorce laws, would help expedite what has always been a difficult and painful process. The draft has already been fine-tuned to protect the interests of women and children affected by divorce. When the amendment was initially introduced in 2010, it sought to waive the waiting or cooling-off period of six months before considering a motion for divorce by mutual consent, but a parliamentary committee found this unnecessary. Secondly, the panel wanted better safeguards for women’s property rights and also desired that the clause protecting the interests of children born during the marriage be extended to adopted children too. Subsequently, the draft was changed to the effect that the waiting period could only be reduced by the court under some conditions. If there was any evidence that it would cause financial hardship to the wife, the court cannot grant divorce without making arrangements for compensation, including a share in property, to her. Financial arrangements should be made for the maintenance of children, including adopted children and unmarried or widowed daughters with no means of financial support. The amendment was passed in the Rajya Sabha in 2013, but not in the Lok Sabha.
A common argument from those opposing the present amendment is that the provision for divorce by mutual consent adequately covers the situation of a marriage lapsing into dysfunction. Groups purporting to protect the ‘rights of men’ also argue that a woman could enter into a sham marriage and later walk away with the husband’s property by getting it annulled at will. Some make extreme claims that it could destroy the institution of marriage and even encourage live-in relationships. Such scenarios should not be used as a pretext to stymie well-intentioned amendments that seek to break matrimonial deadlocks by recognising breakdown as a judicially sound reason. In fact, the Law Commission and the Supreme Court suggested that irretrievable breakdown be added as a ground only to put an end to the ‘fault theory’ as the basis for annulment. Giving up this legislative change to the Hindu Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act will be an unwarranted concession to moral conservatism. The government would do well not to abandon the long-overdue amendment that will take jurisprudence forward, strengthening as it does individual rights.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-dealing-with-broken-marriages/article6917333.ece
21,2,2015,A thoughtful Obama,"If taken at face value, President Barack Obama’s closing address to the Summit on Countering Violent Extremism could signal a repositioning of the official White House line on the war against global terrorism. The President’s speech was a carefully calibrated response to the recent wave of attacks by militants from the Islamic State (IS) in those countries that are part of the U.S.-led war in Syria and Iraq. Rather than the shrill notes of threat and retribution that usually attend U.S. policy rhetoric on the global war on terror, what the Summit heard from Mr. Obama were thoughtful insights into the human rights origins of terrorism. Speaking to a gathering of Ministers from nearly 70 countries, the UN Secretary-General and other senior officials, Mr. Obama made two significant points. First, he made an exceptionally strong plea to cut through the terrorist narrative based on “twisted interpretations of Islam” that allows groups like IS to act in the name of Islam. Secondly, he directed the attention of his audience to the need to transform the environments of economic impoverishment in which young people, trapped without education or any avenues of advancement, turn rich pickings for terrorist recruiters. “So if we’re serious about countering violent extremism, we have to get serious about confronting these economic grievances,” he declared.
While Mr. Obama deserves credit for outlining a nuanced view of the social origins of terrorism, and a more humane, long-term and inclusive approach to a possible solution to extremism, it would be unrealistic to expect a radical shift in U.S. policy towards this phenomenon. Despite the softer rhetoric, the Obama administration’s response has been far sharper and intensive than what was viewed as the heavy-handedness of his predecessor in office in conducting its global war against terror. Across Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia, the Obama administration launched more than 390 drone strikes in its first five years. This is eight times as many as were launched during the entire George W. Bush presidency. The bombing of IS bases by the U.S.-led coalition of nations in Syria and Iraq is part of the continuum of war set by the invasion of Iraq by the same forces in 2003. Fighting them today is a deadly and ruthless war machine operated by religious extremists. IS is a deadly menace to the civilised world, with its acts of public brutality designed to radiate terror. While the U.S. and its allies are compelled to root out this sinister challenge, the imperative is for the global community to move ahead on issues such as Palestine which could conceivably lend more moral force to anti-IS operations in the Middle East.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-a-thoughtful-obama/article6917334.ece
23,2,2015,The return of Nitish,"With Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar being sworn in Chief Minister of Bihar, a phase of political uncertainty has come to an end in the State. But his return to power also kicks off another phase of political realignment in the run-up to State Assembly elections due before October. The political churn is likely to be more intense than what has just been witnessed, and that ended with the resignation of Jitan Ram Manjhi who had earlier refused to step down in favour of Mr. Kumar, who had won the 2010 popular mandate. Mr. Manjhi had hoped for more active support from the Bharatiya Janata Party to split the JD (U), without which he could not have sustained his claim to remain in power. But the BJP limited its support to merely pledging the votes of its own MLAs to him.
The three strands in the drama that just concluded, namely Mr. Manjhi’s defiance of his one-time mentor Mr. Kumar, the BJP’s eagerness to goad Mr. Manjhi on, and Mr. Kumar’s insistence on reclaiming the chair he had abdicated in 2014 ostensibly as a matter of principle, hold out the factors that will play out in the coming weeks. Mr. Manjhi, opportunistic as he was, also represents the ambition of the Dalits, who have not yet emerged as a class in themselves in Bihar, unlike in the neighbouring State of Uttar Pradesh. If the appointment of Mr. Manjhi, a Mahadalit, as Chief Minister was in furtherance of Mr. Nitish Kumar’s politics at the time, his rebellion was an inevitable outcome of the same politics. The BJP finds an opportunity here, as the empowered Dalits may not play second fiddle to backward caste leaders and may look for greener pastures. The BJP will, therefore, try to attract Dalits, as it successfully did in Maharashtra and Haryana in Assembly elections in 2014. Mr. Manjhi’s role in the BJP’s scheme of reaching out to Dalits is yet to evolve, but his outbursts against Mr. Kumar will certainly help the BJP’s Hindutva politics. The BJP, which was a junior partner to the JD (U) in Bihar until the 2010 Assembly elections, will lead an alliance of smaller parties this year and will have more than a hundred Assembly seats to offer to aspirants. That makes Mr. Kumar’s task of keeping together his flock, comprising backwards, Dalits and Muslims, an uphill task. By allying with Mr. Lalu Prasad, Mr. Kumar has laid the foundation for building a social coalition of the backwards, which is an attempt to revive Mandal politics with the support of Muslims, as a bulwark against the BJP’s Hinduvta push. It is clear that Bihar in the coming weeks will witness an intense battle between Hindutva and Mandal.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-return-of-nitish/article6922441.ece
23,2,2015,The cost of negligence,"The failure of successive governments in India, especially those in States that have the highest mortality rates among children younger than five years, to address the critical issue of training health-care providers in rural areas to correctly diagnose and treat children suffering from diarrhoea and pneumonia, has had tragic consequences. These ailments account for the maximum number of under-5 mortality incidence in the country. That the poor management of sick children by health care providers is a major causal factor for under-5 mortality has been brought out by a study carried out in rural Bihar. As other studies have shown, what is true for Bihar will be largely valid for other States as well. That the 340 health-care providers studied seldom practised what little they knew about treating children suffering from the two health complications is a poignant reminder of the state of the health-care system in rural India. Only 3.5 per cent of the practitioners prescribed the correct treatment using life-saving oral rehydration salts (ORS) alone for children with simple, uncomplicated diarrhoea. Instead, nearly 69 per cent of them prescribed potentially dangerous drugs, including antibiotics, along with ORS; an equal percentage of them prescribed drugs without any ORS. The record was only slightly better in the case of pneumonia. The quality of diagnosis also left much to be desired.
These findings explain why Bihar has the country’s highest infant mortality rate of 55 per 1,000 live births. In 2010, the under-5 mortality in India from diarrhoea and pneumonia was over 600,000, the highest in the world in terms of absolute numbers. In the same year, India was one of the five countries that accounted for nearly 50 per cent of the deaths globally from diarrhoea and pneumonia in this age group. Hence, it is hard to fathom why India did next to nothing to train and equip health-care providers to diagnose and treat children. Bangladesh has not seen any drop in the incidence of acute diarrhoeal disease, but has reduced its under-5 mortality rate by 75 per cent between 1980 and 2011, largely by reducing mortality from the two diseases by means of better case management even in rural areas. In 2006-2007, as much as 76 per cent of children with diarrhoea in rural Bangladesh received ORS, a 2013 paper in The Lancet says. India has indeed done well in reducing under-5 mortality numbers from 2.5 million in 2001 to 1.5 million in 2011. But with only 10 months left to achieve the critical Millennium Development Goal No. 4 of 38 deaths per 1,000 live births among children under five, India can ill-afford to continue with its indifferent attitude to health care in rural areas.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-cost-of-negligence/article6922442.ece
24,2,2015,More like a flood than a leak,"It is akin to an organised industry. The systematic “pilfering” from the Petroleum Ministry’s office in the heart of New Delhi of documents which were then handed over to “consultants” and interested corporate entities for a price, has revealed a frightening nexus. One account says that a night guard would “steal” the documents while a peon would switch off CCTV cameras to facilitate the alleged acts of corporate espionage, some details of which are now in the public domain. In addition to some low-ranking staff members of the Ministry, two “consultants” and representatives of five top business houses have been arrested by the Delhi Police in the case. Budget inputs, minutes of a Cabinet meeting on disinvestment and detailed documents on the petroleum sector, were among the documents that were allegedly stolen by the ring. The brazen manner in which these were pilfered from Shastri Bhavan in Lutyen’s’ Delhi goes to show that government departments can easily be subverted by vested interests for corporate gains.
This rot might well extend to other ministries and departments. While the facts of the present case will have to be established in a court of law, it is unlikely that company representatives were acting in their personal capacity. If it is proved, the top corporate groups who are alleged to have benefited from the documents that they procured through this organised system of espionage will have much to answer for. It is likely that the Delhi Police crackdown on the ring was triggered by the concern expressed by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval in October 2014 at how “secret” information made its way to the media. Mr. Doval’s letter spoke of the need for firm action to prevent the media from publishing secret documents that impinged on the country’s national security. The NSA pointed out in his letter, which was published in the media, that leaks often emanated from government departments. While a distinction must be made between this kind of pilferage and documents being leaked to the media in the public interest by whistleblowers, corporate espionage must be dealt with in a strong manner. Public interest journalism and corporate theft of government information cannot be weighed on the same scale. In a statement, the Aam Aadmi Party pointed out that the actual beneficiaries were still to be identified by the police. The party hoped that the culprits “who subverted the system to get undue benefits will be booked and interrogated in custody”. The Modi government must be commended for the actions taken by the Delhi Police. But it will be closely watched, on whether or not this investigation is taken to its logical conclusion. For far too long, the big fish have escaped criminal justice.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/more-like-a-flood-than-a-leak/article6925968.ece
24,2,2015,India on a roll,"Ardent fans of Indian cricket would have given a lot in exchange for the team’s current position in the World Cup. With commanding victories over Pakistan and South Africa — on paper, India’s toughest opponents in the league stage — M.S. Dhoni’s men seem likely to top Pool B and secure a quarterfinal against one of the lesser lights of Pool A. Of course, nothing in sport is so straightforward; plenty can happen over the next month to change things significantly. But the wonder of it all is that such a state currently exists. For, having spent two-and-a-half months in Australia without a win, India’s credentials were buried under the debris of defeat and despair. Not too many knew that India had an ODI win-loss record second only to Australia since the 2013 Champions Trophy; and only a few assigned any significance to the fact that having won that very competition in England and Wales and the World Cup in 2011, India was the only side in the last four years that knew what it took to triumph in a big tournament in this format of the game. There were entirely justified questions about whether India could summon its best in Australia and New Zealand, where conditions demand considerable adaptation. But after two sensational Sundays, the team is no longer a dark horse; it has now been installed as one of the favourites.
Typical of Dhoni-led sides, India has done it in a manner that defies easy explanation. Both in the previous World Cup and the Champions Trophy, the team didn’t so much repair flaws as transcend them: the lift in the fielding standards of a largely unathletic side during the 2011 final was inexplicable, as was the dramatic refinement in batting against the moving ball in 2013. Against both Pakistan and South Africa over the last nine days, India was nothing like the side that had struggled in Australia in the preceding months. The batting was patient and calculated, with bursts of explosive hitting; although some momentum was lost towards the end, the totals put on the board were excellent big-match scores. Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli shook off their poor tri-series form. Suresh Raina proved again that pressure brings out his best, while Ajinkya Rahane confirmed the impression that he is unobtrusively becoming exceptional. Most striking of all was the turnaround in bowling, written off as a liability before the World Cup. Seamers Mohammed Shami and Mohit Sharma and off-spinner R. Ashwin found ways of defending and attacking without giving as much away as they had in the recent past. The intensity in the field rose, enhancing the bowlers’ efforts. India still isn’t the best team in the event, but its rivals know that on big days few sides handle the occasion better.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/india-on-a-roll/article6925969.ece
25,2,2015,The return of Father Alexis,"The details of how exactly India secured the release of Father Alexis Prem Kumar remain unclear. From the little that has emerged, the Afghan authorities had managed to establish contact with the priest’s kidnappers within days of his abduction in the Herat province where he was working as part of the Jesuit Refugee Service, an international Catholic advocacy group for forcibly displaced people. The priest was the country director of the group, and at the time he was seized, in the first week of June 2014, he was visiting a school run by the JRS in the western Afghanistan province, where a month earlier, the Taliban had mounted an attack on the Indian consulate. Considering that the missionary spent eight months in captivity, there might have been protracted, even on and off, negotiations that led to his release. Publicly, no ransom demands were made nor other conditions laid down by the abductors for handing over the 47-year-old priest from Tamil Nadu, but it is not unknown for militant groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan to have taken hostages and demanded money for their release. Though the Taliban have targeted and killed many Indians in Afghanistan, it has been suggested that the priest’s abductors may have been one of the many splinter militant groups that operate in the Afghan countryside. It is conceivable too that Iran on the other side of Herat’s border and with not a little influence among some groups in Afghanistan may have played a role in obtaining the release. All that can be said with certainty is that a combination of India’s contacts in Afghanistan, diplomacy and patience won the day. New Delhi was clearly involved at the highest levels.
The safe return of Father Alexis from what must have been a traumatic eight months for him, his family and his community is a cause for celebration and relief, so too that he appears unharmed, at least outwardly. Less than two years ago, an Indian was killed in Paktika province, and in 2010, six Indian workers were killed in a targeted attack in Kabul. Away from Afghanistan, the fate of 40 Indians captured by Islamic State (IS) remains unknown. Father Alexis’s return has highlighted that Afghanistan remains dangerous territory, and that New Delhi needs to be ever mindful of the safety of the 3,000 or so Indians working there on infrastructure projects, especially as India’s involvement in these projects is a matter of strategic choice. With the departure of the United States' and other international troops from Afghanistan ongoing, India’s role in Afghanistan is bound to come under greater strain and scrutiny than before. It is now up to the Indian government to ensure that civilians do not become the collateral casualties of the Great Game in the neighbourhood.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-return-of-father-alexis/article6929820.ece
25,2,2015,Rahul on leave,"Rahul Gandhi could not have chosen a worse moment for self-introspection, coinciding as it does with a parliamentary budget session. The Bharatiya Janata Party’s humiliating defeat in the recent Delhi Assembly elections, and the unqualified support for the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance’s Land Acquisition Act — that the Modi government diluted in an ordinance and now seeks to transform into an Act of Parliament — provide the perfect setting for the Grand Old Party to take on the role of an effective leader of the opposition in Parliament. And, as Mr. Gandhi was the moving spirit behind the previous UPA government’s Land Acquisition Act, the Congress could have used the legislation’s current cause célèbre status to relaunch its heir apparent. The party had even announced that he would address a public meeting on the issue at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar on February 25. For Mr. Gandhi, therefore, it is not just a case of another missed opportunity: the “leave of absence” he has taken to “reflect on recent events and [the] future course of the party” has left Congress president Sonia Gandhi embarrassed, and the party faithful stunned — and bewildered. So much so that the official explanation that Mr. Gandhi would shortly “return and resume his active participation in the affairs of the Congress” is not being bought entirely even by senior party functionaries — which is also a testimony to the marked lack of transparency within the party.
The speculative explanations proffered by party leaders, however, ranged from the plausible to the bizarre. One, Ms. Gandhi’s coterie was resisting his elevation and opposing the changes he wished to institute in the party. Two, it was a prelude to his exit from politics, as Mr. Gandhi was tired of being the fall guy, including after the recent Delhi polls. Three, he was finally getting married. If there is no evidence for the third explanation, Mr. Gandhi had planned a two-month sabbatical starting in the last week of January, before the Delhi polls — eventually, Ms. Gandhi persuaded him against it. However, the first holds a germ of truth as the Congress is clearly engaged in its own internal politics rather than in a project of revival. But damaging as Mr. Gandhi’s “leave of absence” is for the Congress, it is consistent with his known need for frequent breaks. The Congress has shown no signs yet of demanding an alternative leadership; it can now only hope that Mr. Gandhi returns refreshed for the unveiling of a plan of action at the All India Congress Committee conclave coming up in early April.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rahul-on-leave/article6929821.ece
26,2,2015,Pragmatism over politics,"The nomenclature for the PDP-BJP coalition points to the pragmatism needed on the perilous path the two parties have bravely undertaken in forming a coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir. Their coalition document is called an “Agenda for the Alliance”, not a “common minimum programme”. And the two sides have made it clear that what they are forging is not a “political alliance” but a “governance alliance”. Despite that, their decision to come together is itself a welcome sign that leaders both in the State and the Centre are willing to put aside the extreme rhetoric of the election campaign to build a government that represents the mandate fractured along Jammu-Kashmir-Ladakh lines, and to cater to their constituencies there as one whole.
The road ahead is far from easy. Their interlocutors have been well-advised to outline and face the issues head-on, and that will be the most contentious part. While the BJP’s insistence on a debate on Article 370 has been set aside for now, no one can doubt that it is a core principle for the party. The return of Kashmiri Pandits to the Valley, and the rehabilitation and recognition of refugees from Pakistan, have been rightly termed “humanitarian” issues and will need careful handling. Already we have heard from the Panun Kashmir movement of its opposition to the BJP-PDP alliance. The PDP’s demand for a time-bound revocation of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, too, is a core demand, and the PDP’s agreement to nuance it will not erase the groundswell against the Act in the Valley, even as it seeks to push for its partial withdrawal and, as the Justice Verma Committee recommended in 2013, take crimes such as “sexual violence” out of its purview. It will require a certain amount of statesmanship on the part of Mufti Mohammad Sayeed as Chief Minister not to fall into the trap his predecessors faced, in using all these issues to score points against the Centre. Above all, the part of their common agenda that will demand the greatest amount of statesmanship from the Centre, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in particular, is the process of “engaging all stakeholders” to work on a resolution of the Kashmir issue, in the manner that both his predecessors, A.B. Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh did, by engaging both Pakistan and the Hurriyat separately. Mr. Modi has the benefit of their experiences, as well as their template of the four-step process that has over the past decade shown its potential, whether it was on the Line of Control ceasefire, or on trade and travel across the LoC. The PDP-BJP “Agenda for Alliance” now holds the key to coalitional harmony. It will also be an important pivot to Mr. Modi’s plans for his subcontinental outreach.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pragmatism-over-politics/article6933673.ece
26,2,2015,Empowering the States,"The broad contours of a cooperative federal polity where the Centre and States engage as equal partners in development is now emerging after the government on Tuesday accepted the recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission. The FFC, headed by former RBI Governor Y.V. Reddy, has broken new ground by recommending a move away from scheme and grants-based support to States to a greater devolution of funds from the Centre’s divisible pool of tax revenues. Thus, it has recommended that the Centre share 42 per cent of the divisible pool with the States, which is 10 percentage points higher than what is the case now. By accepting the recommendation despite the fact that it would lead to a sharp drop in its own share of revenues at a time of fiscal pressures, the Centre has sent out an unequivocal signal of its commitment to the principle of ‘cooperative federalism’. The phrase was first mentioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the context of his decision to replace the Planning Commission with the NITI Aayog. Indeed, the FFC’s report, along with the setting up of the NITI Aayog and the consensus on the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax, are important components of the emerging federal landscape where the Centre confers greater freedom and responsibility on the latter by devolving greater resources to them.
Consequent to the higher devolution of funds, the Centre is likely to re-evaluate several schemes that it sponsors for the States. This is a natural consequence as the Centre needs to offset its loss of revenue even as States devise their own spending programmes tailored to their needs. It is a fact that some States have been weighed down by the need to cough up their share of funds for Centrally sponsored schemes even if such schemes are not relevant to their needs. For example, for a State such as Kerala with its high literacy levels, a scheme to promote primary education is not relevant, just as one promoting power generation is not relevant to a power-surplus State such as Gujarat. The key to the success of this experiment in cooperative federalism lies in how well the States use the higher revenues and the accompanying freedom to frame their development priorities. Some of the better-developed States such as Tamil Nadu might feel aggrieved at a reduction in their share of devolved funds, ironically because of their better development metrics relative to other States. But this is federalism at work, because the resources freed up thus go to support another State that might be lagging behind on development parameters and per capita income. What is important is whether the FFC has adopted logical and fair measures while designing the allocations — which it indeed has done.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/empowering-the-states/article6933674.ece
27,2,2015,Towards a modest goal,"No laundry list of new trains to be started. No announcement of new lines to be laid with ambitious targets. No pet projects to be set up in core constituencies of the ruling party. Make no mistake, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu’s maiden budget is not a typical politician’s budget; it shows the deft touches of a professional who knows what it takes to turn around a leviathan’s fortunes that have been on a downhill ride in the last few years. Whether it is the focus on existing high-density corridors where increasing capacity is cheaper and quicker or the new talk of improving “customer experience” or for that matter, the realisation that Railway finances have to be made self-sustainable, Mr. Prabhu has ticked all the right checkboxes. The budget speech reads more like a vision statement than a report on the Railways’ financial and operational performance. The only connection with past budgets is the decision to not increase passenger fares but tinker with freight rates. Mr. Prabhu’s challenge, though, will be in implementing his ambitious agenda, specifically in finding resources, financial and technical, to achieve targets. For example, the Rs.8.56 lakh crore investment plan for the next five years sounds impressive no doubt, but how is the Railways going to fund such a mammoth sum? With operating expenses consuming nine out of every 10 rupees earned by the Railways, there just isn’t enough surplus to plough back into investment.
This is where the Railways needs to think out-of-the-box. Mr. Prabhu has acknowledged the problem and has listed out several options to raise finances, including borrowing from multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and pension funds whose investment horizon would match the long-term plans of the Railways. Clearly, Mr. Prabhu will have to draw heavily on his finance background and expertise to make these work. The Railway Minister’s ambitious agenda comes through in his plans for the coming fiscal too. For instance, electrification of 6,608 route kilometres in 2015-16 compared to 462 km sanctioned in 2014-15, or for that matter, the plan to spend Rs.96,182 crore in doubling/tripling/quadrupling and electrifying 9,400 km of tracks, sound impressive — but execution will be the key. We have seen such ambitious plans in the past falter at the execution stage. The projected improvement in operating ratio, a measure of efficiency, from 91.8 per cent this year to 88.5 per cent in the coming one sounds impressive, but the fine print on expenditure needs to be watched because this ratio is easy to massage. Overall, Mr. Prabhu’s budget is a break from the past in taking a long-term view of the Railways’ future by making it financially independent and operationally efficient. He has five years to reach this destination.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/towards-a-modest-goal/article6937738.ece
27,2,2015,The Oscar accolades,"This year’s Oscars were touted to be a Birdman versus Boyhood race (though Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel, Morten Tyldum’s The Imitation Game and Damien Chazelle’s Whiplash got a rich haul of nominations too), largely because two much-loved art house favourites were up against each other for contrastingly different styles of storytelling. Birdman, a dark comedy on Hollywood, not surprisingly received its most highly regarded honour, named the Best Picture and taking three other Oscars with it. If Boyhood was the framing of a sequence of observational moments from life pieced together over 12 years in a naturalistic, organic, what-you-see-is-what-you-get realistic narrative, Birdman was conceived as a largely single-shot, seamless, open-to-interpretation, layered narrative that is simultaneously real, theatrical and larger than life. Boyhood is a unique portrait of character, the most intimate coming-of-age film ever made. It uses the premise to subtly explore the small little changes that go into the loss of innocence. It is a bittersweet film that has now attained a stronger cult status after its loss to Birdman. Someday, it will officially be seen as a prequel to the filmmaker’s Before Sunrise, Before Sunset and Before Midnight films as the story of a boy who becomes his father, sensitively played by Ethan Hawke.
Birdman is a phenomenal film and its win is an even more significant triumph for comedy as a legitimate high art form and because it marks a return to the basics of filmmaking – seamless storytelling, powerhouse performances, great writing and terrific use of background score – during times when mainstream cinema is moving closer towards visual-effects-aided spectacles celebrating comic books and pornography, as the film suggests. Inarritu made a film that dared to criticise this trend, took an unflinching look at art, commerce, ego, validation, life and death and showed Hollywood a mirror. This was a vision so meticulously crafted and powerfully realised that it was virtually editor-proof ( Birdman understandably did not get a nomination for Best Editing because it was seen as one long continuous shot). The fact that Boyhood, a low-stakes indie experiment done on a part-time basis, emerged as the strongest Oscar contender against one of the most wonderfully crafted, breathlessly beautiful and intellectually rich films of our times is a win by itself, not a mere loss. It is not surprising that the sixty-something Academy voters related more to a man looking back at his life than a boy looking forward to it. The films are not very different, after all. You know there’s a Birdman in Boyhood when the father tells the son: “We’re all just winging it, you know? The good news is you’re feeling stuff.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-oscar-accolades/article6937739.ece
28,2,2015,Optimism on growth,"Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian’s first Economic Survey is notable for three main reasons. First, the overall sense of optimism that it exudes — and justifiably so — on the economy and its prospects in the medium term. Second, the emphasis on fiscal discipline, quality of expenditure and public investment, mainly in the Railways, to give a boost to the economy. And finally, the thrust on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pet schemes of Jan Dhan Yojana and Direct Benefit Transfers as means of eliminating leakages in the subsidy mechanism and ensuring that subsidies reach those who deserve it. Alongside, Mr. Subramanian has also raised a question mark over the new data series on GDP growth announced a couple of weeks ago, pointing out that India is not a ‘tiger economy’ yet as the data would have us believe. India’s is a recovering economy rather than a surging one, the Survey says, pointing out that the numbers seem difficult to reconcile with other developments in the economy. Other major economic data such as on industrial output and trade and agriculture, coupled with anecdotal evidence, point to an economy that is on the mend gradually and not to one that is galloping away on growth. That said, there is little reason to question the Survey’s conclusion that India is now in a sweet spot thanks to a government that has a mandate for reform and a benign external environment that has had a favourable impact on the current account deficit (CAD) and inflation. Indeed, if India does achieve the projected CAD of 1 per cent in 2015-16, that would be in large part due to the falling commodity prices, particularly of crude oil.
The Survey’s projection of a 8.1-8.5 per cent GDP growth in 2015-16 is credible given the present economic environment, though the bets would be more on the lower end of the band. Mr. Subramanian has reiterated his advocacy for public investment to act as a booster dose. And, interestingly, he has picked on the Railways as the “growth locomotive”, arguing that reversing the cycle of underinvestment in the Railways can do wonders to the economy. This ties in with this week’s Railway budget and its emphasis on long-term investment; in fact, it is tempting to conclude that the increase in gross budgetary support to the Railways by a third to about Rs.40,000 crore is evidence of this policy in action. Railways could be to the Narendra Modi government what roads were to the Vajpayee administration. The Survey has clear advice for Finance Minister Arun Jaitley: control expenditure through subsidy reduction, improve the quality of expenditure by spending more on investment and less on consumption and borrowing only for investment. Will Mr. Jaitley act on this in his Budget today?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Optimism-on-growth/article10700087.ece
28,2,2015,Needless provocation,"Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat’s recent comment that the prime motive behind Mother Teresa’s work among the destitute and desperately poor was to convert them to Christianity may have received approbation from BJP members, the Shiv Sena and assorted right-wing Hindu organisations. But the rest of India has responded differently, with people of all faiths — not merely Christians — strongly expressing their objections to what they see as an unwarranted attack on Mother Teresa, a revered figure. This last week, the issue echoed in Parliament, with opposition parties seeking a clarification from the Modi government. Cornered, Parliamentary Affairs Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu said that the government had nothing to do with the RSS. This drew howls of protest from opposition MPs, who pointed out that the ruling party benches were filled with proud swayamsewaks. Indeed, Mr. Bhagwat’s remarks are being widely seen as part of the Sangh Parivar’s efforts to keep alive the controversial project of religious conversions and ghar vapsi (homecoming).
Mother Teresa, who came to India in 1929 as a young nun, became a naturalised Indian citizen and went on to found the Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic religious congregation that in 2012 consisted of over 4,500 sisters and is active in 133 countries. Of course, this is not the first time that she has been the subject of controversy: during her lifetime, she was accused of being a marketing guru who used her celebrity status to attract funds for the Missionaries of Charity from dubious sources. But the fact remains that when this is set against the body of her work — picking up dying leprosy patients off the streets, washing their sores and allowing them a dignified death, for instance — Mr. Bhagwat’s accusations seem trivial. It was this kind of selfless service for the desperately poor, not her ability to convert souls, that made her such an inspirational figure worldwide. In Kolkata, the city in which she did most her work, she remains an icon, its most human face. In 1979, she won the Nobel Peace Prize; a year later, the country that she made her own awarded her India’s highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, the first time someone of foreign origin has thus been honoured. In 2003, she was beatified as “Blessed Teresa of Calcutta”. It would be a pity if an icon so treasured by millions in this country for her service to the needy is trashed just to serve the blatantly partisan agenda of the Sangh Parivar, which often involves a periodic questioning of the national loyalties of minority communities.

29,2,2015,Right by birth: On daughters and Hindu succession act,"The latest decision of the Supreme Court on the right of Hindu daughters to ancestral property corrects an obvious anomaly in the interpretation of a crucial 2005 amendment to the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. The verdict settles the question whether the coparcenary right of daughters comes into effect only if the father through whom they claim that right was alive on the day the amendment came into force. The apex court has now categorically ruled that the daughters’ right flows from their birth and not by any other factor such as the existence of their fathers. In other words, it has rejected the common misinterpretation that only daughters of coparceners who were alive on that day could get an equal share in property. The court has rightly recognised that the amendment conferred equal status as a coparcener on daughters in Hindu families governed by Mitakshara law, and this right accrued by birth. The change came into effect from September 9, 2005, but with a provision that partitions or testamentary disposition that had taken place prior to December 20, 2004 — the date on which the amendment Bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha — will remain valid and unaffected by the change. This led to the interpretation that the daughters’ coparcenary rights, being prospective, would not come into effect unless both the coparcener father and his daughter were alive on September 9, 2005. This position was crystallised in a 2015 judgment of the Supreme Court in Prakash and Others vs. Phulavati. This judgment now stands overruled.
The court’s reasoning is unexceptionable. First, it locates the origin of the coparcenary right in one’s birth. Second, it finds that there is no necessity for a predecessor coparcener to be alive for one to acquire that status, as what is relevant is birth within the degrees of succession to which it extends. In that sense, the legislation, even though it comes into effect on a prescribed date, is retroactive in its application as it is linked to birth, an antecedent event. It also underscores that the legislation makes it clear that the daughter’s rights are the same “as that of a son,” and “as if she had been a son at the time of birth”. The coparcenary status given to daughters has been a subject of reform in many States, particularly in south India, long before the UPA regime brought in the amendment for the whole country. Kerala had introduced legislation in 1975, Andhra Pradesh in 1986, Tamil Nadu in 1989 and Maharashtra and Karnataka in 1994. The legislative aim was that a flagrant discrimination between sons and daughters in entitlement to an equal share in coparcenary property, that is property inherited from one’s father, grandfather or great-grandfather, should be done away with. It is indeed welcome that the apex court has sought to give full effect to this intent by setting at rest doubts arising from varying interpretations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/right-by-birth-the-hindu-editorial-on-daughters-and-hindu-succession-act/article32347299.ece
29,2,2015,Historic ratification: On universal ratification of a labour standard,"The welcome decision by the Kingdom of Tonga to outlaw the worst forms of child labour is the first time in the International Labour Organization (ILO)’s 101-year history that a labour standard has been universally ratified. Convention 182, which was adopted in the 1999 annual international labour conference, prohibits the sexual exploitation of children, trafficking, deployment in armed conflict and other conditions that compromise their overall well-being. The Convention complements the ILO’s efforts under the 1973 Minimum Age Convention to prevent the employment of children below a lower age threshold. Under the influence of both these ILO standards, millions of young boys and girls have been rescued from hazardous conditions of work. Concomitantly, these have resulted in significant increases in enrolments in primary education. The landmark ratification, however, does not detract from the enormity of the challenge that remains. An estimated 152 million are trapped in child labour and 72 million of them are engaged in hazardous work. If anything, current efforts would have to be stepped up significantly to achieve the ambitious goal of total abolition of the scourge of child labour by 2025. But the COVID-19 pandemic is threatening a reversal of recent gains, with widespread job losses, deterioration in conditions of work, decline in household incomes and temporary school closures.
The historic first universal ratification of a global labour standard may be an occasion for celebration; it is nonetheless a moment for sober reflection. The two instruments on child labour are among the eight core ILO Conventions regarded as embodying the spirit of the 1998 declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work. Instruments relating to the freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining and the elimination of discrimination in employment and occupation are among the others. These conventions provide the necessary framework to counteract the predominance of informality in the conditions of work and ought to be a priority for governments. Though belated, India has signalled its legal commitment to the elimination of child labour with its 2017 ratification of Convention 182 and the instrument prescribing the minimum age of work for children. As the world prepares to designate 2021 as the year to abolish child labour, governments must seize the moment to instil hope in the future generations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/historic-ratification-the-hindu-editorial-on-universal-ratification-of-a-labour-standard/article32347515.ece
1,3,2015,An imaginative and deft balance,"Finance Minister Arun Jaitley may just have managed to achieve what some of his predecessors attempted but failed. In a performance that is striking in its imaginative balance, Mr. Jaitley has deftly reconciled the interests of business and the markets on the one hand and that of the masses, or aam aadmi, if you will, on the other, and all this without taking his eyes off the fiscal deficit ball. His second budget, which is also his first full-year one, has proposals that incentivise savings, increase social security and pension coverage of citizens and ideas to harness the idle gold lying in family lockers. For good measure, the Finance Minister has also signalled his government’s commitment to the rural jobs scheme by allocating a marginally higher sum with the promise of more if his tax revenues increase. Simultaneously, Mr. Jaitley has kept his focus on the needs of business and the corporate sector with a significantly higher allocation for infrastructure, a phased reduction in the corporate tax rate, deferment of GAAR by two more years, a microfinance refinancing agency, a law to handle disputes in public contracts and the promise to usher in a bankruptcy code this year. The only luxury that the Finance Minister has permitted himself is that of delaying the journey to a fiscal deficit target of 3 per cent of GDP by an extra year. While this may have the fiscal hawks up in arms, the fact is that the target was set earlier under the then prevailing circumstances that have changed now. And then again, Mr. Jaitley can be given the benefit of the doubt for being profligate simply because the extra spending goes towards investment in infrastructure and not for consumption.
Broadly, there are three facets of the Budget that stand out. First, the conscious push towards spreading the social security net, especially retirement pension coverage, using the Jan Dhan platform. The Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojna which will offer accident cover of Rs.2 lakh at a premium of just Rs.12 per year and the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana which will offer life cover of Rs.2 lakh at a premium of just Rs.330 per annum are commendable plans that will take social security to the poor who need it the most. For the middle class, Mr. Jaitley has incentivised the push for retirement coverage with the promise of a generous tax-break, which in one stroke channelises savings and ensures a pension net. The second major facet is the investor-friendly initiatives as seen in the phased cut in corporate tax rate and the deferment of GAAR. The idea of an electronic bill discounting platform for MSMEs is an excellent one that will address the cash flow problems of the smallest of businesses.
The serious push to address the parallel economy inhabitants as seen by the proposal to pass a tough law against those holding undisclosed assets abroad is the third major feature. Ten years rigorous imprisonment and 300 per cent penalty on those who conceal income and assets abroad are unprecedented tough measures that send the signal that this government means business on the issue of curbing illegal foreign accounts. The gold deposit scheme and sovereign bonds are probably vehicles to get the illegal gold hoarded by the parallel economy into the mainstream though Mr. Jaitley might not admit it. The one major criticism that the Finance Minister might have to address is the fact that he is raising additional resources through indirect taxes, which are regressive as they are harsher on the poor. The middle-class might also be unhappy that there has been no change in either the income-tax slabs or the rates. They will have to wait for better times to come. Mr. Jaitley’s decision to increase the import duty on petrol and diesel is unlikely to go down well as retail prices have increased due to the trade-parity pricing formula followed by the oil companies. The devil, as they say, is in the detail and there could be other unpleasant changes hidden in the fine print. But broadly, and for the moment, the Finance Minister can take credit for tailoring a budget that balances conflicting pulls and pressures and in a difficult environment to boot. Overall, it is an imaginative and well-formulated exercise addressing the needs of growth as well as equity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-imaginative-and-deft-balance/article6946787.ece
2,3,2015,Positive signals for business,"There are several features of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s first full-year Budget presented in Parliament on Saturday that are notable, such as the effort to widen the social security and pension net, the plan to severely penalise those holding illegal foreign accounts and assets, and the proposals to monetise idle gold holdings in the country. Yet, what stands out the most is the structural shift in the government’s attitude and approach to the business and corporate sector. This is evident from proposals such as the cut in corporate tax by a significant 5 percentage points, putting off the implementation of General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) by two more years, a sharp increase in >allocation to infrastructure, a proposed >Bankruptcy Code, an >electronic bill discounting scheme to help the smallest of businesses to tide over cash flow problems, and even a new law to handle disputes involving public contracts. Not since P. Chidambaram’s ‘dream budget’ of 1997, which slashed corporate tax rates and taxes on royalties among other things, have we seen such a business-friendly budget. Successive governments and Finance Ministers have considered business and industry as a sector that needed to be kept on a tight leash using the instrument of taxation. In that sense, the biggest reform measure that Mr. Jaitley has unleashed lies not in any of the budget proposals but in the changed mindset towards business — the recognition that it is a major stakeholder in the economy and that its growth needs to be fostered.
So, what explains this change? The obvious answer is that the BJP has always been known to be pro-business, especially Prime Minister Narendra Modi. So a business-friendly budget is nothing surprising. But that would only be a broad explanation of the change. The more immediate explanation, though, is that the Budget had to support the Make in India theme of the Prime Minister, and what better way to attract capital and investors than by reducing taxes and easing means to do business in India. The Budget goes a long way in supporting the pet theme of Mr. Modi, whose imprint is visible in other proposals too. With an estimated 12 to 14 million people joining the workforce every year, the importance of increasing jobs, especially in manufacturing, cannot be overemphasised. It does not matter whether Make in India is aimed at exports or at the domestic market; the bottom line is investment and jobs. The Budget is the reiteration of the Modi Government’s conscious shift towards supporting industry and business. Mr. Jaitley had said earlier the Budget is but one day in a year and reforms are possible in the remaining 364 days as well. If that is any indication, then more reforms lie ahead for business and industry.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/positive-signals-for-business/article6948763.ece
2,3,2015,Dark struggles in paradise,"The arrest of Mohammed Nasheed, former President of the Maldives, was not unexpected. He and his Maldivian Democratic Party had seen it coming and had appealed to the international community, including New Delhi, to prevent it. A delegation of the MDP visited the Indian capital a week before the arrest but got no official hearing. The charismatic Mr. Nasheed, the main face of the Maldivian opposition, was charged under anti-terrorism laws for the arrest of a judge back in 2012 when he was President, a few days after the original charges against him were dropped. The government of President Abdulla Yameen insists that the arrest was necessary to prevent Mr.Nasheed from absconding. Coming in the backdrop of attempts by the Maldivian opposition to unseat Mr. Yameen, there is no disguising the political overtones to the arrest. The MDP, which sees itself unjustly ousted from power in 2012 through what Mr. Nasheed has alleged was a ‘coup’ against him, did try to extract advantage from the differences in the ruling coalition, demanding that Mr. Yameen hand over power to a disgruntled ally. There was talk of impeachment proceedings against the President, who is a brother of the former dictator Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. The government’s reaction to a political threat is a throwback to its bad old Gayoom days when all opposition was effectively silenced with incarceration. Mr. Nasheed, denied legal representation after his arrest, now finds himself back in the familiar surroundings of the Dhoonidhoo Island Detention Centre where he spent several years during the Gayoom dictatorship and was internationally upheld as a ‘prisoner of conscience’. If convicted, he could be barred from contesting the next presidential elections.
The arrest of Mr. Nasheed has sparked protests in the Maldives, and worldwide concern at the country’s regression. There is international concern that the continuing unrest in the small chain of islands in the Indian Ocean could provide a setting in which extremist Islamist groups could find a ready foothold. New Delhi has expressed its concern a bit belatedly, some would say. It has now urged that there be a resolution of differences “within the constitutional and legal framework” of the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi appears to be mulling a postponement of a stopover in the Maldives after a visit to Sri Lanka in mid-March. Given that India is keen to assert its strategic presence in the Indian Ocean region, it should not worry that this postponement would push Maldives closer to Beijing but convey a strong signal of its concern over the increasing volatility of the situation there.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dark-struggles-in-paradise/article6948764.ece
3,3,2015,Curb the fringe elements,"When he spoke of ‘India first’ as his government’s religion and the Indian Constitution as its only religious book, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was moving beyond platitudes on religious freedom, and correctly re-emphasising the constitutional guarantees of India as a secular, democratic republic. Within the space of ten days, Mr. Modi went from offering mere reassurances to religious minorities to actually committing his government to the constitutionally conferred rights of all citizens to freely practise a religion of their choice. In a welcome contrast to the typical stance of Hindutva groups, he upheld the Constitution as the expression of the ethos the country had followed for thousands of years, and chided those making irresponsible statements in the name of religion. If >his speech at an event organised by a Christian group was meant as >an assurance to religious minorities, this response in Parliament, in which he insisted that the country could only be run in accordance with the Constitution, seemed directed against Hindutva hardliners who were making the functioning of his government difficult. Clearly, Mr. Modi was trying to distance his government from the vituperative hate-mongering of the Hindutva groups, including the RSS. Evidently disconcerted by the criticism of his failure to rein in the extremist elements within the broader Hindutva fold, Mr. Modi seemed to be hoping he would be judged on the basis of his own words and deeds, and not of those claiming to be the ideological affiliates of the BJP.
True, the statements of RSS leaders and Hindutva extremists are amplified many times over during the periods the BJP is in power. But if Mr. Modi does not want to be answerable for the behaviour of the Hindutva fringe, many of whom are also middle-rung leaders of his own party, he should not then hesitate to reprimand them more often and more openly for their provocative speeches. Otherwise, the government would be seen as cynically exploiting the work of the fringe for the political ends of the ruling party whenever possible, and tactically retreating where the fringe’s politics become inconvenient. The views of the RSS and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad would continue to make headlines as long as the ruling party leaders and functionaries treat these organisations as part of their extended family. What is troubling about the public agenda of the Hindutva groups is the impression that the implied aggression against non-Hindus has the tacit sanction of the ruling party. Mr. Modi will have to continuously speak up categorically against religious extremists of the saffron hue too, if the Hindutva fringe is not to cast a long shadow on his government and undermine its credibility.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/curb-the-fringe-elements/article6952242.ece
3,3,2015,Cricket’s new boss,"Any change at the helm of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) can be seen as an opportunity to end the crisis of credibility that has consumed the game’s administration in recent times. Ever since the >betting and spot-fixing scandal hit the 2013 edition of the Indian Premier League, and the BCCI, under N. Srinivasan, gave the impression of stonewalling any inquiry, the credibility deficit became so apparent that the judiciary took a dim view of the state of affairs. The election of Jagmohan Dalmiya was without opposition, but the elections for other posts were not free of factionalism. The BCCI’s annual general meeting was held at a time when >Mr. Srinivasan was barred from contesting for the post of BCCI chief, on account of the rule against those having a commercial interest in any event organised by the Board becoming office-bearers. With Mr. Srinivasan’s absence from the fray, the point of interest in the election at the BCCI’s annual general meeting was whether his faction would outwit the rival group of former BCCI president >Sharad Pawar. Mr. Pawar, however, could not make a comeback, as the east zone, whose turn it was to propose a candidate, chose to nominate Mr. Dalmiya. The Pawar camp managed to get Anurag Thakur elected as secretary, while all other posts went to candidates backed by Mr. Srinivasan’s camp. The outcome indicates that political manoeuvring and orchestration continues to be a dominant feature in the affairs of cricket administration in India.
Mr. Dalmiya is a seasoned administrator, who, in his earlier stint, began the process of harnessing the sport’s massive marketing potential that led to Indian cricket going through a commercial boom. He has considerable experience in running the game and organising major events at the international level too. However, he will also have to live down the unsavoury aspects of his past. He was accused of misappropriation of funds and expelled from the BCCI in 2006. Some may see him now as a >‘Srinivasan man’, but there is little doubt that he has enough experience to chart an independent path. And the presence of Mr. Thakur as secretary is likely to be a balancing factor in the administration. The Supreme Court recently ruled that cricket administration is a public function. It has asked a three-member committee of eminent judges to recommend reforms that will help rescue the much-loved game from the whims and vagaries of individuals. The administration is now expected to stop being an opaque clique or a cosy club and transform itself into a transparent body. The question now is whether the present change at the helm will lead to such a transformation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/crickets-new-boss/article6952243.ece
4,3,2015,Engaging with Pakistan on J&K,"Marriages of convenience rarely involve a change of heart. >Political expediency dictated the coming together of the Peoples Democratic Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party in a coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir, and neither party could have been expected to shift ideological positions so soon after the swearing-in. The > statement of Chief Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed crediting Pakistan, Kashmiri separatists and militants for the smooth conduct of the Assembly election was thus hardly a surprise. He was addressing his political constituency when he made the statement, and not his partner in government, the BJP. Evidently, the Mufti and the PDP see the tie-up with the BJP as a tactical retreat and not as a strategic advance, as a temporary “governance alliance” necessitated by the nature of the mandate and not as a long-term “political alliance” on the basis of any shared interests or vision. They know they will have difficulty in selling the alliance, by whatever name it is called, to their core support base. >Avoidable and indiscreet the Mufti’s statement might have been, but it was certainly not out-of-character. The PDP’s need to collaborate with the BJP on administration will have to coexist with its need to ideologically confront the Hindutva party on every issue of political importance, whether it be >Article 370 or the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act.
What is of political import is not whether the election was peaceful because of any restraint shown by Pakistan-backed separatists and militants or because of the vigil of the security forces. While opposition parties, quite understandably, want to use the opportunity to embarrass the BJP over this issue, the Centre cannot be blind to the fact that a solution to the >Kashmir dispute would necessarily have to include Pakistan. If Pakistan is part of the problem for India in Kashmir, it would also have to be part of the solution. The BJP-led government is sometimes prone to impulsive reactions, as was evident when the Foreign Secretary-level talks were called off last year after the Pakistan High Commissioner met with leaders of the separatist Hurriyat. The Mufti’s statement, ill-advised as it doubtless was, should not be allowed to queer the pitch for India’s continued engagement with Pakistan on Kashmir and terrorism and other bilateral issues. The Hurriyat and Pakistan would have to be on board for India’s efforts to find a solution to the Kashmir dispute to succeed. J&K should not be allowed to become hostage to politicking, whether by the PDP in Kashmir or by the Congress and the BJP at the national level.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/engaging-with-pakistan-on-jk/article6955947.ece
4,3,2015,Bankruptcy law reform needed,"Budget 2015 recognises the need for legal reforms to stimulate business and growth. Economic policies overwhelmingly focus on >fiscal measures, monetary interventions and >welfare programmes to aid businesses, but the legal processes that underlie commerce are often ignored. Laws that are concerned with starting businesses, enforcing contracts, ensuring debt repayments and exiting businesses, play a critical role and can thwart growth, rendering even good policies ineffective. It is in such a spirit of broadening the approach that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has >identified reform in bankruptcy laws as a key priority, envisaging legal clarity and speedy processes that will ultimately ease doing business in India. The connection between better insolvency laws and economic growth is straightforward: >stronger bankruptcy laws protect the rights of borrowers and lenders, promote predictability, clarify the risks associated with lending, and make the collection of debt through bankruptcy proceedings more attractive. These factors ultimately facilitate credit and thus a higher flow of capital in the economy. But as per the recent Doing Business, 2015 Report, India is ranked 142 on the ease of doing business and at 137 for resolving insolvencies. The average time taken for insolvency proceedings in India is about 4.3 years, while it is only 1.7 years in high-income OECD countries. The recovery rate (cents on the dollar) is 71.9 in high-income OECD countries as opposed to 25.7 in India.
This is why the Interim Report of the Bankruptcy Law Reform Committee released in February 2015 is welcome. The Committee set up by the Ministry of Finance in August 2014 will be crucial to the new legislation promised in the Budget. The Committee sees the early recognition of financial distress and timely intervention as key features of efficient rescue regimes and believes that the degree of viability of a company must be the central consideration for allowing it to be rescued, and that an unviable company should be liquidated as soon as possible to minimise losses for stakeholders. They recommend that secured creditors be allowed to file an application for the rescue of a company at a sufficiently early stage, rather than wait for the company to have defaulted on 50 per cent of its outstanding debt, as currently provided for in the Companies Act, 2013. The Committee suggests that unsecured creditors representing 25 per cent of the debt be allowed to initiate rescue proceedings against the debtor company. The report also focusses on individual insolvency, a crucial area covering sole proprietorships and small and medium enterprises in India. Therefore, a new bankruptcy law coupled with practical changes, removing the judicial bottlenecks and delays, will be crucial to the reform process.

5,3,2015,Banning is not the solution,"Decisions made in the wake of a popular outcry over emotive and sensitive issues will invariably be wrong. The government’s action in getting a court order restraining the telecast of the documentary, India’s Daughter, by the British film-maker Leslee Udwin, is a knee-jerk response to the outrage voiced by sections of society against what they call giving undue publicity to a convict’s views. While the film-maker notes that she had a ‘no objection’ letter from the Home Ministry and obtained permission from the Tihar Jail authorities to interview the convict, the police have registered an FIR after it became known that the documentary is to be aired by a television news channel on March 8, coinciding with International Women’s Day. The work has been banned from public viewing for the sole reason that it contains some repugnant comments by the convict, blaming the victim for the rape and murder. A moot question is whether it is unethical to disseminate the views of a convict, even those as abhorrent as those of Mukesh Singh; and whether banning the reporting of such views is the right response. True, it will be morally repulsive and abominable to hear the convict justifying his horrific crime by blaming the victim and saying she could have survived had she not resisted rape. But it is equally true that there is some public interest in recording such views and airing them in such a way that it does not glorify, but makes them repugnant. Actually, the documentary may even help the public recognise and counter such thought processes in society.
As the documentary is yet to be aired, it may be unfair to prejudge its approach and the level of its success in its being, in Ms. Udwin’s words, ‘an impassioned plea for gender equality’. To presume that it will only strengthen the rapist’s mindset may derail any effort to create a sensitive record of what the country needs — a conscious transition from a culture of tolerance towards gender violence to a progressive socio-legal structure that combats the phenomenon. India now has stronger and better-defined laws; there is greater sensitivity among investigators, prosecutors and judges, but the scope for genuine transformation lies in the larger domain — the attitude and approach of society at large. Documentaries such as this may serve to advance this purpose, and even if they fail to do so, the solution is not to ban such efforts. For they may help confront the culture of rape and the widely seen phenomenon of public figures, officials and politicians conforming to the patriarchal mindset that is at the core of gender violence in India. The documentary should be seen as holding a mirror unto a society that is far from being sensitive to gender issues.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/banning-is-not-the-solution/article6959753.ece
5,3,2015,Financial sector reform on course,"‘One-stop solution’ has become a new mantra in the modern business world. The convergence of activities that follow in its wake, however, often put consumers in a piquant situation. A consumer of a financial product especially can easily get confused, and end up buying the wrong product. Oftentimes, the aggrieved are pushed from one place to another to seek redress. The reasons are not far to seek. Though a single agency may sell multiple financial products, the regulators for these may be different. In this scenario, avoiding responsibility has turned that much easier for sellers, and the aggrieved consumer is often treated as a football. Seeking to right this wrong, Budget 2015 has made the consumers of financial products the focus of all laws. “A properly functioning capital market also requires proper consumer protection,” Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said while presenting the Budget. His proposal to establish a unified financial redressal agency may well redefine play in the financial services field. The glamour of providing universal banking has seen the mis-selling of products acquire some sort of an institutional blessing. With competition turning fiercer in the financial services field, there seems to be a focus, blinkered as it might be, on pushing products at any cost. In such an environment, a consumer can never be the proverbial king. A single complaints resolution agency is the core of the non-legislative component of a host of recommendations made by the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission. What Mr. Jaitley has done now is to initiate action on this. Once it becomes a reality, any aggrieved consumer can just knock on the doors of this single-point grievance-resolution agency. An independent agency would command greater trust among consumers and create a sense of responsibility among sellers. More important, it could clean up the financial services field, and usher in healthy practices.
This consumer focus is the critical part of the move to overhaul financial sector regulation. The Finance Minister did indicate in his Budget speech that efforts in this direction are on track. Even as the implementation of the recommendations of the Justice Srikrishna-chaired FSLRC is being studied by independent task forces, Mr. Jaitley is confident of placing the Indian Financial Code before Parliament sooner rather than later. But hurdles, especially of the legislative kind, are aplenty. Removing them will put the government’s resolve to the test to get assorted pressure elements out of its way. It may need some administrative tweaking as well. Putting in place the IFC is a gargantuan task, and could trigger a transformation in the financial sector.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/financial-sector-reform-on-course/article6959752.ece
6,3,2015,AAP’s leadership jinx,"Success usually drives away troubles, but in the case of the Aam Aadmi Party, the victory in the Delhi Assembly election only seems to have precipitated a crisis of credibility and leadership. By effecting the removal of Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav from the Political Affairs Committee of the party, the dominant faction of the AAP that stands solidly behind national convener Arvind Kejriwal signalled that it would not tolerate any dissidence in the organisation. Both Mr. Bhushan and Mr. Yadav were apparently willing to step down from the panel, but wanted an honourable exit: either through a complete reconstitution of the PAC or by informally staying away from its meetings. But the Kejriwal faction, with his deputy Manish Sisodia in the forefront, wanted to publicly signal that there could be no questioning of the leadership of Mr. Kejriwal. Although the differences within the AAP revolving around the leadership style of Mr. Kejriwal have a long history, the immediate trigger for the crisis was the continuation of Mr. Kejriwal in the organisational post after he was sworn in Chief Minister of Delhi, which is prohibited under the party’s rule of one person-one post. But Mr. Kejriwal’s loyalists would hear of no such thing, and wanted him to continue in the top party post. Notwithstanding his offer to step down as national convener, Mr. Kejriwal gave free rein to his supporters in the party to silence dissidents and dissenters.
Mr. Kejriwal is no doubt the face of the party and is central to the party’s fortunes both as Delhi Chief Minister and a front-line leader of the AAP. But the question implied in the challenge from Mr. Yadav and Mr. Bhushan is the party leader’s commitment to internal democracy, an issue that the AAP has taken great pride in differentiating itself from other parties. Mr. Kejriwal, for all his talk of transparency and democratic processes, is sometimes impulsive in his ways and wont to surround himself with a coterie of subservient second-rung leaders. As a party campaigning for probity in public life and equal access to public resources for all, the AAP holds great promise. But a politics revolving around a personality cult will achieve little. The Delhi victory was not Mr. Kejriwal’s alone, and the attempts to undermine the democratic structure of the party would have long-term consequences. Without a democratic structure, the AAP cannot hope to win the people’s confidence, relying only on Mr. Kejriwal as a mascot. It needs to expand beyond Delhi to take on the BJP in substantive terms, and that onerous task requires a strong organisational base — which alone can provide inspiration for a consolidation of mass sentiment in the AAP’s favour.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/aaps-leadership-jinx/article6963538.ece
6,3,2015,Surprises in quick succession,"Reserve Bank of India Governor Dr. Raghuram Rajan has a penchant for surprises. For the second time inside of two months, he chose to cut the key repo rate outside the standard policy cycle. In all, the rate has been cut by 50 basis points in two equal instalments. The surprise this time around should be read in the context of confusing signals that the Governor had transmitted just a day prior to the announcement of the 25 basis points cut on Wednesday. Pointing to an ‘avalanche of capital flows’ while addressing a meeting in Mumbai, Dr. Rajan said: “We cannot cut the interest rates very quickly to the bone in order to tell those countries: don’t come here expecting high interest rates.” What changed in these two days? The timing of the rate cut, coming as it did within a few days of the Modi Government’s first full-year Budget has, predictably, set tongues wagging. Two favourable factors — the agreement with the government on inflation-targeting, and retail inflation at below policy expectations — seem to have provided a sense of comfort for the Governor to go in for a rate cut. While there is no particular sanctity about the policy cycle which may not coincide with other developments, the question still arises as to why it was timed for now. The Governor has justified it on the ground that any policy action has to be an anticipatory one. The latest rate cut, in a way, will erase the widespread perception that the RBI and the government have been pulling in different directions.
The reference to the ‘avalanche of capital flows’ perhaps gives a clue or two to Dr. Rajan’s acute unease. Foreign capital flow is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can serve to swell the nation’s pride. On the other, it can also hurt the country’s economy. Unbridled flow of capital could drive the rupee value up, and make Indian exports uncompetitive in the global marketplace. Money flows to where returns are high. Dr. Rajan is aware of the consequence of keeping the interest rate high when central banks across the world are cutting rates. Ipso facto, rupee-related concerns appear to have pushed the RBI to opt for a rate-cut decision. This is a non-inflationary way of tackling any possible capital flow-induced disturbances to the rupee. “We can act against temporary undesirable volatility. It is very hard for us to act on a sustained basis to maintain a value of the rupee,” Dr. Rajan told an analysts’ conference after the rate cut. It is indeed a smart win-win act that should please many a restless constituency in the economy. Significantly, banks have been playing reluctant participants in the double-quick two-round rate cuts. Perhaps, fixing supply-side issues may have to get top priority now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/surprises-in-quick-succession/article6963540.ece
7,3,2015,A discriminatory decision,"The manner in which the Devendra Fadnavis government in Maharashtra has scrapped the judicially allowed 5 per cent reservation for Muslims in educational institutions shows it has no qualms about being seen as discriminating against the minority community. The reason given in the Government Resolution scrapping the quota, introduced first through an ordinance in July 2014, is specious: it merely states that the ordinance lapsed in December. The irony behind the policy decision is that this quota was the only portion of the ordinance that was permitted to operate by the Bombay High Court in its interim order of November 2014. The High Court held, prima facie, that the 16 per cent quota for the Maratha community in both education and employment was unconstitutional. The Court agreed with the conclusions of the State Backward Classes Commission that the Maratha community could not be termed backward in view of its dominant social position. The Court stayed reservation for Muslims in public employment, while allowing it in government and aided educational institutions. Yet, the government got a Bill passed in the State Assembly providing for reservation for Marathas. It appears bent upon implementing a policy measure that helps the Maratha community despite the fact that this approach was stayed. Yet the government is not interested in continuing with the Muslim quota, which has judicial sanction.
It may be argued that reservation for Muslims is invalid as it amounts to discrimination on religious grounds, which is expressly prohibited by the Constitution. Yet, several courts have recognised that where the reservation is for identified subgroups within a religious community, and extended on the ground of social and educational backwardness based on quantifiable data, such affirmative action is valid. In the case of Maharashtra, the quota is applicable to 50 identified sub-communities among Muslims. In Tamil Nadu, too, 3.5 per cent reservation for Muslims is being implemented without any problem, mainly because it is applicable to them not on the ground of religion but on the basis of their social and educational backwardness. Several reports, mainly those of the Sachar Committee, the Ranganath Misra Commission and the Mehmood-ur-Rehman Study Group have accepted that Muslims are educationally and socially backward, and special measures are needed to bring them into the mainstream of secular education. The government could have pursued the ongoing litigation on both kinds of reservation to its logical conclusion in the Supreme Court before acting in a manner contrary to what the interim orders permit. If it is serious about its commitment to minority welfare, it should provide better access and greater opportunities to Muslims to pursue avenues of secular education.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-discriminatory-decision/article6966880.ece
7,3,2015,Promising first step,"The Modi government’s decision to engage Islamabad can only be welcomed given the decision to open up to South Asia in a big way. Several key initiatives of the government are contingent on a peaceful South Asia. And, there is little doubt that a peaceful region will be key to realising India’s own growth potential. Even if there has been little change in the attitude of Pakistan’s permanent establishment towards reining in anti-India terror groups, talks held by Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar with his Pakistani counterpart Aizaz Chaudhry in Islamabad could hold the key to the future of the bilateral relationship. The two met after India abruptly cancelled what were billed as “talks about talks” between Foreign Secretaries last year following a meeting between separatist Hurriyat leaders and the Pakistani envoy in Delhi. As has become the norm in India-Pakistan relations, the cancellation came after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, along with other SAARC leaders, was invited to attend Narendra Modi’s swearing-in ceremony last May, raising hopes for a positive engagement. Since then, Pakistani and Indian forces have been exchanging fire intermittently across the Line of Control and the international border.
So, the Modi government’s decision to send its new Foreign Secretary is a step in the right direction even as a full resumption of dialogue between the two countries is awaited. Both sides said little that departed from the customary exchange of political rhetoric. The Modi government has had enough time to understand the issues at hand and must now take a call on how to move forward with Pakistan. There are two options before the two governments — to pick up the threads of the “two plus six” structured dialogue agreed to in 1997 which has made little or no progress — or agree to a new structure more in line with 21st century realities. But given the track record of bilateral negotiations, it is unlikely that the latter option would be pursued. There is no reason the two sides should not try to frame a new structure of negotiations that jettison the past agendas. Sir Creek, Siachen, terrorism and Kashmir are all known and identified issues in bilateral ties; even the resolution of the “easier” issues has proved elusive given the blow-hot, blow-cold nature of the relationship. If the oft-repeated statement that countries can’t change their neighbours is to have substance, then both Mr. Modi and Mr. Sharif have a golden opportunity to take bilateral ties to a new level.

9,3,2015,Vigilantism in Dimapur,"When mobs take the law into their own hands, a common justification is to cite India’s slow and often biased judicial system. This was not one of those cases. Ten days after a reported rape in Dimapur, Nagaland, a >mob broke into the city’s Central Jail, dragged Syed Farid Khan, the man accused of having committed the crime, into the streets of the city, and stripped, beat and lynched him, all the while filming the crime on their phones. There was no delayed justice, no compromised police force, no shocking acquittal here, yet the mob decided to kill a man who merely stood accused of a crime. The fact that the deceased was a Muslim — or a “Bangladeshi”, as has become the shorthand in large parts of India including its northeast — was central to the mob’s fury. Using violence to act out caste and religious hatred has a long and inglorious history in India, and sexual violence too frequently has underpinnings of caste and religious hatred to it.
A society’s violence and bigotries do not exist in silos, yet India has made the dangerous mistake of beginning to address its sexual violence problem as if it were a localised infection rather than a metastasising cancer. Respecting the rule of law is as important when condemning a rapist’s actions as it is when condemning those of a murderous mob. A society that believes that every woman, irrespective of her moral or sexual choices, has the right to her own body, must also believe that a person, irrespective of the crime he is accused of, has the right to the due process of law. One that believes in meting out its own version of subjective ‘justice’ is equally likely to condone a father killing his daughter for having premarital sex as it is to encourage the murder of a suspected rapist. It would be wrong to see this act of mob ‘justice’ as a response to India’s heightened revulsion of rape; it is in fact to be seen as a part of India’s growing violence and lawlessness which has so diminished and endangered the lives of its women. The mob in Dimapur did not make its streets safer for women; it made its air more dangerous for everyone. The new conversation that India began in December 2012 should have led to a re-evaluation of all our bigotries and prejudices, all the demons within; instead, an incomplete revolution has taken place, one that may do as much harm as good, and is no closer to a fuller idea of justice. The brutal vigilantism of the kind that was witnessed in the Dimapur killing does India no good any more than the crude misogynist remarks of the defence lawyers in the >India’s Daughter documentary.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/vigilantism-in-dimapur/article6972016.ece
9,3,2015,Welcome push on infrastructure,"Well-developed infrastructure is a fundamental underpinning of any effort to push the economy into a growth orbit. This requirement has assumed a critical dimension for the BJP government’s larger political agenda. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ pitch has ignited a wave of optimism. Its success, however, hinges largely on dismantling ground-level hurdles. A sense of unease was discernible when Finance Minister Arun Jaitley spoke, while presenting Budget 2015, of inadequate infrastructure and major slippages in projects. “Our infrastructure does not match our growth ambitions,” he admitted. He evidently realises that >stepped-up allocation by itself would not be enough. He has promised to introduce a plug-and-play model for big-ticket infrastructure projects such as power plants, airports and roads. The proposal to revisit the PPP (public private partnership) mode of infrastructure development is welcome and inevitable. Assorted non-economic risks — from political to social — have inhibited investment in this space. The toll model for roads is a case in point: ‘toll-risk’ is proving to be a dampener for the flow of fresh private funds into the sector. The changing dynamics call for a new approach. “The sovereign will have to bear a major part of the risk without, of course, absorbing it entirely,” Mr. Jaitley had said. >Economic Survey 2014-15 also speaks of “disproportionately high levels of default’’ facing the road sector portfolio owing to the economic downturn. The Survey clearly sees a slowdown in appetite for BOT (build operate and transfer) PPP projects as a consequence. The PPP model was the centrepiece of the growth story a decade ago but it has outlived its utility. The proposed Public Contracts (Resolution of Disputes) Bill and the Regulatory Reform Bill will, it is to be hoped, help get stalled projects back on track. The plan for a bankruptcy code must be read in tandem with these two proposals. All these should provide a higher level of comfort to lenders for infrastructure projects.
The Budget has also proposed a National Investment and Infrastructure Fund with an annual inflow of Rs.20,000 crore. This could strengthen the balance sheet of infrastructure finance companies such as the NHB and the IRFC, and help them improve their leveraging power and refinancing capacity. This will have a trigger effect down the line. Simultaneously, Mr. Jaitley has planned tax-free infrastructure bonds for projects in the rail, road and irrigation sectors. The Budget has also proposed five ultra-mega power projects. With the plug-and-play model, one hopes that the winners of the contracts could begin the project implementation process immediately without worrying about regulatory clearances and coal or gas linkages. Mr. Jaitley has pressed the right buttons. Whether these initiatives take off depends on how potential investors respond.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/welcome-push-on-infrastructure/article6972017.ece
10,3,2015,The power to pardon,"The >release of the Kashmiri separatist leader Masarat Alam by the Mufti Mohammed Sayeed government is not so much a national security crisis as it is a crisis for the relations between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Peoples Democratic Party. The BJP-led government at the Centre tried to hide its embarrassment at the actions of its ally in Jammu and Kashmir by quickly clarifying that it >does not agree with the freeing of Mr. Alam who spearheaded the stone-throwing protests in 2010 that resulted in the death of more than a hundred persons. While the State government was within its rights to revoke the detention under the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act, the discharge of a Hurriyat hardliner who showed no remorse clearly sent the wrong political signals outside of the Valley. Evidently, in an attempt to stem the negative fallout of its alliance with the BJP, the PDP is seeking to cultivate the Muslim secessionist constituency in Kashmir by showing reluctance to concede to the political sensitivities of the Hindutva party. If the PDP is to retain its core base and political influence in the Valley, it would have to be seen as the dominant partner in the alliance, unyielding to the pulls and pressures of the BJP. That Prime Minister Narendra Modi felt compelled to say he did not need lessons in patriotism from the opposition is in itself an indication of the stresses and strains that the BJP has come under following Mr. Alam’s release from jail.
While Chief Minister Mufti Sayeed appears ready to test the limits of the BJP’s patience, Mr. Alam’s release is not going to make a solution to the problems in Jammu and Kashmir any easier. The power to pardon must be used as carefully as the power to punish. In terms of impact, the freeing of Mr. Alam could be of the same order as the hanging of Afzal Guru, which further polarised the political situation, making the search for peace and reconciliation that much more difficult. While a solution that would allow Kashmir to return to normality would have to involve discussions with all sections of the people, and necessarily take on board the secessionists and the hardliners, nothing is to be gained by political one-upmanship whether on the part of the PDP or the BJP. Instead of seeking to annul the release of Mr. Alam, the Central government would be better advised to keep him under close watch. New Delhi must also continue to push for a comprehensive dialogue on a solution to the Kashmir issue taking into account the historical context of the dispute and the continuing democratic aspirations of its people. A comprehensive political solution would in one stroke render gestures such as the release of Mr. Alam truly pointless.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/masarat-alam-release-the-power-to-pardon/article6975341.ece
10,3,2015,The cost of bidding,"On the face of it, the ongoing >spectrum auction is already a success. Against an initial target of Rs.82,000 crore, the total bid amount has >already crossed Rs.86,000 crore after just four days of bidding. Going by the current bidding intensity, the Centre can hope to mop up at least Rs.1 lakh crore by the time the auction ends. While this is good for the national exchequer, the reality is that an expensive auction is counterproductive from a consumer point of view. It is no secret that higher spectrum costs will put pressure on telecom operators to either increase tariffs or halt or defer their investments in rolling out new infrastructure. Neither is good for achieving Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of a Digital India. It was the high cost of spectrum in the 2010 auction that stunted the growth of 3G and mobile broadband services in the country. The Centre had then received bids worth over Rs.1 lakh crore, with operators jostling to outbid one another. As a result, even after five years of that auction, consumers are yet to experience good quality 3G services. With the average connection speed hovering just around 1.3 Mbps, it is the lowest among Asian countries.
Programmes such as the 100 Smart City project and the e-Governance initiatives require speed — at least a 2 Mbps connection at affordable rates. But for this to happen, telecom operators have to be given adequate spectrum, and at a reasonable price. To be fair, the Centre cannot be faulted for following the auction process for allocating spectrum. Compared to other mechanisms used in the past, such as the first-come-first-served policy and subscriber-linked criteria, auctions are the most transparent way to parcel out finite natural resources. However, the Centre has to take the blame for adopting a faulty auction design. Take for instance the decision to auction only 5 MHz of spectrum in the 2100 MHz frequency band. A block of 5 MHz spectrum is just enough for one player to offer 3G services; with eight operators in the fray, it is not surprising that the bids have skyrocketed to astronomical sums. This coupled with the decision to take back spectrum from incumbent operators, post the expiry of their 20-year licences, have placed a stark choice before telecom companies — they either have to buy spectrum at any cost or face the prospect of going out of business. Access to inexpensive broadband services is the basic requirement for achieving the goal of digitising India. Ironically, the Centre’s success in garnering higher revenues in the spectrum auction could signal the failure of that vision.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/spectrum-auction-the-cost-of-bidding/article6975340.ece
11,3,2015,Striking a jarring note,"Indo-Sri Lankan relations have seen a marked upturn in recent weeks after a new administration took over in Colombo. Last month, during the visit of President Maithripala Sirisena, four substantive agreements were signed. There are also indications that India’s sensitivities regarding Colombo’s relations with Beijing are being addressed. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is >set to visit Sri Lanka this week, the first such bilateral visit at the prime ministerial level from India in years. Given this backdrop, it is jarring to note Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s r >emarks seeking to justify the shooting of Indian fishermen who cross the maritime boundary between the two countries. His claim that fishermen found in another country’s territorial waters deserve to be shot, goes against the international policy of looking at such transgressions as civil offences. It also goes against the established bilateral policy of India and Sri Lanka treating the fisheries conflict in the Palk Bay as a humanitarian and livelihood issue to be resolved peacefully. Following Mr. Wickremesinghe’s intriguing remarks in an interview to a Tamil television channel that there would be no shooting incidents if Indian and Sri Lankan fishermen avoided entering each other’s territory, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had to raise the issue at a recent meeting with Mr. Wickremesinghe, and underscore the essential humanitarian nature of the problem. The comparison with India’s approach to the Italian marines case was also inapt as it involved Indian fishermen being shot at from a foreign vessel and had nothing to do with any fisheries conflict.
It is surprising that the Sri Lankan Prime Minister so casually talked about ‘shooting’ when such incidents had subsided considerably in the last decade or so. In recent years, Sri Lanka, in a move that is understandable in the context of trawlers from the Indian side depleting the marine resources in the Sri Lankan waters, has been limiting its actions to arresting fishermen and seizing the trawlers involved. Through a bilateral agreement, the fishermen, too, are released after a short while, even though the detention of the trawlers continue to provoke angry protests in Tamil Nadu. There is little doubt that the root of the problem lies in trawlers from Tamil Nadu entering Sri Lankan waters, and engaging in unsustainable fishing practices using banned equipment. While negotiations between fishermen from both sides are needed before an acceptable solution is reached, any such agreement will necessarily have to involve Indian trawlers being phased out early. The answer may lie in Tamil Nadu fishermen being weaned away from fishing grounds in the limited space in the Palk Bay and Palk Strait and being encouraged to engage in deep-sea fishing.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/striking-a-jarring-note/article6979067.ece
11,3,2015,Penalties and prevention,"The issue of black money elicited hyper-reactions from the BJP in the run-up to the general election last year, and not without reason. For a layperson, >black money is usually associated with the rich. Oftentimes, political parties raise this issue to demonstrate their pro-poor slant. Given these facts, it is no surprise that the BJP government has proposed a slew of legislative actions to tackle the twin issues of assets held illegally abroad and unaccounted wealth within the country. The broad contours of the government’s initiatives on the black money front as sketched out by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his budget speech, provide for stringent punishments. Non-disclosure of and non-payment of tax on foreign assets could land anyone in jail, with a rigorous prison term of up to 10 years. While proposing to make such an offence non-compoundable, Mr. Jaitley has sought to shut the option for such an offender to appeal to the Settlement Commission. Also, the enforcement authorities will be armed with powers to search, seize and prosecute, to bring the recalcitrant ones to book. To tackle the black money issue, the government has decided to bring in a new and comprehensive Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Bill during the current session of Parliament. Since benami deals, especially in real estate, are a major source of black money generation, Mr. Jaitley has trained his focus on them. There is a conscious drive to capture transactions of a certain size in the system by insisting on the use of PAN details.
The proposals no doubt reflect the political underpinnings of the BJP’s thought process on an issue like black money. These will serve to please its core constituency, which voted for it overwhelmingly. Nevertheless, these represent merely an attempt to discover a cure for the disease. The system and the practice as they exist today create a perfect breeding ground for tax evasion. And the tax structure adds to the complication. If the benefit accruing from avoidance is great and the risks of detection are minimal, the tendency to evade tax will persist. Mr. Jaitley’s budget-related proposal will instil fear in the minds of tax-evaders. Also, these could arm taxmen with more powers. Vodafone and like cases are examples of how the taxman has often adopted a blinkered approach. Should the focus not be on erasing the benefits arising out of tax avoidance? Surely, prevention is the right solution. This calls for an environment that fosters tax compliance, and a regime that ushers in a friendly playing field. If any proof is required, it is available in the ongoing coal and spectrum auctions. One needs a wiser head, more than a heavy hand, to tackle the black money menace.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/black-money-issue-penalties-and-prevention/article6979068.ece
12,3,2015,Political price or personal liability?,"The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime suffered immensely from the perception that it was ‘scam-tainted’. However, the cost of such a tag until now was limited to a massive electoral defeat for the Congress and the prosecution of a few who served in it as Ministers. Even then, its detractors often took care to exempt its Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, from personal criminal liability while blaming him for failing to stop his colleagues’ misdemeanours or silently acquiescing in them. It is therefore baffling that >Dr. Singh is being summoned to face criminal prosecution, based solely on material evaluated by a judge, without an investigating agency recording an adverse finding against him. Brushing aside the CBI’s initial attempt to close the case, Special Judge Bharat Parashar has proceeded to take cognisance of criminal charges against Dr. Singh, in his capacity as Minister of Coal in the first UPA regime, the then Coal Secretary P.C. Parakh, and well-known industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla, and three others, in connection with the manner in which Hindalco, an Aditya Birla group company, was accommodated in the Talabira coal block in Odisha, originally meant for Neyveli Lignite Corporation in 2005. Dr. Singh appears to be paying a price for heading a regime that was seen as associated with much wrongdoing. Both he and Mr. Parakh have in the past denied wrongdoing in the Hindalco allocation.
Judge Parashar is forthright in his prima facie conclusion that between the then Secretary, Coal (P.C. Parakh) and Minister of Coal (Dr. Singh), “there was a concerted effort to somehow accommodate M/s Hindalco in Talabira-II coal block” and that it was “the central common objective” of a criminal conspiracy. Held against Dr. Singh is the fact that he allowed the allocation matter to be reopened after he himself had approved the minutes of a screening committee meeting at which it was decided that NLC would get the block. Also, repeated reminders and phone calls had gone from the PMO to the Coal Ministry to expedite the matter. The Supreme Court verdict invalidating all coal block allocations made during the UPA regime highlighted the administrative malaise that gripped its rule. Given the tenor of such verdicts, it was only to be expected that one day Dr. Singh, as its Prime Minister, would be called upon to explain some transaction or defend a criminal charge arising out of it. The summons and impending prosecution show that political accountability is not the only consequence of inaction or the failure to do the right thing when in power. The onus is now on the court to prove that in its summons to the former Prime Minister, it holds Dr. Singh not just politically accountable but personally liable.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/political-price-or-personal-liability/article6983034.ece
12,3,2015,Is Iran stealing Israel’s thunder?,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s > >controversial speech before the Joint Session of the United States Congress in the first week of March was constantly punctuated by applause and rounds of standing ovation. But the content of his speech was familiar and predictable. He continued playing a politics of fear, denouncing Iran as a threat “to the peace of the entire world” and urging Congress to resist the emerging nuclear deal with Iran. U.S. President Barack Obama, on reading the speech transcript, said: “On the core issue, which is how to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon which would make it far more dangerous, the Prime Minister did not offer any viable alternatives.” The event was a spectacle, a public display of differences, both within the United States and between Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu. It is also an instance of rapidly changing geopolitics. There is reasonable hope in the international community, especially among European diplomats, that the nuclear deal may potentially be a viable alternative to the currently adversarial, sanctions-driven relations of the West with Iran. The deal, which may be finalised by the end of March, will attempt to regulate strictly Iran’s ability to produce nuclear fuel for at least ten years, and then gradually ease the restrictions. In turn, the West would ease its sanctions that currently curtail Iran’s oil exports and prevent it from accessing global financial markets. In this context, Mr. Netanyahu’s call for a complete dismantling of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure seems unrealistic, outdated and worthy of being ignored.
Within the U.S., the opposition to Mr. Obama is getting increasingly bitter. Forty-seven Republican Senators sent an open letter to Iran’s leaders on Monday, warning them that any nuclear deal that they sign with President Obama could last only as long as he remains in office, which is until January 2017. To this, Mr. Obama reportedly said: “I think it’s somewhat ironic to see some members of Congress wanting to make common cause with the hard-liners in Iran.” The fact is that as Iran’s clout in the region grows, it is gradually stealing Israel’s thunder. Iran is playing a key role in defending Iraq against the IS onslaught, and the U.S. recognises the value of an Iran-backed militia fighting in Tikrit. Though America is uncomfortable with the Syrian regime, it sees the strategic significance of Iran’s support to Bashar al-Assad in countering IS. So it is IS that is becoming a common cause for the U.S. and Iran, giving reason for a rapprochement. Mr. Netanyahu’s concern is understandable, but when given an opportunity to present his case he has made little of it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/is-iran-stealing-israels-thunder/article6983035.ece
13,3,2015,Creeping danger of intolerance,"First it was the writers, now it is the turn of >television channels to be assaulted in Tamil Nadu. Freedom of speech and expression has seldom been under so much threat. The bomb attack on the office of Tamil TV channel Puthiya Thalaimurai in the early hours of Thursday takes the growing intolerance in our society to new heights. The channel showed trailers last week of a programme it intended to telecast on the relevance of the thali or mangalsutra in contemporary India. It began to receive threatening calls, with callers turning abusive when women answered the phone. The channel decided to call off the show. Even after this, parties such as the Hindu Makkal Katchi and the Hindu Munnani held protests outside its office. A cameraperson recording the protest was assaulted. The State BJP too issued unedifying statements justifying the protests. All this culminated in the bomb attack, which might not have injured anyone but has done great harm to the country’s liberal fabric. The fringe groups behind this have thrown a challenge to the secular and tolerant ethos, and sought to use violence to intimidate liberal sections of society from debating or questioning cultural mores. While the ideological challenge will have to be met politically, the full force of the law should be used to rein in elements out to intimidate media and society.
The thali is a neck ornament worn by Hindu women as a symbol of marriage and a living husband. The show, it appears, would have debated whether battered or abandoned wives still need to wear it. Whether women choose to wear a cultural symbol such as a thali — or, for that matter, a burqa, a veil or a wedding ring — is entirely a matter of personal choice. As a religion, Hinduism has always shown a philosophical indifference to forcing rituals and symbols on its adherents. This incident is one more in a growing list of attempts by fundamentalists to appropriate the personal into the political. Secondly, the targeted show was to be in the nature of a debate, which is by definition a platform for two opposing viewpoints to be aired. Debates that allow a topic to be robustly analysed are an essential part of the public discourse in a democracy. Some years ago, Tamil Nadu saw disgraceful attacks on the film star Khushboo for her remarks on premarital sex. Tamil writers Perumal Murugan and Puliyur Murugesan have been threatened, even as a BBC documentary on the Delhi rape victim was banned nationally. In all these cases, protesters claimed that India’s cultural fabric was under threat. What is really under threat is its millennia-long history of tolerance, broad-mindedness and acceptance of a diverse, multilayered ethos.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/creeping-danger-of-intolerance/article6987126.ece
13,3,2015,"The business end, with optimism","It is fitting that the 30th anniversary of India’s defining victory in the World Championship of Cricket, which was celebrated this week, has coincided with the current team’s stirring run in the World Cup. Sunil Gavaskar’s men had captivated Australia in 1985 with a brand of dynamic cricket that was ahead of its time; M.S. Dhoni’s side hasn’t quite that je ne sais quoi, but it has so far in the tournament shown a similar ability to bowl teams out. India might have entered the World Cup with the air of a monarch about to be deposed — after defeats in the Tests and the tri-series had appeared to shred the team’s confidence — but the past few weeks have witnessed a remarkable turnaround. From the words of captain Dhoni and particularly team director Ravi Shastri, who termed the tri-series “a waste of time and energy”, it is now clear that India was awaiting its moment. Through the tournament, the defending champion has appeared to gain strength incrementally. The team was noticeably sharper and more intense in the field against Pakistan and South Africa; with their toughest opponents in the league stage dealt with early, Dhoni’s men ruthlessly dismissed the UAE and Ireland. The only scare was caused by the West Indies, but the calmest man in world cricket — Dhoni — ensured there was no panic.
Hearteningly, India has ticked the many boxes that matter in a global tournament: solid, explosive batting; restrictive, wicket-taking bowling, backed up in the field; game-toughness under pressure. Particularly impressive is the team’s handling of mental fatigue — Virat Kohli recently said that Suresh Raina reminded him of having spent 100 days in Australia. Unlike hosts Australia and New Zealand, whose players have had the time to recover in the comfort of their own homes, India’s cricketers have had to recuperate on the road. Shikhar Dhawan, who has a home in Melbourne, is an exception of course. There’s no doubt that that has played a part in his resurrection. After a middling tour of Australia till the World Cup, Dhawan found form and, with 333 runs, is currently fourth on the scorers’ list. The bowlers, who did not look like they could buy a wicket at one stage, have improved beyond sight. Mohammed Shami (12 wickets) and spinner R. Ashwin (11) are among the top ten, but the entire bowling unit has worked together, finding both consistency and potency. India has done well in different situations and varied conditions, increasing its unbeaten World Cup streak to nine — five on the trot in 2015, four in 2011. A likely quarter final against Bangladesh does not appear taxing, but complacency has no place in the knockouts. India does not have Australia’s abundance of match-winners, but if it plays to potential in the business end, it will be an incredibly hard side to beat.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-business-end-with-optimism/article6987125.ece
14,3,2015,The price of clinging to power,"Neither the ruling United Democratic Front nor the Opposition Left Democratic Front can escape blame for the >violence and chaos within the Kerala Assembly during the presentation of the Budget by Finance Minister K.M. Mani. With the LDF members insisting that they would not allow Mr. Mani, who is under a cloud following allegations that he accepted a bribe from liquor bar operators, to present the Budget, and Chief Minister Oommen Chandy intent on defending the Minister, the stage was set for bedlam. It resulted in the Speaker’s chair being thrown down, and the budget speech ending in just six minutes. Mr. Mani’s continuance in the Cabinet had become politically untenable after a case of corruption was registered against him, but Mr. Chandy could not afford to alienate the Kerala Congress (M) led by him which, with its nine MLAs, was in a position to make or break the government, surviving on the thinnest of majorities as it is. It is unfortunate that he has chosen short-term political interest over principles of ensuring transparency and probity in public life. Mr. Mani has been allowed to wield his political clout to his own advantage. Although there is no legal bar on his continuing as Minister, Mr. Mani should have stepped down as a matter of propriety to allow for an impartial investigation into the charges by the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau, free from any interference.
While the demand for Mr. Mani’s resignation is no doubt politically legitimate, the LDF members led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) ought not to have escalated their protest to the levels they took it to inside and outside the Assembly. Instead of storming the Speaker’s podium and engaging in scuffles with treasury bench members and watch and ward staff, they ought to have made full use of the Assembly as a forum to debate the bribery charges. The death of an LDF worker outside the Assembly during the protests and clashes with the police, provide further reminders of the need to keep the political discourse within the limits of civility and legislative and parliamentary decorum. The crisis in Kerala will not go away until Mr. Chandy finds a way to keep Mr. Mani out, without having to sacrifice his government. If he is unable to persuade his Minister to see reason, he certainly cannot expect the Opposition to rise above political partisanship. The more Mr. Chandy is seen as ignoring political propriety to cling to power, the more he will be surrendering the political advantage to the LDF. If Mr. Mani is not persuaded to step down quickly, it is Mr. Chandy who will have to pay the price politically.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-price-of-clinging-to-power/article6991179.ece
14,3,2015,Paranoia at work,"The government has been growingly defensive, almost paranoid, about those non-governmental organisations and activists challenging its policies and programmes. In the instance of Greenpeace activist >Priya Pillai, it went as far as labelling her “anti-national”. The Delhi High Court’s intervention, >quashing and setting aside a Look-Out Circular (LOC) issued by the government against her, was a much-needed step. Ms. Pillai, who was seeking to travel to the U.K. on January 11, was detained at immigration at the New Delhi airport and prevented from leaving the country, with no immediate explanation provided for the action. As is now known, the LOC was issued on the basis of a unilateral direction by the Intelligence Bureau (IB), without hearing out Ms. Pillai. The IB issued the arbitrary order under a clause meant exclusively for “CI [counter-intelligence] suspects, terrorists, anti-national elements, etc.”. What exactly did the government assume was anti-national about her visit? That her activity had the potential to denigrate India in the eyes of foreign nations, leading to a regression in economic activity? As the court has noted, Ms. Pillai was travelling to meet British parliamentarians to exert moral pressure on the U.K.-based Essar Energy, which was working with a joint venture company, Mahan Coal, whose projects were seen to be affecting tribals in Madhya Pradesh.
Justice Rajiv Shakdher took the view that the right to travel abroad was a fundamental right, flowing from the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution. This right cannot be curtailed by an executive decision, but only by “enacted law”. The Judge held that the government’s disapproval of the views of civil rights activists expressed at an international forum would not be reason enough to stifle them. To consider Ms. Pillai to be anti-national just because her views might “negatively” impact the image of India “is completely untenable”, he held. Significantly, a somewhat similar argument about protecting India’s image was heard during the controversy surrounding the documentary, India’s Daughter. BJP Member of Parliament Meenakshi Lekhi in fact said the documentary would deter tourism. The IB’s views on NGOs are known. An IB report apparently sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that expressed anxiety over foreign funding NGOs apparently received for opposing development projects, has been widely criticised. In January, the Delhi High Court directed the removal of a freeze on Greenpeace India’s bank account, as the government had not brought any “evidence on record” to support its action. The latest judgment comes as a victory for NGOs that seek to question certain economic policies and provide alternative voices — without necessarily endorsing the ways of all of them.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/priya-pillai-issue-paranoia-at-work/article6991174.ece
16,3,2015,Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka,"As he >inaugurated the reconstructed Northern Province railway line during his two-day, four-city visit to Sri Lanka, Prime Minister Narendra Modi signalled in more ways than one that he would like to flag off a new start to India-Sri Lanka ties, that could put them on track to the “golden chapter” that he had promised earlier. Mr. Modi has done well to focus on strengthening India’s historical links with Sri Lanka, invoking the ancient ethnic, linguistic and religious ties that bind them. His careful emphasis on India’s support for a “united” Sri Lanka was deeply appreciated given the mistrust in Sri Lanka of perceived Indian intrusiveness, riding on concerns over the Tamil question. Yet, Mr. Modi struck the right resonances during the historic first prime ministerial visit to Jaffna, which clearly >struck a chord with the Sri Lankan Tamil community there. He also stressed the need to go beyond the Thirteenth Amendment in terms of the political empowerment of the Tamil minority. There was another message, equally powerful, in the flagging-off and in the inauguration of a slew of projects: that of an Indian intent to deliver on its promises of development. The rail line is one of the regrettably few major Indian infrastructure projects to have been completed in the post-war period. Projects such as the Kankesanthurai port, the Sampur power plant and the construction of homes have been delayed by tardy Sri Lankan government clearances, but a bulk of the blame for the lack of progress must lie with Indian inefficiency. India cannot cavil at Chinese investment in the island unless it is able to finish its own projects on time.
Significantly, during his official meetings the Prime Minister refrained from the kind of showmanship that often hangs over Indian approaches to Sri Lanka, typically signalling an assertion of strategic primacy in the subcontinent and the Indian Ocean region. The >agreements signed in Sri Lanka were minor ones, and already in the pipeline. This could help the Sirisena government ward off allegations of being too India-centric. There were some critical comments in the Sri Lankan media over the fact that four high-level visits between New Delhi and Colombo have taken place in less than 60 days, with one newspaper calling it “too much too soon”. It was possibly this apprehension that was reflected in the controversial remarks on India by Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and some other members of his Cabinet just before Mr. Modi’s visit, and the Indian Prime Minister did well in not reacting to them. India must start a fresh chapter with Sri Lanka as that country emerges from a troubled and turbulent phase. Gently offering a hand of friendship while reminding Colombo that its promises to the Tamil minority must be kept, would serve India’s strategic interests well. That would also help enhance India’s image as the leading democracy in the region.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/modis-visit-to-sri-lanka/article6996280.ece
16,3,2015,The promise of insurance reform,"With the Rajya Sabha >passing the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, the Narendra Modi-led BJP government must be feeling strengthened. The Bill crossed the final hurdle only because its principal bête noire, the Congress, allowed its passage. That it took over six years for Parliament to give its assent to such a widely-anticipated step on the insurance front illustrates the sharp divide — not necessarily ideological — between the two principal players in Indian politics. Convergence of views very often does not lead to a consensus — for obvious political reasons. Nonetheless, the shadow-boxing between these two major national parties has helped trigger a high-voltage debate on the need for reform in the insurance space. The stakes go beyond the political and business constituencies. Insurance reform is only one of the measures the Modi administration is banking on as part of its growth strategy. But the constant polarisation on political lines on key issues is slowing the traction on important fronts and causing uncertainty, that tells on the economy.
Now that the way is clear for 49 per cent foreign holding in an insurance company, will the country see a flood of foreign direct investment? At the moment, the field is laid a lot easier for players. The operating environment has been redesigned to facilitate foreign investors to engage in the long-haul game. Insurance penetration in India, life and non-life put together, was just about 3.9 per cent in 2013, up from 2.3 per cent in 2000, according to Economic Survey 2014-15. This reveals the extent of opportunities available. Interestingly, according to the Survey, private insurers saw a 1.4 per cent decline in their premium in 2013-14 even as the Life Insurance Corporation recorded 13.5 per cent growth. These numbers tell a tale of their own. For long, insurance has been viewed only as a tax-saving tool. The protection element still has not seeped into the mind of the common person. Changing the mindset and spreading the net will involve much time and enormous cost. Competition could invigorate the field by providing greater access and more products at fair prices. Given the dynamics of the Indian marketplace, foreign players could bring to the table new dimensions. The experience elsewhere — as in the automobile industry — suggests that competition makes the consumer demanding. Surely, the Indian insurance field requires a more aggressive customer. The passage of the Insurance Bill will indeed go a long way in reconfiguring India’s position in the global marketplace.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-promise-of-insurance-reform/article6996281.ece
17,3,2015,Leaving beef bans to the States,"Even as some of its State units — within and outside government — have shown a zeal in seeking to toughen laws on cow slaughter, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has nationally been more guarded about the issue. The BJP government in Haryana >announced that it is instituting a law that provides for a 10-year prison sentence for those caught slaughtering cattle. In doing so, it has taken its cue from its counterpart in Maharashtra which >extended the ban on cow slaughter to all cattle, even as two other BJP-ruled States, Jharkhand and Rajasthan, are considering similar legislation. Reports also suggest that in West Bengal — a State that permits cow slaughter with a “fit for slaughter” certificate — the BJP State unit is seeking to deploy vigilante groups to prevent the ferrying of cows to Bangladesh for slaughter. This activist zeal by the BJP in the States contrasts with the party’s national position. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi had attacked the “pink revolution” — the export of cattle meat — during last year’s general election, his government has not changed its meat export policy since then. That policy prohibits the export of the meat of cows, bulls, calves, any milching bovine or calves less than four months old. Only the meat of non-milching buffaloes, along with that of goats, is allowed to be exported.
Even though most States, except Kerala and parts of the northeast, have laws of varying degree banning cow slaughter, it is a sensitive subject. Beef and buffalo meat are sources of cheap protein not just among sections of the minorities, but also for poor Hindus. The BJP has also not forgotten a speech made in the Lok Sabha by the late G.G. Swell, an MP from Meghalaya, in 1996 during the party’s 13-day tenure in government. On that occasion, Swell spoke about the intolerance of the BJP and its inability to accept that in parts of India, including large swathes in the northeast, beef is a cultural, culinary preference. More recently, in Kerala, leaders belonging to the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have described the efforts by BJP-ruled States as a “sign of increasing encroachment of personal liberty and democratic freedom”. While Central ministers have ruled out a Central law as livestock is a State subject, even hardline Hindutva-oriented BJP MPs like Yogi Adityanath say that it is important to let the government focus on development for some more time. The national executive of the BJP has remained silent on the issue since its government came to power. Clearly, the party will calibrate its position on the issue in the long run, not letting it distract attention from its reforms agenda.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/leaving-beef-bans-to-the-states/article7000180.ece
17,3,2015,Mr. Modi’s ocean view,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has used >his visits to Seychelles and Mauritius — besides Sri Lanka — to enunciate a proactive vision of India’s interests and responsibilities in this sensitive region. It is indeed the clearest expression yet by an Indian leader of what the Indian Ocean and the region around it mean for Delhi. “We seek a future for Indian Ocean that lives up to the name of SAGAR — Security and Growth for All in the Region,” Mr. Modi said, l >aunching the offshore patrol vessel MCGS Barracuda in Mauritius on March 12. “Our goal is to seek a climate of trust and transparency; respect for international maritime rules and norms by all countries; sensitivity to each other’s interests; peaceful resolution of maritime security issues; and increase in maritime cooperation.” In a sense, India has now stepped out of the closet to engage with the wider Indian Ocean region, stressing that its security interests are critical. After all, the perpetrators of one of the worst terror attacks in the country’s history, Mumbai 2008, came by sea.
By inviting Seychelles and Mauritius to join the existing maritime security cooperation arrangement among India, the Maldives and Sri Lanka, the Prime Minister signalled that Delhi was ready to play a pre-eminent role in the region. Mr. Modi has batted for the creation of a strong regional grouping around the Indian Ocean. However, India’s record in building multilateral institutions has been poor — the Indian Ocean Rim Association is a case in point. Good and stated intentions by themselves are not enough to convince partners that India is willing to bear the burden of their security and economic expectations. Mr. Modi’s diplomatic calendar has been full and he is still very much within the grace period normally allowed to a government to match vision with reality. But India’s diplomatic and security establishments, unused to working together, must be enabled to work in tandem if Delhi is to make a lasting impact in the Indian Ocean region and beyond. Given that the Indian Ocean channels carry two-thirds of the world’s oil shipments, a third of the bulk cargo and half of all container traffic, the region’s strategic significance is unquestionable. And India’s commitment to “shape its future” can only be welcomed. Without referring to China and the United States, the Prime Minister said India had to recognise that there were “other nations around the world” with a strong interest and stakes in the region. A higher profile for India in the region is not necessarily a zero-sum game given the challenges it faces. For example, climate change is an issue Mr. Modi flagged both in Mauritius and Seychelles. A more confident India must play its role in the region — defending its interests but acting in cooperation with others.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mr-modis-ocean-view/article7000182.ece
18,3,2015,‘Conspiracy’ as an easy way out,"There is something seriously problematic about the state of affairs in the Trinamool Congress (TMC)-run West Bengal. Three days following the >gang rape of an elderly nun belonging to the Convent of Jesus and Mary school in Ranaghat in Nadia district, by dacoits, arrests of the culprits are yet to be made. Rather than acknowledging the seriousness of the problem of crimes against women in the State, the State government has yet again sought to politicise the issue, initially insinuating “religious fanaticism” to be responsible for the crime. Later, the Chief Minister blamed the Opposition — the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Bharatiya Janata Party — for what turned out to be spontaneous protests against the incident in Ranaghat. This is not to suggest that the robbery and rape incident in Ranaghat could not have been a “hate crime”, a number of which have been reported in other parts of the country recently. But for the government to jump the gun even before apprehending any of the culprits just to score political brownie points is unacceptable.
West Bengal, according to latest statistics released by the National Crime Records Bureau, ranked third in absolute numbers of crimes against women and among the high-ranking States in incidences of rape in 2013. However the State cannot be singled out. The issue of rape and other crimes against women is a national one and protests against the Delhi rape incident in 2012 have steadily turned the gaze on law enforcement agencies to effect better responses to these crimes. What sets the TMC government — and Ms Banerjee in particular — apart is its refusal to subject these issues to serious scrutiny and escape into conspiracy theories. Ms Banerjee’s response to the incident in 2012 in Park Street, Kolkata involving the gang rape of Suzette Jordan — who succumbed to encephalitis recently — was to term it a “made up incident” against her government. Her party colleagues dismissed the rape allegation and also cast aspersions on Ms Jordan’s character. The police official in charge of the investigation of the incident was transferred after affirming that it was indeed gang rape. Meanwhile the main accused in the rape case is yet to be apprehended by the Kolkata police nearly three years since the incident. While crimes against women are indeed a societal issue, there is much that the State could do apart from prevention. The State police should not be encumbered by political pressures as it sets out to bring culprits to book. The Chief Minister’s continued reliance on conspiracy theories lends to unnecessary politicisation which leads to a dangerous drift even as it renders law enforcement agencies ineffective.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/conspiracy-as-an-easy-way-out/article7004086.ece
18,3,2015,Battling tribunals,"A Division Bench of the Madras High Court struck down key provisions relating to the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) established under the Trade Marks Act, 1999, as unconstitutional. This is yet another interlude in the tussle between judiciary and the legislature on the “tribunalisation” of courts. There has been much concern over the validity, character and competence of several of the tribunals in India. The Supreme Court has, in a range of decisions, articulated the principles that a tribunal has to abide by in order to be constitutionally valid. A Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy report (2014) has identified about 29 different tribunals set up under various Central legislations, and finds several of them to be inconsistent with the parameters laid down by the Supreme Court. The Court in Chandra Kumar (1997) and NCLT (2010) suggested that the tribunals which were replacing the jurisdiction of the Courts should enjoy the same constitutional protections as them. This meant that when the jurisdiction is being transferred from a court to a tribunal, the members of this tribunal should hold a rank, status and capacity which is as close to those of the judges in a court as possible. The recent Supreme Court judgment which struck down the National Tax Tribunals (NTT) also clearly spelt out the parameters to test the constitutionality of tribunals. Yet, little effort has been made by the legislature in making the law consistent with these constitutional principles. Instead, as the honourable judges have noted, the government continues to be “furtive” and “reticent” about these precedents while the tribunals usurp judicial powers.
At stake are core principles of an independent judiciary and separation of powers, a part of the basic structure of the Constitution. The crux of the present case is with regard to the qualification and selection of Chairman, Judicial Member and Technical Member of the IPAB. For instance, Section 85(3)(a) of the Trade Marks Act allows members of the Indian Legal Service holding a post of Grade 1 for at least three years, for appointment as a Judicial Member of the IPAB. The High Court declared this unconstitutional, suggesting that an officer working with the Executive cannot act in a judicial capacity. It also, inter alia, held that the recommendations of the Chief Justice of India for the post of Chairman had to be given due consideration by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), which until now considered this as a mere suggestion ultimately requiring its own approval. Tribunals are designed for speedy disposal of specialised disputes. But a tribunal which is biased, incompetent and unfair, cause more harm than serve such intended purposes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/battling-tribunals/article7004087.ece
19,3,2015,Determining backwardness,"Sometimes political mobilisation and not socio-educational backwardness decides the distribution of the benefits of reservation for specific communities in education and jobs. While striking down the inclusion of Jats in the Central list of Other Backward Classes (OBC), the Supreme Court voiced its opposition to the State’s tendency to go by the “perception of the self-proclaimed socially backward class” in deciding the beneficiaries of reservation quotas. The Jats spread across nine States are relatively more prosperous than many other communities in northern India but they used their numerical superiority to influence and pressure the government into including them in the OBC quota. The state should not be influenced by political considerations and it must exercise great care in identifying emerging forms of backwardness. Past mistakes or “wrong inclusions” in the reservation list, according to the judgment, could not be the basis for further additions. However, the court was careful not to dismiss any change to the list of OBCs. On the contrary, Justice Ranjan Gogoi who wrote the judgment directed the government to recognise emerging socially and educationally backward groups such as transgenders, who are among the most distressed, for the grant of reservation benefits. The judgment is thus important not only for its articulation of the rationale for identifying the groups that need to be kept out of the reservation system — politically dominant and economically prosperous caste groups — but also for its support for the inclusion of heavily disadvantaged groups such as transgenders, who cannot ordinarily be classified as a social class.
Closely linked to the setting of norms for identifying new groups for reservation benefits is the court’s downplaying of the importance of caste in deciding reservation benefits. While caste was indeed a prominent reason for historical injustice in the country, it could not be the sole decider of backwardness of a class. Instead, new practices, methods and yardsticks would have to be continuously evolved moving away from the caste-centric definition of backwardness, the court ruled. Surely, the fact that the previous United Progressive Alliance government notified the reservation for Jats despite advice to the contrary from the National Commission for Backward Classes played no small part in counter-posing historical injustice to emerging forms of backwardness in a changing society. But the question that arises is about the exclusion of castes and social groups already in the reservation list in a continuously evolving society. The court might have left a small opening for revisiting the whole list of reservation beneficiaries in the light of new socio-economic realities.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/determining-backwardness/article7008151.ece
19,3,2015,Just not funny,"The issue of women’s empowerment often gets reduced to mere discussions on sexual violence against women. Rather than obsessing on it as if it were the only concern, it is necessary to put in place macro-policies and change social perspectives on female empowerment in a holistic manner. The persisting failure to do this was brought into sharp focus last week when Janata Dal (United) chief >Sharad Yadav made a comment in Parliament on dark-skinned South Indian women, saying that they are ‘as beautiful as their bodies’ and adding that they ‘know dance’. On the surface, it sounds merely facetious, but such statements are dangerously wrong at several levels. The first question that arises is why during a debate on the Insurance Bill the member would find it necessary to drag in a comment about women at all. It was hardly apposite to the occasion or relevant to the issue being discussed. It trivialises women and sends out the message that flippant remarks about women, their skin colour or bodies are par for the course. Second, the remark comes in the wake of several denigrating comments about women made by members of Parliament and senior politicians — across the political spectrum — in the last couple of years alone. To make matters worse, Sharad Yadav responded to Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani’s criticism with the highly offensive comment, “I know what you are.” After days of defiance, he was >forced to clarify that remark on Tuesday.
Rajya Sabha MP Kanimozhi has rightly said that she felt frustrated by the number of people who have tried to downplay the remark by saying it was a ‘compliment’ to South Indian women. Therein lies the bigger problem — the complete lack of awareness that condescending jokes or remarks about women reveal as much about deeply-ingrained patriarchal attitudes as do overt acts of violence or domination. The senior political establishment in the country constantly betrays this lack of understanding of what constitutes non-discriminatory attitudes to women. And their stance exposes how deep the problem really runs. It is one of the biggest reasons why women continue to get a raw deal in police stations and court rooms, in workplaces and homes. Besides laws that address women’s safety, what is urgently needed is a code of conduct or set of rules that will apply to public officials and politicians, which can ensure that gender-biased comments and jokes are weeded out of the public discourse. Parliament is hardly the place for misplaced and misogynistic levity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/just-not-funny/article7008150.ece
20,3,2015,Status quo in Israel,"The re-election of Prime Minister Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu after his Likud Party >secured the first place with 30 out of the 120 seats in the 2015 Israeli legislative elections came as a bit of a surprise. Exit polls pointing to a better showing by the centrist-moderate coalition, the Zionist Union including the Labour Party, turned out to be wrong as the Likud emerged with far more votes than what was expected. While the Likud lacks a majority of its own, it now gets the right to form the government in coalition with other parties, and it is clear that Mr. Netanyahu will be Prime Minister for a fourth term. The Likud victory, belying expectations, can be attributed to the polarising campaign led by Mr. Netanyahu who took a hyper-racist position denouncing Israeli Arabs and rejecting, in the run-up to the polls, the statehood demand by Palestinians. The triumph of the right wing also reflects the sharp change in attitudes in Israeli society that has become militantly opposed to any gesture of substantive peace with Palestinians. The silver lining in the elections was the emergence of the Joint List — a group of leftist and Arab parties — as the third largest grouping with 13 seats in the Knesset. Israeli Arabs have a larger and more inclusive voice in the Knesset than before.
Globally, Mr. Netanyahu’s victory must frustrate even Israel’s closest ally, the United States, which was unable to dissuade the Israelis from the brutal bombardment of Gaza in 2014. A hardliner victory in Israel as the U.S. is battling the Islamic State hardly helps the larger strategic plan of easing tensions in West Asia. The U.S. has expressly supported a two-state solution and it must be worried by Mr. Netanyahu’s explicit rejection of Palestine nationhood during the election campaign. The U.S. could support a UN resolution explicitly defining a Palestinian state with pre-1967 borders as a response to Mr. Netanyahu’s change of views, but it is perhaps unlikely to happen. The U.S. is currently engaged in complex negotiations with Israel’s geopolitical rival Iran towards a nuclear treaty and would not want to upset its special relationship with Israel. Mr. Netanyahu’s allies go far beyond the White House and the U.S. State Department, with the powerful pro-Israel lobby spread across bipartisan lines in the U.S., especially in the resurgent Republican party. However, Mr. Netanyahu’s uninhibited Zionist chauvinism might actually work to persuade western actors beyond the U.S. to see the Palestinian point of view on issues such as illegal Israeli settlements or the UN according statehood to the Palestinian Authority.

20,3,2015,Perils abroad,"The >brutal murder of an Indian national, Prabha Arun Kumar, in Sydney on March 7 has reignited debates around the safety of Indians abroad. The spate of violent attacks on Indians in Australia over the past decade has persistently fuelled nagging tensions in India-Australia relations, puncturing the sense of optimism that had emerged on that front. Ruling out racial motivation behind the attack, >Australia has promised that the perpetrators of the crime would be brought to justice; a special detective squad has been assigned to investigate it. But given Australia’s generally lackadaisical response in such contexts in the past, India has reason to be sceptical of these promises. The series of attacks on Indian students about half a decade ago had been severely condemned by India. The government had questioned the effectiveness of the steps taken then by the Australian authorities, and issued a “restrained travel advisory”, asking Indian students to take basic precautions in being alert to their own security. The insensitivity shown by Australian officials — who were often in denial mode — in responding to these attacks had come to notice in India at that time. So one can only hope that External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj’s recent call to her Australian counterparts for complete cooperation in resolving the issue is met with the needed level of seriousness at least this time.
The tragic event will, it is to be hoped, lead to a broader debate concerning the conditions of Indians abroad. First, the government can consider adopting “smart” means to ensure the safety of Indians while abroad, especially in times of crisis. For instance, Britain’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) had, in 2008, set up a ‘Locate’ system to act as a people-tracking register. This has now been replaced by a country-specific alert system, via email, Twitter and Facebook. Second, the Indian government has often been criticised for not doing enough about the conditions Indian migrant workers face abroad. For instance, a 2014 Amnesty International report lays forth the human rights abuses encountered by Indian migrant workers in Saudi Arabia. By means of diplomatic pressure and bilateral agreements, the Indian government has to ensure that these migrant workers are not denied any of their labour rights as provided under international law. Third, an ethical discourse on the conditions of Indians abroad has to simultaneously involve an inward gaze on how Indians have been treating their own guests from overseas. Just last week, a mob in Bengaluru chased and attacked Africans in their suburban locality. With racial prejudices, delays and inefficiencies at play, the criminal justice system often proves unequal to the task of coming to the aid of many such foreign citizens while in India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/prabha-arun-kumar-case-perils-abroad/article7012196.ece
21,3,2015,For a free and fair investigation,"The indication from the government of Karnataka that >it would request the Central Bureau of Investigation to go into the suspicious circumstances of the death of the former Deputy Commissioner of Kolar district, D.K. Ravi, must be welcomed. This belated decision by the Congress-led government is an outcome of a huge public outcry with both the polity and civil society in the State playing a major role in pressuring the government to take the help of the CBI. After all, the police’s and the Criminal Investigation Department’s probes were hamstrung by the undue haste shown by the State government in declaring that Mr. Ravi’s death was a case of suicide, and by selective leaks from its officials ruling out foul play in the death. Meanwhile, the feeding frenzy of sections of the media, and the Opposition’s reliance on narrow-minded politicking have certainly not helped clarify the circumstances leading to Mr. Ravi’s death. Both the government and the Opposition have rushed to conclusions that suit their respective political positions. Yet, in a roundabout manner, the undue attention and political bickering raised the pitch in getting the State government to take the right step of instituting an unbiased inquiry.
Whether the CBI can do a better job of disentangling the complexities behind the death will not be known immediately, but the role of Mr. Ravi as someone who took on powerful vested interests in Kolar district must figure in the investigations. Such a free and fair investigation by the CBI will be helped by the fact that it would be unencumbered by the baggage of politics in Karnataka, unlike in the case of a probe by the State police and the CID. Mr. Ravi clearly seems to have made a lot of enemies out of powerful people in Kolar by taking a conscientious position in upholding the public interest as a civil servant. His legacy — during a 14-month tenure in Kolar — included passing strictures against encroachment of government land, and taking on powerful real estate developers who had close ties with political outfits in the district. It is hoped that the outrage in Karnataka is not limited to the sensationalism that has been whipped up around Mr. Ravi’s death. His passing away should prompt us to hold a mirror up to society and bring in scrutiny over the actions of these vested interests while encouraging other civil servants to be as discerning and public-spirited as Mr. Ravi was. Only this would be a true tribute to the legacy left behind by the civil servant.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-dk-ravis-death-for-a-free-and-fair-investigation/article7016167.ece
21,3,2015,National policy for Upper Houses?,"The desirability of a bicameral legislature at the State level has been debated since the days of the Constituent Assembly, and recent developments may revive the debate. Assam and Rajasthan want to join the small seven-member club of States (Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh) with a Legislative Council in the country and Odisha is also examining the creation of one. A second chamber has always been attractive to those who believe in widening the space for representative democracy. Its advocates say wiser counsel from an upper House of elders is needed to temper the often fractious nature of the debate in the Lower House. Also, the second chamber helps in accommodating more sections of society in the process of legislation and decision-making. Detractors, however, contend that the Council is nothing but a body to accommodate various political interests within a party, a backdoor way into the legislature for those who lose direct elections. Recent experience suggests that even Chief Ministers choose the Legislative Council route when the option is available. Does the fact that an upper House exists in seven States, with two or three more keen to join that list, really indicate that there is merit in having a Council?
There is little doubt that a second chamber will be a useful forum to play an advisory role in legislative matters. However, the fact remains that it can also be a tool in the hands of those in power to accommodate their favourites or defeated party functionaries. Also, there is no consensus even within States on its necessity. In Tamil Nadu, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam abolished the Council in 1986, and strongly opposes moves by its rival Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam to revive it. Parliament has already passed legislation to revive the chamber in Tamil Nadu, but it is yet to be implemented. In Andhra Pradesh, the Telugu Desam Party government abolished the Council in 1985, but a Congress regime revived it in 2007. This was why a senior member in the UPA Cabinet cautioned the government against supporting the then DMK regime’s proposal to revive the Council in the absence of a consensus. A parliamentary committee, examining the Rajasthan and Assam bills relating to creation of the Legislative Council, suggested that there should be a national policy on having a permanent second chamber so that a subsequent government cannot abolish it at its whim. This is a better way to address the issue instead of relying on ad hocism. While framing such a policy, it will also have to be decided whether the time and resources involved in having a second chamber is worth the while, and if so, whether the present scheme of giving representation to teachers and graduates requires modification to involve other sections.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-national-policy-for-upper-houses/article7016168.ece
23,3,2015,Doubts notwithstanding...,"When Union Finance Minister >Arun Jaitley defended the Central Statistical Office (CSO) strongly last week in the Rajya Sabha, he was essentially responding to the incredulity with which politicians and economists alike have in recent times reacted to India’s reworked growth numbers. A new methodology, unveiled toward the end of January by the CSO, presented a rosier picture of the Indian economy than previously imagined. It, for instance, indicated a growth in gross domestic product of 6.9 per cent in 2013-14, quite a jump from the 4.7 per cent estimated earlier. Growth rates for earlier years were upgraded too. To be fair, a lot has changed from the old framework, and it is no minor tweak. One change made relates to the base year, on which comparisons are made. Two, there is now an attempt to capture value addition, rather than growth through volumes, in the calculation of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Three, data from newer, more sophisticated corporate databases have been used. Four, GDP will be measured at market prices, by adding taxes to and reducing subsidies from what used to be the main measure till now, GDP at factor cost. All these changes, many experts acknowledge, are important for Indian metrics to match international ones. Still, there is something discordant about the rosy numbers, on the one hand, and the economic lethargy on the ground, on the other. The high growth projection of 7.4 per cent for 2014-15 somehow seems out of sync with low industrial production, poor corporate performance and less-than-expected tax collections.
That’s why even economists were stumped by the extent of the changes. In the >Economic Survey, preceding the Budget, Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian noted that the numbers were “puzzling”. He >cautioned against interpreting it as evidence of a surging economy. The controversy also quickly acquired a political colour, unsurprising because it did now seem that the final years of the United Progressive Alliance government saw far healthier growth than it was thought then. Also, the campaign of Narendra Modi in the run-up to the 2014 parliamentary elections focussed a good deal on what he called the mismanagement of the economy. Then, there were commentators who compared India with China, not only on the point of growth but also less generously on the issue of disputed official data, which the latter is so often accused of fudging. It is in this context that Mr. Jaitley’s defence of the CSO needs to be seen. Yes, it may do little to ease the doubts of experts who feel there are discrepancies in data. But by calling the statistical body a “credible” and independent organisation, which needed to be reiterated, the Finance Minister has, at the least, sent the right political message.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/doubts-notwithstanding/article7020973.ece
23,3,2015,Persisting acts of intolerance,"The Supreme Court last week agreed to hear a plea for a direction to seek an explanation from the Uttar Pradesh government for the >arrest of a Class XII student for allegedly posting on Facebook “objectionable” comments about Samajwadi Party legislator and State Minister Azam Khan. This is of a piece with a series of incidents involving efforts to curb free speech on the Internet by invoking Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000. The Section, which provides for punishment to persons sending offensive messages through any communication device, is arguably in patent violation of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. It makes punishable, inter alia, any communication that may be “grossly offensive” or “menacing in character”, or may cause “annoyance” and “inconvenience”. Petitions challenging the constitutionality of this law have argued that these terms are too “vague” and “ambiguous”, yielding unbounded scope for arbitrary use of power by officials who may interpret the terms as they deem fit. Article 19(2) permits reasonable restrictions on free speech on grounds of “public order, decency or morality”, but by no stretch of interpretation could content that is of a “menacing character” or causes “annoyance” be said to fall within the scope of such reasonableness. Several petitions have been filed challenging the validity of this law, and the Supreme Court has reserved its verdict.
These arrests reflect the fact that the law was poorly drafted. More significantly, these show the intolerance and blatant abuse of power by politicians across party lines, and their efforts to manipulate the law to stifle dissent and criticism. This provision was inserted as an amendment in 2008 by the United Progressive Alliance government, and the present National Democratic Alliance regime continues to favour it, saying the law was intended to “regulate the use of cyberspace” and not to curb free speech. But the facts clearly call the bluff on such justifications. This is reflected in a number of arrests of netizens in the last five years for critical remarks on politicians. Mr. Azam Khan, who was so offended by what the school student had posted, unleashed the force of Section 66A and the police for his immediate arrest. The student was eventually released on bail. One can only hope that the Supreme Court will act towards ultimately strengthening the foundations of free speech by striking down this untenable clause of the IT Act. This will be the surest way to halt the blatant misuse of power by the political class with respect to free speech on the Internet.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/persisting-acts-of-intolerance/article7020974.ece
24,3,2015,Disquieting injustice,"The maxim “justice delayed is justice denied” must seem like a tired cliché to the relatives of the 42 Muslim men who fell prey to bullets, allegedly fired by members of the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC), and other survivors in Hashimpura in Meerut sometime in May 1987. The fact that it required 28 years to arrive at a court decision in the Hashimpura massacre is itself enough to suggest that justice has been thoroughly denied to the victims of the gruesome crime. On May 22, 1987, the PAC allegedly picked up dozens of Muslims, mainly youth, after curfew was imposed in Meerut city. Within days, 40 among them were found dead in the Ganga Canal in Ghaziabad district. It took nine years to file a charge sheet against 19 PAC personnel (the key individuals were allegedly spared), four more to arrest 16 of them in June 2000 when they finally surrendered after years spent in active service without being apprehended for their alleged crimes. In 2002, the case was transferred to a Delhi court and it took four years for charges to be filed against the accused. Thirteen years later, on March 21st, the 19 accused were let free due to lack of sufficient evidence and the inability of the witnesses to identify the accused.
This travesty of justice to the victims of the massacre is not surprising considering the shoddiness in the much delayed probe into it. Lawyers appearing for the victims and rights activists have, for a long time, complained about the loss of evidence that could have helped frame the accused circumstantially. Various police records, details related to the arms and ammunition used against the victims, logs, were all reported to have been missing after all these years since the incident. With such a botched up investigation by the police and a series of apathetic governments in UP regardless of political affiliations doing little to secure a case for the victims, the present outcome must surely be a blot on the Indian judicial process. The full judgement is not yet out as we go to press, but the victims have vowed to appeal to higher courts to seek justice. The Hashimpura massacre of Meerut's Muslims is an example of India's recent blighted past when police action and composition were known to be communalised at least in States like Uttar Pradesh. Since the late 1980s, there have been many police reforms but the record in handling communal violence has been mixed. Clearly, there need to be more substantive changes in policing and the nature of the judicial process if India’s citizens from the minority community are to be reassured of the secular nature of the Indian state and the justness of its judicial system.

24,3,2015,Liberating black gold,"The passing of the >Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2015 and the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Bill, 2015 marks a significant step forward in the Central government’s reforms push. It effectively ends government monopoly over the extraction of coal, which has existed after coal mining was nationalised in 1973. Parliamentary approval for the auction of coal blocks — effected through an ordinance that the Bill now replaces — also provides closure to one of the biggest scandals to have rocked the country in recent times: the allocation of 204 coal blocks to private parties, which the Supreme Court had cancelled on the grounds that the allocation process was arbitrary and illegal. The auctions have helped the coal-bearing States realise over Rs.2 lakh crore by way of royalties over a 30-year period from the 33 blocks auctioned in the first round. According to media reports, internal government estimates place revenues from all the 204 blocks to exceed Rs.15 lakh crore over 30 years. Quite apart from the windfall revenue to the States, the passage of the Bills is a game changer in other ways. It has opened up the path for foreign investments in the sector, since Indian arms of foreign companies are entitled to bid for blocks, as well as for commercial mining of coal, which can have a salutary effect on prices going forward. Despite having reserves of 301 billion tonnes of coal — the fifth largest in the world — India has been plagued by chronic coal shortages, leading to costly imports by power and metal producers. This has led to severe power shortages, with downstream impact on both industry and individual consumers. With 90 million tonnes of coal expected to be produced from just the 42 operational mines in the blocks auctioned so far, such shortages may well be a thing of the past. The move is also beneficial to the state-owned Coal India Limited, which may now get the elbow room to bring in some much needed technology and best practices, while opening up prospects of a better future for millions of mine workers.
The passage of the Bills also marks a significant political victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. With the exception of the contentious > Land Acquisition Act, the government has now won parliamentary approval for three of the four major reform moves initiated via the ordinance route, sending a strong message to political parties on the economic advantages of reforms. With the exception of the Congress, the Left and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, all other major Opposition parties had reversed their initial opposition to the coal bill, after seeing the enormous revenue potential unlocked by the auctions. This augurs well for future reform measures.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/liberating-black-gold/article7024867.ece
25,3,2015,Debating religious conversions,"The operative word in ‘freedom of religion’ is ‘freedom’, and not ‘religion’. Religious conversion is thus a matter of individual choice guaranteed as a fundamental right under the Constitution, and not a collective right of any religious community to proselytise. What matters is not whether such conversions are necessary but whether the individual is allowed the freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of a religion of his or her choice provided under Article 25. Union Home Minister >Rajnath Singh in calling for a debate on religious conversion, framed his argument poorly: “Is conversion necessary? Can social service not be performed in India without resorting to conversion?” Conversion may not be necessary for anyone but the person converting, but that is no reasoning at all against religious conversion. And, of course, social service can be performed without resorting to conversion. Christian missionaries have combined propagation of religion with social service but unless cases of force or fraud are proven, there can be no objection to such a combination of religious and social work. True, as Mr. Singh said, it should be possible for members of all religions to prosper in India without promoting conversions. But this is not to say that promotion of religious conversions is in itself wrong. That there is no socio-economic need for religious conversion cannot be used to push through any restrictive anti-conversion laws. Existing laws are more than adequate to prevent forcible or fraudulent conversions.
Curiously, Mr. Singh used the possible changes in demographic profile and character of India that religious conversions would entail as an argument against religious conversion. Any restriction on religious conversion, whether on ground of social tension or changing demographics or national character, will amount to a serious violation of the fundamental right to freedom of religion. What is important is that India survives as a secular nation, and not that it remains a country with an unchanged religious mix. As a senior Minister in the government, Mr. Singh should not have called upon the religious minorities to debate anti-conversion laws in the context he set out. Anti-conversion laws cannot be a means to protect religious communities, whether they are a minority or they constitute the majority. It is people who need legal protection and not religions. The threat to the idea of India is less from changes in demographic profile than from attempts to impose a rigid, unifying ‘national’ culture.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/debating-religious-conversions/article7028789.ece
25,3,2015,India flounders as H1N1 spreads,"The influenza A(H1N1) virus continues to kill people in India, although its spread is not at a galloping pace. As on March 21, the number of people affected was over 32,200, and the >death toll in excess of 1,900. The worst-affected States are Gujarat and Rajasthan. In Gujarat, the number of cases has crossed 6,300 and the death toll is 410. In Rajasthan, the cases number over 6,400 and the death toll is 400. The possibility of the actual numbers being much more than government data indicate cannot be ruled out. The influenza virus circulating in the country since last year has revealed how ill-prepared India is in managing and preventing the spread of an infectious disease that could cripple it. The Pune-based National Institute of Virology had sequenced the haemagglutinin (HA) protein. But it is not known if it has completed the sequencing of the whole genome of the circulating virus strain; it had not done so till the end of February 2015. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare rubbished the results of a study published on March 12 in Cell Host & Microbe by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology team that claimed three mutations in the HA protein in the 2009 pandemic virus strain. The team found mutations in two samples deposited last year by India in a public database. While the government continues to vehemently deny new mutations in the circulating virus, it has thus far failed to support the claim convincingly.
A March 14, 2015 report in The Lancet makes it abundantly clear that India has not shared some critical information with the World Health Organization that would help determine if the circulating strains are the same as the two strains that have shown resistance to the anti-viral drug. “We have not yet received detailed information in regard to the characteristics of the circulating viruses [in India]”, Masato Tashiro, Director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, Tokyo, told the journal. The failure to share the full genome sequence data with the WHO reference laboratories and/or deposit them in public databases, severely hampers global efforts to study the evolution of the virus. India has no national influenza policy either, to vaccinate doctors and health-care workers who run the highest risk of contracting the infection; it only “recommends” vaccination of health-care workers. The time has come to take influenza more seriously, especially since H1N1 and H3N1 have become seasonal influenza. Though Indian drug companies are capable of manufacturing influenza vaccines to make the country self-reliant on this count, they have no real incentive to do so in advance in the absence of assured procurement by the government. With its arsenals ill-equipped to prevent the spread, India can only hope the summer heat would rein in the infection.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/india-flounders-as-h1n1-spreads/article7028788.ece
26,3,2015,Victory for free speech,"In an enlightened judgment that pushes the frontiers of laws envisaged for the regulation of the Internet, the Supreme Court has quashed the controversial >Section 66A of the Information Technology Act (amended in 2009) and Section 118(d) of the Kerala Police Act. Section 66A has been repeatedly invoked to staunch dissent and even the mildest criticism of political figures in the country. The section penalised anyone who used the Internet to send messages that were “grossly offensive” and “menacing”, and the scope of the provisions clearly violated constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech. The Supreme Court judgment, delivered by Justices Rohinton Nariman and J. Chelameswar, called the section, “vague” and having a “chilling effect on free speech” guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution and that could not be read under the reasonable restrictions offered by Article 19(2). By striking down Section 66A (and Section 118(d) of the Kerala Police Act on the same grounds), the Supreme Court corrects a major anomaly in the IT Act framed to govern the Internet in the country.
That said, the judgment has upheld the constitutionality of Section 69A that defines the rules and procedure for the government to block websites based on a set of legislatively provided grounds. While the blocking rules are comprehensive, the lack of transparency in the execution of blocking (Rule 16 states that “strict confidentiality shall be maintained regarding all the requests and complaints received and actions taken thereof”) is a cause of concern. Also, government officers have used Section 69A as a sledgehammer to block entire websites for offending content, instead of the specific URLs. However, the Court did the right thing in reading down Section 79(3)(b) pertaining to intermediary liability by ruling that intermediaries such as Google or Facebook would not be liable for illegal content on their websites unless they failed to comply with a court order asking for takedowns of such content. This should lessen the burden on intermediaries to decide immediately on every request for takedowns of controversial content on their websites. It could have taken this further by striking down provisions such as Rule 3(2)(b) of the Intermediary Guidelines framed under Section 79, which demands that the intermediaries regulate content on grounds that are as vague and subjective (including terms such as “grossly harmful”, “harassing” and “blasphemous”) as is the case with Section 66A. Still, there is no denying that this judgment is a major victory for activists and netizens in the country who have fought long and hard to overturn the draconian provisions of the IT Act. The judgment strengthens democratic freedoms as a whole, especially since the Internet today in India has become a virtual public sphere and a lively arena of discussion and debate.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/victory-for-free-speech/article7032653.ece
26,3,2015,India’s Oscars?,"They may come with the ecumenical name of “National” Awards, but every time the announcement arrives, it becomes an occasion for parochial chest-thumping. “Tamil cinema gets 8 National Awards,” say Tamil Nadu-based newspapers and websites. Publications based in the north, meanwhile, trumpet the many wins of Haider and >Queen , adding almost as an afterthought that one of the most prestigious and major awards — for Best Actor — has gone to Vijay for the Kannada film Nanu Avanalla, Avalu. What purpose, then, do these awards serve, if not to alert us of the best of Indian cinema, make us care about not just what our State has made and won but what other States are making? What difference then exists between the National Awards and the awards routinely handed out by the various States, for local films and local talent? This question crops up every year, and there are no easy answers. Recognising “the best” in art is in the best of circumstances a most subjective endeavour. Imagine the plight of the jury members then if they have to ensure that these awards are handed out equitably, with no semblance of “partiality”. Even the announcement of the Dadasaheb Phalke award is not free from controversy. As beloved as >Shashi Kapoor is, one wonders if there are not others more worthy, who have done more for the cause of Indian cinema.
And yet, this imperfect system, it must be said, is the only one in the country that honours both popular cinema and the more niche cinema. Some directors have raised objections over this, claiming that popular cinema has its awards anyway, and that the National Awards — being the nation’s biggest honour for cinema — should only be for “serious” cinema. But given the size of our popular cinema, these recognitions matter. They spur at least some film-makers to make better-quality films for the masses, and if the general film-viewing culture is to improve, then it has to be through films that are viewed by the most numbers, not by a cine-literate few. And that’s why the recognitions to “popular” films such as Queen, Haider and Jigarthanda matter. In a way, this is the principle the Oscars adhere to, recognising not just the art-house creations but also the blockbusters. Even if one is making a movie for the masses, there’s something about the imprimatur of a prestigious awards body that makes one want to make better movies for the masses. That, really, may be the lasting legacy of the National Awards.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/indias-oscars/article7032654.ece
27,3,2015,"For India, a bridge too far","And so it ended, not with a bang or a whimper, but something in between — India’s reign as world champion. In the sort of life-comes-full-circle moment that cricket so often produces, M.S. Dhoni’s men >were ejected by the team they had dethroned in the quarter-finals of the 2011 World Cup — Australia. A chase of 329, subjected to the constricting pressure knockout matches exert, was a tall task; no team before Australia on Thursday had crossed 300 in a semi-final. A margin of 95 runs suggests a thumping. There is some truth in it, for India was outgunned, but this wasn’t a performance without fight or character from the defending champion. After Australia won an important toss and threatened to put the contest beyond its opponent, thanks to a masterly 105 from Steve Smith, India pulled things back. The bowling and the fielding, which have seen such dramatic improvement since the horrors of the tri-series, came together between overs 38 and 43. Dhoni’s captaincy was sharp, attacking. But Australia wrestled free in the final few overs. India’s pursuit had its moments: when Shikhar Dhawan was at the crease and when Dhoni and Ajinkya Rahane were soaking up pressure, the faith of those who believe in miracles could not be shaken. But chases of over 320 demand a big hundred from a batsman in the top five. On the day, against high-quality pace bowling, it was not forthcoming.
But in sport there is no shame in losing to a stronger opponent. India surprised many — but not itself, claimed Virat Kohli before the semi-final — with the quality of cricket it played. Very few who followed the team through the Tests and the tri-series Down Under, where not one win came, foresaw an unbeaten run to the semi-finals. But Australia in Australia remained a bridge too far. Michael Clarke’s men had the ability to hurt India in a variety of ways — not least in the field, where two direct hits late in the innings ended the longest of long shots. Kohli’s wicket earlier was vital, for he has an excellent record in chases. Australia had clearly planned for him, bowling wide and frustrating him before springing a short ball. With Mitchell Starc having five overs up his sleeve for the batting Powerplay and the death overs, Clarke had all bases covered. Australia will begin Sunday’s final in Melbourne as the favourite in a home game. But in New Zealand, it faces a tough challenge. Under Brendon McCullum, the Kiwis have played sparkling, intelligent cricket, both gladdening the heart — except South Africa’s, which it broke — and engaging the mind. When the two met earlier, New Zealand edged a suspense-filled thriller by one wicket. If the final turns out to be anything like that game, the World Cup will have a memorable capstone.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/for-india-a-bridge-too-far/article7036456.ece
27,3,2015,An embarrassing stance,"Earlier this week, >India voted alongside China, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan in favour of a Russian resolution limiting benefits to same-sex couples. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, an outspoken defender of the rights of sexual minorities, had extended benefits available to spouses of UN employees to same-sex couples. Russia moved a resolution that would allow national law to override this extension, and India supported it; the resolution was, however, defeated. On this occasion officials have been at pains to stress that the issue was one of sovereignty, not of gay rights. This is hard to believe; in September 2014, India was one of the few countries to abstain from a historic vote on violence and discrimination against sexual minorities. Highlighting India’s increasingly embarrassing isolation on an issue on which there is global consensus, that of the universality of sexual rights, the resolution was adopted. Globally, India is now in the minority, one of only 76 countries that criminalise same-sex relationships. India’s votes at the UN are in line with its domestic laws, since the colonial-era >Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code criminalising unnatural sex — which has been interpreted to cover consensual homosexual relationships — remains on India’s statute books. A plea that detailed police harassment of homosexuals and the challenges to HIV prevention that the ghettoisation of gay men posed cleared the Delhi High Court hurdle >but not the Supreme Court. Review petitions have failed; only a >curative petition is before the Supreme Court.
The apex court can and does come to the rescue of citizens faced with unconstitutional laws and policies, but the ultimate blame for India’s retrograde stand on homosexuality must lie with its elected representatives, who could have acted to strike off Section 377 from the statute books. Gay rights are human rights and India cannot pretend to be a democracy when it refuses to recognise the existence and choices of a significant minority of its population. Indian law has been marked by its commitment to full safeguards against the trampling by majority groups of the rights of minority social groups. The natural progression of a democracy’s expanding definition of freedoms must be reflected in its recognition of sexual minorities, as most of the world has already done. That the United Progressive Alliance could not find the moral courage to set right this historical wrong should not stop the National Democratic Alliance from writing a new future. The new government appears to care deeply about how it is perceived overseas. It should then recognise that its regressive stance on gay rights would militate against its aspirations to be seen as a modernising society.

28,3,2015,Not a zero-sum game,"With his state visit to China just weeks after Prime Minister >Narendra Modi’s trip to Sri Lanka, President Maithripala Sirisena appears to be trying to balance relations with the two countries that have the greatest influence in the island nation today: India and China. Since taking charge, several decisions by Mr. Sirisena’s government have given China cause for concern, in particular the >suspension of the $1.4-billion Colombo port project. His government has said it would re-examine Chinese projects signed by the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, while on the strategic front Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera announced that >Chinese nuclear submarines would no longer be welcome to dock in Sri Lankan harbours, even as Sri Lanka ups maritime cooperation with India. Sri Lanka also signed its >first nuclear agreement with India, albeit one that envisages nuclear safety operations and not energy generation at present. All these moves, capped by Mr. Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka, sent out a clear message of India’s importance in Sri Lanka’s external relations. Having assuaged India’s concerns, Mr. Sirisena seems to be shifting his focus to China, and smoothing feathers ruffled by his government’s actions there. If his decision to suspend the Colombo port project was timed days before Mr. Modi’s visit to Colombo, he has chosen his meeting in Beijing to announce that the suspension is “temporary” and that the contract is expected to be reinstated shortly.
However, the more important message from >President Sirisena’s meeting with President Xi Jinping is on China’s future plans in the region. At the Boao Forum, President Xi was unveiling the road map for China’s Maritime Silk Route and Silk Road initiatives, that envision massive infrastructure projects in India’s neighbourhood, along with help from the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which he discussed with Mr. Sirisena. Mr. Xi has also suggested a possible ‘triangular’ dialogue among India, China and Sri Lanka. It would be a mistake to assume, as some in India do, that these talks could be viewed as a threat to India, or a zero-sum game. Instead, each of these is an acknowledgment that India is now the ‘elephant in the room’ when China engages one of its closest neighbours. Furthermore, India must welcome the offer of the trilateral that has been suggested by both Colombo and Beijing, while keeping its own bilateral relations with both on a steady course of progress. Such magnanimity may seem naive to many, but will go a long way in assuring Sri Lanka that it does not have to choose between its natural affinity and proximity to India, and China’s affluence and interest in its progress.

28,3,2015,Twitter evolution,"When Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently launched >Twitter Samvad, a service that allows people to receive tweets by government leaders and agencies as text messages over mobile phones, it was a striking testimony of how quickly the social media has evolved to a position of being perceived as a communication channel for the officialdom. The San Francisco-based Twitter, which was not even around a decade back, made its name when it became an invaluable tool for those protesting against the regimes in Iran and Egypt to organise themselves. These protests, which took place at the dawn of the social media age, even came to be referred to as the “Twitter Revolutions”. This was not a deliberately cultivated tag. In fact, as the book Hatching Twitter states, the social media network’s co-founders wanted to steer clear of such a narrative. One of them is quoted as saying, in the backdrop of the protests in Iran, “We are not standing with, or against, the protesters. We just love this use of Twitter.” And this logic continues to hold true even today, when Twitter has about half a billion registered users.
In a slightly more evolved social media environment, where users have lots of choices, it does make business sense to tap sources with high user-volumes. Mr. Modi is someone who understands the power of the social media, having used it extensively in his successful election campaign of 2014. Also, in India SMS works better. This is because, while mobile phone usage has increased exponentially over the years, Internet access is still an issue. The flip side, however, is the uneasiness that usually marks relationships between governments and media of any kind. Governments are important for the media both as a source for stories and for business. In the case of the social media, there is an added dimension of censorship. Twitter knows it better than many other organisations, having had a love-hate relationship with governments across the globe. In extreme cases, as in China, Twitter is blocked from public access. In some other countries there are frequent requests for takedowns and user information. According to Twitter’s latest >Transparency Report, the Indian government made 41 user information requests in the second half of 2014, compared to 16 in the first half. There might be little that is wrong when this pertains to security-related issues. But Internet companies are usually in a dilemma over how to treat such requests. At least one irritant relating to social media usage in India might have gone, quite coincidentally on the same day this service was announced, on March 24.

30,3,2015,Towards safer skies,"The >Germanwings Airbus A320 crash in the French Alps that killed 150 people including the co-pilot who was responsible for it, raises a difficult question for the aviation industry: can it determine with finality that a pilot is fit in all respects before a flight? Despite the rigorous physical and psychological testing processes in place, that may not be possible. Civil aviation is among the most regulated sectors because of the risks that flying entails for everyone — the passengers, crew and people on the ground. The revelation that Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot of the Germanwings aircraft, had mental health issues that he concealed from his employer raises disturbing questions. It underscores the fragility of the human factor which is truly the critical element in the rigorous processes required for aviation. The Lubitz issue showed that the annual medical examination of pilots done under strict European Union regulations can fail to identify psychological problems such as depression. Significantly, last year’s mysterious >Malaysia Airlines MH 370 disappearance also involved a captain who may have been disturbed. Had the EU a ‘two-person’ cockpit rule such as in the U.S., which requires two crew members to be present in the cockpit always, this act of mass murder could have been stopped. The EU and the European Aviation Safety Agency are now considering the introduction of a similar rule.
Flight safety has so far focussed on threats from the passenger side, and the 9/11 terror episode led to fortification of the cockpit. In exceptional circumstances, such as an emergency affecting the pilot and the cockpit area, the crew can use a code that opens the cockpit door briefly, or it even opens automatically if the pilots are immobilised due to depressurisation. But if they are in a position to act, pilots can override this mechanism. The crash in the Alps has launched the search for a solution to this problem, of accessing the cockpit from outside, if the plane has been commandeered from within. The quest now includes a technological solution — one that enhances ground control of aircraft features, including the cabin door, remotely. On the human factor aspect that cannot be overemphasised, the solution lies partly in destigmatising mental health issues. This is particularly relevant to the present-day workplace, where the emphasis is on productivity. Stress and aviation do not go together, and pilot recruitment tests are designed to exclude those who crack under pressure. Preliminary evidence shows that Andreas Lubitz was indeed stressed, and that in spite of medical advice pursued his deadly course. It is tragic that a failure to factor in the possibility of human errors has led to tragedies of this proportion in the skies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/towards-safer-skies/article7045762.ece
30,3,2015,The war in Yemen,"Yet another Arab nation faces a humanitarian crisis following military conflict, as the localised >war between various forces in Yemen has taken on a regional dimension. After the besieged Yemeni government requested help, the Gulf Cooperation Council, led by Saudi Arabia, l >aunched air attacks against Houthi rebel positions in Yemen on March 26. The Saudis have deployed a large force with help from Arab countries such as Egypt and Jordan and others such as Pakistan and Sudan. This military action — without UN sanction — has also involved logistical help from the United States. The ostensible reason for the Saudi intervention is to temper the rising Iranian influence in its immediate neighbourhood. The U.S. involvement — which seems to have bipartisan support in the U.S. polity — is more of a reflexive reaction to register support for its Saudi allies and for the besieged transitional government in Yemen. Saudi Arabia and its allies who have joined the effort allege that the Houthis are being funded and armed by Iran.
The Houthis are a Zaidi Shia group that had participated in uprisings against former Yemeni President and long-time ruler Abdullah Saleh and who had felt left out from the transitional government that followed Saleh’s rule. It is the failure of the transitional government — which was set up with help from the Gulf Cooperation Council in 2012 — to accommodate the Houthis’ interests that fuelled the insurgency. The Houthis have a large degree of control over many areas of northwestern Yemen, including over the capital, Sana'a. The Houthi-led insurgency is not the only military conflict raging in Yemen. The al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) leads another insurgency in the southeast along with the Ansar al-Sharia; this one is a Sunni Islamist rebellion. The regional intervention against the Houthis is bound to strengthen the AQAP. The inability of the ineffectual transitional government to effectively govern a nation that has steadily been divided on sectarian lines, and the weakening of the economy, have helped the various insurgent forces strengthen themselves. The Houthi forces’ consolidation in the south could have presented an opportunity for a new, more inclusive and legitimate government following a ceasefire, but that option is now ruled out as the conflict has been effectively regionalised with the Saudi intervention. Yemen increasingly appears to be heading towards Syria’s fate — a nation torn asunder into enclaves controlled by sectarian and fundamentalist groups and constantly at war among one another.

From >horse-trading and giving the party ticket to persons of >dubious background to >autocratic decision-making and suppressing dissent, the AAP appears susceptible to all the diseases plaguing India’s political system. Instead of the AAP changing the political system, the political system seems to be assimilating the AAP. While all of these might have increased its chances of winning the polls, the party is slowly morphing into another typical Indian party. With every compromise made on its founding principles, the AAP betrays its original backers, the youth and civil society movements who were disillusioned with the hitherto existing political parties. The AAP owed its success to the promise of change that it carried; to give up on this promise is to admit political defeat for the sake of electoral victory. If the AAP is to truly succeed, it would have to succeed on its own terms, without surrendering its original ideals and crusading spirit.
Mr. Bhushan and Mr. Yadav might have had different reasons for taking on Mr. Kejriwal, but they were united in their opposition to the way the party was being run. True, Mr. Kejriwal is the face of the party, its leader as well as its most hard-working member. But a leader who does not listen to his followers will soon be walking alone. As an organisation grows, consensus-building and democratic procedures might appear to be cumbersome and as a hindrance to quick decision-making and work efficiency. But there can be no shortcuts for a political party pushing for systemic changes. Mr. Kejriwal seems to be opting for a highly personalised style of leadership and campaign, and looks more interested in quick-fix solutions that do not always allow for the complexities of the problem. Internal democracy is integral to informed decision-making in any organisation. Dissent and dissidence might slow down the AAP and Mr. Kejriwal, but these remain essential to keeping them going in the right direction.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/electoral-victory-political-defeat/article7049879.ece
31,3,2015,The Australian supremacy,"If there were any doubts about Australia’s preeminence in cricket’s world order, those were ruthlessly >banished at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday. A fifth World Cup crown in 11 editions — each achieved in a different continent, between 1987 and now — confers an aura of supremacy as nothing else. Consider that Australia has made two other finals at the game’s quadrennial showpiece event, and you get a sense of a country that produces dynamic, match-winning cricketers who pass on bloody-mindedness from generation to generation. Michael Clarke’s men were slight favourites at the start of the current edition; hardly anyone in cricket circles picks against Australia in big tournaments, especially outside the subcontinent. Given the side was likely to play a majority of its matches at home — including the semifinal and final at Sydney and Melbourne respectively, stomping grounds where it has historically been hard to beat — it was no surprise that the smart money was on Australia regaining the title. But being fancied is one thing. To win and do it so often that it appears inevitable, particularly in big games, is the hardest challenge in professional sport.
Australia grew in strength through the tournament, as Clarke and the influential James Faulkner returned after injury-enforced absences. The one-wicket defeat to New Zealand when the sides >first met, Clarke said, was a wake-up call. But he knew, as did most who follow the game closely, that Australia had no business staying in the contest as long as it did. Other sides in the tournament took notice: the feared Australian will was apparent; all that remained was for its game rhythm to click into gear. Steve Smith and Mitchell Starc shone the brightest, the former batting with calm mastery in the knock-out matches, the latter creating chaos and panic in the opposition with searing left-arm pace. Both played vital parts in the final too, Starc removing the tone-setting Brendon McCullum and Smith ensuring that a small chase suffered no nerves. But this was an Australian side full of explosive game-breakers. Under Clarke, who left one-day cricket in a fairytale finish, the side played stirring, attacking cricket — much like the team it beat in the final. New Zealand looked like a heart-warming underdog story to the casual fan; in reality it has been the form side in one-day cricket over the last six months or so. Its vibrant, intelligent style of play established the World Cup’s zeitgeist with eight successive wins. A one-off final in unfamiliar Melbourne — after all its matches at home — proved too much, however. Australia was better on the day, as it so often is, but New Zealand proved that valour and imagination can bring the impossible within grasp.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-australian-supremacy/article7049880.ece
1,4,2015,Fearing extinction,"The history of India’s socialist parties — from which the various Janata Parivar entities emerged — is one of splits and mergers. If in the past its leaders, opinionated, fractious, colourful and intensely political as they are, lined up behind Congress rebels to form Central governments in 1977 and 1989, some of them also boosted the numbers of BJP-led NDA governments in 1999 and 2014. In 1996, when the minority H.D. Deve Gowda-led United Front government came into being, it was ideologically more cohesive, but the Congress that had backed it soon withdrew support. Over the years, the Janata Parivar parties drifted from their ideological moorings in socialism to seek identity politics.They stayed afloat, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, capturing the space vacated by the Congress, and addressing the aspirations of the numerically substantial backward castes. In last year’s general election, the BJP (that had been quicker off the mark than the Congress in taking note of the aspirational OBCs back in the early 1990s, launching its “social engineering” experiment) wiped out the Janata Parivar parties in both the Hindi-belt States, taking away a major chunk of the OBC and Dalit votes that had sustained them for over two decades.
The trigger for the > current moves towards a merger of six Janata Parivar parties, especially the Janata Dal (United) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal located in Bihar and the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, is the fear of extinction. Assembly elections are due this year in JD(U)-ruled Bihar and in 2017 in Uttar Pradesh where the SP is in power. In the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the three parties touched their lowest mark in two decades: the JD(U) and the RJD together won just six of Bihar’s 40 seats, and the SP a paltry five of Uttar Pradesh’s 80 seats. The other three parties are the Indian National Lok Dal, the Janata Dal (Secular) and the Samajwadi Janata Party. Today, as they move to merge under the leadership of the SP’s Mulayam Singh Yadav, having set themselves the task of doing so by April 20 when the second half of Parliament’s budget session commences, their first electoral test ahead will be in Bihar. If the merger takes place, the impact will be felt first on the streets with the anti-Land Bill agitation and then inside Parliament: the party will start with 15 MPs in the Lok Sabha and 30 in the Rajya Sabha. But though Nitish Kumar retains some appeal, the rest of its leadership, especially Mr. Mulayam Singh, Mr. Deve Gowda, the RJD’s Lalu Prasad and the INLD’s Om Prakash Chautala are jaded practitioners of dynastic politics. To remain relevant and grow, these parties, an important part of India’s political history, need to adapt to the times — for there is more to politics than mere arithmetic.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fearing-extinction/article7054502.ece
1,4,2015,Numero Uno,"For a country starved of successes at the individual level in world sport, Saina Nehwal’s >feat of becoming the first Indian woman shuttler to reach the No.1 position in the world is a stupendous achievement. The 25-year-old Nehwal — a resident of Hyderabad — achieved this mark during the course of the 2015 India Open Super Series badminton tournament. Nehwal eventually won, defeating former world champion Ratchanok Intanon of Thailand. Amidst the collective disappointment in the cricket-mad country following India’s loss to Australia in the World Cup, Nehwal’s mark has offered a moment of immense pride and delight for Indian sports-lovers. Very few Indians have reached the pinnacle of individual sports. In badminton, only Prakash Padukone had reached the No.1 mark, more than three decades ago. Nehwal now occupies a distinguished position in Indian sport along with achievers such as chess grandmaster Viswanathan Anand and boxer Mary Kom, both of whom reached the top positions in the respective individual sports.
Nehwal’s ascent was aided by the fact that the reigning Olympic badminton champion, Li Xuerui from China, sustained an injury and has played sparingly in the past few months. It is Nehwal’s persistent competitiveness that has allowed her to remain in the top echelons of her sport, and helped her reach the summit at an opportune time. She had won five major tournaments since 2014 — the Indian Open Grand Prix twice, the Australian Super Series and the China Open in 2014, and the India Super Series in 2015. Credit must also go to Nehwal’s coaches over the years, who include Dronacharya award winner Syed Arif, badminton legend Pullela Gopichand and the present coach Vimal Kumar, who is also a former Indian champion. As with other Indian sportspersons — Viswanathan Anand in particular — Nehwal’s success could spur other Indians to take a liking to that sport and inspire them to seek competitive pursuits. The lack of adequate sporting infrastructure, the general absence of a sporting culture, and the domination of cricket in media coverage of sports in the country have meant that Indian achievements in individual sports are few and far between. Here is hoping that such triumphs as Nehwal’s are not flashes in the pan but the start of a trend of strong competitiveness among individual sportspersons, at least in badminton. The victory of male shuttler K. Srikanth in the same tournament — which lifted his world ranking to No.4 — suggests there is indeed something strong brewing in Indian badminton.

8,4,2015,For some fresh air,"The Centre’s move to provide real time data on air quality in some of India’s bigger cities brings policy focus to a key social determinant of health. >The National Air Quality Index launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a work in progress, as the quality of data from some cities remains weak, monitoring stations are not fully equipped and the standards set for pollutants fall short of World Health Organization recommendations. In the case of Particulate Matter measuring less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter — among the more hazardous pollutants — the WHO has a recommended average level of 10 micrograms per cubic metre, and an interim target of 40mcg/m By contrast, India’s tolerance limit for a “good” rating for fine particulates is 50. The air people breathe in many cities is very unhealthy, the values for respirable particulate matter far exceeding even the lax threshold. The public health consequences of this neglect of pollution by governments are the premature deaths of over 620,000 people each year, ill-health for thousands, and loss of economic productivity. Clearly, the business-as-usual approach is proving too costly.
Poor air quality is linked to specific areas of activity — a sharp rise in motorisation, particularly involving the use of diesel as fuel, coal burning, and construction work, to name a few. As the global experience shows, escalating pollution levels accompany heightened economic activity, but an informed policy response reduces the progression. That is the challenge before Prime Minister Modi: to make wealthy polluters pay, and expand green alternatives for all through attractive incentives. A supportive framework is vital to achieving the lifestyle change that Mr. Modi advocates as a solution. In Delhi, rated by some surveys as having the world’s worst air quality, the Metro rail network is growing, but so is the use of personal cars. Yet, the government is not disincentivising their use through congestion charging, which would also generate much-needed funds for the growth of modern bus and rail systems; the existence of a National Urban Transport Policy has not made a difference either. The National Green Tribunal has ordered that diesel vehicles over 10 years old not ply on Delhi roads. This is a positive measure, but those affected should get a reasonable opportunity to make alternative arrangements. The government has also failed to grasp the potential of bicycles as a clean mobility solution, and cities are hostile to their users. Coal burning for power generation can be reduced if rooftop solar power is promoted through a national scheme. U.S. cities are leasing out to homes solar panels. It is such smart solutions that can dramatically improve the air in urban India, without affecting the high quality of life that citizens aspire for.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/centres-move-on-national-air-quality-index/article7078261.ece
8,4,2015,"It’s show time, yet again","Less than a fortnight after the World Cup was beamed from across the seas from Australia and New Zealand, cricket will now be served in short, potent doses in India as the Indian Premier League (IPL) looms into view. Following the glitter and glitz of Tuesday’s opening ceremony in Kolkata’s Salt Lake stadium, most players will have to sever their emotional links with the World Cup and embrace the Twenty20 league. Four years ago, after India won the World Cup, Virat Kohli revealed that it took a week for the players to get used to the acoustics and rhythms of the subsequent IPL tournament. The league’s eighth edition, which starts with Wednesday’s game between defending champion Kolkata Knight Riders and Mumbai Indians at Kolkata’s Eden Gardens, will go on to complete a circle as the final, the 60th match, will be held at the same venue on May 24. As the IPL series hurtles across the country, 12 grounds will play host to it. As always, the latest version will see established players and domestic rookies vying for their share of the spotlight, while retired legends Rahul Dravid, Ricky Ponting and Jacques Kallis guide Rajasthan Royals, Mumbai Indians and Knight Riders respectively.
The tournament has forever been steeped in controversies related to match-fixing, conflicts of interest, and so on. Yet, the hype-mongers had worked furiously to spin a feel-good yarn over the last few months, and even the World Cup was appropriated. Franchises were quick to praise their players’ exploits in the World Cup. The Rajasthan Royals played up Australia’s Steven Smith and James Faulkner, while Royal Challengers Bangalore lauded Mitchell Starc. In the franchises’ Twitter feeds, the Australian shade of the talented trio was made to lose sheen compared to club colours. Some feverish commentators would like us to believe this is the greatest show on earth. But the reality, as Dravid sagely pointed out a few years ago, is that the IPL is a domestic tournament with an international flavour. On the other hand, the money involved is huge and it does thrust a few unknown players into the limelight, as it did Chennai Super Kings’ Shadab Jakati in the past; and as it is expected to do in the case of Knight Riders’s mystery spinner K.C. Cariappa. Through the efforts of the Supreme Court, the IPL has seemingly moved on from the pestilence of 2013 when spot-fixing and betting allegations caused a 14 per cent dip in television viewership. That tumult is less now, as stringent corrective measures are in place. Will cricket-lovers, satiated with the World Cup fare, have the enthusiasm to follow the eight teams for 47 days? After all, the IPL, like mangoes and movies, has become intrinsic to the Indian summer.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ipl-its-show-time-yet-again/article7078262.ece
9,4,2015,Violence in law enforcement,"The killing of 20 woodcutters, who were apparently linked to a red sanders smuggling mafia, by the Anti-Smuggling Taskforce of Andhra Pradesh raises disturbing questions about police accountability and disproportionate use of force. The woodcutters when asked to surrender by the taskforce are reported to have thrown sickles and stones at the police personnel. The “random shots” fired in “self-defence” by the taskforce in near-darkness >killed 20 of the about 100 woodcutters at two sites in the Seshachalam forest. Just a few days ago, the Deputy Inspector General of Police, M. Kantha Rao, had sought the permission of the State government to open fire on those smuggling red sanders. Evidently, the clearance for opening fire came from the very top and the decision to shoot to kill was taken with the full knowledge that there would be protection for the police personnel against prosecution. That two different groups of the taskforce ended up firing at the woodcutters in different parts of the forest at about the same time is deeply troubling and suspicious. The taskforce personnel were unable to arrest any of the other woodcutters. Also, other than those shot dead no woodcutter is known to have suffered injuries. And, none of the police personnel had any serious injury that could have lent credence to the claim of their having fired in self-defence. Woodcutters are only a small part of the well-networked tree-felling mafia, which enjoys the support of rich smugglers and powerful politicians. Not surprisingly, political parties in Tamil Nadu, the home-State of the woodcutters, and civil rights organisations suspect a deeper conspiracy and have sought a probe into the whole episode.
The Seshachalam forest killing seems to be only a symptom of a deeper malaise. In neighbouring Telangana, the police gunned down five terror case undertrials who were being taken to court, the apparent provocation being that one of them had snatched a gun and opened fire at the accompanying police party. That all the five should be shot dead because of the danger posed by one of them is baffling. Indeed, it is difficult not to see these deaths in the context of the attacks on policemen by two activists of the Students Islamic Movement of India, who were later shot dead by the police in Nalgonda. While the police have every right to protect themselves in the course of the discharge of their duties, they cannot be allowed to take on the role of judge and executioner. Unless there is an impartial investigation into all these killings, the people’s trust in the police and the criminal justice delivery system would be badly shaken.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/violence-in-law-enforcement/article7081898.ece
9,4,2015,Seeking reaction by no action,"In the face of virtual non-cooperation from banks, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to maintain the status quo in policy rates, in the first bimonthly Monetary Policy Statement for 2015-16. The “heads I win, tails you lose” attitude of the banks has not really gone down well with the RBI and also the fiscal bosses. The Raghuram Rajan-led >RBI appears to have taken a tough stance. It has every justification to do so. Since the beginning of 2015, the RBI has cut policy rates by 50 basis points in two doses of 25 points each, and that too outside the usual policy cycle. On both occasions the banks had chosen to look the other way without effecting similar cuts in lending rates. They refused to pass on the benefits to customers. This time around when the >RBI kept the rate unchanged, some leading banks such as SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and others have reluctantly come forward to cut lending rates, albeit only marginally. It is difficult to fathom the logic behind their behaviour — of the blatant refusal to cut rates earlier and opting for a voluntary reduction in lending rates now. Governor Rajan has time and again referred to the lag in rate cut transmission. Often in the past, banks acted with alacrity in passing on rate hikes to borrowers. When transmitting rate cuts, however, they have taken their own sweet time. Rather, they have used rate cuts to shore up their bottom line. Thus, the twin cuts in rates only served the banks whose collective NPAs (non-performing assets) were a cause for considerable anxiety. With variable loan rates becoming the norm in the banking sphere, the refusal to reset lending rates in line with the RBI policy rate is indeed hurting the cause of borrowers, especially of the retail kind.
The recalcitrant attitude of banks has, predictably, forced the RBI to push for a marginal cost of funds-based computation of their base rate. At the moment, there is no uniformity in the way banks calculate their base rate. They use a combination — of average cost, marginal cost and blended cost of funds — to arrive at their base rate. The RBI feels that marginal cost of funds — which is pegged on the incremental cost of deposits — will reflect the policy rate change better. This is a key takeaway from the so-called “no action” statement of the RBI on Tuesday. With the RBI taking a no-nonsense stand and indicating that any future rate cut will hinge on the pace at which banks passed on the benefits of rate cuts to borrowers, the onus is now on the banking industry to deliver. Banks must do business and be profitable and not strive to be profitable by denying benefits to the borrowers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/seeking-reaction-by-no-action/article7081899.ece
10,4,2015,Forced migration and homecoming,"The return of Pandits to Kashmir is integral to any solution to the Kashmir dispute, but the proposal to create enclaves for them in the Valley is a misconceived element of tokenism that would do great harm and no good. Indeed, by pushing the idea of separate zones for Pandits, the Bharatiya Janata Party is in effect abdicating the responsibility of the government it heads at the Centre and of the government it is part of in Jammu and Kashmir, in restoring normality to the conflict-torn Valley. Without ensuring a peaceful climate for Muslims and Pandits to live together in Kashmir, creating clusters for Pandits would amount to little more than further dividing the State on religious lines. While religious polarisation might work for the parties in government, the BJP and the Peoples Democratic Party, it could have disastrous consequences for efforts to find a negotiated settlement to the Kashmir dispute taking into account the concerns of all stakeholders. Although Chief Minister Mufti Muhammad Sayeed has now denied any move to create a “separate homeland” for Pandits, there is little doubt that the idea initially found favour among leaders of both the BJP and the PDP. The two parties were the biggest beneficiaries of the polarisation on religious lines seen in the recent State Assembly election, and their leaders must have calculated that the proposal for separate zones could only accentuate the existing communal divides. For the BJP, this was a solution that would have had a resonance for its political constituency in the rest of India, and the party must have been hoping to sell it as a big step forward to resettle Hindu Pandits in Kashmir. In the PDP’s eyes, any effort by the BJP to mobilise Hindus politically in Jammu could lead to a consolidation of the Muslim vote in its favour in the Valley.
Had it not been for voices of protest from leaders of both the Muslim and Pandit communities, the proposal might have gone through. Kashmiri separatist leaders who sought to draw parallels between the enclaves and Israeli settlements in Palestine were surely overreacting, but there was little doubt that the proposal would only have worsened the situation for both Muslims and Pandits. After all, Pandits are longing to return to their native land, and not to specially created clusters away from their original homes. Unless they are able to return to their roots, their own places before the forced migration, homecoming would hold no significance. Their longing is for their homeland, for their old lives and livelihoods, and not for any parcelled piece of space in Kashmir. If the BJP’s leaders have not realised this, they have misdiagnosed the problems of the Pandits.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-forced-migration-and-homecoming/article7085903.ece
10,4,2015,Roots of terror in Kenya,"There seems to be no limit to brutality for al-Shabaab, the Somali jihadi group. In what is estimated as the 17th attack in the last three years in Kenya, 148 people, mostly students, were mercilessly mowed down by the group’s militants on the Garissa University campus in eastern Kenya, not far from the border with Somalia. The motive for this latest atrocity is difficult to fathom. While the jihadists claim it was in retaliation for Kenya’s military intervention in Somalia, the deliberate targeting of non-Muslims in these attacks raises some questions. Is al-Shabaab trying to foment religious strife in Kenya (where there is a substantial Muslim population in a largely Christian country), or is this yet another action by a weakening group to assert its strength as a jihadi outfit affiliated to al-Qaeda? The attack was reminiscent of the killings at the Westgate mall in Nairobi in 2013. The Kenyan government managed to handle the repercussions of that tragedy by projecting a face of unity and not allowing the attacks to descend into sectarian turmoil. But in a country that is riven by disparities, the resilience seen thus far will be put to severe test following the Garissa tragedy, coming as it does on top of a series of other incidents since 2013.
Al-Shabaab’s recent actions — which are not limited to those in Kenya — cannot be seen in isolation from the situation in Somalia. A tattered country that has faced civil war and strife for more than two decades now, Somalia has been a breeding ground for groups such as al-Shabaab which grew out of the youthful sections of radical Islamic organisations like the Islamic Courts Union (ICU). Ironically, in the mid-2000s the ICU had provided some semblance of order — even if motivated by theocratic concerns — in a country that had suffered warlordism and lawlessness since 1991 when a civil war began. An Ethiopian invasion in 2007 which defeated the ICU spawned the guerrilla forces of al-Shabaab, which consolidated power in the late-2000s and soon imposed harsh laws in areas under their control. The UN-approved African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) which included military forces from Kenya, helped take on the repressive al-Shabaab in 2012, but the latter has since then again turned into a guerrilla group engaged in indiscriminate violence both within and outside Somalia. Of late, AMISOM has registered some major successes in driving out al-Shabaab forces from its remaining strongholds. This could explain al-Shabaab’s desperate actions in Kenya and Uganda (which is also part of AMISOM). Kenya needs to redouble its efforts as part of AMISOM in Somalia, even as it strives to avoid any reprisals against its own Muslim community.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-roots-of-terror-in-kenya/article7085904.ece
11,4,2015,Just punishment,"The conviction of B. Ramalinga Raju, the disgraced former chairman of Satyam Computer Services Ltd., B. Rama Raju, his brother and managing director, and some associates, closes a chapter on India’s biggest corporate fraud to date. In a way, the black sheep in the booming information technology industry have at last been nailed for their crimes. The accused were sentenced to a seven-year prison term for fudging accounts and inflating profits; for cheating investors and breaching the trust of thousands of shareholders; evading taxes and paying additional taxes at another point to justify the fictitious revenues they could not otherwise account for. These were not merely violations of law; the illegal actions brought corporate India, and its lynchpin, the information technology sector, under a dark cloud. It is therefore commendable that the meticulous work of investigators and judicial officers brought closure to a challenging trial that involved a voluminous amount of documents and electronic evidence. In the end, Mr. Raju received little sympathy despite admitting to the corporate fraud, which resulted in the abrupt fall of the $2 billion Satyam empire, which he announced through an e-mail to his colleagues, the Securities and Exchange Board of India and the stock exchanges. His actions clearly were motivated by the fact that the scale of the fraud was too big to sustain. Later, though, Mr. Raju sought to disown his admission and disputed the fact that he had written the e-mail that detailed the graft and fraud. Clearly, his attempt at deception failed.
The manner in which Mr. Raju sank from being the poster boy of the country’s software industry to a convict in a cheating case holds a lesson or two for the rest of the country in handling wealth, power and ambition. As a remand prisoner, he sought relief from the rigours of prison life by spending in a hospital much of a nearly two-and-a-half year stint in judicial custody. The seven-year jail term and the Rs.5.5 crore fine imposed on the Raju brothers is just punishment, though some would say it is too lenient considering the scale of the fraud. As for the others sentenced along with him, it is not often that auditors are held accountable for aiding and abetting fraud and forgery. The positive outcome of the Satyam story is that today there are greater initiatives to promote scrupulous and clean corporate governance — which inexplicably collapsed in this particular company — and better accounting standards. Thankfully, the industry survived the shock of the January 7, 2009, admission by Mr. Raju, and its aftermath, and what was then a modest $50 billion industry is now looking at revenues worth $146 billion in 2015.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-just-punishment/article7089984.ece
11,4,2015,Rekindling the fight against leprosy,"The diagnosis and treatment of leprosy, or Hansen’s Disease, is now considered easier and more effective than ever before. Since 1983, the disease is curable with multidrug therapy. MDT was successfully assimilated into India’s health programmes, leading to a reduction in the overall rate of leprosy incidence in the country. But since 2005 the rate of decline has slowed. As of 2014, India still accounts for 58 per cent of all new leprosy cases in the world. During 2013-14 alone, 1.27 lakh new cases were detected in India. It is in this context that one hopes the Law Commission of India’s 256th Report, ‘Eliminating Discrimination against Persons Affected by Leprosy’, will initiate a new chapter in India’s fight against leprosy. The report is critical of the failures of our health programme, especially since 2005, in dealing with leprosy eradication. Its recommendations clearly draw from the constitutional values of dignity, equality and freedoms. The Law Commission recognises India’s international obligations arising out of the UN General Assembly Resolution on the Elimination of Discrimination against Persons affected by Leprosy, 2010, as well as its obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2007. Sensitivity to social stigma against persons suffering from leprosy is a theme underlying the document.
The focus of the report is on how several of the laws are themselves discriminatory, needing amendment or repeal. For instance, the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956 contains discriminatory provisions wherein higher premium rates are charged from persons affected by leprosy due to a supposedly higher risk to their lives. There are several personal laws such as the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939 that are also discriminatory, mistaking leprosy as an ‘incurable and virulent disease’. Even the Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995 does not include all categories of persons affected by leprosy within its purview, denying them special privileges under the law. The report recommends non-discriminatory laws and affirmative action, for their greater integration into employment and educational institutions. But some recommendations may be termed controversial. The report suggests that persons living in colonies for leprosy patients need to be granted ownership title to property in their possession. But these colonies are also sites of discrimination that leave its residents segregated and isolated from the rest of the community. Ensuring the assimilation of the 850 colonies for leprosy patients in India will be a complex task involving an engagement that goes beyond acknowledging ownership rights. But overall, the Commission's recommendations are forward-looking and progressive. They must be implemented soonest.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rekindling-the-fight-against-leprosy/article7089985.ece
13,4,2015,Unacceptable decision,"The decision of the Lahore High Court to release Lashkar-e-Taiba commander Zaki ur Rehman Lakhvi from detention was not surprising considering that he had already been granted bail by an anti-terrorism court in December. The Pakistan state has, since the terror attacks in Peshawar in the same period last year, sought to convey a sudden urge to undo the earlier faux pas of granting Lakhvi bail, and contested it. Yet prosecutors failed to mount a proper case, arguing for Lakhvi’s detention only on the issue of “maintenance of public order”. Without a clear-cut case built by prosecutors on charges of engaging in terrorism, it was always a matter of when Lakhvi would be released rather than if. The Indian authorities had marshalled pages of evidence showing the role Lakhvi had played as a controller of the terrorists who attacked Mumbai on November 26, 2008. Apart from audio tapes and transcripts showing his involvement, the testimony of U.S. citizen David Headley who had done reconnaissance in Mumbai before the attacks, and confessions by the captured terrorist Ajmal Kasab were also made available to Pakistan. That these were not properly used to build a case against Lakhvi suggests the laxity and hypocrisy of the Pakistani state. The poor prosecution effort was compounded by witness and judge intimidation. The still-unsolved assassination of special prosecutor Chaudhury Zulfiqar Ali in May 2013 also affected it.
Of late, Pakistan’s state establishment has pursued a dual policy towards jihadists operating from its soil. While the security establishment has taken on extremists belonging to the Tehreek-e-Taliban in the country’s west, considering them “enemies of the state”, and military courts have been set up to prosecute them, the forces that had indulged in cross-border terrorism in India have been protected and treated with kid gloves. The duplicitous attitude towards terror has already hurt the country as the Peshawar attacks revealed. For years, the coziness between sections of the Pakistan security establishment and the jihadists had allowed a culture of impunity to build up in the country, leading to the death of several civilians, bomb attacks, and assassination of leaders. The hope that the return to democracy since former President and army chief Pervez Musharraf was deposed could help change the status quo and bring about greater civilian control over the security establishment, has been belied thus far. The resumption of diplomatic engagement at the highest levels has also failed to secure justice for the victims of the 26/11 atrocities. It is inevitable that the current approach toward the jihadists focussed on India will also hurt the Pakistani nation-state in the long run.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/release-of-lashkaretaiba-commander-zaki-ur-rehman-lakhvi-from-detention/article7095724.ece
13,4,2015,Rafale and beyond,"It seemed interesting that on the eve of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s departure for France, the Indian and French governments issued similar statements on the prospects of an agreement on the purchase of the Rafale aircraft: that no >single deal should be allowed to overshadow the Prime Minister’s visit. Indeed, India-France relations are much bigger than any one contract; they represent the cultural affinity and historic relations between two vibrant democracies. The items on the Prime Minister’s agenda reflected the range of commonalities — from the preservation of ancient architecture to the development of Puducherry and Chandigarh as smart cities; from the construction of semi-high-speed railway lines to cooperation on a space mission to Mars; from discussing anti-terror training to tackling climate change through renewable technologies and a robust nuclear partnership. The economic aspect of the relationship has been ignored for too long. Although more than a thousand French companies have a total investment of about $20 billion in India, bilateral trade is worth just $8 billion. While all this deserved attention, it was disappointing that the Prime Minister put the spotlight back on defence ties by making a surprise announcement on the purchase of 36 Rafale aircraft as the highlight of his talks with President François Hollande. If the outright purchase was a crucial military necessity, it could have been discussed a few weeks before or after the visit, as a political push for the deal was secondary to the technical specifications and delivery requirements. Moreover, the deal, which involves purchasing products off the shelf abroad, detracts from Mr. Modi’s “Make in India” initiative.
The breakthrough on the Areva nuclear equipment deal, on the other hand, shows the positive outcome of Mr. Modi’s and Mr. Hollande’s political push, combined with a “Make in India” twist. As in the case of Indo-U.S. nuclear negotiations, Mr. Modi and Mr. Hollande decided to clear the logjam by splitting the problem into different silos — allowing for separate mechanisms for the pricing issues and for the technical and legal aspects. The supplementary deal involving Areva and L&T producing heavy forging metal casing for nuclear reactors is an important step in localising some of the expensive parts. During his visit to Canada, where he hopes to sign a deal for uranium supplies, Mr. Modi means to take forward his plan to increase nuclear energy production. Given this objective, it may be useful for him to round off the visit by discussing his nuclear energy plans in Germany as well, which is now winding down on nuclear power but is at the cutting edge of nuclear safety research for the European Pressurised Reactors that are being considered for India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-the-rafale-deal/article7095725.ece
14,4,2015,Admiration sans adherence,"Political scientist, economist, jurist, social reformer, architect of India’s Constitution, and a leader of men: Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, a multifaceted personality with varied interests, defies attempts at classification and categorisation. But with his singular drive for the uplift of the poor and the weaker sections, he became an inspirational figure during his lifetime and a national icon in the decades thence. Not surprisingly, despite his later differences with the Congress, and his opposition to the politics of social hate and communal divides, Ambedkar is now sought to be appropriated by both the Congress and the BJP as part of their political mobilisation strategies. The two parties have planned year-long celebrations to mark his 125th birth anniversary year beginning today. While the Congress’s claim to the Ambedkar legacy, though disputed, is nothing new, the BJP’s decision to mark the anniversary with elaborate events marks a change in its approach to his life and work. However, instead of projecting the change in approach as a change in its own attitude to Ambedkar, the BJP and its ideological fount, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, seem to be intent on a selective reading of Ambedkar as a Hindu nationalist. His conversion to Buddhism in 1956, and his opposition to the oppressive caste hierarchy in Hinduism do not seem to have mattered for the RSS, whose joint secretary Krishna Gopal has brought out a booklet highlighting the supposed affinities between Ambedkar and Hindu nationalism such as his opposition to the theory of Aryan invasion, and to conversion to Islam.
Central to the attempts to appropriate Ambedkar’s political legacy is the consolidation of Dalit votes. Dalit representative parties such as the Republican Party of India have entered into alliances with the BJP, but the focus of the BJP now seems to be to enlist Dalits directly into the party. Memorials, statues and commemorative volumes on his life and work are evidently part of this effort. For the Congress, the Ambedkar birth anniversary events are meant to stem the erosion in its support base among Dalit groups. That the political contestation for Ambedkar’s legacy has gained an added edge now is proof of the success of the efforts at organising Dalits as a political force. But none of this adds up to providing greater space for Ambedkar’s views on social justice and social democracy in the Indian polity. Sadly, while there is a growing reverence for Ambedkar among the political class, and a greater recognition of his contribution to nation-building, his ideas have not found ready acceptance. In this, he is one with Mahatma Gandhi — someone who is admired, but whose views are hardly adhered to.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ambedkar-admiration-sans-adherence/article7099212.ece
14,4,2015,State of criminal defamation,"The recent Shreya Singhal judgment of the Supreme Court that struck down Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 as unconstitutional, has opened up pathways for wider and more nuanced debates on free speech in India. Now under judicial scrutiny are Section 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, pertaining to criminal defamation. During the hearing on a batch of petitions challenging the constitutionality of these provisions, the Supreme Court has issued notice to the government. The petitions contend that Sections 499 and 500 of the IPC travel beyond the restrictions enshrined in Article 19(2), thus constricting free speech beyond reasonable limits. The Hindu had in 2003 filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court challenging the vires of Section 499, inter alia on grounds that it violated the freedom of press guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a). As the law stands, defamation is both a civil wrong and a criminal offence. In a civil action, a person may be sued for monetary compensation while a criminal wrong can invite imprisonment up to two years. With the former being an effective enough remedy, the latter needs to be repealed. Under Article 19(2), free speech can be curtailed only by way of reasonable restrictions. Such a restriction must not be arbitrary or excessive, and the impairment of freedom must be ‘as little as possible’. But criminal prosecution in India can be incredibly harassing and intimidating, and have a chilling effect, thus being an ‘unreasonable’ restriction.
The government has sought a report from the Law Commission of India on the issue. A joint consultation paper published by the LCI in September 2014 notes that the respondents “overwhelmingly expressed dissatisfaction with the present state of defamation law”. Considering the need to repeal Section 499, it acknowledged that criminal defamation laws violated international norms, and that the penalty of incarceration up to two years was clearly disproportionate. The recent history of defamation laws is riddled with misuse by politicians and corporations to silence the media, activists and criticisms. The spate of defamation cases filed during the 2014 Lok Sabha election is evidence of this. Defamatory acts that may harm public order are covered by Sections 124, 153 and 153A, and so criminal defamation does not serve any overarching public interest. Even though Section 499 provides safeguards by means of exceptions, the threat of criminal prosecution is in itself unreasonable and excessive. This is not to say that defamation must not be discouraged. But decriminalising it will bring the IPC in accord with Article 19(2), ensuring that the means used to discourage defamation do not end up damping legitimate criticism.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-state-of-criminal-defamation/article7099213.ece
15,4,2015,Blow for Net neutrality,"It is no surprise to see online retailer Flipkart pulling out of Airtel Zero, the controversial plan offered by India’s leading telecom provider Bharti Airtel to provide its subscribers free access to select websites. >Flipkart had to contain the fallout after Airtel Zero was severely criticised by the proponents of Net neutrality, the principle that all Internet traffic has to be treated equally. The e-retailer faced a >severe backlash on social media over its decision to join Airtel, and even had its app down-rated on app stores by die-hard Net neutrality advocates. For all the pro-Net neutrality utterances it makes now — ironically, >Airtel also does so — what is still a surprise is what made it join the platform in the first place. Flipkart did so disregarding the >wave of support for Net neutrality that has been sweeping across India following the recent publication of a consultation paper on it by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. Politicians, celebrities and the common person alike have joined the cause. Did it not occur to Flipkart that its own success until now could not have been possible but for an open Internet? Was it pushed into such a deal by private equity investors who have pumped in a few billion dollars into the business in recent years? Or was it emboldened by the relative silence of Net neutrality supporters on a similar scheme, which goes by the name of internet.org?
Facebook introduced internet.org a few months ago to subscribers of Reliance Communications. Airtel Zero and internet.org are very similar schemes. Airtel would know; it is Facebook’s partner in Africa. The only difference is in positioning. Internet.org is presented as an attempt to make the Internet available to those who don’t have access to it. There is no denying that many in India still do not have Web access. But the actors in internet.org are all commercial enterprises, as they are in Airtel Zero. The list includes Facebook, Reliance Communications, and many of the nearly three dozen Indian content and news sites, some of which have been vocal in their support for Net neutrality. Many of their business models are based on their ability to accumulate bigger audiences and more readers. Such free plans, also called zero-rating plans wherein the subscriber gets access to select sites, are deemed to be against Net neutrality and banned in countries such as Chile. Whatever made it join Airtel Zero in the first place, Flipkart is now making the right redemption noises, leaving Airtel in the lurch. The dramatic pullback has given supporters of Net neutrality more ammunition, much more than would have been the case had Flipkart not decided to join Airtel Zero in the first place.

15,4,2015,Fighting a futile war,"By its own admission, the Communist Party of India (Maoist) is a flailing force, unable to alter its status from that of a guerrilla group; with its potency on the wane, it is nowhere near its stated goals, which it seeks to achieve by means of a “revolution”. Nearly a decade after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh termed the Maoist movement India’s greatest internal security threat, it remains a marginal force engaged in sporadic acts of violence principally in India’s tribal belt and limited mainly to the dense forests of Chhattisgarh — where its top leadership is believed to be holed up — and to Jharkhand, Odisha and Maharashtra. They admit that they have little presence beyond these areas and that they are unable to bring their influence to or build support in urban areas. Political and mobilisational work is largely absent and their primary pursuit has been reduced to insurgency. What then explains the recent > spurt of violent acts by Maoists, killing and injuring men of the Central Reserve Police Force, the Border Security Force and the police in the Bastar region of Chhattisgarh? Are these simply acts of desperation by a weakening force that is seeking to reassure its own cadre of its “potency” despite the organisational setbacks and loss of strike power?
The war against Maoists and their attempts at retaliation have formed a familiar pattern over the past few years. Their actions are increasingly part of a futile war against the Indian state that has resulted only in rising casualties and interminable harm to the tribals whose interests they purportedly seek to represent. As the paramilitary and security forces in Chhattisgarh have gradually sought to retain “control” over Maoist strongholds, and their operations have resulted in the incarceration and death of several Maoist leaders, the rebels have reacted with sporadic “counter-offensives”, mostly ambushes. These are common in the summer months when they waylay and kill security personnel. This in turn invites the state to prolong its military campaigns and use strong-arm methods to “cleanse” villages. Perhaps the Maoists think this is a viable strategy, a way to “expose the nature of the state”, which would help them mobilise and enlist more adherents to their “cause”. But the futility of their violent pursuit is only becoming clearer by the day as there has been no upturn in support for them following the actions of the state. Their drive has only brought growing woes to the tribal people. The state may be able to withstand setbacks and continue to deploy more forces for the task. But governments both at the Centre and in the States must realise that there has to be another way out — going beyond a purely militaristic and bloody solution.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/communist-party-of-india-maoist-movement/article7102333.ece
15,4,2015,Will the Sena shed its skin?,"Whether it is the vada pav protest by its activists against > Shobhaa De or the provocative article penned by its MP > Sanjay Raut urging disenfranchisement of Muslims, the Shiv Sena seems to be returning to an intolerant form of Marathi chauvinistic politics. But the Sena is > not alone with this brand of politics: Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) is also a claimant for the same political space, and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Maharashtra unit is doing its best to be seen as the foremost champion of Marathi language and culture. The Devendra Fadnavis government’s > “diktat” to multiplexes to allot prime-time slots for Marathi cinema, its lobbying for classical language status for Marathi, and the celebration of the Jnanpith for writer Bhalchandra Nemade are all part of the BJP’s efforts to be seen as an alternative, not only to the Congress but also to the Sena. Without doubt, the Sena was feeling the build-up of pressure from its rivals and its allies in equal measure. After the demise of founder Bal Thackeray, the Sena was on the threshold of a defining change: many predicted that the party would collapse after Thackeray, or would split vertically with a section joining the more strident MNS. But the soft-spoken Uddhav Thackeray held the party together with his aggressive leadership style, and toured the State extensively before the Assembly election, connecting with its own mass base and stressing on the core issues that have traditionally defined the party. The Sena was thus able to hold its own against a resurgent BJP, which was riding the crest of a Modi wave.
But, despite the recent successes of its proven chauvinistic methods, there is a strong churn within the Shiv Sena as Uddhav Thackeray’s son Aaditya emerges as a forceful leader. Aaditya has been propagating a certain development agenda, and talking of expanding the Shiv Sena nationally. His campaign against destruction of green cover at the Aarey Milk Colony for a Metro project and his call for greater participation of citizens in the Mumbai Development Plan played a role in Chief Minister Fadnavis staying the implementation of these projects. As Aaditya assumes a greater role in the party and a line of second-generation Sena leaders takes charge, the Sena should shed its old skin and embrace the change within. Otherwise, the party would find it difficult to manage its relations with the BJP, its partner in government both at the Centre and in the State. And, in its efforts to continue to appeal to its old support base, the party might fail to win any new converts from among the youthful middle class of Maharashtra.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/shiv-sena-relevance-mns/article7102334.ece
16,4,2015,A tale of two countries,"The >IMF’s forecast that India’s growth will overtake China’s this calendar year and the next is cause for neither surprise nor euphoria. China is deliberately cooling off, after more than two decades of high growth. Meanwhile, India’s purported shift away from consumption-driven growth towards investment is expected to generate the conditions for sustained high growth. But the ‘elephant’ has a long way to go before it can catch up with the ‘dragon’. China’s compounded annual growth rate was over 10 per cent between 1990 and 2013, while the best that India achieved was about 9 per cent, between 2003 and 2009. China’s double-digit growth helped it emerge as the world’s manufacturing hub and enabled it to bring about major reduction in poverty levels, besides ensuring a far higher level of literacy and better health and living standards than India’s. India needs to grow at 7 to 8 per cent for at least a decade to create jobs for the 12 million people entering the market each year and generate resources to improve physical and social infrastructure. A quarter of India’s households have no electricity, whereas China has full coverage. India’s literacy level at 74 per cent is way below China’s 95 per cent: India’s so-called ‘demographic dividend’ is thus in question. India’s infant mortality rate of 43 per thousand live births is thrice that of China’s. And, China’s per capita income, at about $3,500, is more than three times India’s levels. India will not be able to sustain its investment thrust and reach China’s levels unless its present savings rate, at about 30 per cent of GDP, against China’s 51 per cent, improves. India must boost household savings by improving employment and financial inclusion, and keep inflation in check. A policy environment that encourages ‘Make in India’ can help.
Yet, in trying to become a manufacturing hub, it is important for India to learn from China’s experience. China’s investment-to-consumption transition (or from exports to domestic demand) has been prompted by a prolonged slump in the advanced economies. But the shift is proving slow and painful because of a manufacturing model that has relied on keeping wage costs unduly low. A domestic demand impulse would entail a shift towards high-value, high-wage manufacture, as in Japan. China’s investment in human capital and scientific research is what works here. The second cause for the government not pushing growth aggressively is a real estate bubble that needs to be deflated slowly. And finally, China can no more afford to ignore the environmental effects of unbridled industrialisation. Its air and water pollution levels are alarming. India shares many of China’s vulnerabilities, but not its strengths. It should lift domestic demand, go for a ‘growth-plus’ approach – and, above all, not be swayed by those who reduce development to a game of numbers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/imf-forecast-on-indias-growth/article7106093.ece
17,4,2015,Yet another twist,"The split verdict by a two-judge Bench of the Supreme Court on the appointment of a > Special Public Prosecutor is likely to further delay the disposal of the appeal filed by former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and three others against their conviction for corruption. For Ms. Jayalalithaa, who is keen on a clean chit well ahead of next year’s Assembly elections, any delay will be unwelcome. The court being divided on the validity of the appointment of G. Bhavani Singh as SPP is not by itself a matter of concern, as it can be resolved by a three-judge Bench; the development has thrown up the possibility of the entire hearing in the Karnataka High Court — which had concluded with the verdict remaining reserved — being required to be repeated. The Bench had allowed the appeal hearing to go on while it was deliberating on Mr. Singh’s appointment. It was clear that any order invalidating Mr. Singh’s appointment would automatically mean the matter would have to be heard afresh. That prospect still exists, as a three-judge Bench could well agree with Justice Madan B. Lokur’s ruling against Mr. Singh’s appointment. A simpler course would have been to stay the High Court hearing until the prosecutor’s status was resolved. Also, the Karnataka government and the intervener, DMK general secretary K. Anbazhagan, could have obtained an early clarification from the Supreme Court on who would represent the prosecution in the High Court.
The issue was agitated by Mr. Anbazhagan in the High Court, first before a single judge and later a Division Bench, and it finally landed up in the Supreme Court. The legal position was always clear: that once a case is transferred from one State to another, the transferee State alone is competent to appoint the prosecutor. Yet, Mr. Singh began to represent the prosecution in the appeal based on an order passed by the Tamil Nadu government. Karnataka took the stand that its role had ended with the conduct of the trial, and that it did not take steps to consult the Chief Justice of the High Court and appoint a prosecutor for the appeal. However, a High Court Bench said Mr. Singh was entitled to be the prosecutor as Section 301 of the CrPC says a prosecutor appointed for a case could appear without written authority in other proceedings arising out of it. Justice R. Banumathi accepted this view and upheld Mr. Singh’s appearance, but Mr. Justice Lokur did not. The outcome of the proceedings before a larger bench will determine whether the High Court will have to re-hear the appeal or pass its verdict straight away. The public cannot be blamed if there is an impression that the judiciary itself is only muddling its way through a tangle created over the years.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/jayalalithaa-da-case-anbazhagan-appeal/article7109866.ece
17,4,2015,Candidate Hillary,"On April 12, Hillary Clinton moved one step closer to becoming the > first-ever woman President of the United States. The 2016 election will be her second presidential run. To succeed this time she will have to eschew the theme of “inevitability” that had crept into her bruising primaries battle against Barack Obama in 2008, and that ultimately sank her campaign. The former First Lady was off to a quick start in her campaign video and came out swinging for the fences as a would-be “ > champion of everyday Americans”. The implied focus on the welfare of the middle class is a throwback to liberal Democratic values and poses a challenge to Republican Party free-marketeers. It may also reflect her intention to separate her record from that of the inc umbent Mr. Obama; this was mostly evident in her comment that “the cards are still stacked” against the common person. Ms. Clinton is indeed a different beast to the President, although pundits predict she will borrow elements of campaign design from her former boss, and indeed the social media strategies employed so ably by Team Modi in 2013-14. Buttressing her nuts-and-bolts approach to campaign management, she can be expected to project her deep understanding of the paralysed politics of Washington, and be unapologetic about her political pedigree.
But will all this be enough? And if it is, will she reshape the American story to fit better into a turbulent world? The Republican Party is not throwing up any inspiring leaders. Among the hopefuls, Jeb Bush has the clout of his last name but not much else. Ted Cruz is considered to be a fringe candidate, even among Republican heavyweights. Marco Rubio has passable charisma and an important connection to the Latino community, but he would flounder if he went toe-to-toe against a much more experienced Ms. Clinton. Though her entry into the Oval Office is far from being a certainty as of now, the greater challenge for her may be knowing what to do once she gets there. She was, after all, leading the Obama action that fumbled through the Arab Spring. Would she do it differently a second time? The rise of Islamic State will certainly dominate the attention of the next POTUS. She also promised, in a 2010 speech, that the administration would think “smart power” and focus on multilateralism, regional architectures and broad-strategic engagements with countries such as India, Russia and China. Clearly that dream didn’t materialise. On domestic policy , however, the Obama years offer hope. Just as he tackled the inequities of the health-care system head-on, Ms. Clinton could do much to close the gender pay gap, tackle America’s rape crisis, and upgrade its education system to help the millennials thrive in the workforce. That, and much more. Her time is now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/hillary-clinton-running-for-us-president-2016/article7109867.ece
18,4,2015,Waving the wrong flag,"The > arrest of the Kashmir separatist leader Masarat Alam Bhat within six weeks of his release from jail shows an early collapse of the ‘healing touch’ policy adopted by the Jammu and Kashmir government led by the Peoples Democratic Party soon after coming to power. Mr. Alam was a known troublemaker with the potential to instigate violence, and little thought seemed to have gone into the decision to let him walk free from jail after more than four years in detention. At a rally to be addressed by Hurriyat chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani in Srinagar, Mr. Alam was at the head of a group of youths shouting anti-India slogans and > waving the Pakistan flag, forcing the government to first place him under house arrest and later take him into custody. That the PDP and its partner in government, the Bharatiya Janata Party, were divided on how to deal with Mr. Alam was evident from the start. Not only did the PDP fail to consult the BJP on the issue, it appears to have underestimated the sinister consequences of releasing Mr. Alam without wresting any kind of assurances from him. If Mr. Alam’s release last month embarrassed the BJP, his arrest now is an acceptance of failure by the PDP, which was at pains to stress that while the released person had a history of involvement with stone-pelting he had never wielded a gun.
If political considerations weighed heavily in the decision to release Mr. Alam, matters of practical policing seemed to have forced the government’s hand in ordering his rearrest. Other than giving the hardliners in the Kashmir dispute an opportunity to regroup, the release and rearrest episode appears to have achieved little. The Kashmir issue is not any closer to a solution. Politically, both the PDP and the BJP will be seen as having bungled in this case. In a State torn by violence, flag-waving and sloganeering might seem minor crimes, but the Jammu and Kashmir government cannot be seen as ignoring the anti-national implications of Mr. Alam’s waving the Pakistan flag in the Valley. If the government does not clamp down on this symbolic defiance, it will only embolden the separatist forces. Political autonomy for Kashmir will have to be negotiated within the framework of India’s sovereignty, and the crackdown following the waving of the Pakistani flag is a clear statement of intent and purpose from both the State and Central governments. The Masarat Alam release and rearrest fiasco was an avoidable political miscalculation. Nothing must be allowed to undermine the credibility of a genuine political initiative from the Mufti Sayeed administration, which should pick up the threads of the earlier dialogue between New Delhi and Srinagar on proposals for more autonomy for the State.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/masarat-alam-geelani-tral-rally-pakistan-flag/article7114111.ece
18,4,2015,Janata convergence,"The > coming together of six different elements of the erstwhile Janata Dal in the form of a new party, more than 20 years after splitting away, marks a political development of some significance. The decision to unite springs from their abysmally poor performance in the last general election and the need therefore to consolidate — or perish. Nevertheless, this formation will pose a challenge to the BJP in those very States from where the party won a bulk of its Lok Sabha seats: Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Not just that, even though these parties separately were regarded as regional parties, the new formation will have the status and appearance of a national party, something that only the BJP, the Congress and to some extent the Left parties currently have. Indeed, so enthused was Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav after being elected president of the new party that he reminded journalists that whenever elements of the Janata Parivar have united they have ruled at the Centre, whether it was in 1989 under V.P. Singh or in 1996 under H.D. Deve Gowda. The yet-unnamed party is in power in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and has a significant presence in Haryana and Karnataka. In the Rajya Sabha it will be the third largest party with 30 MPs, behind only the Congress and the BJP. In the Lok Sabha its 15 MPs will make the party the eighth largest.
But after over five months of negotiations — and with Assembly polls in Bihar barely half a year away – the party still does not have a name, flag, symbol, policy document or organisational structure: so the reunion is not without its problems. The prime movers, the Janata Dal (United) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal, which will have to square up to a resurgent BJP in Bihar this year, face an impending identity crisis. An agreement had been virtually reached on accepting the SP’s symbol, the bicycle, and a new name, the Samajwadi Janata Dal. But former Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, who quit the JD(U) to form his own party, and Pappu Yadav, RJD MP-turned-renegade, have staked claim to the symbols and flags of their original parties should they become available. This could jeopardise the new party’s chances in Bihar, where the RJD’s ‘lantern’ and the JD(U)’s ‘arrow’ have alternately > held sway since 1990. But these issues will be overcome, just as the new party has decided on a federal structure that will give the State satraps sway in their areas of influence. It remains to be seen whether these leaders, known for their individualism, have learned the lessons of history. But the arithmetic — of consolidating the power of the OBCs who constitute over half the population, most of whom were lured away by Narendra Modi, a member of the OBC himself — could work in the new party’s favour.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-reemergence-of-the-janata-parivar/article7114112.ece
20,4,2015,Promising change in CPI(M),"The >election of Sitaram Yechury as the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was seen as the inevitable elevation of a prominent and familiar leading figure representing the Left in the parliamentary arena. The 62-year-old Mr. Yechury was widely seen as the automatic choice in the normal course. But oddly enough, until the last moment the election to the key office in the CPI(M) was shrouded in uncertainty. This was because of a strong competing bid by the dominant faction of the Kerala unit led by Pinarayi Vijayan, which complicated matters until the very end. Ten years older than the outgoing general secretary Prakash Karat, S. Ramachandran Pillai could hardly have been the person to win for the CPI(M) new recruits among India’s youthful, expanding salaried middle-class, and the move found little support from other States. Quite unlike in 2005 when Mr. Karat was elected general secretary, the change of guard in the CPI(M) this time does not mark a generational shift. However, the change is no less significant for that reason. Although of the same generation, Mr. Karat and Mr. Yechury have come to represent very different strands of thought in the party. Mr. Karat is more ideological in his approach, a theorist reluctant to compromise on core issues even when the party enters into electoral seat adjustments with others. Mr. Yechury >believes in greater cooperation and coordination with other secular-democratic parties and in building a more broad-based front to deal with changing ground realities and the growing threats to secularism. An approach that is more accommodative to other parties, based on the recognition of the CPI(M)’s own weaknesses in many parts of the country, is therefore likely. A shift towards the adoption of a native model of socialism, situated in Indian conditions, is a distinct possibility under Mr. Yechury’s stewardship.
The biggest challenge for the CPI(M) under Mr. Yechury is recovering lost ground in West Bengal, where both the Trinamool Congress and the BJP are on the ascendant. Mistakes in Singur and Nandigram were compounded by the failure to see the growing threat from the BJP. The CPI(M) has been successful in bringing left and democratic forces together on a joint programme in States where it has had a strong presence. Now the challenge is to help build a democratic, secular coalition in other States and at the national level. To this end, the party would have to reassess its attitude to the Congress, traditionally a rival in States where it has been in power — Kerala, West Bengal and Tripura. Mr. Yechury can be expected to formulate a pragmatic change in the attitude of the CPI(M) to allow it to play a part in the States where it is a contender for power and at the all-India level, as a binding force for not only the Left parties but also for secular and regional parties.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/promising-change-in-cpim/article7119516.ece
20,4,2015,The secrecy regime,"A >committee set up by the Union government to look into the provisions of the Official Secrets Act, 1923 (OSA) in light of the Right to Information Act, 2005, had its first meeting recently. This marks a step in making a transition from a secrecy regime towards open and transparent governance. Although the move is currently entangled in specific controversies over >declassifying files relating to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, its broader and long-term implications are of enormous significance. The legal position is clear. Whenever there is a conflict between the two laws, the provisions of the RTI Act override those of the OSA. Section 22 of the RTI Act states that its provisions will have effect notwithstanding anything that is inconsistent with them in the OSA. Similarly, under Section 8(2) of the RTI Act a public authority may allow access to information covered under the OSA, “if the public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests”. It is the interpretation of ‘public interest’ that is the challenge. National security laws should balance the need to ensure state sovereignty with principles of transparency and accountability.
The draconian OSA was enacted in 1923 by the British rulers under very different political circumstances, and it was amended post-Independence, perpetuating the insulation of the government from public scrutiny. The statute has provisions that are too broad and vague, often leaving room for arbitrariness. For instance, under Section 2(8)(d) of the Act defining a “prohibited place”, “any railway, road, way or channel or other means of communication by land or water…” can be notified by the Central government as a ‘prohibited place’. Section 3 provides for penalty for spying to be imposed on anyone who is even found in the ‘vicinity’ of a prohibited place. Unsurprisingly, the law has been misused time and again. V.K. Singh, who >wrote a book detailing instances of corruption, nepotism and negligence within the Research and Analysis Wing, was charged with an offence under the OSA. The court had to intervene, granting the retired General anticipatory bail based on the finding that nothing in the book put any national secret in jeopardy. Dr. B.K. Subbarao, a former Navy Captain, was put in the lock-up for months on charges of violating the OSA. The Bombay High Court found his prosecution to be fraudulent. Secrecy in government operations is necessary, but it has to be limited by absolute necessity, keeping the confidentiality strictly time-bound. As part of the review, the Home Secretary will take inputs from security agencies; to make the process more representative, civil society should also be included in the dialogue.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-secrecy-regime/article7119518.ece
27,4,2015,Parliament unbound,"Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan found herself in the eye of the storm last week after she delivered two almost identical rulings on consecutive days >expunging jibes targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A heated debate followed, with an enraged Opposition unitedly questioning her on Thursday on whatever was “unparliamentary” in Aam Aadmi Party MP Bhagwant Mann’s remark that ending farmers’ suicides and the agrarian crisis would require more than a ‘Mann Ki Baat’, in a reference to Mr. Modi’s monthly radio broadcast. In the end, Ms. Mahajan was forced to retreat, saying she did not object to criticism of the Prime Minister — she just wished to emphasise that every issue should not be “politicised”. She agreed to examine the records, saying that if the context permitted such a comment, she would restore it. That has since been done, and Mr. Mann’s words are now part of the parliamentary record. Earlier she acknowledged that she had repeatedly told MPs it was wrong to refer to the Prime Minister in every discussion. On Wednesday, a remark by Congress MP K.C. Venugopal on Mr. Modi during a discussion on attacks on minorities had invited expunction by Ms. Mahajan.
In the 11 months since the Modi government came to power, the growing tension between Ms. Mahajan and the Opposition has been palpable, with many MPs expressing their dismay — if informally — at what they describe as the “partisan” attitude of the Chair. There have been occasions when Ms. Mahajan has directed the switching off of microphones mid-speech; her invocation of “Om Shanti” after obituary references has invited comment. But on Thursday it all exploded in the House in the full glare of the television cameras. In a parliamentary democracy the Speaker’s role is well-defined: once elected, she is expected to detach herself from government activity to run the House impartially. The Rules characterise the Speaker as “the true guardian of the traditions of parliamentary democracy”, stressing that her decisions are “final and binding and ordinarily cannot be questioned, challenged or criticised”. While giving “adequate opportunities to all sections of the House to ventilate their views”, she must “preserve the dignity of the House”. Mr. Modi is neither the first Prime Minister — nor will he be the last — to face Opposition fire in Parliament. Since Independence every Prime Minister has faced criticism. This was true also of Nehru, who enjoyed an absolute majority and enormous public esteem. Dr. Manmohan Singh, who was regularly pilloried in Parliament, would, like all his predecessors, defend himself. Mr. Modi, who has positioned himself as a strong leader, does not need the protection of the Chair. As for the Speaker, she must not just be just, she must be seen to do justice.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/parliament-unbound/article7143730.ece
27,4,2015,Rollback of the Spring,"The >conviction of former Egyptian President Mohammad Morsy and his co-defendants by an Egyptian court last week is the first of several verdicts expected in four major criminal cases brought against the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood (the Ikhwan), which was ousted following the 2013 military coup. Morsy was sentenced to 20 years in prison for inciting riots against protestors outside the presidential palace in December 2012. The protestors were agitating against an order by the President that allowed him to avoid judicial oversight for actions until a new constitutional charter was put in place. There has not been much sympathy for Morsy and his fellow-detainees. The Muslim Brotherhood’s sectarian attempts while in government to radically restructure Egypt’s institutions on Islamist lines had also resulted in protests in 2013 by liberals and secular-minded people. This had ultimately paved the way for the military re-establishing control, with some liberals supporting the move then. Yet, this was unmistakably a coup that overthrew a legitimately elected government. The Freedom and Justice Party affiliated to the Brotherhood had, after all, won the parliamentary and presidential elections held in 2011 and 2012. Since coming to power, the new military government led by General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has sought to persecute the movement, slapping case after case on its leaders.
The bulk of those killed during the December 2012 protests were members of the Brotherhood, and it is unclear what happened during that round. It would appear that the cases against Morsy and his associates are politically motivated and meant to get back at the Brotherhood, which had used the post-Arab Spring protests to consolidate itself. Mr. Sisi’s regime is now reminiscent of the Hosni Mubarak dictatorship. The persecution is not limited to the Brotherhood; even the liberals and secular-minded sections of the population that were part of the Spring protests are at the receiving end. There is a clampdown on the media and a crackdown on all dissent. Egypt meanwhile continues to receive military aid from the West and allies such as Saudi Arabia, and it has restored its domestic and foreign policy on lines that existed prior to the Brotherhood’s ascent to power. The Brotherhood’s brief reign in power was problematic. But utilising the opportunity provided by popular protests to revert to a dictatorship has negated all that was achieved during the 2011 ‘Revolution’. Egypt is thus back to square one, and faces an additional problem that could hurt it in the long run — an indignant Brotherhood reeling under repression.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mohammad-morsy-conviction-rollback-of-the-spring/article7143732.ece
28,4,2015,Himalayan disaster,"The devastating impact of the >earthquake in Nepal, measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale, could have been mitigated if there was some preparedness for the tragedy beforehand. More than 3,800 people in that country and around 40 people in India are reported to have lost their lives while thousands more are injured. Nepalis were f >orewarned about the possibility of a major earthquake, as the country was located on a geological fault line where tectonic plates were constantly on the move below the earth’s surface. The process was expected to release pent-up energy any time following these intense tectonic shifts. Expectedly and unfortunately, nature’s unleashed fury has resulted in a colossal tragedy, especially in the Kathmandu valley, while there is little news about those affected closer to the epicentre in Lamjung district in the hilly tracts of interior Nepal.
Of the many natural disasters, earthquakes are the most difficult to predict; some experts suggest that it is even impossible to do so. The best of earthquake warning systems, such as the ones installed in Japan, are only capable of warning regional centres about the possible impact of ongoing earthquakes. Yet, there are ways of mitigating disasters — building structures that are relatively quake-resistant, preparing for evacuation by constructing centres specifically for the purpose, and sensitising the public about quakes and their devastating impact. Is it such an impossible task to remain prepared, knowing full well that seismic zones are prone to frequent quakes? Japan, which is a country prone to regular earthquakes, has shown the way on disaster mitigation and preparedness. Unfortunately, in the congested urban settings of developing countries these steps are difficult to implement. Now the need is to help Nepal find its feet in providing relief and rehabilitation to the quake survivors as they brace for more aftershocks, rain and landslips. In this regard, the alacrity of the Indian government, among others, in sending aid to Nepal, and the prompt effort in evacuating Indian citizens are commendable. With governance in Nepal still seemingly a fragile structure given that the Constituent Assembly is yet to conclude its exercises because of the fractious political process, the centralisation of resources in the Kathmandu valley has not helped the government. It would have been better off delegating responsibilities to local government structures, which have been absent for more than a decade in the country. It will be terribly unfortunate if the lessons of this yet-unfolding tragedy are not properly learnt. Meanwhile, our hearts go out to the Nepali people. It is imperative that the flow of international aid be stepped up to help restore the battered Himalayan state.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/nepal-earthquake-a-himalayan-disaster/article7147506.ece
28,4,2015,Challenge of agrarian distress,"Everything else can wait but agriculture cannot, said Jawaharlal Nehru. This should have been the talisman for India’s progress. Yet, successive governments have failed to accord agriculture the priority it deserves. The tragic >suicide of a farmer during an Aam Aadmi Party rally in New Delhi has brought to the fore the agrarian crisis facing India. Official records reveal that >more than 2.96 lakh farmers have ended their lives over the last two decades. This year has been particularly bad because of damage to the rabi crop caused by rain and hailstorms. Extensive damage to cash crops and horticulture has brought even some prosperous farmers to the brink of ruin. Despite the adverse impact of climate change, non-remunerative prices, lack of adequate irrigation facilities, absence of assured income and paucity of crop insurance, Indian farmers have brought the country up to the ranks of the top global producers of rice, wheat, vegetables, fruits and milk. Some 85 per cent of India’s farmers are small and marginal, and 65 per cent of farming is rain-fed. But high input costs, low returns, the consequent inability to repay farm loans, and general neglect have made agriculture unviable for the small and marginal farmer. Government spending here has dwindled over the years to 14.7 per cent, and the private sector has demurred, citing lack of rural infrastructure and modernisation.
For all its assertions, the Narendra Modi government has yet to come up with a clear strategy on this front. Barely a few months in power, it came up with some controversial >amendments to the 2013 Land Acquisition Act, doing away with the provisions for obtaining consent from landowners and for social impact assessment ahead of acquisition. The government’s insistence that the changes would facilitate ease of business and speed up its development agenda has not convinced the Opposition parties. Its handling of the impact of unseasonal rain on farmers, slippages in keeping its promise to raise the support price for major crops, and tardy payments to sugarcane growers have given rise to a perception that the government is not farmer-friendly. A majority of farmers are in the clutches of private moneylenders who double up as sellers of seeds, fertilizers and other inputs. A failed crop pushes growers into deeper debt, from which it is not easy to escape. The forecast of a deficient southwest monsoon for the second year in a row adds to the worries. In such a situation, the Central government must display political will and come up with urgent measures that will bring the promised “achche din” to farmers. Leaving the task to the States won’t help.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/farmer-suicide-in-delhi-challenge-of-agrarian-distress/article7147507.ece
29,4,2015,Lessons from a verdict,"Three conclusions may be drawn from the Supreme Court >ruling that the Tamil Nadu government did not have the jurisdiction to appoint a Special Public Prosecutor to handle the appeals filed by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. First, it reflects poorly on the State government, which displayed what the court called “anxiety” to ensure representation for the prosecution when her bail application came up for hearing immediately after her conviction in a Bengaluru Special Court in September last year. Secondly, the Tamil Nadu and Karnataka governments demonstrated inexcusable ignorance of the legal position that once a case was transferred from one State to another, the transferring State loses jurisdiction to pursue it further. This position had been underscored by the Supreme Court only a few years ago. Thirdly, the Supreme Court continues to lay emphasis on the purity of the criminal process in corruption cases and will not countenance attempts to derail the process. Fears that the disposal of the appeals made in the Karnataka High Court by Ms. Jayalalithaa and her three associates against their four-year jail term would be delayed have been allayed, as the three-judge Bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra has ruled out a de novo hearing. It has also clarified that Section 301 of the CrPC (which says a Special Prosecutor appointed for a ‘case’ may appear without written authority in any court) does not mean that a person appointed as prosecutor in a district court could also appear before a high court in the same case.
The Karnataka government has now brought back B.V. Acharya, who had earlier vigorously prosecuted the case but was >forced to resign, to represent it while filing its submissions before the High Court. It will be seen as a legal setback to Ms. Jayalalithaa mainly because she and her lawyers gave the impression that they wanted Mr. Bhavani Singh to be the prosecutor in the appellate stage too. They ought to have known that no court would allow the accused to choose the counsel for the prosecution. As a result, the court has asked the High Court to disregard Mr. Singh’s written submissions, if any. The Supreme Court’s reminder to the High Court that corruption has a “corroding effect”, that it is the duty of an appellate judge to scrutinise objectively the evidence on record in its entirety and that his reasoning ought to be “resolutely expressed”, may cause some anxiety to the defence as to whether there is any implicit direction to the High Court to decide the matter in a particular manner. However, a look at the context would show that the Supreme Court is doing no such thing. Rather, it is only reinforcing its view that want of proper assistance from one side need not affect the outcome if the appellate judge is sufficiently objective and avoids weakness and vacillation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lessons-from-a-verdict/article7151374.ece
29,4,2015,Regressive message,"“To be liberal and outspoken in the Pakistan of today is tantamount to painting a target in the middle of your forehead,” said one newspaper in Pakistan, about the >killing of Sabeen Mahmud, activist and owner of a Karachi coffee-house, who was gunned down at a traffic light as she drove home. Ms. Mahmud’s killing didn’t come without warning, however. Each time a journalist or activist is killed in Pakistan it is a warning to others to hold off speaking on issues that are inconvenient to its religious and extremist establishment inside and outside power. The attack by gunmen on Geo TV anchor Hamid Mir in Karachi a year ago came after threats were issued over his reports on extrajudicial killings in Balochistan. The killing of journalist Saleem Shahzad in 2011 followed his article about radicalisation within the military, and the killing of journalist Raza Rumi’s driver in an attack where he himself escaped came after Mr. Rumi’s TV programmes against the killing of religious minorities over blasphemy charges were aired. Ms. Sabeen, who had crossed swords with these groups, had been sent a threat letter just a week prior to her killing for her decision to hold a discussion on human rights violations in Balochistan at her coffee-house. The message is as brutal as the bullets pumped into the two: if you want to remain alive in Pakistan, stay away from criticising its powerful religious terrorist groups and their patrons within the government and the military. Ms. Mahmud may not have been a journalist in the traditional sense of the term, but her widely acclaimed efforts for free speech and online popularity made her as dangerous to those groups as any of the others targeted. In 2012, UNESCO named Pakistan the second most dangerous place for journalists, and the Committee to Protect Journalists has criticised the government for lack of progress in handling attacks against the media.
What makes Ms. Mahmud’s killing truly ironic is that it comes at a time when Pakistan has launched a National Action Plan to counter terrorism and extremism, and weeks after the Army launched operations to counter crime and violence in Karachi. Both efforts seem to ring hollow when an unarmed woman and her mother can be surrounded at a busy traffic intersection and shot multiple times in cold blood. As the outcry against Pakistan’s establishment over the killing mounted, the services, ISPR, put out an unusual statement condemning the killing and promising a full inquiry. As journalists and activists who gathered to mourn yet another member of their tribe said, this is fitting, as even if they weren’t responsible for the killing, it is hard to believe “the all powerful intelligence can’t find out who is.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-assassination-of-sabeen-mahmud-a-regressive-message/article7151375.ece
30,4,2015,MGNREGS as insurance,"With unseasonal rain laying waste vast areas under the rabi crop in north India earlier this year and the threat of a deficient monsoon looming, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme could act as a real salve for distressed farm workers and labourers. The >World Bank’s brief statement on the scheme on Tuesday to this effect, as part of its latest India Development Update, concurs with recent empirical research that has revealed that the MGNREGS has acted as an effective substitute in the absence of crop and weather insurance to poor farm households in some States lately. The National Democratic Alliance government would do well to heed this timely suggestion from the World Bank, which has released a volume on the scheme based on research done in 2009 and 2010. The Bank goes on to say that the MGNREGS can be a better-targeted scheme than even a cash transfer programme. Yet, reports reveal that there is much unmet demand for labour provided under the MGNREGS over the past year, due to poor implementation by some State governments and a general apathy shown by the NDA regime since last year. This is evident in the reduced outlays for the scheme (as acknowledged by the Finance Minister, yet addressed only with a promise of additional budgetary support subject to the availability of revenues), and delays in transfer of monies to State governments which has led to tardy wage payments. All this has resulted in an unresponsive set of conditions that has not encouraged demand for labour provided under the scheme. The government’s effort to identify the poorer districts for higher allocations has only seemed to curtail demand in the other districts, which number much higher. The MGNREGS is a demand-driven scheme, but the fact that it requires adequate conditions for its effective implementation is self-evident.
The laxity in the implementation of the scheme over the past year has meant a reduction in the number of workdays as compared to previous years. There are certainly a number of improvements that are required to be made. These include better and more productive asset-creation through work done, improved administrative management, provision of information to and sensitisation of the public as the World Bank also points out, and checking leakages. But the fact that the MGNREGS has provided succour to India’s poorest sections in rural areas is something that has been acknowledged and acclaimed, as the World Bank statement also shows. Considering that the benefits of the scheme outweigh the drawbacks, it would be an act of poverty if the government does not utilise the MGNREGS to bring relief during a time of significant agrarian distress in a number of States.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mgnregs-as-insurance/article7155059.ece
30,4,2015,The importance of finishing second,"Local body elections rarely if ever command wider national attention. But in >West Bengal, the elections to civic bodies this time were of more than local interest, for a variety of reasons. While the Trinamool Congress, some of whose leaders are under investigation for their reported involvement in financial scams, was seeking a popular vote of confidence, the Bharatiya Janata Party was hoping to supplant the Left parties as the principal opposition in the State. In the event, the BJP could not wrest control of a single civic body, while the Trinamool, winning 71 of the 92 civic bodies, improved on its 2010 performance. The Trinamool’s good performance was less of a surprise than the BJP’s poor showing. After the defeat of the Left Front government, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) had yielded ground to both the Trinamool Congress and the BJP, raising visions of a polarisation of votes that could have marginalised both the Left Front and the Congress. But the BJP evidently could not live up to its initial promise. Whether or not local factors came into play and damaged its prospects is not clear, but the BJP can take little comfort in its failure to win a single civic body outright. For the Trinamool Congress, a bigger win than in 2010 was as important as winning itself. By bettering its performance, the party can now with some justification claim that a majority of the people believe that political motives were at the heart of the cases foisted on its leaders.
Despite finishing second, the Left Front could have found little cheer in the results. Yet, in the context of its rapid decline from a party that ruled West Bengal continuously for 34 years to an organisation fighting hard to retain even its traditional support base, the CPI(M) could have done far worse than finishing a poor second. In a State where the negative vote is an important component of electoral politics, the party could ill-afford to lose its status as the principal opposition to the Trinamool. Just as a good chunk of the traditional Trinamool voters are oriented against the Left parties, the Left Front too can hope to gain from any disenchantment with the Trinamool so long as it occupies the Opposition space. Any failure to retain the second spot would have meant further erosion in the base of the Left, strengthening the BJP. This is no turnaround in the fortunes of the Left parties, but the very fact that the BJP could not make significant gains is some consolation for the war-weary Left Front. The battle was for the second place, and the BJP has lost it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/west-bengal-civic-body-elections-the-importance-of-finishing-second/article7155060.ece
1,5,2015,Message loud and clear,"With an explicit >signal to Pakistan to open up its trade access for Afghan trucks all the way to the Indian check posts at the Wagah-Attari border, Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani is doing more than talking about economic connectivity. His pointed remarks in an exclusive interview to this newspaper seemed to underscore possibilities of an alternative reality for South Asia, one in which all countries in the region open up the world for one another. Thus, while Pakistan could, if it chooses, offer the possibility of trucks moving from Kabul to Kolkata and Chittagong, it could equally open up opportunities for India to Central Asia, even as other countries in SAARC follow suit. While this may sound fanciful, the reality is that the only road blocks to such a vision are political and can easily be adopted on the ground. If Pakistan joins other SAARC countries to sign the Motor Vehicles Agreement and fully implements the Afghanistan Pakistan Transit and Trade Agreement (APTTA) it signed in 2011, the subcontinent could see a revolution on the roads. The call from President Ghani during his visit to Delhi comes at a particular ‘subcontinental moment’. Every SAARC nation has pitched in to help with Nepal’s urgent need for help in the aftermath of its earthquake. While India has taken the lead, rushing planes with relief just six hours after the tragedy struck, others have followed. Pakistan and Sri Lanka have rushed manpower and supplies with their own relief planes. Nature’s fury doesn’t recognise political borders, and neither should humans. In a welcome move, Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed earthquake relief with Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on the telephone on Thursday. Mr. Modi did well to suggest a SAARC disaster management team and joint exercises on mitigating natural disasters.
Significantly, Mr. Ghani also spoke of building a subcontinental network to cooperate on fighting terror. The new and mutating threat from IS or Da’esh has ‘changed the game’, according to him. In the past, insurgencies or anti-national terror organisations threatened the state, but the “prize” now is not in defeating the state but in destruction. The only way to counter the threat is for these very states to unite in fighting it. The key challenge is to solve political differences so that all the countries of the region can remove road blocks to growth and build highways, energy pipelines and fibre optic i-ways which will bring prosperity to the region. Building connectivity economically and thereby politically will provide the key to a more integrated economic region, paving the way for better relations in the larger neighbourhood.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ashraf-ghani-in-india-message-loud-and-clear/article7159338.ece
1,5,2015,India’s urban challenges,"The Union Cabinet’s nod on Wednesday to the >100 smart cities project and a new urban renewal mission is an important first step toward dealing with an old problem that has only got progressively worse over the years: urban liveability. A shade less than a third of India’s population now lives in urban areas, overcrowded cities and towns with infrastructure bursting at the seams. This problem will only worsen with little or no intervention happening. The proportion of the urban population can only go in one direction — upward — as more Indians migrate to the cities and towns in search of jobs. Cities are engines of growth, and as a result attract a lot of people. The country’s urban population contributes over 60 per cent of India’s GDP; in 15 years this will be 70 per cent. On the other hand, there is little incentive for people to migrate out of cities. Earlier attempts at providing better urban infrastructure or at creating new townships have not been able to deal with the issue of liveability satisfactorily. Even successful special economic zones have had to contend with the issue of lack of social infrastructure, which usually means access to avenues of education, health, arts, sports, and so on. There are numerous definitions of a smart city but the Modi government’s idea of one usefully encompasses institutional infrastructure (governance), physical infrastructure, as also social infrastructure.
The Cabinet approval marks the first of many steps, as also the easiest, that will be required for the project. The challenges start now. Of course there is no doubt that this has created tremendous enthusiasm amongst many possible stakeholders, including service providers who have been part of smart city projects elsewhere in the world. Countries such as Japan, Singapore and Germany, among many others, have evinced interest to be a part of this. Yet, in its scale and complexity the project will be second to none. The official estimates of per capita investment requirement is Rs.43,386 for a 20-year period, or a total investment of Rs.7 lakh crore. Creating a smart city isn’t just about creating the physical infrastructure — roads, clean water, power, transport and so on, things India finds difficult to deliver to its citizens nearly seven decades after Independence. It is hoped that public private partnerships (PPP) will deliver but the mechanism seems to need a lot of tweaking in order for it to work, a fact acknowledged in the recent Budget. The big challenge will be to create self-sustaining cities, which create jobs, use resources wisely and also train people. This also means more autonomy for these cities. Whether that can happen is a moot question depending heavily on the maturity of the Indian political system.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/100-smart-cities-project-and-indias-urban-challenges/article7159339.ece
2,5,2015,Amending the law against corruption,"Not all the >amendments to the Prevention of Corruption Act cleared by the Union Cabinet last week inspire public confidence or meet the objective of filling gaps in domestic anti-corruption law. In significant respects, the proposals fall short of public expectations and fail to address key issues in corruption jurisprudence. In its Bill introduced in the Rajya Sabha in 2013, the UPA government proposed to extend the protection of prior sanction for prosecuting public servants to former officials. The ostensible reason was that Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure protected retired officials, while the PCA covered only serving officials. The government wants to stick to this change, when it would have been more advisable to bring the CrPC in consonance with the PCA. The sanction provision ought to have been restricted to prosecutions that flow from deviations from public policy, laws and regulations. Possessing unexplained assets, being caught red-handed while taking a bribe and misappropriating property cannot be actions in the course of official functions, and in such cases prior sanction cannot be required. The Bill drops the protection accorded to bribe-givers if they depose during trial, thereby deterring those coerced into giving a bribe from subsequently testifying against offenders. A distinction ought to have been made between collusive bribery and bribery under coercion.
The expanded provision relating to bribery and enhanced jail terms are positive developments, but the idea of subsuming most offences now covered under ‘criminal misconduct’ into a single clause should be revisited, lest some form of abuse of office slips through the net. Another worrisome aspect is the change made to the offence of possessing ‘disproportionate assets’. When the 2013 Bill used the term ‘intentional enrichment’, it seemed as though the prosecution needed to prove the possession of unexplained assets as well as the ‘intention’ to enrich oneself. The government now says “possession of disproportionate assets” will be proof of “such illicit enrichment”. It is to be hoped that this will mean the prosecution need not prove the intention to amass wealth, as such an additional requirement would allow those in possession of ill-gotten wealth to escape the law. The proposed amendments have positive aspects too. They seek to curb commercial entities from offering inducements to public servants and provide for punishments to individuals in charge of such entities. The trial court itself can now deal with the process of attachment of property instead of the district court. Fixing a time frame for grant of sanction and completion of trial is a welcome feature. A crucial opportunity to overhaul the anti-corruption law should not be lost through imperfect amendments.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/amending-the-law-against-corruption/article7162261.ece
2,5,2015,America’s perennial angst,"That despite being an economic superpower the United States has severe domestic issues tied to poverty, marginalisation and crime was made even more evident in the recent protests that turned into >riots in Baltimore. These riots followed the death of an African-American youth, Freddie Gray, at the hands of the city police in early April and were not a one-off occurrence. They were just the latest in a series of convulsions that has rocked American cities owing to what is perceived as racist policing and targeting of “black” youth by law enforcement officials. Last year in the town of Ferguson in Missouri, similar riots had occurred after a white police officer shot down a black teenager, Michael Brown, in what was perceived as an unprovoked act. The U.S. had also seen a raging public debate over the acquittal of a neighbourhood protection volunteer, George Zimmerman, in the case of the murder of another black teenager, Trayvon Martin, in Florida in 2012. These and other recent incidents suggest a disturbing picture of law enforcement in which African-Americans — especially young males — are unfairly targeted, stereotyped and subject to brutal methods of policing. With dwindling employment opportunities due to insufficient education and poverty, the community suffers from high rates of criminal incidence, stereotyping the young African-American. The problem, which is somewhat different from more blatant issues of racism, segregation and civil rights in the 1960s and 1970s, has been acknowledged by President Barack Obama and other politicians, but little has been done to address it.
Baltimore, a city that has a high concentration of African-Americans relative to other parts of the country, suffers from specific issues such as urban poverty owing to long-term deindustrialisation and unemployment. It has very high crime rates with the African-American youth of the inner cities in particular prone to be blamed for them even as they face difficult living conditions. Law enforcement in the city has been characterised by police brutality, and despite a better racial balance than elsewhere in the country in the city’s administration there is a severe lack of confidence in the system among residents. The abysmal state of affairs, which was depicted realistically by the popular TV series The Wire, extends to other inner cities as well. Unless the U.S. rethinks its strategies on crime and punishment with respect to the black community — incarceration rates among African-Americans continue to remain unacceptably high – and until the economic system evolves a way of addressing inner-city poverty, such incidents seem destined to recur.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/baltimore-riots-and-americas-perennial-angst/article7162262.ece
4,5,2015,Nepal’s moment of truth,"As the dust settles over Nepal, the landlocked country is saddled with questions related to disaster management and state structure, to be answered by its polity and those in charge of governance. As reports point out, >Nepal’s earthquake tragedy — with the loss of 7,000 lives (and counting), physical and psychological injuries to many more, and extensive damage to property — has been exacerbated by the fact that rescue, relief and rehabilitation efforts are concentrated in the Kathmandu valley. Areas closer to the epicentre are mostly inaccessible: the roads are broken, and landslips have ravaged an already difficult terrain. Yet it is in these very areas that the damage has been the most severe. The Nepal government has virtually thrown its hands up, showing up its incapacity to address the severity of the problem, as aid flow from agencies, and countries including India and China, has filled the breach to a limited extent. This incapacity is, to a great extent, the Nepal polity’s own making, unable as it has been to complete the Constitution-writing project started in 2008. Meanwhile, poor governance has rendered Nepal a difficult place to live in. Out-migration has been on the rise, even as many Nepalis have flocked to the capital city despite its congestion. Most of the economic activity is concentrated in and around the valley. So are the donor agencies and the bulk of the political leadership in charge of aid distribution.
The issues that have held up the successful completion of the Constitution-writing process are closely related to the present inability of the Nepal government to respond quickly and effectively to the natural disaster. If Nepal had been a truly federal republic with greater decentralisation of power at the local levels, and had a diversified economic base that is not limited to the valley, would there not have been better roads and more responsive administrative systems in place in some of the most-affected places beyond the valley? If these federal units had been structured in such a manner as to give local communities greater power and responsibility, would they not have been more prepared to handle disaster? Would not a strong executive unhindered by differences between the presidency and the parliamentary leadership have helped more streamlined decision-making? The answers to these questions are in the affirmative. This then suggests that the promise of the successive Jan-Andolans that led to the formation of the Constituent Assembly in the first place has to be realised by a responsible and forward-thinking polity. Nepal’s political class ought to use this juncture as a spur to finalise a Constitution. This should allow its citizenry to be better prepared for any more such tragedies in the seismically fragile zone they inhabit.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/nepals-moment-of-truth/article7167427.ece
4,5,2015,Pseudo-science and gender bias,"The imbroglio over >Baba Ramdev’s ‘Divya Putrajeevak Beej’, the ayurvedic medicine that was allegedly branded to promise the birth of male offspring, has mostly been about its blatantly expressed son-preference. Raised in the Rajya Sabha, the issue hogged the limelight last week, with the Opposition demanding an explanation from the government whose Chief Executive has shared many a platform with the yoga guru in the past. Positing the drug beside the recently-launched >Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (save the girl child) programme of the Central government, critics used the opportunity to level questions at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The outrage was warranted: the 2011 Census indicated a child sex ratio (0-6 years) of 914 — meaning for every 1,000 boys there were 86 girls missing. For years the sex ratio in India has been low, abysmal in certain decades as in 2001-11, skewed in favour of males, thanks to an irrational preference for boys over girls. Amounting to eugenics, in its extreme, involving attempts to influence the sex of the child preconception, son preference is more commonly manifested as insidious termination of pregnancies or female infanticide. Any attempt to perpetuate gender bias must be nipped in the bud.
Baba Ramdev himself subsequently retorted that Putrajeevak was only a generic term for child in its original Sanskrit sense, and that it only promised to target female infertility. He stoutly maintained that any reference to son preference was imagined, not intended, and promised non-ambiguous packaging. However, without splitting hairs over nomenclature, it is important to see the occasion for what it presents: an opportunity to make an emphatic call for a scientific validation of the country’s traditional systems of medicine. When the Bharatiya Janata Party government upgraded the Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) into a Ministry in 2014, it was expected that this would result in the scientific validation of various drugs offered by these systems. It has been the argument of scientists that the potency claims with respect to these drugs rest largely on those making or dispensing them, and as such these undergo no proper review or validation — a tried and tested process that allopathy swears by. Some of these claims tend to border on the fantastic, and can even attract the penal provisions of the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act. It is absolutely essential that the state, while promoting these pluralistic healing traditions, ensures that when people make the choice to go in for such treatment, they are reassured by science, and not just blind faith.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pseudoscience-and-gender-bias/article7167428.ece
5,5,2015,Local politics in foreign policy,"When it comes to foreign policy, India is one whole, not the sum of its parts. Which is why the government’s plans to introduce a Constitutional amendment in Parliament in order to operationalise the India-Bangladesh >land boundary agreement (LBA) for the three States of West Bengal, Meghalaya and Tripura, but not for Assam, is an unwholesome precedent. Simply put, of all the 162 enclaves and 5,044 acres of land in ‘adverse possession’ that have been carefully analysed and agreed to for the land swap on both sides of the border, the 268 acres that Assam is due to hand over will not be included. The reasoning for this exclusion seems to be political: ahead of the Assam Assembly elections this year, the ruling BJP doesn’t wish to be seen “giving away” land to the neighbour, Bangladesh.
Equally political is the reaction of the Opposition Congress party, that rules the State of Assam, which now opposes the government move simply because it doesn’t want to give it a political advantage ahead of elections. Both have over the past decade allowed these short-sighted calculations to turn an important bilateral agreement into a game of political football. Even though former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh had, after several delays, signed the protocol for the LBA in 2011, the UPA government never made it enough of a priority to clear it through both Houses of Parliament during its tenure. Now, the NDA government, that had promised Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina that the bill would be tabled in the winter session, plans to introduce it at the fag end of the budget session, and that too in truncated form.
Each of these delays don’t just put off an agreement to resolve a crucial issue between India and Bangladesh, they chip away at India’s credibility in the neighbourhood. Four decades later, India seems no closer to completing an agreement that had been all but signed and sealed, and even ratified by Bangladesh in 1974. And it is no closer to putting the roughly 51,000 people living in these areas out of their uncertainty and misery.
What seems to be even more troubling is the Bangladesh government’s claim, as spelt out in an interview by the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to The Hindu in Dhaka, that it was yet to be formally notified about the revised plan for the bill. If the NDA government is indeed serious about its neighbourhood policy, such a lapse of communication is unhealthy, as its handling of this issue will be a key indicator to all neighbours about how India will attempt to resolve issues with them in the next few years. The government and the Opposition must put their political differences aside to build bipartisan support for the original agreement they have both at various points acceded to. Bilateral accords are built on the principle that the government of India speaks for all States and all parties within the country.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/indiabangladesh-land-boundary-agreement-local-politics-in-foreign-policy/article7170958.ece
5,5,2015,Pile-ups at High Courts,"That India’s courts are clogged with long-pending cases is well-known, but the texture of the problem is something we’ve known little about so far. A new database of court data lays out some of the contours of the issue: over 40 lakh >cases are pending in India’s High Courts, and a tenth in courts for which data are available have been pending for over ten years. The oldest case languishing in the few courts for which enough data are available is just a decade younger than India itself. A quarter of the cases for which information is available are pending at the admission stage itself. An earlier Law Commission report found that the situation was far more dire in the lower courts — at the end of 2012, some one crore cases were pending in Subordinate Judicial Services courts and 20 lakh cases in Higher Judicial Services courts across 12 High Court jurisdictions in the country. A certain fatality has marked India’s efforts to deal with pendency thus far. We are a big country, we are a litigious people, we have chronic administrative undercapacity and a perennially under-resourced judiciary, we are told. So enormous has the problem begun to appear in the public mind that it has seemed impossible to fix. This is not necessarily true.
For one, the real extent of judicial pendency in India is nearly impossible to estimate on account of an utter lack of standardisation in data classification and management systems; virtually every State is a law unto itself, collecting and classifying case data as it chooses, making it impossible to compare with the neighbouring State. This is not a purely technical concern; it has severely hamstrung India’s efforts to understand the nature of not just judicial delay, but the judicial process itself. There is no good reason for this state of affairs to continue; the technology to resolve this is now easily and cheaply available. In addition, there are simple administrative fixes that have been suggested by reform-minded judges. As Chief Justice of the Madras High Court, Justice A.P. Shah had instituted evening courts to look after traffic and police challans, which account for over a third of all cases pending in the lower courts. Such cases need to be removed from the regular court system altogether. Plea bargaining is another judicial reform step that has not yet picked up in India. Finally, the grossly inadequate judge strength must increase; even if not the doubling of judge strength as promised in the past by the Ministry of Law and Justice, a significant leap is unavoidable. For justice and the rule of law to seem meaningful to the people, the government must back its assurances with resources.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pending-cases-pileups-at-high-courts/article7170959.ece
6,5,2015,Parliamentary face-off,"The likelihood of the Modi government pushing through key Bills relating to land acquisition, real estate and a goods and services tax in the few days left of the Budget session is beginning to look increasingly remote. It can perhaps bank on getting approval for the black money law, and that too because as a money bill, support or otherwise in the Rajya Sabha (where it does not have the numbers) is irrelevant. The BJP’s parliamentary managers had hoped to replicate the strategy adopted in the early half of the Budget session when they breached Opposition unity by first taking up the Bill to increase FDI in insurance conceived by the UPA government, to secure Congress support. Next, they persuaded parties that run State governments and stood to benefit through the coal and mines Bills — West Bengal’s Trinamool Congress and Odisha’s Biju Janata Dal — to back them. This time, however, the Congress, that remains undecided on the GST Bill —though it had brought in the Bill during UPA rule — saying the BJP has changed it, is also opposing the real estate bill, emboldened by the return of a seemingly rejuvenated Rahul Gandhi. The government, that had excluded Assam from the >India-Bangladesh Land Boundary Agreement Bill in order to appease its voters in that State, has been forced to retract under pressure from the Congress and, more importantly, Bangladesh: the latter made its displeasure known on changes that smacked of bullying. As for the Real Estate (Amendment) Bill, the Opposition has forced the government to agree to send it to a select committee in the Rajya Sabha.
If the Modi government finds itself in a tight spot over key pieces of legislation, it has only itself to blame. Barring the Land Acquisition Bill, over which there is resistance from a united Opposition, there is enough common ground for it to have found a way out. The ruling dispensation’s key failing has been its attitude that is reflected in the Prime Minister Modi’s fleeting appearances in the Houses, the manner in which even junior Ministers such as Rajiv Pratap Rudy “advise” the Lok Sabha Speaker on what to expunge from records, or Parliamentary Affairs Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu saying that the BJP’s Lok Sabha majority entitles it to steamroll Bills through. The government has shown scant respect for normal parliamentary practices such as sending key Bills to standing committees. Also, the government attracted the wrath of the Opposition first by sequencing the GST Bill ahead of the Finance Bill — the centrepiece of the Budget session — and then by including non-taxation proposals in it. It was forced eventually to withdraw on both counts. Clearly, the government needs to take some lessons in parliamentary democracy. If it doesn’t now reach out to the Opposition, the face-off will continue, to its own detriment.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/parliamentary-faceoff/article7173962.ece
6,5,2015,Targets forever,"On April 29, a teenage girl and her mother were thrown off a moving public transport bus just outside Moga in Punjab. >The girl died, while the mother is still in hospital. Shinder Kaur, 36, had boarded the Orbit bus at Moga with her daughter, aged 13, and son, aged 14. When Ms. Kaur objected to being overcharged, the conductor and helper began to abuse her and make lewd comments. When she appealed to the driver for help, he started speeding up instead. As the family began to protest loudly, the girl was pushed to the door and thrown off, followed by her mother. Her brother was forced off shortly afterwards. The incident is inhuman in itself, but several facts have added to the outrage. First, the bus company is owned by members of the family of Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, whose son, Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal, first denied the family’s stake, and then refused to take responsibility for the incident. Second, at least two politicians from the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal made the worst kind of insensitive remarks on the tragedy. Punjab Education Minister Surjit Singh Rakhra said the death of the girl was “god’s will”, while Moga MLA Joginderpal Jain insisted it was an “accident” that could happen “on any bus”. If there was some hope that all the uproar and protest countrywide following the Nirbhaya rape case would usher in a slightly different kind of discourse on the abuse of women, that hope has been belied by a series of incidents and reactions.
Three aspects here are particularly troubling. First, why is it that not one of the other 15 passengers on the bus came forward to help the woman and her children? Have people in India become so inured to the abuse of women that they take it for granted and just watch? Second, was the bus crew emboldened to break the law so blatantly because powerful people owned the transport company? Political patronage often shields the worst criminals in India. And finally, if our lawmakers have a mindset that lets them term an obvious case of molestation and manslaughter as “god’s will” or an “accident”, then where does one even begin to protect women’s rights in India? >Mr. Sukhbir Badal has since said it is “absurd” to think an incident involving such brutality would go “unpunished because of the company’s ownership”. One hopes this will turn out to be true. Political parties are trying to get mileage from the incident. Meanwhile, on multiple fronts, open violence against women continues. It will continue until attitudes change at the grassroots level, aided by teachers, parents and others, and by TV, cinema and pop culture — which ought to push narratives of power for women.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/moga-molestation-targets-forever/article7173963.ece
7,5,2015,The day of the citizen,"Salman Khan is no ordinary film star with blockbusters and fan clubs to his name. A celebrity who not only mentors younger actors but also actively aids social service, he is hugely popular among both the producers and the consumers of Bollywood films. Not surprisingly, >his conviction in the hit-and-run case resulted not in any dent in his image or popularity, but in a huge wave of >sympathy from fellow Bollywood stars and film fans. The Mumbai Sessions Court therefore did well to not be swayed by the groundswell of support for the megastar while handing down the judgment in the 2002 case. The verdict was broadly in line with the Supreme Court’s observations in the Alistair Pereira case that the law should be equal for celebrities and ordinary citizens alike in serious offences that result in deaths. Pereira, 21, from a wealthy business family, lost control of his luxury car in Bandra in November 2006 and ran over five labourers and two children sleeping on the pavement. Though the Supreme Court upheld the three-year sentence given by the Bombay High Court, it said that was too “lenient” a punishment for an offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The Supreme Court indicated that trial courts should not give the benefit of the doubt to those driving drunk and instead convict them under 304 II (punishable with 10 years imprisonment) than the lesser offence of 304 A that provides for a jail term of two years for negligent and rash driving.
Sessions Court judge D.W. Deshpande’s verdict also nailed attempts by Salman’s lawyers to pin the blame on his driver Ashok Singh, the only defence witness who was suddenly brought up at the last stage of the 13- year-long trial. Singh testified that it was he who drove the vehicle that the prosecution claimed Salman drove in a drunken state. But Judge Deshpande was not convinced, and told Salman as much on the day of the judgment. Though Indian courts have been relatively less stringent in pursuing perjury cases, it is important that the judiciary pursue the perjury matter against Ashok Singh to expose why he was willing to take the blame. The Bollywood discourse that Salman was paying the price for his celebrity status, and that he had done humanitarian work, has an eerie echo with similar arguments made for Sanjay Dutt in the 1993 serial bombings case. Quite rightly, the court did not take such extraneous considerations into account, and the judgment will serve as a model for the lower judiciary in cases of a similar nature. For the police, the lesson is that they cannot be slipshod in investigations. Perhaps the most important message is for society at large: drunken driving could have serious consequences for other people. Deaths caused by drivers under the influence of alcohol should attract the charge of culpable homicide, and not merely that of negligent driving.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/2002-salman-hitandrun-case-the-day-ofthe-citizen/article7177624.ece
7,5,2015,Patent pressures,"In its 2015 Special 301 Report on Intellectual Property Rights, the office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has retained India in its “Priority Watch List”, noting however that bilateral engagement between the two countries on IPR concerns had increased over the past year. The USTR had done an Out-of-Cycle review of India in 2014, mentioning the improvement in trade ties, and this year ruled out another immediate review. The U.S. wants India to bring its IPR regime closer to norms that the former seeks and has been uncomfortable in particular with the clauses in the Patents Act of 2005. The Act provides for a high standard of patentability, allows for compulsory licensing provisions and pre- and post-grant objection to patents. The progressive Act has been invoked in several judgments recently in relation to pharmaceutical patents — for example, the Supreme Court upheld the sale of a generic version of the cancer drug Nexavar in December 2014, and upheld the Indian patent office’s rejection of >Novartis’s application for a patent for its anti-cancer drug, Glivec. It must be mentioned that patent laws in India are compliant with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The restrictive patenting laws have protected a thriving generic pharmaceutical industry producing low-cost drugs in India. The industry has gradually become export-driven, resulting in these companies becoming keen to tie up with major pharmaceutical companies abroad by seeking voluntary licensing arrangements. Other countries have also looked at India’s Patents Act as a model, with affordability of pharma products and drugs being a key concern.
It is in this context that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement in New Delhi on April 24, asking for aligning India’s patent law with “global standards”, is a cause for concern. The refrain of the Central government over the past year on this issue is that a strong IP regime is necessary for economic growth and investment. This is clearly a misplaced concern, as such an emphasis is being pushed by big pharmaceutical companies that are uncomfortable with the “health safeguards” in the Patents Act and that have lobbied with the USTR to keep India under “priority watch”. Last year the government had agreed to the creation of a high-level bilateral intellectual property working group with the U.S. While these arrangements with the U.S. may be useful to mitigate any prospective attempts by the USTR to impose trade sanctions, the government must retain its own position on IP and the patents regime in India, and should not allow any dilution of its patent laws that safeguard the public interest.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/patent-pressures/article7177626.ece
8,5,2015,NGOs in the firing line,"The Narendra Modi Government clearly shares the problematic relationship that its predecessor government of the UPA, especially towards the end of its tenure, had with non-governmental organisations and people’s movements in general. What began primarily as a crackdown on organisations protesting against the nuclear power projects in Kudankulam and Jaitapur, has since then acquired a sharper edge. If >UPA II barred a dozen NGOs from receiving foreign donations and contributions, the BJP government has not only frozen their accounts but also blamed them for economic ills. An Intelligence Bureau report apparently blamed them for the slump in India’s GDP. In other words, NGOs are the major stumbling blocks to the government’s avowed pursuit of development. A claim that some NGOs — make that Christian NGOs — are engaging in proselytisation has also been floated. The present government and its leading spokespersons never tire of reiterating their strange position on conversions, also projecting the possibility of bringing forward a law to curb them. >The crackdown on NGOs in terms of putting a freeze on foreign donations they receive, on the ground of Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) violations, is but a manifestation of the dim view the government has of NGOs. U.S. Ambassador to India Richard Verma spoke at an event organised by a Delhi-based think tank of the chilling effect the government’s actions on this front may have on civil society. Must all those who may have a dissenting view be identified as enemies of the state? By freezing their accounts, the government has almost forced the closure of the operations in India of Greenpeace, which was spearheading the movement against a power plant in Madhya Pradesh. Bank accounts of the Ford Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and others are also seemingly under scrutiny.
In a country, which as Ambassador Verma estimates has some two million registered NGOs, the bad pennies among them of course have to be tackled firmly. They should be held accountable for their actions under Indian law if any law is violated. Yet, as a nation India must also acknowledge the innumerable positive interventions made by NGOs, and their imprint on landmark Acts passed in Parliament. Whether it is about the Right to Food, Right to Education or the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, and the most fundamental of them all, the Right to Information — which seeks to make the government accountable to the public on its decisions — several key pieces of legislation owe in no small measure to NGO interventions. The sledgehammer treatment now being meted out to NGOs does not behove this government. The clampdown is nothing short of an extreme step. It will have the same kind of chilling effect that a clampdown on free speech will have.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ngos-in-the-firing-line/article7181460.ece
8,5,2015,Mikes in the time of disaster,"“If it bleeds, it leads,” has been an adage in the newsroom. Unfortunately, the fact that it has to come with filters of propriety, decency and ethics attached is being overlooked almost regularly by Indian broadcast journalism. >The latest example is Nepal, where the earthquake and its tragic aftermath have been exploited to the hilt by television cameras in an appalling race for TRPs. The role of the media during disasters is an important one. Before a catastrophe, they can warn a population and prepare it. Afterwards, with continued reportage, they can ensure that no survivor is forgotten or left out of the aid network. But it is during the disaster that their role is quite vital. They can be effective conduits of information about help lines, aid-distribution camps, emergency phone numbers, or the kind of supplies required. They can help scotch rumours and prevent panic by quickly disseminating the right facts and figures. Their coverage helps mobilise help from outside the disaster area, in the form of money, supplies and volunteers. And finally, the focus of the media on a disaster helps increase its visibility, thus forcing governments to upgrade it on their agenda. While India’s television crews did most of this, they were overstepping the boundaries so often and so dramatically that the Nepalese people finally turned against them and virtually asked them to leave.
This was unfortunate, given that Indian rescue teams were indeed the first to reach Nepal and have played a stellar role there, as did the media in sending out some of the first images of the calamity. But it is imperative that television revisits the basic rules of journalistic ethics during disaster reporting. Regardless of how important they imagine it is to wring an emotional response from audiences, they must refrain from sticking microphones in the faces of survivors who may have just lost everything. ‘People’s right to know’ just does not apply here. Nobody has a right to know how much anyone else is grieving. Instead, it is the survivor who has an absolute right to privacy. The only right way to get a human angle to the reporting is to ask for consent, make a full disclosure of how and where it will be aired, keep the questions brief, and not push for emotional outbursts. Also, when rescue choppers landed, survivors were dismayed to find TV crews taking up space they believed should have been left for relief material. In a disaster, relief must take primacy over media privilege. Indeed, it must be seen to take precedence. A disaster of this magnitude leaves in its wake traumatised families that have lost everything in one fell swoop. Ethical journalism must place humanity above professional urgency.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mikes-in-the-time-of-disaster/article7181461.ece
9,5,2015,The new juvenile law,"There was never any doubt that the progressive juvenile law enacted in 2000 was not being implemented properly and that there was a need to revisit its provisions. In many ways, the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Bill, 2015, passed by the Lok Sabha, is a forward-looking and comprehensive enactment that provides for dealing with children in conflict with the law and those requiring care and protection. However, its laudable features have been overshadowed by one provision that states that children in the 16-18 age group will henceforth be tried as adults if they are accused of committing ‘heinous offences’. The government believes that the provision will help address public disquiet over the perception that young offenders are getting away with light punishment after committing crimes such as murder and rape. However, child welfare activists have been saying there is no need to carve out an exception for children in a particular age group solely based on the perceived heinousness of the offence. The division into two groups — one below 16 and another above 16 — goes against the core principle that all children should be treated as such till the age of 18. This age has been fixed based on studies in child behaviour and the U.N. Convention of the Rights of the Child. A parliamentary Standing Committee opposed the change, noting that subjecting juveniles to the adult judicial system would go against the objective of protecting all children from the rigours of adult justice. It noted that the Supreme Court had not agreed with the view that children involved in certain offences should be tried as adults.
In response to >criticism, the government has made some changes before getting the Act passed in the Lok Sabha. It has dropped a patently unconstitutional section (Clause 7 in the Bill) that sought to treat as adults, children allegedly committing an offence after the age of 16 but getting arrested only after they are 21. Also, the government has tweaked the wording involved, saying that what the Juvenile Justice Board will hold is a “preliminary assessment” rather than a “preliminary enquiry” into the mental and physical capacity of the child to commit such an offence. It has added by way of explanation that it is not a ‘trial’, obviously to address concerns that the procedure to assess the child’s capacity itself may amount to a regular trial. The prospects of the government making further changes before the Bill goes to the Rajya Sabha appear to be bleak. The question before the legislature, and society at large, is this: do we preserve the scope for rehabilitation among young offenders through a benign juvenile law, or derive satisfaction from long prison terms for them?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-new-juvenile-law/article7185609.ece
9,5,2015,The return of the Tories,"In a surprise election outcome, the Conservative Party led by >David Cameron has been elected to govern the United Kingdom for the next five years, and this time on its own majority. The results of the fiercely fought May 7 elections belied pre-poll predictions of a tie between the Labour and Conservative parties and a hung Parliament in which the support of smaller parties would be key to crafting a coalition arrangement. The final outcome — predicted accurately only by the single exit poll published at 10 p.m. after polling ended — has the Conservatives comfortably past the midway 326-mark in the 650-seat House of Commons. The Labour Party, whose leader Ed Miliband ran a bold and earnest campaign that focussed on a new and fairer deal for the working people, has come a far second. The party’s traditional stronghold of Scotland has been lost to the Scottish National Party (SNP), which has swept up all but three of the 59 Scottish parliamentary seats. The Labour Party has also lost out to the Conservatives in England and Wales. The Liberal Democratic Party — perceived as untrustworthy for having reneged on its electoral promises while in coalition — was decimated, its numbers down from 57 in the last Parliament to just eight, and with several of its prominent leaders, including Vincent Cable, the Secretary of State for Business who had a prominent role in promoting trade with India, defeated. The right-wing anti-immigration, Eurosceptic United Kingdom Independence Party has got only one seat; its leader, Nigel Farage, failed to win one.
The Conservative Party takes credit for steering the country into economic recovery and creating two million new jobs. Its five-year mandate comes at a time when a million Britons depend on food banks for their survival, and where the numbers of people in poverty, according to a report from the New Policy Institute, have increased in the last two years by 800,000, from 13.2 million to 14 million. The numbers in “deep poverty” have increased from 8.9 million to 9.6 million, the same report states. The Conservative manifesto commits the party to welfare budget cuts of £12 billion to reduce the deficit. This comes over and above austerity measures that have already been undertaken. With Britain’s National Health Service in a financial and staffing crisis, higher education costs skyrocketing, a serious housing shortage on the cards, and utility costs soaring , the new government would appear to have its tasks cut out. Addressing these issues through the austerity route will rapidly abort Mr. Cameron’s promise of building “an even greater Britain”. Moreover, the uncertainty created by the in-out EU referendum pledged before 2017 by the Conservatives is likely to present a challenge for its international relations, even beyond EU.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/uk-elections-the-return-of-the-tories/article7185608.ece
11,5,2015,Discrimination most foul,"Close to seven decades after Independence, in many villages of India the nature of certain social equations has not changed from what they have been for centuries. Such villages continue to remain what Dr. B.R. Ambedkar called “sinks of localism, dens of ignorance and narrow-mindedness”. How else could one see certain recent incidents reported from Tumakuru in Karnataka about vi >llage barber shops denying haircuts for Dalits, temple festivities >remaining out-of-bounds for Dalit families, and other forms of prevalent discrimination? By all accounts these are not isolated incidents. Discrimination against Dalits is widespread and ingrained in the psyche across India, in rural settings in particular. In some places it takes the form of violent oppression, in others it is disguised yet omnipresent. To be fair, when the incidents in Tumakuru came to notice, the administration took corrective steps immediately. This suggests responsiveness on the part of the state to issues of social justice at least in some cases. But recurring acts and persisting practices against the Dalit community beg the question whether state response and constitutionalism alone are enough to overcome longstanding social injustice and prejudices in India’s villages.
In other words, has political justice — achieved in some respects over time by means of affirmative action — managed to overcome social injustice at all? The alacrity shown by state authorities in the Tumakaru cases reflects to some extent the political power gained by Dalits in India and the efficacy of the rule of law. After all, the Constitution guarantees the right to equality of all citizens and affirmative action for Dalits. Years of following the policy of affirmative action has yielded a high degree of participation and representation of Dalits in politics and in governance. But without progressive social consciousness permeating society at large, constitutionalism, state actions and political equations simply do not suffice. It would help if the political actors who have accommodated Dalits among their party and governance structures, due to the their sheer weight of numbers as a representative section, also believed in and worked as conduits for social transformation. Perhaps if Dalits were not merely accommodated but were accorded leadership roles in parties, that could aid this process of social activism. A >recent study pointed out that barring exceptions such as the Bahujan Samaj Party, the leadership of major political parties suffered from a clear diversity deficit, with Dalits being severely under-represented in the leadership across parties. Being made part of the political leadership — one way of being among the elite in the country — will not by itself guarantee the eradication of social prejudice, but it will be a step in the right direction.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-discrimination-against-dalits/article7190812.ece

In a six-paragraph statement, which dwelt at length with Pakistan’s internal security challenges, the corps commanders, often described as the real cabinet of Pakistan, took “serious note” of RAW involvement in spreading terror. The statement came just days after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had telephoned his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi and conveyed his condolences over the recent loss of lives in the Nepal-centred earthquake. Earlier, in an interview to Saudi Gazette Mr. Sharif had expressed disappointment at the lack of progress in resuming talks with India despite his “exceptional decision” last May to visit India for Mr. Modi’s swearing-in ceremony. It is evident from the corps commanders’ statement that the Pakistan Army doesn’t share Mr. Sharif’s stated interest in improving relations with India. So what exactly is Army Chief Raheel Sharif’s game here? One, he is signalling to his civilian Prime Minister that India policy is in his domain. Two, as he takes on some of the terrorists seriously in Pakistan, he wants to keep the India bogey alive. Friendship with India remains anathema to the Army despite American efforts over the years to convince Rawalpindi that it might not be such a bad thing. Central to the Army’s ideology as the defender of the nation is its anti-India position: any dilution in such an approach will be considered a sign of weakness, or so General Sharif and his commanders seem to believe. The General has also strengthened his foreign policy role in Pakistan by opening up to the Afghans and Americans, something his predecessor Ashfaq Kayani failed to do. Clearly, he is a sought-after man. And during his tenure, ties with Kabul and Washington have improved a lot.
The charge that RAW is involved in fomenting trouble in Balochistan or Karachi is not a new one. Other than one line in the statement, the Pakistan Army has come up with precious little evidence to prove it. As Mumbai was attacked in 2008, the bravery of martyred policeman Tukaram Omble ensured the capture of one of the attackers, Pakistan national Ajmal Kasab — the most potent piece of evidence ever collected by India pointing to a Pakistani link to terrorism on Indian soil. Statements, in themselves, don’t mean much; only hard evidence counts. While India takes note of the Pakistani charge, the relationship as it stands is unlikely to change. Not much has happened in one year in the > bilateral relationship, and there are no signs otherwise.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-pakistan-blaming-raw-for-fomenting-terrorism/article7190813.ece
12,5,2015,A sensational comeback,"The >Karnataka High Court’s judgment absolving Ms. Jayalalithaa of the grave charge that she amassed wealth illegally during her first tenure as Tamil Nadu Chief Minister between 1991 and 1996 is undoubtedly a resounding political victory for her. It removes the taint of corruption that has marred her political reputation repeatedly over the years and at the same time, removes her legal disability to hold public office. It is an unusual feat for any politician in the country to regain her eligibility to hold the post after being unseated twice as Chief Minister. On both occasions, this was possible because a High Court intervened to reverse the conviction recorded by trial courts. In a legal sense, it is an extraordinary triumph, as the case that she possessed unexplained assets worth Rs.66 crore was believed to be the strongest one that she ever faced. It was tenaciously investigated and vigorously prosecuted. The charge sheet was backed by reams of evidence, consisting of a long list of real estate known to be linked to Ms. Jayalalithaa and her associates, the flaunting of wealth during the egregiously opulent wedding of her ‘foster son’, a host of companies with no ostensible business, items of jewellery, clothing, expensive footwear and wristwatches supposedly in her possession and a maze of financial transactions through apparently inter-connected bank accounts. There were attempts to subvert the trial in Tamil Nadu under the AIADMK regime and the Supreme Court was forced to transfer it to Karnataka. After other twists and turns, the voluminous judgment of the Special Court in Bengaluru, >sentencing her and her three associates to a four-year prison term and hefty fines, appeared to have succeeded in bringing to book a political leader who had faced several charges in the last two decades but had overcome most of them.
The Karnataka High Court’s equally voluminous verdict, however, has overturned all the substantive findings of the trial court. In particular, Justice C.R. Kumaraswamy has drastically revised the quantum of ‘disproportionate’ assets from the trial judge’s estimation of Rs.53.60 crore to a mere Rs.2.82 crore. This amount exceeded their known income of Rs.34.76 crore by just 8.12 per cent. And, applying a Supreme Court ruling that permitted a 10 per cent difference between one’s known income and estimated expenditure, the High Court acquitted her of the charge. Several questions arise from the outcome of the appeal, the most serious one of all being the fate of the trial court’s findings that many documents and testimony that the defence relied on were not genuine. A layman is likely to be confused by the acquittal order after it appeared convincingly established that there was no genuine explanation for the maze of bank transactions involving the four accused and their companies. It would take a particularly credulous society to believe that the acquisition spree involving these firms and the ease with which they took loans and foreclosed them, obtained gifts and bought up property and shares were all above board. In view of the huge divergence that is apparent in the findings of the trial court and the High Court, it is vital that this matter be taken to the Supreme Court for an authoritative pronouncement on the issues involved. The highest court’s last word on this issue would be a crucial acknowledgment of the intensity of public concern over probity of politicians in high office.
… and the way forward

Now that the conviction is set aside, Ms. Jayalalithaa can return as Chief Minister with complete political and moral authority. Since she stepped down as Chief Minister following the conviction in September last, the Tamil Nadu government has been in a state of total stagnation. Shockingly, the conviction of Ms. Jayalalithaa and the appeal which should have been seen as addressing a question of accountability was turned into a crisis of governance. Under O. Panneerselvam, who was more intent on expressing his loyalty to Ms. Jayalalithaa than on demonstrating his administrative efficiency, the government was directionless when it was not stagnant. Clearances were delayed and projects came to a standstill. Chennai Metro Rail became a metaphor for the inert government, apparently kept waiting for Ms. Jayalalithaa to return as Chief Minister before beginning service. At every level of the government, the effort seemed to be to portray Ms. Jayalalithaa as the super-efficient leader without whom things could not move in Tamil Nadu. What the State witnessed in the last eight months was a deliberately inflicted policy paralysis intended to serve as a daily reminder to the people of the State of the high costs of keeping Ms. Jayalalithaa out of the government. No one expected Mr. Panneerselvam to run the government without any guidance from Ms. Jayalalithaa. After all, the mandate in 2011 was for Ms. Jayalalithaa, and Mr. Panneerselvam was hand-picked by her as a stopgap successor. However, what is regrettable is that the State has lost critical time in meeting development targets and reaching out for investments in key economic sectors. As it turns out, Mr. Panneerselvam appears to have played just a waiting game, losing valuable governing time in his eight months in office.
In her new innings, the AIADMK chief will be expected to fast-track the welfare measures she had begun in 2011, and speed up several long-delayed infrastructure and development projects. While there can be no way to make up for the time already lost, her government still has another year before the next election to implement her election promises and put Tamil Nadu on an upward curve on the growth and development charts. Having said this, we hope that Ms. Jayalalithaa will indeed strive in all earnest to take Tamil Nadu forward to a new stage of development and prosperity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-jayalalithaas-acquittal-a-sensational-comeback/article7194487.ece
13,5,2015,Exclusionary intent,"Taking a cue from a pending case in the Supreme Court the BJP government is >all set to formalise a policy for granting citizenship to Hindu immigrants from Bangladesh while it will continue its battle to rid India of ‘infiltrators’ from that country. This reduction of a complex history of migration across India’s eastern border into this loaded formulation was articulated repeatedly by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha election. In a speech made in Assam in February 2014, for instance, he said: “We have a responsibility towards Hindus harassed in other countries. Where will they go? We will have to accommodate them here.” In another speech made later the same month in West Bengal the target was a different type of immigrant. “Those who are taking away jobs here have to leave. The priority is jobs for the youth of this country. That is our first responsibility,” he said. More recently, BJP president Amit Shah has >made the granting of citizenship to Hindu immigrants, and the expulsion of illegals, a key poll promise as the BJP gears up for the Assam Assembly elections. These statements are underscored by a broader ideological position, as mentioned in the BJP election manifesto, that India should be the natural home for persecuted Hindus who could seek refuge here. This has overtones of exclusionary doctrines like the Law of Return in Israel that gives Jews the right to live and seek citizenship there.
During the NDA’s last stint in power an amendment to the Citizenship Act >was effected in 2003 that made it easier for Hindus who had come from Pakistan and were residing in Gujarat and Rajasthan to be given citizenship. Attempting something similar for eastern India, however, will prove more problematic. Since the Supreme Court case covers the period from 1971 the government will have to specify a time period during which it feels that Hindus and other minorities faced persecution in Bangladesh. Depending on which period is chosen this could complicate ties with Bangladesh as that would amount to casting aspersions on its ability to protect minorities. Given that this is a good moment in the confidence-building process between the two countries, with India just having >passed the Land Boundary Agreement, such a partisan move could rock the boat again. Rather than make these calculations it would have been infinitely better if India had a national policy on refugees or was a signatory to the 1951 refugee convention under which signatories are obliged not to send refugees back to where they have a well-founded fear of persecution. In the absence of a coherent policy such issues will continue to be decided in an ad hoc manner, driven by ideological-political considerations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-policy-for-granting-citizenship-to-hindu-immigrants-from-bangladesh/article7198470.ece
13,5,2015,Fraudulent duplication,"Acts of fraud in the running of higher education institutions is almost a given; what’s unusual is data being present to prove them. Now, an analysis of names of faculty members submitted for approval to the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) by engineering colleges >has shown that around 50,000 ‘duplicate’ teacher names exist on the rolls of more than one college; in an indication of how rampant the practice is, the proportion of engineering colleges in a State that had such ‘duplicate’ teachers ranged from 90 per cent to a hundred per cent. As with much else, India’s official norms for engineering colleges are laudable: undergraduate colleges must have a faculty ratio of 1: 15, and a cadre ratio of 1:2:6 for professors, associate professors and assistant professors respectively. On the ground, as is widely known, the norms are observed only in the breach. So widespread is the ‘sharing’ of teachers to meet the norms that the practice is said to have become organised, with details of agents and teachers known to be ‘for hire’ available in a given city or district. Earlier this year, the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University in Hyderabad disaffiliated nearly 150 engineering colleges for insufficient staffing. The Punjab Medical Council found 400 ‘ghost’ teachers enrolled in four private medical colleges. College managements for their part complain that even when they try to follow norms, corruption in the approvals process is rampant.
By 2020, India will be the ‘youngest’ country, its freshly graduating youth propelling the biggest labour force in the world. The bulk among the most educated of this workforce of the future will not come from the IITs and the IIMs, but from the thousands of technical institutes that have sprung up. Just 15 per cent of young people enrol for higher education, a figure the government has been trying to push up. Lakhs of students are entering technical education courses, some aspiring to be the first engineers and doctors in their families, at considerable financial cost. But by not ensuring that adequate numbers of teachers are available, let alone monitoring the quality of teaching, India is not doing right by its youth. Only a fifth of all Indian graduates are employable, a range of surveys by corporate hirers over the last three years has shown, and the poor quality of teaching is one of the causes. The facts are hiding in plain sight; a special investigation by The Hindu into this state of affairs was based on data from the AICTE’s own website, analysed by the open data website ‘Factly’. The apex body governing technical education never thought to do a simple search of its own database, it would appear. It remains to be seen whether governments at the Centre and in the States will act on this.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-faculty-data-fraud-fraudulent-duplication/article7198471.ece
14,5,2015,Preparedness as the key,"The recurrence of a >major earthquake on May 12 — this time measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale — with its epicentre near Kodari in Nepal, barely a fortnight after the >devastating temblor in the landlocked country, has once again raised questions about preparedness for such disasters in the subcontinent. India is divided into five seismic zones, with Zone 5 being the most active and earthquake-prone. The Himalayan regions, the Assam and Burma region, and the Bhuj region in the west fall in this category. While the time of occurrence of a big earthquake cannot be predicted accurately with existing technology, the foreknowledge of potential danger areas can help mitigate the impact of a disaster. The reason for earthquakes occurring in Nepal is known: the movement of the Indian tectonic plate against the Eurasian plate. Along the Himalayas lie two fault-lines: the Main Boundary Thrust and the Main Central Thrust. Running parallel to the Himalayan ranges to a width of 100 km to 120 km, this region has a history of earthquakes. In the last 120 years, there have been four major events: 1897 (Shillong), 1905 (Himachal Pradesh, Kangra), 1934 (Nepal-Bihar border), 1950 (Arunachal Pradesh, then a part of the North East Frontier Agency or NEFA).
The movement of the Indian tectonic plate against the Eurasian plate has created accumulated stress. This stress is released in a manner that makes predicting earthquakes impossible. When a major event happens, part of the stress is released at that point but accumulates in a different part of the belt. Thus there is no natural escape for the region from susceptibility to earthquakes. The best-laid plans for disaster mitigation following quakes can go awry, but some lessons can be learnt from the past. However, as the gap between the occurrence of major earthquakes in a given region could stretch over more than a lifespan, memories can fade and mitigation plans may not be grounded in lived experience. The real advancement that has been made recently in India is, for instance, the >setting up of many seismological stations, especially after the Bhuj earthquake of 2001. Measurements from these stations and global positioning system data now tell us the Indian plate is moving north at a speed of 5 centimetres a year. This would contribute to stress accumulation and to seismic activity even in Zones 2, 3 and 4. We need to accept earthquakes as a reality and do everything in our power to redefine development plans, especially in terms of building quake-resistant buildings. There should be systematic resort to “disaster drills” to educate the public on what to do during an earthquake. Preparedness is the key to managing any more such disasters.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-disaster-preparedness/article7202354.ece
14,5,2015,Partners in conservation,"That wildlife conservation efforts cannot succeed in the long term without the proactive involvement of local communities living in and around forest areas has been a well-established fact. The latest lion census >conducted in Gujarat reaffirms this. The exercise has shown a 27 per cent rise in the feline’s numbers, which now stand at 523, compared to 411 in 2010. Forest officials acknowledge that this conservation success story would not have come about without support from the Maldharis, a nomadic tribe of cattle-rearers, and also farmers living in the vicinity of the Gir National Park. Lion territory in Gujarat spans some 22,000 sq km across four districts — Junagadh, Bhavnagar, Amreli and Gir-Somnath. This covers 2,600 villages with an approximate population of 7,00,000. Lions now frequent more villages than in the past, with about 167 of them found roaming outside the protected forest area, creating hardly any conflict situations. The lions have actually helped control the population not only of nilgai, its principal source of food, but also of wild boars, which frequently destroy standing crops. Thus, they have benefited the local communities. These communities have reciprocated by protecting the animals from poachers, resisting retaliation when lions prey on cattle, and even building parapet walls around farm-wells to minimise the accidental death of lions that may fall into them.
Although humans and animals have coexisted for ages, the story has not always had a happy ending. Challenges posed by human casualties, and damage to crops, buildings and so on from wildlife intrusions have led one group of conservationists to argue that villagers residing in forest areas ought to be sent out. But another group insists that such a move will result in the loss of goodwill of local communities, impeding conservation efforts. The question is how goodwill could be generated when fear of the animal itself looms large. In Gir, it has become possible to inculcate a sense of pride and ownership among local communities regarding the animal. They share a virtual spiritual bond with the lion. Down south in Valparai, Tamil Nadu, meanwhile, there has been a >gradual decline in human fatalities caused by wild elephants after early-warning systems that use text messages and flash light alerts were deployed with help from forest-dwellers within a 2-km radius of herd locations. The Nature Conservation Foundation that has been working on this has found that often it is lack of awareness about the animal’s presence that results in casualties. When the 2006 Forest Rights Act upheld the forest-dwellers’ traditional right to land, conservationists resisted it over concerns of habitat fragmentation. But as testimonies from Gir and elsewhere demonstrate, making local communities active partners can create a win-win situation on the conservation front.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-involving-of-local-communities-in-wildlife-conservation/article7202355.ece
15,5,2015,Not business as usual,"The government >got a great deal of legislative work done during the just-concluded Budget session, which might suggest that despite its lack of numbers in the Rajya Sabha it remained dominant in Parliament. The ruling dispensation succeeded in getting all of 23 Bills — including those related to the Union Budget and the Railway Budget — through, while Ministers made 50 statements. It ensured that time lost through disruptions caused by the Opposition was more than compensated for by the extra hours both Houses sat. The government actually gained from the repeated interruptions of question hour in the Rajya Sabha and its cancellation on some days in the Lok Sabha, for Ministers could avoid being called to account in the House on pressing issues. The Opposition was permitted just one discussion under Rule 193 and two calling attention motions in the Lok Sabha, and one discussion under Rule 176 and four calling attention motions in the Rajya Sabha. The pieces of legislation approved by Parliament included not just the one relating to the historic >India-Bangladesh Land Boundary Agreement, but also key reform measures: the >Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2015; the >Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2015; the >Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Bill, 2015 and the >Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2014. And then there was the Bill that fulfilled an election promise while sending out the message that the government wants to tackle corruption — the >Black Money Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (Imposition of Tax) Bill, 2015
But these impressive figures notwithstanding, the message that emerged from the Budget session was of a government on the back foot. The return of an apparently >rejuvenated Rahul Gandhi saw the Congress in a belligerent mood in Parliament. Indeed, the party’s heir-apparent appeared to even unnerve those on the ruling party benches. The Opposition also succeeded in >sending three Bills critical to the government’s reform agenda, to parliamentary panels: the Land Acquisition Bill has gone to a joint committee of the Houses, while Bills relating to Goods and Services Tax and the regulation of the real estate sector have been sent to select committees of the Rajya Sabha. In the case of the Land Bill, the Opposition’s campaign outside Parliament combined with the government’s inability to address agricultural distress, has taken some of the sheen off it. The government’s breaking with tradition in not sending several new Bills to parliamentary panels, packaging some items of legislation as money bills to circumvent the lack of numbers, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi skipping the vote on the GST Bill in the Lok Sabha, have not gone unnoticed. In politics, perception is often more important than mere statistics — it is time the government and its parliamentary managers realised this.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-budget-session-of-parliament/article7206651.ece
15,5,2015,Strategy shift,"The >string of audacious attacks on security forces, civilians and politicians carried out by Maoist rebels in recent times, the calling of a two-day ‘Bastar Mahabandh’, and the >abduction of villagers who were on their way to attend Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s public meeting in Dantewada, point to the current strategy and intent, as well as determination, of the CPI (Maoist) organisation. Despite suffering severe reverses in several States and failing in its efforts to spread the “revolutionary” movement to new territories, the rebels want to send the message across that they are still a force to reckon with. What is happening in the Bastar forests in Chhattisgarh remains the best example of the failure of counterinsurgency strategies adopted by successive governments. If the UPA government’s strategy was to rely heavily on the security forces, under its now infamous “clear, hold and build” model, the BJP government appears to be pursuing a pronounced strategy of development. The >first-ever visit by a Prime Minister to a Maoist stronghold, to inaugurate the mega steel plant at Dilmili village in Dantewada and the extended rail line between Rowghat and Jagdalpur, represents this shift from the deployment of ‘battalions’ to ‘development’.
Developmental activities invariably take time to have a visible and positive impact on socio-economic conditions. Counterinsurgency strategists and the political leadership must be equally sensitive to the political component of the Maoist movement, which has at its core many issues relating to the people. The Raman Singh-led government in Chhattisgarh is a stable one no doubt, but its ability to ensure ‘effective’ governance needs to be ensured: this is the critical component of any counterinsurgency strategy. The Centre should first formulate a counterinsurgency doctrine encompassing also the development and security-related components. Such a doctrine would provide a certain unity of approach among States and security agencies, irrespective of which political party is in power. Out of such a doctrine, area-specific strategies and tactics could be developed and implemented across States. Security agencies must stop using assassination as a tool in counterrevolutionary warfare. The fact that top Maoist leaders >Roopesh (with his wife) in Coimbatore, and >Ajith in Pune, were arrested, and not killed in the process, is notable. Prime Minister Modi’s advice to a child in Dantewada to learn from failures is even more apt for the political establishment and the security forces. If only they did so, the problem of Maoist extremism could have been tackled to a large extent by now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-dealing-maoist-extremism/article7206653.ece
16,5,2015,Right to have a childhood,"The Union Cabinet’s >approval of a set of amendments to the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 raises serious doubts and concerns. One of these proposes to ban the employment of children below 14 years in all occupations except family enterprises and the audio-visual entertainment industry, on condition that such work does not interfere with their education. One amendment proposes to regulate “adolescents” in the 14-18 age group by prohibiting their employment in hazardous occupations unsuitable to their age. There is no doubt that the 1986 Act itself needs to be amended. First, the law has proved to be weak and ineffective in curbing child labour. Second, it is in contradiction with Article 21-A of the Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 that makes schooling compulsory for all in the age group of six to 14 years. Third, the 1986 Act does not regulate adolescent labour as mandated by ILO Conventions 138 and 182.
Although the government’s intention to amend the Act is to be appreciated, what is deeply problematic is its intention to exempt from the ban employment in family enterprises. It is suggested that poverty and socio-economic conditions in India justify children helping their families in certain occupations where the possibility of any harm coming upon them does not exist, provided that they balance the work with schooling. This may sound reasonable but may prove unworkable. The law potentially opens loopholes that will sustain or even encourage child labour, creating a regulatory nightmare. Here the government fails to recognise that family enterprises can also prove to be exploitative and oppressive for children. ‘Family enterprises’ fall in the unorganised sector, making them an amorphous legal category that is hard to govern. Such a law will adversely affect girl children who are often forced into domestic work, or Dalits and those from the minorities who work out of dire poverty but are ultimately denied the joys of childhood. Moreover, instead of just tinkering with the 1986 Act, the government needs to comprehensively overhaul it, focussing on the rehabilitation of children rescued from traumatic working conditions. This requires an interlinking of ‘rescue, rehabilitation and schooling’ through greater coordination among Ministries and organisations, and the inter-locking of the provisions of existing laws such as the RTE Act, the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976; the Factories Act, 1948; the Beedi and Cigar Workers Act, 1996 and so on. It is meanwhile also disheartening that the budget allocation for the Ministry of Women and Child Development has been reduced from Rs.18,588 crore to Rs.10,382 crore.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-approval-of-amendments-to-child-labour-prohibition-and-regulation-act-1986/article7211095.ece
16,5,2015,The dead warriors,"On the face of it, the series of attacks on bloggers in Bangladesh — the latest victim is Ananta Bijoy Das, >mowed down by machete-wielding killers in Sylhet — suggests the hand of intolerant Islamic fundamentalists affiliated to various militant groups. These groups have targeted bloggers for their “atheistic” and “secular” views over the last few years. The victims include >Avijit Roy, the pioneering hand behind the popular Bangladeshi free thinkers’ blogging platform, Mukto-Mona. Roy and others used the Internet to voice their strong concerns and provocative views against conservatism and fundamentalism in Bangladesh, making them ready targets of the violent Islamist groups. When you dig deeper, though, these attacks are unmistakably another sad testament to the long-raging battle for the country’s soul. The bloggers are among those who would want to hold on to the ideal of a secular state that was conceived after the historic war of liberation against the then West Pakistan in 1971. On the other side are fundamentalist malcontents who have never accepted that ideal, and drawn their inspiration from the collaborators of that period of war.
Ever since the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League government in 2010 started the long-pending process of indictment of Jamaat-e-Islami leaders for the brutal war crimes during the liberation war, the contradictions have become sharper. When one of the leaders, Abdul Quader Mollah, was convicted, spontaneous agitations erupted in Dhaka culminating in the Shahbag protests in 2013 demanding capital punishment for those convicted for the war crimes of 1971. While it must be unequivocally said that these demands are not entirely just, for capital punishment is barbaric in itself, the demand is rooted in the country’s violent history. The sharp political polarisation in Bangladesh, despite a majority of the people favouring punishment for war criminals, has led to the rejuvenation of Islamic forces that were supported at some points by the leading Opposition, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Secular and progressive bloggers such as Roy and others had taken the side of those opposed to the Jamaat-e-Islami and other radical Islamist forces ranged on the other side. The government has since accepted some of the demands of the protesters on this issue. But the Sheikh Hasina regime is bogged down by the polarised political equations in Dhaka and has not aggressively taken on those who have targeted the bloggers, making them soft targets for the radical Islamists. How many more bloggers would have to give up their lives before the government realises that their battle is essentially the same as that for justice for the war crimes of 1971?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-bangladesh-bloggers-killing/article7211096.ece
18,5,2015,Caution and optimism,"In the last two decades, the diplomatic emphasis in India-China relations has been on working on a strong economic relationship that would whittle down the strategic differences and feeling of adversarial relations that have piled up over time. The >three-day visit to China by Prime Minister Narendra Modi stayed true to that script, but clearly built on the bonhomie generated during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s >India visit in September 2014. If the emphasis during that visit was on building a “closer developmental partnership”, the reciprocal visit by Mr. Modi has been all about enhancing that relationship, mostly relating to trade and economics. This is evident in the joint statement issued after bilateral talks between Mr. Modi and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. The statement also seeks to address some of the concerns over the nature of the economic relationship. The magnitude of two-way trade has risen to $71 billion, but there has been a corresponding rise in the trade deficit. The statement suggests that both countries are cognisant of this deficit and are taking steps to address this, over and above those decided during Mr. Xi’s visit. The signing of 26 agreements detailing commercial investments worth $22 billion between companies also signifies the growing economic ties. The joint statement on climate change that reiterated the principles of “equity and common but differentiated responsibilities” to address issues of climate change and reiterated support for the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol, was also timely. This would clear some doubts about China’s position following its joint communiqué with the U.S. on cuts in emission levels.
That said, the strategic distance remains: the joint statement and also Mr. Modi’s remarks during the visit recognise this fact. The boundary dispute finds mention in the joint statement; while progress in talks has been glacial ever since they began, there is the assurance that both sides will seek to maintain peace at the border as they work towards a solution. Mr. Modi’s delegation gave no indication that India is keen to participate in China’s ambitious “one belt, one road” initiative; the joint statement limited the reference to cooperation on the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar economic corridor. This suggests a degree of caution on India’s part over China’s role in India’s near and extended neighbourhood. Yet, Mr. Modi struck all the right notes in his speech engagement at Tsinghua University, suggesting the need to overcome strategic differences even while acknowledging the complexities as India seeks to build concomitant ties with other world powers. It is to be hoped that this emphasis, and ongoing engagement between the two leaderships at the highest levels would build further momentum to truly realise a strong India-China partnership for the 21st century.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/caution-and-optimism/article7216727.ece
18,5,2015,Up in the air,"The Prasar Bharati Corporation, set up in 1997 by an Act of Parliament with a mandate for public broadcasting services through Doordarshan and All India Radio, to inform, educate and entertain, is today neither fish nor fowl. It is a public service broadcaster only in name; in practice it continues to be the government’s handmaiden. For most of its existence it has faced questions over its relevance in the digital age. There are in the country today over 830 channels accessed by 150 million households that have TV sets. This is a far cry from the time Doordarshan was king and sole purveyor. The virtual government control on the media once ensured that AIR and DD were able to attract the best programmes and producers. The mid-1990s changed all that, and the entertainment channels were followed by private news channels. The Corporation dreamed of being a BBC-lookalike. But that was a tall order. Globally there are over 30 public service broadcasters and the most popular of them is the BBC, to which generations of Indians have been exposed, beginning with radio and later TV. Its level of autonomy and independence has inspired many broadcasters to emulate the model, and Prasar Bharati was no exception. But here is the catch. The BBC, with its much-admired programming, is supported by revenue from licence fee that every TV-owner in the United Kingdom pays. And over 70 per cent of the income is spent on the BBC’s programming.
In sharp contrast, Prasar Bharati runs totally on government funding. Only 15 per cent of the budget is spent on content; the rest goes to pay salaries to its over 31,621 employees. The Sam Pitroda Committee, as other committees before it, wanted the Corporation to become financially independent and to be allowed to monetise its under-utilised assets such as real estate, archival material and the scores of transmitters that have in any case outlived their purpose. All this is easier said than done: the Corporation does not have the authority to give the nod even to open an ATM on its premises. The prospect of autonomy also is seriously in doubt when you look at what it now does with news. Successive governments have taken to managing news content with the next elections in mind or to project governmental achievements. In the latest instance, the BJP government has issued a diktat requiring the news channel to set aside prime time for Ministers to showcase their achievements. In a context where cable TV has penetrated over 92 per cent of the households, unless Prasar Bharati wakes up to the challenge of offering the right kind of programming and technology, the threat to its existence will continue to loom large.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/up-in-the-air/article7216728.ece
19,5,2015,A system under trial,"It is unfortunate that more than two years after the Union Home Ministry sent out an advisory to States and Union Territories in January 2013, and eight months since the Supreme Court >kicked off the process of releasing undertrials who have undergone half their likely jail terms in prison, many of them remain in detention. The figure given by the Union government to the court last month suggests that as many as 2,78,000 prisoners, or a little over two-thirds of the total number of incarcerated people in the country’s jails, are undertrials. And the main reason they are still in judicial custody appears to be poverty, as most of them are too poor to afford bail bonds or provide sureties. “This is certainly not the spirit of the law, and poverty cannot be a ground for incarcerating a person,” the Supreme Court observed recently while passing a set of directions. The court found that many of the cases involved were compoundable, and yet many people have been imprisoned without the benefit of compounding being extended to them. It has reiterated that an undertrial review committee, comprising the District Judge, District Magistrate and Superintendent of Police, should be set up in each district. The onus of constituting such a panel for every district has been put on the National Legal Services Authority, acting in coordination with the State Legal Services Authority.
The Code of Criminal Procedure was >amended in 2005, introducing Section 436A, to reduce overcrowding of prisons. Under this section, an undertrial prisoner shall be released on own personal bond if he or she has undergone detention for a period extending to one half of the maximum period of imprisonment specified for that offence. Last year the Supreme Court had asked sessions judges and judicial magistrates to start visiting prisons in their jurisdictional districts from October 1, 2014 to identify and release undertrial prisoners languishing for long periods. It is not clear why these measures have not yielded results. One reason could be that there is inadequate legal aid and advice available to poor prisoners. The legal services authorities in various States must play a principal role in inculcating awareness among prisoners about their rights, especially provisions that entitle them to freedom. It is also in the interest of the government that prisons are not overcrowded, considering the cost of prison space, resources and maintenance. The real solution, however, does not lie merely in the early release of prisoners on bail, but in expediting the trial process. The fact that cases are not decided for long spells that are close to the likely period of imprisonment is a poor commentary on a system beset by delay. The sooner this is addressed, the better it is for the administration of criminal justice.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-system-under-trial/article7220397.ece
19,5,2015,History will tell,"When Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, chairperson of the Indian Council of Historical Research, decided >last week to do away with the 22-member advisory board to the Indian Historical Review, the ICHR journal, the decision took not only the ousted members — who had not been informed of the move — but also the fraternity of historians by surprise. There are six members on the editorial board, and 12 members of the Council have been asked now to double up as advisory board members. The members of the advisory board, who were not members of the Council, worked purely in an advisory capacity. Their presence served as a guiding force for the journal’s editors: they made use of their stature and standing to attract names to the peer-reviewed journal that had been in the dumps for a decade. The journal turned the corner last year as Sage, the publishers, started paying a royalty from sales to the ICHR. The scrapping of the advisory board raises some fundamental questions on the direction that the respected journal will now take. The question that many historians are asking today then on the functioning structures of the ICHR is this: if it ain’t broke, why fix it?
Interestingly, when he was appointed to the post a year ago by the Bharatiya Janata Party government, Professor Sudershan Rao had said: “According to our traditional knowledge, none of us is all alone in this world and... ours is not a lone planet as is often commented in the Western intellectual circles. Our ancient Indian historical tradition says that we have a number of Lokas and Bhuvanas where infinite number of Jivas exist and are passing through various stages of evolution — physical, intellectual and spiritual. So, passing on this fund of historical knowledge to the coming generations becomes an onerous responsibility of the ICHR, in my view.” Professor Sudershan Rao as a historian — although there are many in the field who question his very credentials to be called one — must put this theory to test before he undertakes to pass it on to future generations. To be accepted as history, the epics, vedas and the puranas have to face the rigour of research and scientific examination: merely developing a fawning attachment or lavishing praise on them would not do. This rigour, as historians will tell you, is a matter of training, and of scholarly competence — not to be confused with a Right way or a Left way. It is with this perspective that the Indian Historical Review will be seen by scholars. Home Minister Rajnath Singh has meanwhile asked historians to read authors such as V.S. Naipaul to take corrective steps in the writing of history, thus seeing no difference between writers and historians. But historians should spot the difference.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/history-will-tell/article7220398.ece
20,5,2015,"Farewell, Aruna","Death finally came as a release to >Aruna Shanbaug. But for others like her in similar situations, the fight for a dignified death goes on. After the brutal rape and strangulation that left her comatose, for more than four long decades Aruna was fed, bathed and dressed like an infant by her nursing colleagues in the King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital in Mumbai, where she lay like a vegetable in an isolated room. Her state of suffering moved journalist and author Pinki Virani to move the Supreme Court in 2010 and, after a medical examination the court agreed she was in permanent vegetative state. Additionally, the next year the Supreme Court clarified that passive euthanasia was not illegal. Ironically, despite Aruna being the motivation behind the momentous ruling, Ms. Virani could not win the case and get passive euthanasia sanctioned for Aruna herself because the nurses who cared for her refused to let her go. Noble as they were in their unceasing attention to Aruna, their inability to allow her a dignified death was in many ways a greater misfortune. It was left to Ms. Virani to fight alone for the rights of “a body that is not alive but refuses to die”, as she described it in a documentary. The refusal to see that true compassion might lie in letting go of people who are terminally ill or brain-dead is fiercely fought by those who believe the right to live comes with the right to a dignified death.
Passive euthanasia is withdrawal of life support, food or medicines to terminally ill or brain-dead persons, but families feel enormous guilt because it is widely seen as a callous act. Thus, even if passive euthanasia could be the most compassionate step for the patient, it is usually withheld because families are wary of being perceived as being cruel. In Aruna’s case, the truth is that her own family members withdrew a long time ago. She was kept alive simply because the hospital she worked in and her colleagues took up her case. What would have happened if she had not been a nursing professional? The burden of her vegetative state would have been enormous on her family. The ‘living will’ is a document that allows an individual to make it clear that in the eventuality of terminal illness or coma, he or she has opted for passive euthanasia rather than to be kept alive by artificial means. However, the courts have yet to accept living wills as legal documents. Consequently, despite passive euthanasia being legal it is not widely practised since neither doctors nor families want to take the responsibility. Making living wills legal would be a huge step towards understanding how important it is to allow a dignified death.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/farewell-aruna/article7224440.ece
20,5,2015,Go forward on India-EU talks,"The European Union’s Ambassador to New Delhi, Joao Cravinho, last week >expressed keenness to pursue the India-EU Free Trade Agreement talks. The desire is mutual. Despite the vigorous pace that the Narendra Modi government has marked in the matter of foreign relations in general, this process has remained in suspended animation for two years now. Minister for Commerce and Industry Nirmala Sitharaman had assured the Ambassador in March of India’s willingness to resume talks. As Mr. Cravinho mentioned, the meeting of the OECD countries scheduled for June offers an opportunity for both sides to draw up a road map. The EU >identified India as a ‘strategic partner’ in 2004. A Joint Action Plan >was signed in 2005 and negotiations on the proposed Broad-based Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA) were launched in June 2007. Eight years down the line, some contentious issues still remain. In the backdrop of Prime Minister Modi’s visit to France and Germany in April came the cancellation of the India-EU summit, apparently for “logistical” reasons. Issues such as the EU ban on import of mangoes from India announced in May 2014, and the legal proceedings in India involving the Italian Marines, are also factors that have left the relationship strained.
The EU is one of India’s largest trading partners and a major source of FDI. The value of EU-India trade grew from €28.6 billion in 2003 to €72.5 billion in 2014, while trade in commercial services rose from €5.2 billion in 2002 to €23.7 billion in 2013. India has concluded agreements with ASEAN, Japan, Singapore and Korea. With the EU the scale of the deal is more ambitious, and consequently the disagreements. For instance, the EU is unhappy with India’s protectionism in the automobile sector, and wants steep cuts in duties, and tariff cuts in things such as wine, spirits and dairy products. But tariff cuts in the agricultural sector would mean Europe’s heavily subsidised agro industry will dump its surplus here, hitting Indian farmers. India’s generic drug market also raises intellectual property concerns for European pharmaceutical corporations. India, on the other hand, is unhappy with the EU not recognising it as a “data secure nation”, and with what the EU has to offer in the area of IT/BPO/KPO services (Mode 1) and the movement of skilled professionals (Mode 4). But the EU is no doubt keen on partnering with India in programmes such as Make in India, Swachh Bharat and Smart City projects. Another criticism levelled against the FTA talks has been over lack of transparency and inadequate consultations with civil society participants. These concerns will also have to be remedied in future rounds of dialogue. It is to be hoped that the whole process would now gain momentum and lead to a negotiated deal.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/go-forward-on-indiaeu-talks/article7224441.ece
21,5,2015,State of flux in Delhi,"Partial statehood, Delhi’s peculiar constitutional situation, has posed challenges before every government that has ruled the national capital since 1993, the year an elected Vidhan Sabha was reinstated in Delhi. Central to this is the prickly issue of an elected government being forced to share powers with a non-elected Lieutenant Governor. So it is that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), armed with a sweeping mandate to govern Delhi and with a newfound sense of assertiveness, now finds itself in an almighty >tussle with the LG over the appointment of an Acting Chief Secretary. This may appear to be a relatively minor issue, but at its heart is an attempt to make sense of the laws that define the issue of who runs Delhi. Article 239 (AA and AB) of the Constitution appears to grant the LG more discretionary powers than Governors in other States. Clause 4 of this Article says that there shall be a Council of Ministers in Delhi to aid and advise the LG “except in so far as he is, by or under any law, required to act in his discretion”. There is no specific provision, however, for the appointment of a Chief Secretary. Under the clause, should the LG have a difference of opinion with his Ministers the matter should be referred to the President. Pending a decision by the President, the LG can take immediate action if, in his opinion, the matter is urgent. But according to the Transaction of Business Rules for the Delhi government, the process of initiating the appointment of a Chief Secretary has to be done by the Council of Ministers. No such move was initiated in this particular instance, and so there should have been no difference of opinion to begin with.
This is a significant grey area, and the real surprise is that it has taken this long for a proper debate on it to happen. Partial statehood, by its very premise, involves some compromises in governance. The big political parties are able to deal with this by going through the ‘right channels’ to prevent a given situation from escalating. It helped that for several years Delhi was ruled by the same party that was in power at the Centre. Such a situation would never work for the AAP, which simply does not do political diplomacy. Delhi is also the only State the party governs, and it is understandably keen to push for more control for itself. Inevitably, things have taken an ugly turn with various civil servants caught in the crossfire, a sense of fear gripping the administration and many officers wondering who to listen to. It is imperative that the rules and laws governing Delhi are reviewed and areas of potential overreach by the Central government are eliminated quickly enough. Failure to do so could lead to a situation where government in the national capital is thrown into a state of flux again.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/state-of-flux-in-delhi/article7228080.ece
21,5,2015,Bad loans are bad news,"With the Indian economy not picking up speed as was being anticipated, the spotlight is on the banking industry. It has been asked why the industry has been >reluctant to pass on the double-dose >rate reduction effected by the Reserve Bank of India in twin instalments outside the policy cycle this year. The answer is not difficult to find. The rising load of bad loans has put banks — especially those in the public sector — in a pincer-like situation. A combination of factors saw gross Non Performing Assets drop from a high of 12 per cent in 2000-01 to 2.5 per cent in 2008-09. These factors included an improved economy, the establishment of debt recovery tribunals, and the enactment of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. But the trend was reversed and the figure rose to 4.6 per cent in September 2014. An estimate by rating agency Crisil suggests that ‘stressed assets’ could stay flat at 6 per cent in 2015-16. And Crisil put the value of such assets at a mind-boggling Rs.5.3 trillion. RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has >said he isn’t quite sure if the banking system has seen the peak yet in bad loans. Since public sector banks account for two-thirds of all banking activity, it is turning out to be a huge worry.
Are bad loans a transitory phenomenon, or are they a chronic problem? If it indeed is a transitory issue, it should slowly evaporate as the economy picks up. If they are the consequence of systemic ills, then the solution lies in fixing the causes. If the economic slowdown is a part of the problem, scam-induced, court-ordained interventions in vital sectors such as coal, mining and telecom have added to the banks’ misery with bad loans. The stressed banks are wary of fresh lending. The need for stricter provisioning in view of the new Basel stipulations will add to their problems. Moreover, banks will no longer be allowed to treat restructured loans as standard ones. The revamped 5/25 scheme is essentially meant to remedy the situation. It allows banks to rejig long-term infrastructure loans by refinancing or selling loans every five years. But the scheme will at best mask stressed assets since banks need not report such loans. Bad loans have put the government in a moral predicament. Can it use the taxpayers’ money to nurse the banks back to health? Besides putting in place a watertight loan appraisal mechanism, the situation calls for a new framework outside the normal banking system to address the funding needs of long-term projects. Bad loans bode ill not just for banks but also the economy. The issue needs to be addressed with the utmost priority.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bad-loans-are-bad-news/article7228056.ece
22,5,2015,March of the IS,"The Islamic State’s >recent takeover of the Iraqi city of Ramadi, followed by its >seizure of the historic city of Palmyra in Syria suggests that rumours of the impending demise of the armed group are vastly exaggerated. Months of aerial bombing by United States-led forces may have weakened the spine of the insurgent organisation and led to the loss of some of the vast areas it holds across Iraq and Syria. Reports have suggested that IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was injured in one attack and that control of the day-to-day functioning of the militias has passed on to other commanders. The resistance shown by Kurdish fighters both in Syria and Iraq — belonging to the Peoples’ Protection Units (YPG) and the Kurdistan Regional Government respectively — has forced the IS to retreat from places such as Kobane and the adjoining Kurd-held territory close to Mosul in Iraq. The group has also suffered significant losses in Tikrit, the former stronghold of ex-President Saddam Hussein. But these losses apart, the resilience of the group has been evident in its capture of Ramadi in the largely Sunni-populated and vast desert province of Anbar. The weaknesses of the Iraqi army — still to recover from its disbandment following the U.S. invasion — are evident. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi’s resort to help from the radical Shia militias might have the support of the Sunni councils in Anbar, but this could only exacerbate what is clearly a conflict that has its origins in heightened sectarian violence in post-U.S.-invasion Iraq.
The IS has cunningly used as buffers vast territories in Syria and Iraq that it controls. An air-bombardment-only campaign is certainly not going to be enough even if it inflicts a toll on the group. The Syrian regime has been fighting too many battles against a variety of rebel forces. It lost some to rebel groups supported by Saudi Arabia and Turkey in Idlib recently, and its tactical retreats from IS-held territory in the past have come to haunt Bashar-al Assad’s forces with the loss of Palmyra. The ancient city — which used to be a Silk route hub — is rich in historic and cultural artefacts; the IS, with its medieval and retrograde views, is expected to engage in destruction here as well. It is clear that the parcelled form of offensive action against the IS is not working well. The IS is bound to implode; it cannot forever sustain itself against a multiplicity of forces — the Syrians, the Iraqi army, the Kurds and the U.S.-led allies (even if they are only engaged in aerial bombing). But as long as there is no concerted action from all these forces targeting the IS in any cohesive manner, it will remain resilient and leave even more brutal trails of destruction in its wake than it has until now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/march-of-the-is/article7232193.ece
22,5,2015,The Barca supremacy,"FC Barcelona, the Catalonian club in Spain, is widely followed and its present generation of footballers revered for their style of football instilled and honed by Dutch footballing legend Johan Cruyff. The club’s heyday under former coach Josep “Pep” Guardiola is understood to be over following his departure and the inevitable aging of some key players such as Xavi Hernandez and Andres Iniesta. Others such as goalkeeper Victor Valdes and defender Carles Puyol have left the club. When Luis Enrique took over as manager at Barcelona from Gerardo Martino in May 2014, the club was said to be facing a mini-crisis. It had failed to win any major honour in 2013-14 — for the first time in six years. This was a far cry from the period of 2008-12 when it won 14 of the possible 19 trophies. When in January, midway through the season, the club trailed its bitter rival Real Madrid in the Spanish La Liga standings, there were questions galore for Enrique to answer. Four months on, the coach stands vindicated for his unrelenting optimism. Barcelona was crowned the league champion last weekend after winning 18 of its last 20 games. It is now on the >cusp of a possible triple win as it is in the finals of the Champions League and the Copa del Rey. The performance of arguably the world’s most devastating front trio, of Neymar, Luis Suarez and lynchpin Lionel Messi, is evidence that Enrique’s approach of man-management rather than total reliance on tactical know-how has worked. The three have had a combined tally of 79 goals and 28 assists in La Liga this season.
While the win will soothe the nerves of Barcelona and its fans, the symbolism outside Spain is not to be lost. Till 2012 the apex of world football was in Spain, built on a style that made absolute control of the ball paramount. In the seasons since then, that emphasis shifted when clubs, especially in Germany, took the style to a new level by adding ruthless efficiency and rapid transition from defence to offence. The high point of this was the combined 7-0 thrashing of Barcelona by Bayern Munich in the 2012-13 Champions League semi-final legs, and the 2014 World Cup win for Germany. Barcelona this season has added these elements to its game. Barcelona no longer just attacks; it counter-attacks too, as was seen in its 5-3 defeat of Bayern Munich in the Champions League semi-finals. The club’s front line, representing the best of the waltz and tango that South American football is known for, has been instrumental in this. Whether this would kick-start another era of dominance by Barcelona and whether with that a shift of the apex back to Spain would happen is too early to say. But victory in Berlin over Juventus in the Champions League final could sow the seeds for such a turn.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-barca-supremacy/article7232194.ece
23,5,2015,The news from Facebook,"Last week, when nine well-known media houses began publishing directly to >Facebook, allowing the social media giant’s 1.4 billion users to read stories then and there, those in the embattled media industry would have felt relieved and uneasy at the same time. Relieved, because of what, on the face of it, seems to be a sweet deal for all the nine publishers that are part of Facebook’s direct publishing feature, > Instant Articles. The New York Times, National Geographic, BuzzFeed, NBC, The Atlantic, The Guardian, BBC, Spiegel Online, and Bild can sell advertisements on their own and keep all of those revenues. Alternatively, they can allow Facebook to sell and still keep 70 per cent of the proceeds. For an industry that is struggling with the aftermath of the digital disruption, this is a welcome revenue-raising opportunity. According to the Pew Research Center’s State of the News Media 2015 report, revenues from print advertising fell in 2014 over the previous year while revenues from digital advertising grew. The catch: the good showing of digital wasn’t even nearly good enough to make up for print’s shortfall. In the U.S., print advertising dollars fell by nearly a billion while digital dollars just about managed a growth of 100 million.
Still, it is difficult not to feel uncomfortable about Facebook’s growing clout as a distributor of news. Top publishers are already on board Instant Articles, and more are itching to follow suit. Their websites could increasingly become less relevant. As more and more publishers join it, each of them individually will need Facebook more than it needs them. But avoiding a partnership with Facebook, as some publishers have suggested they would, isn’t a wise thing to do. As the Pew Research Center’s report >put it, nearly half of those surveyed said they had accessed news on politics and government on Facebook in the week before. Also, the platform attracts roughly a fourth of the display advertisement revenues and more than a third of mobile display advertisement revenues. This is in sharp contrast to the experience of news organisations in garnering digital revenues. Befriending Facebook now is a no-brainer, especially given that publishing houses long ago ceded control of news distribution to technology firms. They have only themselves to blame. What they ought to ensure now is not to become too dependent on any one platform, even as they continue to build their identities both online and offline. Fortunately for the publishers, the likes of Snapchat, Facebook’s promising rival which has managed to woo the youth, do seem to give the hope that the publisher-distributor relationship wouldn’t be one-sided.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-news-from-facebook/article7236278.ece
23,5,2015,This warning should stay,"Following a controversy sparked recently >over >remarks by some Members of Parliament on tobacco use, a group of leading film-makers is seeking to dilute the strong tobacco control measures undertaken by successive governments. The film-makers have made a representation to the Information and Broadcasting Ministry to withdraw the stipulation that cinemas run a warning scroll whenever smoking scenes appear on screen. The argument that showing the scrolls in the manner it is done affects the creativity of the scenes is at best specious. Appearing at the bottom of the screen, the warning does not in any way affect any aspect of creativity. The World Health Organization has stated that the “implementation of a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising and promotion should not prevent legitimate artistic expression”. But that cannot be an argument against the use of the warning scrolls during smoking scenes. In a draft bill introduced in January 2015, the government had proposed a few important measures to prevent children from taking up smoking. One of them is to ban the display of tobacco products at the entrance to or inside a shop. After all, much like banning tobacco advertisement in any form and other promotional activities by tobacco companies, removing tobacco products from plain view can help a lot in reducing their use by children. While it may be difficult to enforce such a ban, that is not so for the warning scrolls in movies.
There is a body of evidence to show that watching movies that have smoking scenes produces a strong impact on young and impressionable minds, encouraging them to try out smoking. The U.S. Surgeon General’s Report of 2012 has made it clear that rating movies with smoking scenes as ‘R’ (restricted) would lead to a reduction in smoking among the youth. Last year the Surgeon General’s Report went a step further and said an 18 per cent drop in the rate of smoking by the youth could be effected if all movies classified as ‘PG-13’ (parents strongly cautioned that some material may be inappropriate for children under 13 years) eliminated smoking scenes. Even if the government does not propose such laws, the least it could do is to maintain the status quo and not succumb to pressure on this count. The warning scroll is an effective way of communicating the dangers of smoking and improving awareness in general about the hazards of smoking. The government’s commitment to waging war against tobacco use took a severe beating when it failed to introduce pictorial warnings in an effective size on tobacco product packaging. Those in the 15-24 year group account for over 27 per cent of tobacco consumption in India; withdrawing the stipulation to display the warning message will inevitably increase that proportion.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/this-warning-should-stay/article7236279.ece
25,5,2015,Misplaced plea,"The Tamil Nadu government’s move to approach the Supreme Court seeking a review of its recent judgment barring the use of pictures of political leaders in government advertisements is retrograde and unnecessary. The court’s verdict restricting the list of dignitaries whose photographs are permissible on government advertisement material to the President, the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India, is a significant step in eliminating the partisan use of government resources to gain political mileage. Indeed, if there is a flaw in the judgment, it is in the exception made in favour of the holders of these three offices. Even though it says the President, Prime Minister or CJI could themselves decide on the inclusion of their pictures in advertisements, there really is no need for anyone’s image in such material if disseminating information is the sole purpose. The Tamil Nadu government has argued that there should be parity between the Centre and the States, and that the judgment, by privileging the dignitaries at the Centre, violates the principle of federalism. It is indeed an attractive argument if one contends that the same privilege should be extended to the Governor, Chief Minister and Chief Justice of the High Court so that there is Centre-State parity. However, the spirit of the verdict is to take government advertising out of the domain of partisan politics. In course of time, the apparent disparity should also give way to a universal prohibition of the use of pictures of any dignitary.
It is disappointing that the court did not accept a key recommendation made by a three-member committee that there should be special curbs on government advertisements during election time. This could have been an important guideline that would further purify the election process. The court may be confident that if the government adhered to norms there will be no need to adopt special, election-eve restrictions, but it should have taken note of the propensity of the political class to seek to gain mileage by delivering politically loaded messages using the official machinery during election time. In a democracy, the main reason for a government to issue advertisements is dissemination of essential and useful information about its functioning, its schemes and projects and their benefits. There is no real need to confer on any individual the privilege of being projected in official publicity material to give the impression that a scheme or measure owes its existence to the generosity of that individual. One can discern in the Tamil Nadu government’s review petition only an eagerness to overcome any legal impediment to its known penchant for projecting the ruling party leader as the sole benefactor behind its welfare programmes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/jayalalithaa-da-case-tn-govt-move-supreme-court-to-review-the-case/article7241637.ece
25,5,2015,That missing vigour,"Going by macro-numbers, the Narendra Modi government has a lot to cheer as it enters its second year. Falling deficit both on the current account and fiscal fronts, and rising foreign exchange reserves should be cause for relief, even rejoicing. Both core and retail inflation rates have eased, prompting the Reserve Bank of India to cut repo rates twice this year. Reading these trends in tandem with the rise in indirect tax collections and a marginal drop in the levels of non-performing assets, a confident Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley, suggested last week that better days are really round the corner. There have also been significant reform initiatives in the area of foreign direct investment covering sectors such as insurance, defence, railways and construction. Labour law reforms and relaxation of rules for investment by new categories of Indians living abroad have all been quietly pushed through amid the daily din in Parliament. The successful auctioning of coal mine leases and spectrum, thereby setting the stage for a transparent policy regime, is noteworthy. However, the government’s inability to push two crucial pieces of legislation — the land bill and the GST bill — has reflected poorly on its legislative management skills. This has also revealed an unhealthy, ‘my-way-only’ attitude in a democratic set-up.

Despite all the positives, there is this sense of restlessness perceptible on the ground. While largely conceding this, Mr. Jaitley has sought to explain it away, attributing any such impatience to the fact that “the country wants to grow even faster”. But is there anything wrong in people pitching their aspirations high? Expectations rose several notches especially after Mr. Modi pegged a high-voltage poll campaign on an allegedly ‘non-performing’ United Progressive Alliance government led by Dr. Manmohan Singh. While claiming that the “expectations from the Modi government were realistic”, Mr. Jaitley has put the blame on a recalcitrant Opposition, which, according to him, has put many a roadblock before the government’s efforts to fulfil its mandate. In fact, he has given his own government a pat on the back for being decisive in the face of obstructionism. But the moot point is this: Why is it that great expectations have so quickly given way to a feeling of impatience, all within the span of a year? The positive sentiment is slowly evaporating. Pick-up in domestic demand and a recovery in the investment cycle are not happening. The ‘X-Factor’ is just not there, as one industrialist put it. An answer to this situation could lie in an initiative that would see the government taking the lead-spender role, kick-starting an economy in slumber. A little bit of socialistic spending is a necessity given the size and structure of the Indian economy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/narendra-modi-government-s-one-year-in-office/article7241638.ece
26,5,2015,Not up to expectations...,"Having come to power on the strength of mega-promises centred on the prospect of achhe din for all, Prime Minister Narendra Modi cannot but feel the weight of popular expectations on his government after an uneventful first year. The vast majority of those who backed him, those who gave the BJP he led a clear mandate in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, bought his words of hope in toto, and believed he could bring in much-needed change and put the country back on a trajectory of growth and development. On the first anniversary, some of the promises remain as proposals and many others appear too remote with little or no chance of coming to fruition in the next four years. Given the state of India’s slow-moving bureaucracy the expectations were perhaps unrealistic to begin with, but Mr. Modi had fed them with election-time rhetoric. From ensuring efficient delivery of basic services and quickening clearance for infrastructure and industrial projects to ending corruption and bringing back black money kept in foreign banks, his was a long and exhaustive list of promises. As the previous Congress-led government ended its term entwined in scams and scandals, Mr. Modi marketed himself as everything his predecessor Manmohan Singh was not, and sought to represent the varied aspirations of whole classes of people. He wanted to offer much more than a concrete programme of action; he wanted to present a vision of the future, a vision of India taking its place as an economic superpower in the first world. Of course, it was not as if nothing got done during the year, but the achievements pale in relation to the expectations. Inevitably, the comparison being made is not between the last year of the Manmohan Singh government and the first year of the Modi government, but between Mr. Modi’s words and his deeds, between the promise of achhe din and the harsh, unchanging realities on the ground.
To the government’s credit, inflation is down. Falling international oil prices might have had a role as also the resoluteness of the Reserve Bank of India in not lowering interest rates, but the government kept a close watch on food prices. The push toward financial inclusion through the Jan Dhan Yojana seems to have yielded quick results with crores of poor people induced to open a bank account for the first time in their lives. This is quite unlike the proposal for smart cities and the Make in India project that have had no substantial results to show for all their potential, and haven’t so far made any tangible change in the lives of ordinary people. Not surprisingly, the government appears to be aware of this shortcoming and is preparing to announce a large-scale social sector scheme. In contrast to the lack of forward movement in social welfare programmes in the last one year, the government looked as if it were in a hurry to accommodate big business by seeking to dilute the safeguards in the land acquisition legislation and extending tax benefits to the rich. While it was not enthusiastic about the previous government’s rural employment guarantee and food security schemes, it took up in all earnest the controversy-ridden Aadhaar scheme, seen as a first step towards targeted social benefits and capped subsidies. Instead of laying claim to a pro-growth label, the government found itself trying to fend off an anti-poor tag. All told and added up on the political ledger, the debit column has certainly ended up being longer than the credit column.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/modis-first-year-in-office-not-up-to-expectations/article7244971.ece
26,5,2015,… yet successful abroad,"Foreign policy initiatives and efforts to raise India’s international profile will be clearly seen as prominent features of the year. Mr. Modi’s visits to 18 countries in the West, Latin America, China, the neighbourhood and East Asia were in line with the foreign policy objectives set during the UPA’s tenure that sought to adapt India to a fast-changing, multipolar world. In line with the UPA’s correctives during its second tenure when the government sought to move away from a single-minded focus on Indo-U.S. relations, the Modi regime has adopted a multifaceted approach. The government has simultaneously pursued Indo-U.S. strategic ties and a strong economic relationship with China based on trade and investment. The former was outlined in the Joint Strategic Vision for the Asia-Pacific and the Indian Ocean region signed during President Barack Obama’s visit when he was the guest of honour at the Republic Day parade in New Delhi. Reciprocal state visits by Mr. Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping allowed for incremental gains in the relationship as both have sought to whittle down strategic differences.
Mr. Modi’s government has played a proactive role in the neighbourhood. Without the coalition constraints that the UPA faced, the Modi government managed to conclude a land agreement with Bangladesh. The government helped Nepal find its feet after the earthquake and promised support for its Constitution-writing process without any interference. Indeed, Mr. Modi’s twin visits to Nepal helped refurbish the image of the foreign policy establishment, which had resorted to an interventionist approach under the UPA midway through its tenure. But as regards Pakistan and the north-west region, India’s foreign policy approach has been found wanting. The emphasis on a limited engagement with Pakistan that has persisted since the 26/11 attacks has impeded movement to solve outstanding issues, even as Islamabad has moved to deepen cooperation with the new regime in Afghanistan. All said, it is an encouraging start on the foreign policy front. And it is a matter of credit to the Prime Minister and the External Affairs Minister that the Nehruvian emphasis on strategic autonomy has been retained.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/how-is-narendra-modis-visit-to-18-countries-going-to-help-india/article7244972.ece
27,5,2015,A heavy hand in Kashmir,"In response to a political storm over the numerous killings of unarmed protesters by the security forces in Kashmir in 2010, the UPA government belatedly tried to change tack by procuring “non-lethal weapons” for the security forces and the police deployed in Kashmir. The introduction of non-lethal weapons was meant to minimise the number of deaths caused by the security forces while trying to curb protests. The government procured pepper grenades, and pump guns that release a barrage of steel pellets. In a context like Kashmir, merely introducing fewer lethal weapons was never expected to work. The paramilitary forces and J&K policemen who wielded the pellet guns, used them at close range aiming at the chests and heads of protesters. The fallacy of pellet guns being “non-lethal weapons” became obvious during their earliest use in August 2010 when Irshad Ahmad Parray, a nine-year-old boy in Anantnag, was killed after receiving pellet injuries in his chest and abdomen. When these guns don’t kill they leave behind a world of darkness by blinding the injured. Although an exact number of people who have lost their eyesight to pellet gun injuries is yet to be tabulated, requests under the Right to Information Act have revealed that between 2010 and 2013 in the two major hospitals of Kashmir, 36 persons had been recorded as having suffered serious eye injury from pellets. In 2010, 12 people were left completely blind. The number has grown, the latest case being that of a Class X student, Hamid Nazir Bhat, in Palhalan village in Baramulla last week: his right eye has been destroyed by pellets fired by the men of the J&K Police.
Last year, Mehbooba Mufti, the president of the People’s Democratic Party, and her fellow-legislators walked out of the Assembly in protest against the blinding of unarmed protesters in Shopian in south Kashmir by the “uninhibited” use of pellet guns by the J&K Police. After the PDP formed the government in coalition with the BJP, Ms. Mufti and her Chief Minister-father Mufti Mohammad Sayeed appear to have forgotten the outrage they had felt over the blindings in Kashmir by pellet guns when Omar Abdullah was Chief Minister. The promise of a “healing touch” that helped the reinvention of Mr. Sayeed in Kashmir politics in the 1990s will lose credibility unless it is applied in ground operations. Mr. Sayeed has maintained a shocking silence over the case of the 16-year-old Hamid, but Javaid Gilani, Inspector General of Police, in an interview to a Srinagar-based newspaper has justified the pellet gun blindings by asking, “How can a deterrent be set then? How are stone-throwers to be stopped?” Such callousness amounts to adding wounds to a wounded body, an attitude that can push Kashmir back to the brink.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/upa-government-gets-nonlethal-weapons-for-security-forces-in-kashmir/article7248512.ece
27,5,2015,Consistency is the key,"For the third time in six seasons, Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings squared off in the Indian Premier League’s (IPL) main event. MI repeated its 2013 triumph, drawing level with CSK and Kolkata Knight Riders as owners of two titles in the eight-year-old tournament. MI’s success was particularly remarkable because it recovered from four consecutive losses at the start to win 10 of its next 12 matches. Neutrals could partake in the franchise’s joy too, for this win brought glory to the back-room staff that included fan-favourites Ricky Ponting, Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Kumble and Jonty Rhodes — legends whose understanding of the Twenty20 format is informed by their intimate knowledge of Test and one-day cricket. The presence of such experienced minds in the MI camp helped it override the early crisis. CSK has come to define the tournament, but has now lost its last three IPL finals. While the retention of a core group of players has helped the team become a constant presence in the knockouts – CSK has never finished below the top four – it has failed to guide the franchise past the final hurdle. Nevertheless, the frequent appearance of CSK and MI in the play-offs suggests a correlation between consistency of personnel and the chance of victory.
The tournament’s success can be attributed to consistency as well — consistency of both the product and its appeal. Despite criticism, it has engaged, over eight seasons, an audience that has a plethora of entertainment options. According to viewership figures and advertisement rates for television coverage, there isn’t a bigger box office draw for the cricket fan. Buoyed by the support, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has mooted plans to organise a shorter IPL to replace the Champions League T20 event later this year. Despite the participation of the best domestic sides from other major cricketing nations, the latter tournament has failed to excite expert and fan alike. With a revenue model that appears to work in place, the BCCI has been encouraged to believe that two tournaments involving solely IPL teams can coexist. That the IPL has contributed to improving the standards of the Twenty20 format, both domestically and internationally, has come to be recognised; but the fear that it could cannibalise other forms of cricket has not receded. The tournament’s standing continues to be threatened as well. The scandal involving betting and different forms of fixing besmirched its reputation. Suspicions were again raised when the Enforcement Directorate conducted raids and arrested bookies across Indian cities. With India set to host next year’s World T20, it will strengthen its reputation as cricket’s pre-eminent power if its actions protect the IPL from corruption.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ipl-2015-mumbai-indians-and-chennai-super-kings-squared-off-in-the-indian-premier-leagues-ipl-main-event/article7248514.ece
28,5,2015,In search of a clear policy,"The last one year has seen India’s military modernisation process slowly picking up pace in terms of clearances for critical military hardware, with an emphasis on ‘Make in India’. But the much-needed policy framework to provide direction for long-term military modernisation and build a domestic military-industrial complex still appear elusive. The implementation of the government’s election-time pitch of >‘One Rank, One Pension’ for military personnel too, while cleared in principle, has been delayed, and this has caused considerable anguish among ex-servicemen. The government’s single biggest decision on the military front pertains to the direct purchase of >36 Rafale fighter jets from France, which effectively scraps the long-delayed Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft contract for 126 fighter jets. Several long-held-up deals including those for Kamov utility helicopters, Avro aircraft replacement and artillery guns that have been identified as critical have been approved. In fact, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar had personally intervened to clear the purchase of critical necessities such as snow boots and bulletproof vests for troops operating in high-altitude regions and involved in counterinsurgency operations. In all, the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) has cumulatively cleared deals worth over Rs.1,00,000 crore in the last one year. In another move with long-term operational and financial implications, the government has downsized the new mountain strike corps stationed on the border with China, pruning the numbers from 90,000 to 35,000, citing reasons of financial prudence.
While some of the decisions are final approvals leading to price negotiations, several are just clearances to initiate the procurement process. How soon the process can be concluded depends on an early streamlining of the Defence Procurement Policy (DPP). Also, with the government’s ‘Make in India’ mantra, the emphasis is on involving industry in a big way and creating a defence and aerospace ecosystem that would help reduce imports and move towards technological sovereignty. Towards that end, Mr. Parrikar has promised a major revision of the DPP and a separate policy for ‘Make in India’ — which are yet to materialise. This delay is causing disillusionment in several quarters, including in the private sector, which never had a level playing field in the defence sector, dominated as it is by public sector undertakings. Another critical aspect in developing domestic military capability involves reforming the defence R&D laboratories and production facilities. While a lot has been said on revamping and making accountable the public sector, the fact that the top R&D body, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), has been without a full-time head for several months now, reflects poorly on the intent. With some major inductions set to give a significant capability boost to the armed forces, a clear policy direction and overhaul of the existing institutions to enable that shift is required at the earliest so as not to lose the momentum.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/modi365-has-make-in-india-helped-ex-military-servicemen/article7252350.ece
28,5,2015,The goldfever,"There has been a steady rise in the value of illegally brought-in gold seized by the Indian Customs in recent years. From Rs.43.87 crore in 2011-12, the figure rose to Rs.104.62 crore in 2012-13, and further to Rs.686.99 crore in 2013-14. The figure is reported to have crossed the Rs.1,000-crore mark in 2014-15. The number of instances of such seizure, too, went up from 503 in 2011-12 to 2,450 in 2013-14 and 3,412 during April-January 2015. Gold imports nearly doubled in terms of volume from 471 tonnes in 2000-01 to 906.63 in 2014-15. The numbers reveal a compulsive appetite for the yellow metal and also the enormous challenges facing macro-planners. For policy formulators in India especially, it is proving a lot difficult to demystify the glitter of gold and deal with the issue effectively. Net gold import accounts for nearly a quarter of India’s trade deficit. Much of the advantage arising out of falling oil prices is nullified by the surge in gold imports. Compounding the misery, the global economic environment is also not helping the cause of Indian exports. External events and the unquenchable thirst for gold have all conspired to put the managers of the economy in a tight spot. Given the innate sensitivity of many Indians on the matter of gold and its hedging utility, the propensity to possess more and more of it may not melt away anytime soon.
Not surprisingly, every action on the gold import front — be it easing curbs or imposing restrictions — has oftentimes had wider effects on the ground, compounding the monetary and fiscal predicament. Controlling gold import and making it less attractive is the big challenge today, especially in the context of stabilising the external sector with many imponderables outside a nation’s control. Attempts to discourage imports by raising tariff walls and prescribing usage terms have only encouraged trade on the sly. What is required is a conscious effort to educate people on the larger public good that would follow if they voluntarily give up the craze. But this is easier said than done. Simultaneously, efforts should be made to provide alternative financial instruments that give people a sense of assurance and security. The new gold monetisation scheme is essentially aimed to woo the common person and help him or her to earn interest on gold lying idle. It is doubtful, however, if the procedures that are laid out will make anyone comfortable with parking gold with banks. Developing such trust will be a task for the longer term.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/steady-rise-in-illegal-gold-import-in-india/article7252351.ece
29,5,2015,An issue mishandled,"After yet another >stand-off with agitating Gujjars the Rajasthan government has caved in, announcing that it would provide the community 5 per cent reservation in jobs. This will be over and above the 50 per cent reservation extended to backward classes and scheduled castes and tribes. And crucially, the provision will be included in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution so it cannot be challenged in court. Following a series of talks with the community the government’s hand appears to have been forced by the scale of the protests. Road and rail traffic in the State >was >disrupted after thousands of people blocked commercially significant rail routes and the Jaipur-Agra national highway. The estimated loss to the Railways is about Rs. 200 crore. The eight-day-long stalemate prompted the Rajasthan High Court to > come down heavily on the government, asking why not a single arrest had been made. That fact in itself reflects the scale of the problem, but it is one that successive governments in the State have created for themselves.
Agitations by Gujjars over reservations have been a near-annual event in Rajasthan since 2006. The problem goes back to 2003 when the Rajasthan unit of the BJP promised, in the run-up to the 2003 election, to have Gujjars included in the Scheduled Tribes list. But the violent opposition that the move evoked from the numerically stronger Meena community forced the State government to back down. The anger within the Gujjar community grew to worrying proportions after the Vajpayee government decided to reclassify Jats as ‘Other Backward Class’. Faced with immense pressure, the Vasundhara Raje government passed an Act in 2008 granting 5 per cent reservation to Gujjars and classifying them as a ‘separate backward community’. In 2010 that Act was struck down by the Rajasthan High Court, which held that the total quantum of reservation had exceeded the ceiling of 50 per cent as laid down in the Mandal judgment. Unsurprisingly, this did not go down well with the Gujjar community, which demanded the promised 5 per cent reservation no matter what. This is proof, if any were required, that once caste politics is set in motion it creates a vicious cycle of unsustainable promises. By succumbing to the demands rather than take proactive action to end the agitation, the Rajasthan government has set a dangerous precedent. For, concessions made to one community inevitably trigger concerns in others. The Gujjar agitation may have ended for now, but it is certain to return in other forms.

29,5,2015,Endemic discrimination,"Recent reports about some Muslim families and individuals being denied housing accommodation or not being allowed to buy apartments in Indian cities point to an endemic issue of urban bias. While discrimination and biases of various kinds are common in urban sprawls across the world, there is something systemic about the denial of housing to Muslims in Indian cities. Surveys have pointed to various forms of bias, where residents display an aversion to those belonging to other castes and religions being in their neighbourhood. Neither access to education nor economic betterment has mitigated the problem of social bias. The sad reality in the city of Mumbai in particular has been that more than two decades since the 1992-93 communal riots, discrimination remains entrenched; indeed, it is today open and unchecked. Communities such as Dalits also encounter biases when they seek housing, but Muslims are an “easy target” because their names often point to their identity. Even online websites have seen home-sellers and owners openly denying houses to Muslims and people from certain other communities, before outrage against the practice got some websites to announce non-discriminatory policies on listings.
Legally speaking, this is a difficult issue to tackle. In the case of public housing, there cannot be any discrimination, and any form of bias in renting out or selling houses is illegal. But in the case of the private and cooperative housing market, the issue is more complicated. There are several housing colonies that are exclusive if not exclusionary to particular communities. These restrict residents to a particular community on the basis of their right to freedom of association, which was endorsed by the Supreme Court in Zoroastrian Co-operative Housing Society Limited v. District Registrar Co-operative Societies (2005). Yet, the Supreme Court has over the years developed a fairly comprehensive jurisprudence that regulates relations between “private parties” based on constitutional principles and fundamental rights. This could legally provide a basis for non-discrimination on matters related to housing. Judicial interventions apart, legislative action is required to address such acts of discrimination. The Rajindar Sachar Committee in its recommendations in 2005 sought the setting up of an Equal Opportunity Commission to provide a legal mechanism to address complaints related to discrimination in matters such as housing. Towards the fag end of its tenure the UPA government discussed the setting up of such a Commission, but nothing came of it. It is time to revisit the issue and implement this legislatively.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/reports-about-muslims-not-given-accomodation-in-indian-cities/article7256661.ece
29,5,2015,FIFA under a cloud,"The arrest of some current and former FIFA officials by the Swiss police for extradition to the U.S. over federal corruption charges, and a subsequent raid in Zurich in a parallel investigation into the allotment of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosting rights to Russia and Qatar respectively, have brought to the fore yet again the worst-kept secret in the sporting world — that football’s governing body is steeped in endemic corruption. Since the days of João Havelange, who was FIFA president from 1974 to 1998, and then through the tenure of the incumbent, Joseph S. Blatter, charges of financial misconduct have been routinely levelled. But they merely shook the edifice; none actually hit the top of the hierarchy. However, the current round of charges are grave. The U.S. Department of Justice has alleged a “24-year scheme to enrich themselves through the corruption of international soccer” and booked people for fraud, racketeering and money laundering conspiracies. The bribes and kickbacks centred on sports marketing deals could be worth more than $150 million. One revelation is of an alleged $10-million payment to some FIFA executive committee members to vote for South Africa to host the 2010 World Cup.
This has come two days before the FIFA Congress, where 209 countries are to vote on a fifth term for Mr. Blatter; the circumstances are thus far from ideal to hold the election. True, none of the investigations have so far named Mr. Blatter. But with the alleged misdeeds having happened under his watch, there is a need to fix accountability. Four years ago when he was re-elected unopposed after his Qatari rival, Mohammed bin Hammam, had been banned amid bribery claims, he asked: “Crisis? What is a crisis?” This time he cannot be in denial. The other consequence of this scandal concerns the choice of Russia and Qatar as World Cup hosts. The race to host them was chaotic and controversial. Of the 24 voters who were to decide the claims of the two cities in 2010, two never made it to the board room, following bribery allegations. Now almost half of them stand discredited. Also, the choice of Qatar as a host was made despite concerns over its summer weather and widespread reports of its poor treatment of migrant workers. FIFA might now say the investigation was a result of its own report submitted in November 2014, but it is a fact that the organisation’s ethics committee had closed its investigation into the bidding process, ruling that breaches, if any, were only of “very limited scope”. Football is perhaps the only truly global sport, and it is loved by millions of fans as the beautiful game. For it to remain that, the need is for democratic governance and not the current, allegedly corrupt, fiefdom that has seen just two presidents in four decades.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fifa-under-a-cloud/article7256662.ece
30,5,2015,Mr. Modi reaches out,"A meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Dr. Manmohan Singh should in the normal run of democracy have passed without inviting any remarks. Once the heat and hostilities of an election end, governance should be a cooperative enterprise, with the incumbent seeking advice or information from the one he succeeds. As Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, for example, was known to maintain cordial relations with several Congress leaders, even telling them he wanted to benefit from their experience of longer years in government. In the current dispensation, too, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley makes it a point to keep in touch with his predecessor, P. Chidambaram, and >Dr. Singh, on matters economic. This is a healthy practice, and if Mr. Modi and Dr. Singh, as it has subsequently emerged, >discussed the economy and foreign policy, the Prime Minister certainly should be lauded for reaching out to his predecessor in office, a well-regarded economist.
When Mr. Modi tweeted about the meeting, he left unsaid the fact that it was he who had initiated the meeting. Therefore it fuelled speculation, especially as the meeting came within hours of a very public exchange of barbs between the two. At the just-concluded first anniversary celebration of the government, BJP leaders had spent more time attacking the UPA government than highlighting its own achievements. A day earlier, a former TRAI Chairman had accused Dr. Singh of wrongdoing in the >2G spectrum scandal, two months after the latter was questioned in the coal mine leasing scam, leading to another chain of speculation. It was only later in the evening, when the Congress realised what was happening and clarified that Dr. Singh had gone to 7 Race Course Road at the invitation of the Prime Minister, and that the only subjects discussed were the economy and foreign policy, that the picture cleared. While it is unclear why Mr. Modi himself did not clarify at the outset how the meeting had come about, it is evident that the Prime Minister is in need of a better public image at this point. He is no more in the sweet spot he was just a year ago: the economy is not doing as well as was hoped, investment is not coming at levels that were anticipated, and the BJP is yet to recover from the abject defeat it suffered in the Delhi State elections, or from the jokes about Mr. Modi’s sartorial choices. The Opposition has pinned the government down on the Land Bill. All this together has taken sheen off the government. Rhetoric — even the occasional jumla, a word the BJP president recently used to denote an empty promise — can be forgiven when uttered in the heat of an election campaign. But when an elected leader and his cohorts seemingly continue to remain in poll mode, people begin to ask: when will the party we voted to power get down to the serious business of governance? Mr. Modi needs to change the optics, if not the objective situation itself. And this meeting is perhaps the first step in that direction.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mr-modi-reaches-out-to-dr-manmohan-singh/article7261347.ece
1,6,2015,A promise to redeem,"The issue of implementing the >One Rank One Pension (OROP) principle for the veterans of the defence services continues to be in the news for all the wrong reasons, with a final announcement nowhere in sight. With the Narendra Modi government in its second year, its major poll promise of OROP remains unfulfilled. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Ministers have >reiterated the government’s commitment to the scheme, that by itself does little to contain the growing unhappiness in the community of ex-servicemen that has been waiting for years for a fair deal. Their demand goes back over three decades. Successive governments have intermittently raised hopes on it according to political convenience, but the feeling has grown that the soldier who puts the nation ahead of his own life in the line of duty faces political apathy after retirement. The previous UPA government cleared the deal in principle and allocated Rs.500 crore, but there was no progress beyond that. In the run-up to the Lok Sabha election last year, the Congress once again brought the issue to the limelight. OROP was one of the top election promises of the BJP that helped garner the support of the large community of ex-servicemen and their families. And the huge mandate the BJP received had convinced them that at long last the scheme would see the light of day.
While the government has given in-principle clearance to the proposal, the process of completing the administrative procedures across different departments seems to be an unending one. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar had on several occasions said his Ministry had finished its part of the work and that the file was with the Finance Ministry. He has promised 80-90 per cent satisfaction for the service personnel. OROP essentially seeks parity for all service personnel retiring on the same rank and tenure irrespective of when they retire, and is expected to benefit two and a half million ex-servicemen and women immediately. That said, the exercise of calculating the dues is a complicated process in itself. In Budget 2015 an initial allocation of Rs.1,000 crore was made but it has been estimated that the cost could come to about Rs.8,300 crore. There is the view that it would still go up by substantial measure depending on the method and criteria adopted. It has to be seen how the government makes the financial provision for such a recurring outgo. But the early implementation of the scheme has now become an imperative: mere rhetoric and assurances will not suffice. It is high time the government came out with a clear road map and a firm date for its implementation, and then adhere to it. This country owes its defence forces as much.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/one-rank-one-pension-implementation/article7268432.ece
1,6,2015,A diktat and some questions,"When the authorities of a government-funded and administered institution of repute chooses to >de-recognise a student group based on an active position it takes on social and ideological issues, there is something very wrong with the approach. The Ambedkar-Periyar Study Circle (APSC) at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras has been distributing pamphlets and posters that call for, among other things, removal of ‘brahminical tyranny’. The circle has also been extremely critical of Narendra Modi and his government, objecting to what it terms ‘anti-poor’ and Hindutva-oriented policies. Detractors, in turn, have objected to what they call the ‘casteist’ and ‘political’ message the APSC has been seeking to spread. An anonymous complaint received by the Ministry of Human Resource Development was forwarded to the IIT-M management. The management, in what appeared to be a knee-jerk reaction, derecognised the APSC, >saying student bodies cannot use the Institute’s name as part of their title without approval, adding that the APSC could seek a review anyway. With the political climate today being so charged, the incident has had national repercussions, with leaders and commentators seeing in the move a grave attack on the freedom of speech. They are right and justified in taking the position.
The IIT-M does not allow political activity or politically-affiliated unions on its campus. Student bodies, including the APSC, are recognised by the Institute in order to foster healthy debates on the campus. There are apprehensions that political parties would find a backdoor entry through such bodies, but the APSC is not formally associated with any political party. In this case, the APSC has campaigned against certain political parties by naming them, and taken positions against religious orthodoxy, even questioning organised religion itself. These radical positions should not really surprise anyone as Tamil Nadu is a State that has had a rationalist political tradition. The APSC’s activism has been criticised by detractors and it has been sought to be associated with “hate speech”. But such an association will be spurious, as questioning orthodoxy and conservatism is not tantamount to hate speech, which is characterised by a deliberate targeting of communities rather than beliefs. What the IIT-M management must seek to do is to not let political discussions and debates to descend into vituperative attacks and hate speech. Instead, by resorting to a quick ban, being passed off as a “temporary de-recognition”, the IIT-M management is playing into the >hands of short-sighted critics . Academic excellence, freedom of speech and expression, and freedom of association should go hand in hand; they should not be seen as mutually exclusive.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-derecognition-of-apsc-by-iitm/article7268433.ece
2,6,2015,The blight of militarisation,"Maithripala Sirisena’s victory over Mahinda Rajapaksa in the Sri Lankan presidential elections in January 2015 was enabled by massive support from minorities in the country — the Tamils and Muslims. Clearly, the mandate was not just for a more accountable and democratic government that would reverse the creeping authoritarianism and family rule heralded by Mr. Rajapaksa, but also for addressing systemic issues that had gripped, and continues to nettle, Sri Lankan society. Chief among them is the issue of militarisation. Following the triumph against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the military has taken a preponderant role in Sri Lankan society, particularly in the north. In the Tamil-majority provinces, the large-scale presence of the military has been sought to be justified as a security response to the possible rise of post-LTTE insurgent forces. But as the participation of the Tamil community in election after election since the war suggests, that reasoning is flawed and unacceptable. The Rajapaksa regime sought to utilise its “triumphalist phase” by allowing the military to diversify into commercial activity, “development”, education, tourism and even policing, among others. The expectation from the new regime — especially among the minorities — was of a quick reversal of this dangerous trend.
Recent findings from the U.S.-based think tank, Oakland Institute, based on research and surveys done during the period December 2014-January 2015, have pointed to hardly any reconciliation > between the government and the Tamils. And the occupation by the military of the land of those displaced in the civil war is a prime cause of resentment, not to mention the long-pending but ignored task of devolution of powers to the provincial councils. The promise of a process of reconciliation and investigation of alleged war crimes has remained unmet, adding to the resentment. Recent reportage by this newspaper from the Northern Province has pointed to steady progress in the release of army-held land to some of the displaced Tamils. This, and the setting up of a new > Presidential Task Force on Reconciliation headed by former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, are steps in the right direction. But these are not enough. The extant militarisation holds dangerous portends; the example of Pakistan is there for all to see. International pressure and electoral results have thus far pushed the envelope for the Sirisena presidency to take minimal steps to reverse the authoritarianism of the Rajapaksa regime. But the need is for a comprehensive demilitarisation plan that includes ways to demobilise recruits to the bloated military, so that Sri Lanka would soon be back to its normal self.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sri-lankas-presidential-task-force-on-reconciliation/article7271812.ece
2,6,2015,Separate lives,"Within > just a year of the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh and the creation of Telangana the two States could not have learnt to live without each other. Both States still have to negotiate through the terms of separation, beyond the division of assets and the sharing of resources. Telangana saw in the bifurcation new possibilities and opportunities for growth and development, and the Telangana Rashtra Samithi government under K. Chandrasekhar Rao doubtless began with a tremendous amount of goodwill. After years of struggle for statehood that entailed much suffering and disruption of normal life, the people of Telangana seem prepared to wait a little longer for the promised transformation to materialise. But while the demand for a separate State took the form of identity politics, issues of backwardness and uneven development remain at the top of the people’s list of grievances. Unlike earlier when they could blame the elite sections of coastal Andhra for taking away the fruits of development, especially Hyderabad, the people of Telangana now have none but their own elected representatives to find fault with. Investments in infrastructure and the leveraging of the strengths of Hyderabad, especially in information technology (IT), are good beginnings, but the people in Telangana’s hinterland would want a more even distribution of growth and development. They did not support a separate Telangana merely to replace a ruling elite from coastal Andhra with one from Hyderabad.
With perhaps greater justification, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu concentrated his energies on building a new capital. After the bifurcation, rebuilding Andhra Pradesh was the constant theme and the search for a new capital, which ended in Amaravathi, symbolised this more than anything else. Mr. Naidu, who can take credit for giving Hyderabad a head start in IT during his earlier term as Chief Minister of the undivided State, is quite understandably putting all his efforts into developing the capital region. However, as in Telangana, unless development is even and the benefits of growth are shared by all, resentment is bound to swell in the regions far removed from the capital. An excessive fascination for IT services and the urban landscape had proved to be Mr. Naidu’s undoing in 2004, and he appears to have learnt his lessons well. Alongside the fascination for IT, there is now concern for the welfare of farmers and landless labourers, and people in far-flung regions with varying needs. Just as for Telangana, the bifurcation can present new possibilities for Andhra Pradesh too. But the two States must see the advantages of greater cooperation and put the painful memories of the separation behind them.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/andhra-pradeshtelangana-bifurcation-anniversary/article7271811.ece
3,6,2015,The right decision,"The Karnataka government’s decision to >file an appeal against the acquittal of the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, Jayalalithaa, is bound to be welcomed by all those who value probity in public life and believe that the courts are the right forums to take forward issues relating to corruption in high places. The Congress dispensation in Karnataka understandably took its time to arrive at a decision on whether to file an appeal in the Supreme Court. It has gone by sound legal principles by examining the recommendations of the Special Public Prosecutor, the State’s Advocate-General and the Law Department. The primary question it had to contend with was raised by the legal wing of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee itself: what is Karnataka’s interest in the outcome of the case? The argument was that the State had already discharged its duty by hosting the trial in Bengaluru, appointing a Special Judge and Special Public Prosecutor, obtaining a conviction in the trial stage and seeing it overturned by the High Court. Should the State go beyond this specified administrative function by filing an appeal in the Supreme Court, taking on the role of an aggrieved party? The question may appear valid, but to abandon a legal process midway is also untenable. The Supreme Court has made it clear that Karnataka is now playing the role of the prosecuting State and has stepped into the shoes of Tamil Nadu. Its duty now includes taking up the mantle of the aggrieved party and pursuing the legal process to its logical end.
Moreover, the Karnataka High Court judgment acquitting the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister is widely seen as flawed in many respects, especially in the computation of the quantum of ‘disproportionate assets’ that ultimately formed the basis of her acquittal. Special Public Prosecutor B.V. Acharya has said the arithmetical errors are glaringly obvious. Some aspects of the High Court’s reasoning are controversial: it has included cash gifts of high value as legitimate income and given credence to a newspaper subscription scheme that had been termed fake by the trial court. It has gone zealously by a 1976 Supreme Court ruling that unexplained assets up to the value of 10 per cent of known income is acceptable, even though the anti-corruption law has since been amended to make disclosure as per statutory requirements the standard to assess legitimate income. The prosecution believes revisiting the computation itself will propel the quantum of ‘disproportionate assets’ beyond this 10 per cent limit. Overall, it will be in the public interest to have an authoritative pronouncement by the highest court on whether the trial court or the High Court was right in appreciating all the evidence. It will also be in Ms. Jayalalithaa’s own interest that her exoneration — if she succeeds in sustaining it — is a vindication that clears her political path rather than one that depends on a conclusion seen to be perennially under dispute and in the realms of legal debate.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-right-decision/article7275529.ece
3,6,2015,Coping with the heat,"Extreme weather conditions have become such a part of life all across the world over the last decade and more, that ways and means to understand and cope with them have become an essential element of survival strategies. Heatwaves in summer, cold waves in winter and extreme rainfall when it is least expected have almost become the norm. Each of these rounds takes its own toll on lives and livelihoods even as those in other areas are forced to stand as mute spectators. This summer in India, the number of >lives lost to heatwave conditions has exceeded 2,000. While shrinking winter-spans are considered by specialists as a sure sign that climate change is a reality we cannot ignore, at the other end of the spectrum, hot summers are no less debilitating. Prediction of these phenomena is itself so difficult, not for lack of effort but because of the theoretical limitations of the models being used in the calculations. Broadly speaking, there is no doubt that summer heat is worsening by the year in parts of India. This fact is reflected in some climate studies. For instance, one on climate in the subcontinent over the period from 1961 to 2010 by scientists of the India Meteorological Department based in Pune and Chennai, found that compared to the first four decades, the number of heat-wave (HW) days per season was higher during 2001-2010 in many parts of north, north-west and central India. An increase was observed in the number of severe-heat-wave (SHW) days per season in some stations, mainly in north-west India. The study also found that the frequency, persistence and area coverage of HW/SHW days were more than average in years succeeding El Nin~o years.
The question remains whether humankind is preparing for eventualities such as this. For those in denial of climate change, there are clear pointers that cannot be ignored. Also, from the point of view of disaster mitigation, the rising number of heatwave related deaths should serve as an urgent signal to develop innovative methods to control summer-time losses. It is somewhat ironical that while the long, hot summer takes such a toll, in this subcontinent it is also a necessary condition for the monsoon to set in and provide adequate rainfall. In a sense, the unendurable heat and the rains that follow are tied together in a delicate balance. While it is important to preserve this balance by focussing on factors to mitigate climate change, it is also necessary to develop methods to cope with the impact of each of these when they go beyond normal.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/coping-with-the-heat/article7275530.ece
4,6,2015,Beyond the rate cut,"The 25 basis-point cut >announced in the repo rate , the rate at which the Reserve Bank of India lends to banks, was indeed on expected lines, although there might be some disappointment with regard to the quantum of the reduction. Why is the RBI playing so cautious, however? The reasons are not far to seek. The banking sector, which has been struggling to bring down the bad loan load, has shown a certain defiance when it came to passing on rate cuts to borrowers. It took a “no fresh rate cut warning” from Governor Raghuram Rajan to goad them on to cutting lending rates, however reluctantly. With the latest cut, the third this year and announced as part of the policy cycle this time for a change, the RBI appears to have given banks a fresh message. Given the level of bad loans in their books, and also considering the stress on their margins, the banks will now have to do a tough balancing act. The RBI has only limited width to go beyond taking a measured step. The central bank is still unsure if the inflation clouds have disappeared completely. Concerns over the below-normal south-west monsoon predictions, oil prices firming up amid volatility, and the ever-present geopolitical risks, appear to be bothering it. A combination of macro-numbers — such as of falling retail inflation and factory output — and political pressures has put the RBI in a spot. So it has, quite understandably, chosen to tread with caution.
Given the complexities of the Indian economy and its inter-connections with the outside world, a rate reduction by the monetary authority alone will not suffice at the present juncture. Oftentimes the RBI has indicated this in a subtle manner. The latest policy suggests that the fiscal bosses cannot avoid the onus of pushing the economy to a higher growth trajectory without inflationary consequences. “Strong food policy and management will be important to help keep inflation and inflationary expectations contained over the near-term,” the RBI has said. At the same time, it has advocated a ‘step up’ in public investment in several areas that could ‘crowd in’ private investment. To remove supply irritants and aid disinflation, public investment is critical. With stressed assets eating into its vitals, the banking industry is largely reluctant to commit itself to fresh credit exposure. “A targeted infusion of capital into scheduled public sector commercial banks… is also warranted so that adequate credit flows to the productive sectors as investment picks up,” the RBI has stated. It takes two to tango, the central bank appears to suggest. The ball is now in the government’s court.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/beyond-the-rate-cut/article7279097.ece
4,6,2015,Against the grain,"At a time when the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Second Amendment) Bill, 2015 is being examined by a joint committee of Parliament, >the promulgation — for a third time — of an Ordinance shows scant regard on the part of the Narendra Modi government for democratic norms. Despite public expressions to the contrary by even Mr. Modi, the BJP-led NDA government appears disinclined to concede any ground to the Opposition on its key demands to restore clauses relating to consent and social impact assessment that were integral to the 2013 Act. Not surprisingly, therefore, Opposition MPs on the joint committee are planning to disassociate themselves from it. Sitaram Yechury, CPI(M) general secretary and a member of the committee, has described the re-promulgation of the Ordinance as “absolutely untenable constitutionally in a democracy”. Even as the ruling dispensation shows no sign of relenting, murmurs of unhappiness have come from within the BJP itself, especially from MPs who represent rural constituencies. In fact, at the first meeting of the joint committee some BJP members, worried about the political fallout of the proposed changes, expressed their concern. Even the BJP’s NDA allies, the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Shiv Sena, have raised questions about the wisdom of persisting with such an unpopular move.
Evidently, the Modi government misread the signs: for even senior officials who see merit in the proposed changes (as they feel it would simplify land acquisition and put infrastructure projects on the fast track) say the government should have engaged the Opposition in a discussion before bringing the Bill forward. It should have also, they add, conducted a countrywide exercise of opinion-making before attempting to initiate changes. Now, the Opposition, led by the Congress, has had sufficient time to run its campaign against the government-sponsored changes. Reports from the ground suggest that a substantial swathe of the population believes the government draft goes against the interests of the rural poor and is anti-farmer. Unfortunately for the government, all this has coincided with unseasonal rain that has damaged crops, and a hike in fertilizer prices. Yet, the minimum support price for crops has not been increased commensurately. Taken together, the message is that this is indeed a suit boot ki sarkar — in Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s shorthand — that does not care for the agricultural class; it just wants a land law that would favour the corporate rich. The ruling dispensation’s plan to call a joint session after the current Land Bill is defeated in the Rajya Sabha, flies in the face of pragmatic politics, as it would just give the Opposition even more ammunition. The only explanation is that its numbers in the Lok Sabha have blinded the government to the predominant national mood.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/against-the-grain/article7279096.ece
5,6,2015,FIFA should turn the page,"Just a week ago, on the day of his election as FIFA president for a fifth term, Joseph S. Blatter remarked: “We don’t need revolutions, we need evolutions.” After resuming office he went further and said: “Why would I step down? That would mean I recognise that I did wrong.” However, days later, >in a widely welcomed move he resigned, saying the organisation needed a >“profound overhaul” . It is unclear what prompted the hard-nosed football administrator, who displayed such Machiavellian ability to stay in control of the body even as it was engulfed in a series of corruption scandals. Whether it was because the noose was tightening around the FIFA general secretary and his second-in-command, Jérôme Valcke, alleged to have authorised $10 million in bribes for World Cup bidding votes, and fears that it would finally reach him, or pressure from the Michel Platini-led UEFA, or ultimately his own conscience, remain questions. Mr. Blatter believed he was a part of the solution and not the problem, although hardly anyone accepted that. In politics it is said ‘perception is reality’, and in the political theatre that FIFA had become over the years it was no different. Any effort to turn FIFA around would have rung hollow with him at the helm. Accountability has to begin at the top, and Mr. Blatter’s resignation is the first step towards that.
Going forward, the need is to transform the way FIFA works. In 2011, before starting his fourth term, Mr. Blatter engaged Mark Pieth, a Professor of criminal law at Basel University, to create a road map for reform. His recommendations included fixing term limits for the president and executive committee members, proper scrutiny of candidates nominated to the executive committee and greater financial controls. None of these has been acted upon, and the time to do so is now. The deeply entrenched quid pro quo system between Mr. Blatter’s regime and regional football associations, with the development funding route turning into a tool to buy votes and thereby creating divisions within the footballing fraternity, has to end. But that shouldn’t mean a throwback to an era when Europe dominated the football scene: that was precisely the reason why Mr. Blatter was so popular in the developing world. It is imperative that a truly democratic system is put in place. And the leader should work not just for his backers but for everyone. The selection process of World Cup hosts should become more transparent. The mess that a flawed system can create is there for everyone to see in the fact of Russia and Qatar having become hosts. It is high time the lessons were learnt.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-fifa-after-sepp-blatter/article7282986.ece
5,6,2015,No short cuts to safety,"The rapid response of the Centre and the States to concerns about the safety of mass-marketed branded noodles is a welcome departure from the culture of governmental indifference to matters of public safety. >Several States have initiated testing of samples of Nestle’s ‘Maggi’ noodles to assess levels of lead, monosodium glutamate (MSG) and other chemicals. The first tests commissioned by >Uttar Pradesh last year , which were repeated in an apex laboratory in Kolkata for confirmation, indicated that the levels of lead in the snack were much higher than legally permissible; MSG, a flavouring salt normally added to preserved foods, was also found, although on the label there was no indication of its presence. This is plainly unacceptable. Food safety, particularly in the case of aggressively promoted packaged snacks aimed at children, is critically important. The Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, which requires the States to deploy an effective enforcement mechanism, seeks to achieve that with a regime of stiff penalties ranging from fines to a life term in prison. Data presented to Parliament last month show that over 10,200 prosecutions were launched under the law in 2013-14, but they resulted in only 913 convictions; in some States and Union territories, none was secured.
In the ‘Maggi’ noodles case, a fuller picture will emerge when the results of tests ordered by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India are known. It is important to trace the origin of the problem, and its possible linkages to other food articles. This requires State governments to maintain vigilance and undertake sincere, transparent efforts to identify unsafe foods. For its part, the food industry, which deploys enormous resources for lobbying and advertising, would help its own cause by cooperating with the investigation. What stands out as overreach in the entire episode, however, is the targeting of celebrities for their endorsement of ‘Maggi’ products in the past. As actor Preity Zinta tweeted, it is puzzling that she received a court notice for >an endorsement made a dozen years ago . Celebrities must choose with great care the products and causes they endorse, but there is little doubt that their support has advanced many campaigns for public health, women and child rights, and so on. It is also relevant to point out here that food safety cannot exist in a vacuum, where the government neglects social determinants of health such as clean water, pollution control, elimination of adulteration, access to energy and freedom from corruption. In contrast to big corporations that have easy access to resources, India’s food business also has small, informal-sector participants who depend on it for livelihood. Without a supportive state, even well-meaning food laws cannot be comprehensively enforced.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-maggi-noodles-being-unsafe/article7282985.ece
6,6,2015,"Monsoon worries, real or not","By downgrading the monsoon forecast for the year > to ‘deficient’, the India Meteorological Department has pressed the panic button. The forecast now talks of 88 per cent of the long-period average, down from the preliminary figure of 93 per cent. The revised estimate is indeed cause for concern, as it holds the possibility of the country being pushed into a drought situation. These are forward-looking numbers no doubt. Yet the signals can hardly be ignored. > Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has sought to talk up the sentiment by suggesting that the fears are exaggerated, and he may well be right. In his view, the geographical distribution of rainfall and its timing will matter more than the total volume of precipitation. Yet, policy-planners at the fiscal and monetary levels have not shied away from articulating their anxiety. The Centre has said it is ready to face a deficit monsoon. Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh has made it clear that the situation is being monitored on a daily basis and that a ‘contingency plan’ is in place. The immediate worry, nay task, is to quickly devise an emergency plan to tackle the social and economic consequences of a possible drought. In the near-term, the government may do well to prepare a ready-to-roll out action programme to provide farmers a support system and fallback mechanism to ensure that they aren’t consumed by the severity of the impact, should there be a drought. This could well prove to be one of the toughest tests yet for the year-old Narendra Modi government. To minimise the annual concerns on this front, governments at the Centre and the States will have to go beyond mere mitigation strategies and work out a long-term irrigation plan in an integrated and holistic manner to optimise the groundwater potential as well.
If the forecast does come true, however, India could be facing the 12th worst drought since 1950. Already hit by unseasonal rain during the rabi season, this portends further trouble during the kharif cycle. This could lead to serious problems on the food front with consequences on the price situation. Already, lack of rural demand is dragging the economy down. The inflation-focussed Reserve Bank of India will have no more leeway to cut the interest rate in such a situation. Three quick rate cuts by the RBI totalling 75 basis points this year have not really seen any major reduction in lending rates by banks at the ground level. With mounting stressed assets and poor credit off-take, the banking industry has so far chosen to be a reluctant actor in the play. The missing X-Factor has conspired with the existing shortfalls in capacity utilisation to make the industry look forlorn. The situation demands proactive action.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/monsoon-deficiency-and-its-impact/article7286670.ece
6,6,2015,Taxis and technology,"The Delhi government’s > rejection on Wednesday of fresh licence applications of app-based taxi firms such as Uber and Ola is justified if it is premised on, as has been widely reported, their failure to comply with an earlier ban. The administration had banned app-based taxi services in December 2014 after it was alleged that a cab driver working for Uber raped a woman passenger. Following this, these taxi firms were asked to apply for licences to operate. They did so. But then they have been accused of not complying with the ban. The rejection of the application comes just days after a passenger aboard Uber was > molested by the driver. Run-ins with authority aren’t anything new for tech-enabled firms such as Uber. The world over, Uber has clashed with governments and of course with the old order of organised taxi services, which it inevitably disrupts. It is hardly surprising when old, regulated businesses cry foul about new, smart technologies that disrupt them. The disrupters are marketplaces — they own no cars but make their money linking people who want a cab ride and drivers who want business. The government, at some point, as in the case of the rape incident, has to show it is acting tough. And it does so by means of bans. But even without getting into the question of whether the ban was justified in the first place, the point to wonder about is why Uber and others didn’t comply with the government order. Did they? How are they going to explain this?
Now, with the Department of Telecom asking Internet service providers to block the websites of the taxi services in Delhi, the ban order is finally enforceable. Nonetheless, it is still important to question the ban in the first place. The reasons were weak in December when the ban order was first sent out. And they continue to be weak, notwithstanding the fact that they were not complied with in the first place. It can be stated without a doubt that hiring a cab is far easier now than before. The ban doesn’t make any party better off. And the problem of safety in Delhi isn’t one that was caused by these app-based services. The problem is bigger and older. Governments across the world and businesses across the world will be increasingly confronted by new offerings, enabled by technology and by a new world order where innovation is the order of the day. Today, the battle is over app-based taxis. Tomorrow, it could be over something else. The government’s point is: without a licence, there is no keeping tab. But the police, by smartly downloading the taxi apps and catching drivers who were violating the ban, showed how it can be done. The new world needs new methods, not old rules. The wiser thing is to work together to ensure safety standards. The intense urge to regulate everything will only make things worse.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-delhis-ban-on-uber/article7286671.ece
12,6,2015,Battling Islamic State,"A year after >it captured Mosul, the major Iraqi city, Islamic State remains a formidable force in the West Asian region. The U.S.-led coalition’s bombing campaign shows no sign of checking its momentum. Barring some setbacks suffered at the hands of Kurdish and Shia militias, IS has expanded its zone of influence beyond its base in ‘Syraq’ over the year. It recently captured Ramadi, the capital of Iraq’s Anbar province, and the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra. It now has branches in countries including Lebanon, Libya, Afghanistan and Nigeria. President Barack Obama all but admitted on June 10, the anniversary of the fall of Mosul, as he ordered an additional 450 military advisers to join the 3,500 already in Iraq, that his anti-IS strategy wasn’t working. To be sure, IS has no dearth of enemies in the battlefield. The Syrian and Iraqi armies have declared war on it; Gulf monarchies are a party to a U.S.-led coalition bombing IS locations; Egypt had struck IS militants in Libya; and Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militia, has said it would fight IS along the Lebanon-Syria border. Still, why does IS appear so formidable?
IS’s advantage perhaps is that its rivals have no coordinated strategy: they are driven not by a common goal of defeating the enemy but by their own self-interest and sectarian calculations. In Syria, the regime of Bashar al Assad is the most potent force against IS. But the U.S. and its allies such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar want a regime change in Damascus. The efforts of Saudi Arabia and Turkey to weaken the Syrian regime are helping IS grow. In Iraq, the army, disbanded and rebuilt by the Americans, is largely sectarian and too inefficient to mount a major attack on its own. The Hezbollah may be able to protect the Lebanese-Syrian border from IS, but it is considered a terrorist outfit by the U.S., and an Iranian lackey by the Saudis. The Kurdish guerrillas in the Syrian and Turkish border regions had resisted IS effectively, but Turkey doesn’t want them to be brought into the anti-IS coalition. Iran has sent Shia militia groups to the battle-front, but they are viewed with suspicion in Iraq’s Sunni-dominated areas owing to sectarian reasons. IS feeds off this complex sectarian-geopolitical game, and with savagery and extremism tightens its grip over victims. But all this doesn’t mean IS is invincible: it could be defeated, as Kobane and Tikrit show. But to turn such isolated victories into a comprehensive triumph, the forces battling IS need to come up with a cohesive strategy cutting across sectarian fault-lines. Until that happens, West Asia will continue to see more bloodshed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/battling-islamic-state/article7306308.ece
12,6,2015,"Key choices, some questions","The appointments of Vijai Sharma as Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and K.V. Chowdary as Chief Vigilance Commissioner (CVC), which have been a long time coming, also raise some concerns about the Narendra Modi government’s level of engagement with institutions that form the life breath of Indian democracy. The CIC presides over the Right to Information, crucial to a participatory democracy in making institutions accountable, while the CVC is tasked with overseeing the vigilance administration. As watchdogs, both are premised on the principles of transparency and autonomy. For this reason, utmost transparency is called for in these appointments, and it is imperative that the processes by which the names are arrived at are in the public domain. Yet, in the last one year, amid all the achievements of the Modi government, the delay in appointing suitable candidates to these posts had been a matter of some concern, flagged by political parties, informed citizen groups and others. At last count, the Central Information Commission, which has been functioning without a chief for the last 10 months, has nearly 37,788 cases to clear. Three posts of information commissioners in the CIC are vacant. The CIC bench is authorised to hear appeals with respect to the PMO, the Department of Personnel, the CVC, the CAG, and crucial government Ministries.
Democracy is also about processes. Here, the government’s intentions cannot be said to have been strictly above board. If the purpose was to appoint Mr. Sharma, the seniormost Information Commissioner, as the chief anyway, why did the 10-month-long delay occur? After all, the convention so far had been to appoint the seniormost Commissioner as CIC. More important, in March the PMO decided to take away the financial autonomy of the CIC by delegating the powers to a government-appointed secretary, prompting many citizen groups to say the government had weakened the CIC and trampled on its autonomy. In the case of Mr. Chowdary, the process of appointment started after the Supreme Court gave the go-ahead, directing the government to ensure transparency by providing the selection committee headed by the Prime Minister the details of all 130 applicants who applied for the CVC’s post (according to media reports), and not just of those shortlisted by a panel of three bureaucrats. The court is yet to complete hearings on a public interest litigation petition questioning the process of appointment of the CVC. The Opposition, whose role is crucial in the process of appointment of the CVC, may have become an ally of the government in this instance. But unless the government addresses concerns over whether it has gone through all the processes and procedures laid down under law, questions and doubts will remain.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/key-choices-some-questions-on-the-cic-and-cvc/article7306311.ece
13,6,2015,Lift the fog on the operation,"The fog is still to lift on the operation the Indian forces undertook against militant camps inside Myanmar territory bordering Manipur as the Narendra Modi government finds itself dealing with the fallout of certain comments made by one of its Ministers. Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore’s statement that the operation was a message to all countries inimical to India, predictably set off a furore in Pakistan. At a time when India-Pakistan relations are at a standstill with no sign of a dialogue in sight, levels of rhetoric have risen, much of it coming from Pakistan. Traditionally, “hot pursuit” is a term that has raised Pakistan’s hackles. After the nuclear tests in 1998, senior Minister L.K. Advani’s remarks on “hot pursuit” elicited a high-decibel response from Pakistan. This time, besides a resolution in the Pakistan Senate, the Prime Minister, the Interior Minister and the Chief of the Army Staff have all gone hammer and tongs at India. It is unfortunate that the action in Myanmar has triggered a fresh slide in relations with Pakistan on account of breast-beating and credit-hunting by the Modi government. A robust response to the >killing of 20 soldiers in Manipur on June 4 was called for, but safeguarding the space to conduct such operations in the future is also critical for India’s long-term strategy. As military analysts have pointed out, the >June 9 operation is not the first of its kind undertaken by the Indian Army — which as a force will continue to need the support of the Myanmar authorities. So, while guarding the sanctity of India’s borders and the lives of its soldiers and citizens, the long-term strategy must be to erode the militant strength. In fact, that must be the single-point strategic agenda.
India’s national interest must be kept paramount. Short-term political gains coming from loud statements of the kind made by Mr. Rathore can only damage India’s image and risk antagonising a neighbour like Myanmar. Interestingly, the Minister >used the hashtag #ManipurRevenge while sending out Twitter messages about the operation. Such sentiments, even when they come from a junior Minister, cannot be condoned. At all times the necessary distinction between the actions of a state and those of a terror organisation must be kept in mind. Reports in the Manipur media suggest that so far the local police have not received any report on the Army operation; nor have any bodies of militants been handed over to them. Given the claims made by the government, it is essential that evidence of the “success” of such an operation be shared appropriately. Also, Delhi must reflect on why on such occasions tact and silence may help more than seeking credit and political capital publicly.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lift-the-fog-on-the-operation/article7310192.ece
13,6,2015,The Ukraine imbroglio,"The G-7 nations put on a brave face against Russia at a summit held this week in the Bavarian Alps and decided to continue their sanctions against President Vladimir Putin for what they called his war in Ukraine. U.S. President Barack Obama in fact accused Mr. Putin of “wrecking his country in pursuit of a wrong-headed desire to recreate the glories of the Soviet empire”. Russia countered by warning that it would prolong its own counter-sanctions, indicating there would not be any change in its Ukraine policy. While all this is happening, a fresh outbreak of violence between government troops and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine is threatening to derail a tenuous ceasefire. Ukraine is paying a heavy price for this stand-off. It has lost Crimea to Russia, is fighting a deadly civil war in the east, and its economy is in a state of collapse, it having contracted by nearly 18 per cent in the first quarter of 2015.
The real crisis of Ukraine is that it is caught in a game of one-upmanship between the West and Russia. The West wants to punish Russia for its annexation of Crimea and for helping separatists in eastern Ukraine. Moscow, on the other hand, sees Western involvement in the ouster of Ukraine’s pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych, and seems determined to resist the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation’s outreach to its backyard. If the West’s real intention is to get Russia to change its policy towards Ukraine, it should rethink its sanctions regime, which has been demonstrably ineffective over the past 15 months. Supporters of the sanctions might argue that those worked in the case of Iran and might work in Russia’s case as well. But Russia is not Iran. It is a geopolitical giant, a former superpower and a huge country that still has substantial leveraging power in Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Given the way policy-making works in the Kremlin, it is illogical to believe that any kind of coercion would work against Mr. Putin. Besides, there is little to suggest that the Western policy of isolating Russia is working at all. More than a year after Russia was suspended from the G-8 following its annexation of Crimea, the leading powers still need Russia to deal with pressing global issues ranging from the Iranian nuclear talks to the Syrian civil war. So a more pragmatic approach would be to start a diplomatic engagement in a mutually conducive environment. The inept handling by both sides of what was a domestic issue in Ukraine has turned it into a regional problem. Left unchecked, the problem could well turn into a war. It is high time the West and Moscow set aside rhetoric and started addressing the problem directly.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-ukraine-imbroglio/article7310193.ece
15,6,2015,Sub-optimal accord,"On the face of it, the >16-point agreement signed on June 8 among Nepal’s four largest political parties should bring closure to the long-delayed process of promulgating a new Constitution for Naya Nepal. Reeling from the earthquakes in April and May, Nepal sorely required its polity and its elected Constituent Assembly (CA) to push for an accord to resolve outstanding issues — the key ones being “state restructuring” and the form of governance. On the latter issue, the accord decided to retain the Westminster parliamentary model with an executive Prime Minister and a constitutional head of state in the President. The Maoists had been opposed to the parliamentary model, but have agreed to take the process of promulgation forward. On state restructuring, the accord has vaguely identified an eight-state model whose boundaries would be decided by a federal commission. Effectively, it pushed the envelope on the much-debated issue to be decided by a committee of experts. Per se, this was a kind of compromise by both sides of the federalism debate. The former accepted the presence of identity as a criterion of federal determination, while the latter stopped insisting that the CA alone would finalise the federal nature of the state.
There is no doubt that the earthquake, which showed up the Nepali state as wanting in its response to the disaster in terms of relief and rehabilitation (and preparedness) efforts, accelerated the process of getting over the constitutional deadlock. But the sudden spurt of activism in finalising the accord begs the question whether it merely postpones the resolution of the state restructuring issue rather than resolving it. State restructuring was a key demand among the plains-dwellers, minorities and jana jatis in the run-up to the first CA elections in 2008. The demand and need for a CA came about because the first Jan Andolan that brought about a constitutional monarchy in 1990 did not do enough to break the >hegemonic hold of communities such as the Bahun and the Chhetris over the state. The decision under the accord to leave the task of resolving what is effectively a political issue to an unelected commission is therefore not an optimal one. Ironically, the first iteration of the CA, before its dissolution in 2012, had managed to nearly resolve the state restructuring issue before some elements from the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) and the Nepali Congress managed to prevent a clinching solution. It is to be hoped that the proposed commission manages to bring about a federal structure that is close enough to what was nearly arrived at by the first CA.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/suboptimal-accord/article7315487.ece
15,6,2015,A key right from Telangana,"Even as the Central government fights to create a business-friendly environment, the brand-new Telangana government led by K. Chandrasekhar Rao has walked the talk by >announcing a unique and highly welcome Right to Clearance policy. This is a significant move in the new State’s industrialisation programme, and could prove to be a crucial differentiator in the near future. Akin to the Right to Information, the Right to Clearance recognises that businesses have the right to know why project proposals are being delayed and to demand redress for unnecessary procrastination. Bureaucratic red-tape and corruption have not really come to an end in India despite the death of licence raj; industries are still at the mercy of whimsical policies and procedural nightmares. The Right to Clearance will involve a provision to impose a fine of Rs.1,000 on officials for each day of delay in granting clearance to a project, besides allowing businesses to know the exact reason why a proposal is stuck. It also lays down a 15-day time limit for the clearance of mega-projects involving over Rs.200 crore, and of one month for smaller projects. If government departments miss the deadline, the project will get automatic deemed approval. These, and other features such as single-window clearances, automatic renewals and self-certification, will go a long way towards creating an ecosystem that eases doing business in the State. The opportunity costs of clearance delays are enormous. Such cost and time overruns impact the viability not just of industries but also of lending institutions. Across the country, projects worth crores of rupees are mired, awaiting clearance.
It is this fact that makes the Chandrasekhar Rao government’s move particularly laudable. Naturally, it has been welcomed by leading industrialists, with >some of them already announcing projects. They now have a sense of reassurance and renewed belief that the Telangana government is serious about creating an outstanding industrial hub. Extending the out-of-the-box thinking, the Chief Minister has assured industry of “a graft-free and hassle-free system” that will remove lobbies and middlemen. Moves such as this will help rid the bureaucracy of inertia, and inject a sense of urgency and responsibility into the system. The Telangana government’s move not only empowers industries but also raises the bar considerably, and other States will have to match the offer if they don’t want to lose out amid the growing inter-State competition for investment. There is, however, one thing the government must note. Project-appraisal is not only about speedy clearances. Proper due diligence is also a sine qua non for clearance. Speed should not result in ill-conceived or poorly-structured projects being rushed through, and it is to be hoped that the policy will also ensure that.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-a-key-right-from-telangana/article7315486.ece
16,6,2015,The OROP struggle,">Thousands of ex-servicemen converged on the national capital over the past weekend to protest against the >delay on the part of the government in announcing a firm timeline for the implementation of the One Rank One Pension (OROP) scheme. Others have gone on a relay-hunger strike across the country, saying they would do so till their demand is met. In the run-up to the 2014 elections and after, the Bharatiya Janata Party held out several assurances on OROP, raising expectations among the community of veterans. OROP is meant to bring parity among retired military personnel based only on rank and tenure and irrespective of the date of retirement. As >Prime Minister Narendra Modi accepted in his “Mann Ki Baat” broadcast, the government had underestimated the complexity of the process. One of the major concerns of the government as it works out the details relates to similar demands that could potentially come from the Central police and paramilitary forces. The logic of OROP stems from the fact that unlike in other government services where the retirement age is 55, 58 or 60, in the military services a soldier retires around 35. So extending the scheme to non-military cadres will nullify its very rationale. In order to pre-empt any legal issues in the future, the government is working to call it military pension, making it a provision that applies only to the armed forces. Another issue relates to allocating finances for the immediate rollout phase and making the necessary provision for enhancements in future. Wary of any bid by the government to redefine OROP, veterans are demanding that it stick to the accepted definition.
The scheme, once implemented, is expected to benefit two and a half million ex-servicemen and women immediately. While the veterans’ anguish over the delay is understandable, they should appreciate the complexity of the process. Also, with OROP being one of the BJP’s top election promises, commitment for its implementation had been reiterated at the highest level by Mr. Modi. The issue, pending for four decades, has seen more progress in the last one year than over the last few decades. So while keeping up pressure on the government, it would be wise to give it room to work out the details. The government, on its part, should realise that these veterans fought for this country while in service, and it is indeed their legitimate right. In addition, they represent a strong voter base, as the last Lok Sabha elections proved. This is pertinent as protesting organisations have announced they would agitate in Bihar, where Assembly elections are due this year. The government should come out with a clear road map in the interests of the nation as well as its own. The existing mismatch between expectations and delivery could prove problematic in more ways than one.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-orop-struggle/article7322625.ece
16,6,2015,Test of integrity,"By ordering the >cancellation of the All-India Pre-Medical and Pre-Dental Test held on May 3 and the conduct of a fresh test within four weeks, the Supreme Court has acted in time to save the purity of the evaluation process for admission to medical courses, and underlined the need to ensure the integrity of all such exercises. A small gang operating with >advanced equipment and using technology had managed to send out answer keys to candidates taking the entrance test in different parts of the country. The tainted candidates were wearing vests fitted with electronic devices to receive the answers. On a comparative scale, the number of those likely to have benefited from the malpractice may be small — 358 mobile numbers received the answer key from the main suspects and only 44 beneficiaries have been identified. However, the fact that the information may have been transmitted to many others, and the likely frustration it would cause to hard-working students, persuaded the court to annul the entire test. After all, it is unexceptionable to insist that nobody who used unfair means be allowed to benefit from it. Further, the beneficiaries were ready to pay Rs.15 lakh to Rs.20 lakh to get the right answers delivered to them. As many as 102 in a set of 123 solved answers found on the mobile phone of one suspect, and 42 out of 50 found on another, were correct. Two of those arrested in connection with the scam admitted to having passed AIPMT 2014 by adopting the same modus operandi.
The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) tried to save the test it had held by requesting that the results of those identified as beneficiaries be segregated and the rest of the process allowed to stand. However, the court has rightly held that such segregation would not be acceptable as there is a larger need to preserve public confidence and prevent further injury to merit. It will indeed be an onerous task to hold a fresh test within a month and stick to the time-schedule under which the academic session has to begin on August 1. While there has been no lapse on the part of the CBSE in the conduct of the entrance test, it cannot be unmindful of the fact that its systems are still vulnerable to organised deceit. It had indeed tried to provide safeguards by distributing different sets of question papers and varying the sequence of questions in each set. The Board may now have to revisit its systems and processes so that it becomes much less susceptible to the designs of a few unscrupulous elements, and so that over six lakh students who vie for about 3,000 seats get a fair deal.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/test-of-integrity/article7322624.ece
16,6,2015,The makings of a game-changer,"The final report of the Bibek Debroy Committee on restructuring the Indian Railways has >suggested a process of gradual reforms, involving the introduction of commercial accounting practices and greater decentralisation of powers, allowing the entry of the private sector, and the setting up of an independent regulator. The committee has indicated a five-year time frame to implement the measures. One of the most transformative suggestions made is >allowing private sector players to run trains. It has suggested exposing railway production units to competition, and the creation of an environment conducive to private investment by giving confidence to private players through transparent accounting processes. This has to be seen in the context of the failure of the public-private partnership route so far in both the road and railway sectors. There have been different reports in the past that have pointed to what ails the Indian Railways. For instance, in 2012 a committee headed by Sam Pitroda, then Adviser to the Prime Minister, submitted plans for the modernisation of the Railways at a cost of Rs.5.6 lakh crore over a 10-year period. The Debroy Committee report stands out in having identified definitive measures to effect a transformation, and setting a timeline.
But it will be a challenging task, especially the recommendations relating to opening up to the private sector and setting up an independent regulator. The committee has acknowledged that restructuring would be a humongous task, and quite cautiously used the term ‘liberalisation’ for the entry of private players — rather than privatisation or deregulation. The railway employee unions are already up in arms over the references to the private sector. This would be a difficult equation to manage. The suggestion to set up an independent regulator will equally pose a challenge. This will essentially mean setting up a body outside of the powerful and centralised Railway Board, which might resist such a move. The setting up of an independent super-regulator has been spoken about in the financial services space, but not much has happened on that front. However, all these suggestions merit immediate consideration. The Railways has suffered huge under-investment in capacities and today its very viability is a question mark. Now the onus is on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who initiated the setting up of this Committee, and Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu, known for his dynamic approach, to take the railway unions into confidence and implement the measures. Both have declared the Railways is not going to be privatised, but the unions do not appear pleased. Winning their trust would be key to the implementation of the measures. That would determine if this will remain just another report or a game-changer.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-makings-of-a-gamechanger/article7318974.ece
16,6,2015,More than an indiscretion,"Regardless of whether External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj was >only acting on ‘humanitarian grounds’ while recommending the grant of a temporary travel document to Lalit Kumar Modi, the former commissioner of the Indian Premier League now living in exile in Britain, her action will be seen as helping a man wilfully evading investigation in India. The >government and the ruling BJP are backing Ms. Swaraj, and have accepted her explanation that she had done nothing wrong and there was no big moral issue involved. >She claims she had merely said the Government of India had no objection if Britain chose to allow Mr. Modi to travel to Portugal to sign consent papers for his wife’s surgery for cancer. However, there are doubts whether there was a requirement for such consent from her husband at all. Further, there appears to be a conscious change in the government’s policy towards Mr. Modi, who is wanted by the Enforcement Directorate for suspected involvement in violations of the Foreign Exchange Management Act. The previous UPA government revoked his passport in 2011 on the ground that he was avoiding personal appearance before the authorities and that he had contravened FEMA provisions to the tune of hundreds of crores of rupees and parked money outside India. The cancellation of his passport was a means to bring Mr. Modi, who has been living in London since 2010, back to India. Ms. Swaraj’s communication to the British government, therefore, constituted an unwarranted change of policy and an unacceptable concession to one who has shown no inclination to join the investigation on the specious claim that he faces a threat to his personal safety in India.
There is another dimension to this issue: the clear presence of a conflict of interest in Ms. Swaraj dealing with Mr. Lalit Modi. Her daughter was counsel for the former IPL chief in a case that led to the Delhi High Court, in August 2014, quashing the order revoking his passport. This verdict has not been challenged by the present government. A British MP interceded on his behalf with the immigration authorities there, citing Ms. Swaraj’s name. All this gives the impression that the Narendra Modi government, and not merely Ms. Swaraj, has been soft on Mr. Lalit Modi. It is not surprising, therefore, that the party and government are solidly behind her. However, Opposition criticism is getting strident, and questions are being raised whether the Prime Minister is condoning what appears to be a case of a senior Minister using her discretionary power in favour of a friend. The government cannot remain silent and wait for the storm to pass, but must act to remedy the situation. It also ought to spell out how it intends to pursue the ongoing investigations against Mr. Modi.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/more-than-an-indiscretion/article7318973.ece
18,6,2015,Mixed fortunes,"Continuing its decline for the fourth consecutive day, the rupee hit a 21-month low of 64.26 against the dollar on Tuesday. This was ahead of the crucial meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve. The impact of the falling rupee has played out in predictable ways on India’s trade front. The just-released trade numbers for May reveal a contrasting picture. On the one hand the trade deficit has narrowed to $10.4 billion in May from $11 billion in April and $11.2 billion in May 2014. On the other hand, exports contracted to $22.3 billion in May 2015 from $27.99 billion in May 2014. No doubt imports, too, have contracted to $32.75 billion in May, down by 16.5 per cent compared to the May 2014 figure. If you factor in the oil import bill, which has declined due to a drop in international prices, the trade scene doesn’t look rosy at all. The reasons are obvious. Given the geopolitical sensitivity of the commodity, it is impossible to expect global crude oil prices to remain at the very low levels seen not long ago. Also, the continuing weakness on the economic front in countries that import Indian products does not offer any cause for cheer. Neither has the falling rupee helped bring any immediate gains, if we interpret the declining export numbers. In a sense India’s trade now finds itself caught in an extremely tricky spot. And foreign exchange management is proving to be a canny exercise in extremely interconnected international play. Given the complications involved, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has to be proactive so that the rupee does not encounter undue turbulence in the event of any unanticipated global disturbance.
The depreciating rupee has, however, >come as a boon to inward remitters. So much so that today India is a global leader in terms of inward remittances. The rupee has shed just 1.25 per cent against the dollar so far this year. If this brings some cheer to those who remit, it has given the country’s monetary authority the leeway to marshal its proactive strategies efficiently. The net spot dollar buying by the RBI in the first four months of 2015 totalled $33.1 billion. For the entire period of 2014, dollar-buying by the RBI totalled $34 billion. The RBI does not appear to be unduly bothered by the resultant depreciation of the rupee. Two factors should have driven the RBI to intervene in the market. Dollar purchase gives a cushion to face any possible rise in crude prices in the near-to-medium term. Also, the dollar buffer insulates from any adverse fallout of a possible pullout of foreign funds from the Indian market should the Fed hike the interest rate. The question, however, is: how much of a fall would be too much for the rupee? That is easier speculated than answered.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mixed-fortunes/article7326415.ece
18,6,2015,A looming refugee crisis,"A new report by Amnesty International on the global refugee crisis should prove a wake-up call for the international community. ‘The Global Refugee Crisis: A Conspiracy of Neglect’ says the world is facing the worst situation on this front since the Second World War, with the number of people forcibly displaced from their homes exceeding 50 million. It’s not really a surprise given the serial collapse of states in West Asia and Africa, and reports of persecution of vulnerable communities in several countries. What is more appalling is the apathy of the world’s powerful leaders towards this humanitarian problem. The Amnesty report rightly says that the international community’s response to the refugee crisis has been “a shameful failure”. Syria is a case in point. More than half of its population has been displaced by a civil war, and some four million people have fled the country. The burden is almost entirely on Syria’s neighbours such as Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, while richer nations across the Mediterranean have turned a blind eye to it. The European Union’s decision to limit rescue operations in the Mediterranean has led to a dramatic rise this year in the number of people who have drowned during boat journeys. The U.S., a country proud of its tradition of welcoming people from foreign lands, has accepted fewer than 1,000 Syrian refugees in the past four years. The schemes of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) that is meant to address the problem remain under-funded.
People flee their homes to escape desperate situations. If Syrians and Libyans are fleeing deadly wars, those from Myanmar and Eritrea are trying to escape long-standing persecution. Resettling such vulnerable people is a global humanitarian obligation. But sadly, in the current world order this responsibility is not evenly distributed. Powerful nations, which often send bombers to poorer countries to “solve” their domestic problems, as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation did in Libya in 2011, are not as forthcoming when they face refugee crises and poverty. At present, almost 86 per cent of all refugees are in the developing countries, which lack the infrastructure and resources to tackle the challenge. A more coordinated approach is needed to address the problem. Richer countries in the West and the Asia Pacific should find more room for refugees from stricken lands, in order to share the burden more equitably. And, agencies such as the UNHCR that deal with millions of refugees should be sufficiently funded to fulfil their missions. More important, there have to be more meaningful efforts, driven not merely by geopolitical calculations but by moral, humanitarian conviction, to solve the world’s crises. That could be the first step towards addressing the causes of the problem.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-looming-refugee-crisis/article7326417.ece
19,6,2015,Positive expansion,"With the >India Meteorological Department’s forecast putting the average seasonal rain for this year at 88 per cent of the annual long period average for the last 50 years, India is looking at consecutive drought-like years for the first time since 1987. It is in this context that the NDA government’s proposal to extend the number of work entitlement days under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme from 100 to 150 in drought-hit districts must be seen. The decision to extend the number by 50 clearly stems from the concern that there would be >greater demand for wage-related work in drought-affected districts. Considering that the government has been less keen than its predecessor in the implementation of the scheme, this move constitutes a change of heart. After all, the Prime Minister only recently said in Parliament that his government would continue the scheme as a symbol of the failure of the Congress-led rule in tackling poverty, and reports recently suggested that the Ministry of Rural Development was keen to reduce the scope of the scheme to select blocks. This newspaper had recently pointed to the >curtailment in demand and lack of regularity in work allocation under the scheme over the past year, leading to a trend of fewer person-days being available to households (‘ >Sunday Anchor’, May 31). Ground reports suggested this was mostly due to delayed payments and lower outlays by the government, in a sign of lack of enthusiasm for the scheme.
MGNREGS could bring relief to farm workers and labourers affected by the laying waste of cropland for the rabi cycle due to both unseasonal rain and deficient monsoon. This fact was acknowledged in a recent observation by the World Bank on MGNREGS as an effective substitute for lack of crop and weather insurance in India. The government’s decision to extend the days of entitlement at this expedient hour must therefore be welcomed. That said, it is imperative that the government realised the importance of the scheme as a crucial intervention to spur the rural economy and alleviate poverty, and not just as a short-term or stopgap arrangement to alleviate distress — which in any case it does. The record of success of MGNREGS since its launch in 2006 as a welfare initiative that empowers distressed rural households has been well-documented. Its weaknesses, in terms of the quality of assets created and leakages in implementation, are also well-known. The government has taken note of these and has promised better monitoring and setting of quality standards for work outcomes. While this is welcome, there needs to be a better focus on timely wage payments and demand for work under the scheme.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/positive-expansion/article7330094.ece
19,6,2015,Facing up to IS,"The >capture of the Syrian border town of Tal Abyad by Kurdish fighters from Islamic State this week deals a significant blow to the radical Sunni Salafi terrorist group. The action not only cut off a vital supply line for IS to its self-proclaimed capital of Raqqa, but also marked a stunning reversal of fortunes for the group which just last month >captured Ramadi in Iraq and >Palmyra in Syria. The People’s Protection Units (YPG), the armed wing of the Democratic Union Party that controls the Kurdish-populated areas on the Syrian side, was on the front lines against IS in Tal Abyad. Over the year, the YPG has been proved to be resilient in terms of its tactics and resolve in the fight against IS. It played a key role in rescuing thousands of Yazidis in Iraq from IS last year, and defeated the radical Islamists in Kobane near the Turkish border in January. With the capture of Tal Abyad, the YPG has emerged as a very potent anti-IS force. The YPG challenges the group both politically and militarily, which makes it a progressive alternative to the perverse world view of IS. Kurdish fighters of the YPG are social liberals whose commitment towards gender equality and secularism stand in sharp contrast with IS’s barbarism and misogyny. Ideally they should have been in the forefront of a united anti-IS campaign. But in reality the Syrian/Turkish Kurds are not getting the support they need in the battle.
This is mainly because of the Turkish approach towards the Kurds. The YPG is affiliated to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terror group by Turkey and the U.S. Ties between the YPG and the PKK have deepened since the start of the Syrian civil war, and Turkey fears any direct help to the YPG would eventually strengthen the hands of the PKK. But this approach has several flaws. First, IS is a bigger threat to Turkey than the secular PKK, which has been in a peace process with the government in Ankara for two years now. Second, a defeat of Kurdish militias by IS would trigger a humanitarian catastrophe, which would not only enhance the flow of refugees into Turkey but also make its borders strategically vulnerable. So it is in its best interest to move ahead with the peace process with the PKK and effect a rapprochement with the Kurds. The recent parliamentary elections in Turkey, in which the >pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic Party crossed the 10 per cent threshold to enter Parliament for the first time, set the political stage for such cordiality. Ankara has to seize the momentum to overhaul its approach to the Kurds. Such a move would not just help it end a three-decade-old civil war that featured the brutal persecution of the Kurds, but also infuse fresh energy into the Kurdish resistance to IS along the Syrian-Turkish border.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/facing-up-to-is/article7330096.ece
20,6,2015,The scourge of racism,"The >gun attack that killed nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, is a violent reminder that racism courses through America’s veins even 50 years after an unarmed civil rights activist was killed by an Alabama state trooper, an incident that led to the historic Selma to Montgomery marches. The target this time was a storied African-American church and the victims included a state senator. The > arrested suspect, Dylann Storm Roof, 21, apparently wanted to ignite a “civil war”. The incident should be seen in the >backdrop of a >rising trend of crimes in the U.S. against African-Americans, involving both >persons in authority and members of the public. Charleston’s victims are simply the latest in a long list from recent years. They include >Walter Scott, who was shot from behind by a police officer on April 4 in North Charleston; >Michael Brown, shot by the police in Ferguson in August last year; Eric Garner, who died in New York in July 2014 after the police got him in a chokehold, and >Trayvon Martin, shot in Florida by a neighbourhood watch volunteer in 2012. The election of Barack Obama as the first black President of the country in 2008 had raised hopes about the dawn of a post-racial era. But African-Americans are still being frequently targeted.
>Racism is not history. Racialisation, making presumptions about people based on their identities from the perspective of White supremacy, is a continuing process that feeds people like the attacker in Charleston. The >American polity, which claims to cherish freedom and fairness, should have addressed this >societal flaw long ago. Instead, the political activism of the conservative right in the U.S. is deepening the flaw. It may not be a coincidence that what the shooter at Charleston told his victims — ‘you are taking over our country’— sounded much like the Tea Party slogan, ‘Take back our country’, which emerged as a rallying cry among the conservatives after Mr. Obama became President. To be sure, the U.S. is not the only country that has racism. What makes it more lethal here are >the country’s gun laws. The Obama administration’s attempts to bring in stricter gun laws have failed in Congress despite a number of mass shooting incidents in recent years. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Obama has now renewed his calls for stricter gun laws. It may be ironical that “the policeman of the world”, which invaded two nations after the September 11, 2001 attacks and sent drones to several others presumably to keep Americans “safe” from terrorists, is seen to be clueless on how to deal with home-grown terrorism. Racism and guns are the twin pathological failures of the American system. It has to tackle urgently these challenges, politically and legally. Else, no force would be able to halt the decay of moral fabric in the country.

20,6,2015,Why is the PM silent?,"The >stubborn silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and of national leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party over the involvement of Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje in the >unfolding Lalit Modi saga is a revelation in itself. That the >actions of Ms. Raje in support of Lalit Modi and the murky business dealings of her son Dushyant Singh are beyond what is politically defensible, is obvious. What is equally clear is that inner-party rivalries are at work and that party president Amit Shah and Prime Minister Modi appear to be watching Ms. Raje’s descent from public grace more as spectators than as custodians of political ethics. For persons holding high office, silence becomes ominous when it has the effect of whittling down the personal and moral authority of the ruling party. The allegations concerning the Rajasthan Chief Minister are indeed serious. The longer the Modi-Shah team takes to respond to the charges against one of their own Chief Ministers, the stronger would be the suspicion that they have something to hide. If Ms. Raje’s actions cannot be condoned, the Prime Minister and Mr. Shah must say so, and the BJP must take steps to have her removed as Chief Minister. If they have explanations in >defence of the business deals and political links of Ms. Raje’s son with Lalit Modi, they must place them in the public domain. To not take either of these courses but maintain a mystifying silence, will be to make a mockery of the offices they hold. If the misconduct of Ms. Raje was of a higher order than the impropriety committed by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, whom the BJP has supported emphatically over the past few days, the >Prime Minister must say so, and not wait for the controversy to come to a head. Silence and patience might have worked if this was a storm that would have blown over, and not a snowballing crisis.
Ms. Raje’s role has come to light only because the former Indian Premier League commissioner decided to flaunt his political connections in India in a bid to portray himself as a victim of vendetta under the erstwhile United Progressive Alliance regime. It is now up to the Modi government to demonstrate that it will not fall for this ploy as far as the investigations against Lalit Modi relating to alleged violations of tax and foreign exchange laws are concerned.

A >much-belated appeal is likely to be filed soon in the Supreme Court against a Delhi High Court verdict quashing the revocation of his passport.

22,6,2015,Give the IIMs their freedom,"There is an irony here that is hard to miss. The three oldest Indian Institutes of Management — IIM Calcutta, IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Bangalore — were established many years before India embraced the market economy model. With recommendations that came from the Planning Commission and working in a socialist framework, they have functioned autonomously to evolve best management practices and, with some help from America, today figure among India’s best-known global brands. Over the years they have benefited from the autonomy granted to them, which has enabled them to work independently in deciding what is best for them. In the true sense of the term, the IIMs have essentially been market-oriented institutions. The government that is now at the helm has an avowedly pro-market disposition too, and has in the recent past cut budgetary support for many welfare measures. The real objective of seeking to impose controls on the management institutes — of which there are 13 today — has therefore perplexed observers. To be fair, the NDA government is not to be blamed entirely. The Congress-led UPA, under Minister Kapil Sibal, set the process going. A committee that he appointed was accused of pursuing the objective of out-and-out privatisation of the IIMs. The Ministry of Human Resource Development under Smriti Irani is now seeking to regulate them by means of the Indian Institutes of Management Bill, 2015, in the text of which the word ‘regulate’ recurs with regularity. The Bill is now in the public realm for comments and will of course pass through Parliament. There is reason to believe that the special status enjoyed by the institutes is being sought to be diluted by bringing in other business schools also within the ambit of the Bill. That is not to say the Bill is without any positive aspects. It promises to meet a long-pending demand to convert diplomas awarded by the IIMs into degrees.
But the real question is whether government control would help make these institutes centres of excellence. Public-funded institutes in India figure nowhere in the top 100 global ranking index. The Indian Institutes of Technology have functioned autonomously in deciding their own curriculum, yet evidently the government is seeking to interfere in their functioning. In the case of the IIMs Bill, it is not clear to what extent the government intends to meddle with the academic structure. What is evident is that major decisions can be taken only with prior government approval. Also, determining the fee structure, a contentious issue in the past, will be subject to governmental nod. The government ought to tread carefully here. It would be appropriate to take the IIMs along while giving final shape to the Bill, which has the potential to alter their structure.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/give-the-iims-their-freedom/article7339509.ece
22,6,2015,Hong Kong needs balance,"The decision of Hong Kong’s lawmakers last week to vote down a proposal put forth by Beijing to reform the city’s electoral system was hardly a surprise. The plan, which would give Hong Kong’s voters the right to directly elect their Chief Executive (CE) but from a list of pre-approved candidates, triggered large-scale protests last year when it was announced. Opponents say it is just another means for Beijing to retain control. Beijing’s explanation is that it is only doing what it promised to do at the time of Hong Kong’s transition from being a British colony to a special administrative region of China. Under the Hong Kong Basic Law, adopted by China in 1990, the CE would be elected by universal suffrage in 2017; but a committee would supervise the nominations. Hong Kong had been a British colony for over 150 years till it was handed over in 1997. All those years it was ruled by governors appointed by London. When the British withdrew, Beijing offered a semblance of democracy to Hong Kong under the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ principle. In contrast to the British-style appointment of governors, the city’s CE is now elected by a 1,200-member committee of Hong Kong’s elite.
Those who support Beijing’s latest reform plan say it is a step in the right direction in Hong Kong’s evolving democracy, giving the people a chance to vote while not undermining Beijing’s authority. But most politicians in the Legislative Council don’t seem convinced by this argument. They want an election process that is completely free of Beijing’s involvement. This position raises three questions. First, while the argument for full democracy that includes open nomination of candidates for the post of CE could appear to be politically correct, does it have the support of the Basic Law that the Chinese government says it is bound by? Second, is it logical to believe that Beijing would agree to a government that is hostile to it being elected in Hong Kong? And, is it possible in practical terms for Hong Kong to live in perpetual hostility with Beijing, which has grown into an economic and geopolitical powerhouse in the past three decades? Hong Kong’s dissenting politicians should show pragmatism in dealing with this situation. On the other hand, China’s decision that it would go ahead with the reform plan despite the vote is imprudent. It cannot possibly overhaul the city’s electoral system without taking its people along; Beijing needs to avoid fractious outcomes given the city’s dominant mood. There are objective conditions for both sides to give up their intransigent positions and make a deal that would be in the best interests of the financial and commercial hub that is Hong Kong.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/hong-kong-needs-balance/article7339510.ece
23,6,2015,A question of credentials,"While the Bharatiya Janata Party government has, on the one hand, been striving to pursue a growth- and development-oriented agenda with a firm emphasis on the economic and foreign policy fronts, on the other hand the question has come up too often whether it is meanwhile systematically seeking to use the Ministries related to culture, information, education and human resources to push itself away from values promoting excellence and expertise when it comes to certain key appointments. This is the only possible explanation for the choice of those with uncertain credentials for some important institutional appointments. In the latest instance, the choice of >Gajendra Chauhan for the post of chairman of the governing council of the Film and Television Institute of India, and other members of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to be members of the FTII Society, has raised the hackles of students of the institute and members of the larger cinema fraternity. Mr. Chauhan is better known for his portrayal of the character of Yudhisthira in the popular television serial Mahabharata in the 1980s. His filmography includes a string of films of a certain kind, and there is little in his repertoire that qualifies him to chair a premier institution imparting quality cinematic training. It is clear that the choice made by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is based on his leanings. He is a BJP member, and wears his affiliation on his sleeve.
Of course, the BJP is not alone when it comes to injecting political bias into the process of selecting persons for such posts, but the present government seems rather brazen compared to its predecessors in ignoring qualifications or merit in making appointments. The Ministry >recently appointed a number of Sangh Parivar and BJP affiliates to the Central Board of Film Certification panel, seemingly with hardly a thought for credentials, eminence or qualifications. The new chairperson of the CBFC, for example, is someone who had directed run-of-the-mill films in the past. The Human Resource Development Ministry recently appointed a historian with barely any peer-reviewed work in the field, to the post of chairperson of the Indian Council of Historical Research, >Y. Sudershan Rao. To boot, he holds controversial views that conflate mythological elements with history. The BJP’s victory in 2014 was predicated on its promise of overhauling governance to achieve economic growth and development. It is impossible to imagine that the mandate was for the fulfilment of any kind of self-serving agenda or sharing of the spoils. The government should not allow itself to veer away from the pursuit of excellence and put in peril the integrity of its institutions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-question-of-credentials/article7342985.ece
23,6,2015,Dance of death,"The smell of death continues to hang over the Laxmi Nagar slum in Malvani in Mumbai’s western suburbs. The first reports of >deaths from spurious liquor came in last week, and over the next four days the toll has crossed 100, making it Maharashtra’s worst such tragedy. In 2004, the death toll in a similar tragedy went up to 87. The use of methanol, the highly toxic alcohol, is once again the factor in these deaths. The human scale of the tragedy is shocking. It has killed the chief bread-winners, widowed several women, some as young as 18, and orphaned small children who have no means to survive. Mainkaini Swami alias Akka, the >alleged mastermind, runs a bootlegging network, and is on the run. Two of her associates were arrested, but Akka remains elusive. She was arrested five times in the past, but has continued to run the network right under the nose of law enforcement agencies. It is tragic that mass deaths among the poor due to >illicit liquor consumption is still prevalent. Since 2001, illicit hooch has killed over 700 people across India in 18 recorded incidents. The biggest such tragedy, which killed 180 people in May 2008, was in >Karnataka. Then, 170 people were killed in >West Bengal in December 2011.
The latest tragedy has been an embarrassment to the BJP-Shiv Sena government, and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will in all probability now clamp down on illicit liquor units across the State. After the 2004 tragedy the Congress-NCP government had made Section 65 of the Bombay Prohibition Act a non-bailable provision with the maximum punishment ranging from six months to three years. However, excise and police officials say bootleggers like Akka manage to get bail and return to the business. The government is now considering the application of more stringent laws such as the Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Slumlords, Bootleggers, Drug Offenders and Dangerous Persons Act, 1981, or even the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) which will make bail a difficult proposition. The government has received many representations, especially from women, to ban liquor in temple towns such as Pandharpur, and Tuljapur, Nagpur and Yavatmal, In January the government declared >Chandrapur “liquor-free”, making it the third “dry” district after Gadchiroli, and Wardha, where Mahatma Gandhi’s Sevagram ashram is located. But, in Gadchiroli and Wardha districts, in the last four years the Excise Department has lodged some 2,000 cases and seized illicit alcohol worth over Rs.2,000 crore. So for now, effective police action combined with stringent laws remains the only way to stop this dance of death.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dance-of-death/article7342986.ece
24,6,2015,Going the e-payment way,"The government’s proposal to >incentivise electronic transactions in preference to cash dealings so as to curb black money is one of the most complete attempts made till now to achieve that end — although it is not entirely a new idea. Earlier attempts, such as the UPA government’s Banking Cash Transaction Tax, sought to address the issue only at the bank level, ignoring the actual users of cash — the merchants and the public. That tax, introduced in 2005 by then Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, stipulated a charge of 0.1 per cent on cash withdrawals above Rs. 10,000. However, it was messy: the somewhat arbitrary move that was also poorly implemented, was repealed in 2009. This government’s new proposal takes a more holistic approach to the cash economy, and as such is more likely to work. In a draft proposal now open for public comments, the government suggests income tax benefits for individuals who incur a certain proportion of their expenditure through electronic means, while proposing a nominal handling charge on cash transactions above a specified level. The removal of the additional charge often levied on electronic transactions should come with this. As for merchants, the government proposes a tax rebate to those among them who handle, say, 50 per cent of their transactions electronically, and a small reduction in value added tax on the items involved. At the moment the system discriminates against electronic transactions. Banks and service providers levy extra charges on them, while cash transactions are implicitly subsidised by banks, which do not factor in the cost of teller services. Paper money comes with hidden overheads: the cost of printing and providing additional security features, and the price of counterfeit money.
Cash transactions and black money are directly linked, since a cash trail is nearly impossible to track. As such, electronic transactions and the ease of audit they afford should make the government’s job much easier in terms of curbing illegal transactions. India is a massively cash-dependent economy, with its cash-to-GDP ratio being around 13 per cent as compared to a global average of 2.5 to 8 per cent. Little wonder, then, that some experts estimate the size of India’s black economy to be at least half the size of the white economy. Commendably, this government seems to be taking a systematic view in working towards minimising cash-based transactions. At the heart of it, even the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana is aimed at providing direct, cashless subsidies to those who need them. There are still more steps that could be taken, such as encouraging major cash-users, traders with large public dealings for example, to move on to electronic payment modes. But this proposal is undoubtedly a good beginning.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/going-the-epayment-way/article7347257.ece
24,6,2015,The Taliban challenge,"Monday’s >attack on the Afghan Parliament building demonstrated the Taliban’s unshaken capability to strike at even the most fortified of complexes in Kabul. This fits into its strategy of staging high-profile assaults aimed at gaining asymmetric superiority in the Afghan war. In the past they had attacked the Presidential Palace, the U.S. and Indian embassies and the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul. The Parliament attack coincided with a vote in the House to endorse a new Defence Minister. The Taliban have been on the offensive since most of the foreign troops, some 14,000 of them from 40 countries at the peak of war, withdrew late last year. The Taliban’s actions have often been exposing the vulnerabilities of Afghanistan’s fledgling army. If the Taliban are allowed to return to power, it would be catastrophic for the Afghan people, particularly for millions of its women who were deprived of even basic human rights under its erstwhile regime. Given the tribal politics and lawlessness in Afghanistan’s rural areas, and the Taliban’s geopolitical relevance in the extremely complex South and Central Asian theatre, it will prove difficult for any anti-Taliban strategy to gain immediate traction. If the past 14 years of war in Afghanistan offers any definite lessons to the actors involved, it is that insurgency cannot be defeated only by military means. One of the grave mistakes the American-led troops committed was their excessive emphasis on a military solution, while reconstruction and creation of infrastructure, and building of institutions, were pushed to the back seat.
President Ashraf Ghani, >who took power in September 2014, had promised to fix the vital issues. But his performance has not been impressive either. That Afghanistan, which has been at war for years, does not have a Defence Minister for the last nine months, itself speaks volumes about the state of its political affairs. What Afghanistan needs is a multi-pronged strategy, supported by the international community, focussing on nation-building and security challenges as well as regional diplomacy. First, the government has to establish itself as a credible, service-delivering and security-providing institution to gain the trust of its people. It should focus on taking the social ground away from the Taliban, at the same time bolstering its own security resources. The international community has an obligation to help this strategy, both economically and diplomatically. It is worth noting that after the Soviets retreated from Afghanistan in 1989, it took just three years for the Mohammad Najibullah regime to fall, plunging the country into a deadly civil war from which the Taliban rose to power. It is the responsibility of both Kabul and its backers abroad to make sure history doesn’t repeat here.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-taliban-challenge/article7347258.ece
25,6,2015,Looking to the Supreme Court,"The Special Leave Petition >filed by the Karnataka government in the Supreme Court against the acquittal of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa is not just the appeal of an aggrieved party on merits. It is also a commentary on the quality of the >High Court verdict in the ‘disproportionate assets’ case. Apart from the undoubted public interest in the outcome of a case that will decide the fortunes of a prominent political leader, the appeal has brought the focus on how exactly courts deal with politically sensitive cases. The crux of the Karnataka government’s contention is this: if the >trial verdict of Special Judge John Michael D’Cunha was noted for its elaborate evaluation of the evidence and the reasoning behind his conclusions, the appellate judge, Justice C.R. Kumaraswamy’s order overturning it is ‘cryptic,’ ‘lacking in reasoning’ and ‘illogical’. Especially requiring a second look are the High Court’s reliance on the >‘less-than-10-per-cent’ theory that allows a public servant to hold unexplained assets up to 10 per cent in excess of what she can account for. The points of divergence between the trial court verdict and the High Court’s judgment are now well-known. The divergence is of such magnitude that every reasonable person would favour an authoritative pronouncement from the highest court on these aspects of the case. Karnataka has sought to focus on what many see as flaws in the High Court order, not least in importance being some >glaring mathematical errors.
It cannot be forgotten that when a public servant is charged with possessing assets disproportionate to her known sources of income and which she is unable to explain satisfactorily, the court must strictly go by the established quantum of wealth possessed, the expenditure incurred during a given period in office and the income known to have been received in the same period. This basically requires flawless computation and, where precise figures are unavailable, an objective means to evaluate the value of the assets. Any failure in making a precise computation will naturally result in a miscarriage of justice. By using different means, the prosecution, the defence and the two courts have so far arrived at different figures on income, expenditure and the consequent quantum of ‘disproportionate assets’. This fact also contributes to the need for a full re-examination. As for the political context, the appeal has been filed at a time when Ms. Jayalalithaa is contesting a by-election that will send her back to the Legislative Assembly. Karnataka has sought interim relief by way of a stay of the High Court judgment; if granted, this may have the effect of restoring Ms. Jayalalithaa’s disqualification from being a legislator. The stage is set for the last round of this 18-year-long legal battle. Ordinary citizens look to the Supreme Court for an authoritative pronouncement on this crucial matter of defining the dos and don’ts for persons in high public office.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/looking-to-the-supreme-court/article7350790.ece
25,6,2015,Not a mouthpiece,"In the pecking order, Rajya Sabha TV nowhere figures in the TRP ratings. But if sobriety, objectivity and fairness count, sans the hyperventilation that passes for news these days, perhaps RSTV would be a shoo-in for the top slot. In many ways, the channel reflects the House of Elders. The detailed discussions on government policies, besides the telecast of Rajya Sabha proceedings on prime time, are its trademark. Yet, at one stroke the short-lived Twitter furore that ensued over its inadequate coverage of the celebration of International Yoga Day led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, managed not only to stoke pent-up communal feelings and ideological hatred against the Congress-appointed Vice-President Hamid Ansari who happens to be a Muslim, but also the channel he heads. The attack was on both. Fortunately, and this can happen only on >Twitter, corrective measures soon followed and the Vice-President received >overwhelming support. This, as the BJP sought to play down tweets from its national vice-president as unfortunate. The channel was dubbed leftist as opposed to, one presumes, right-wing channels. Both entertainment and news channels were asked by the government to make the International Yoga Day a success in terms of coverage, and they duly complied. >Rajya Sabha TV exercised its choice to buck the trend and refrained from going overboard. Having said that, it would not be entirely correct to blame the BJP for criticising RSTV. The channel has received its share of brickbats from the Congress-led UPA as well. At the height of the 2G scam and the furore over crony capitalism that plagued the UPA, RSTV kept its head and went about conducting discussions, inviting members of the ruling party as also those from the Opposition BJP.
As the framers of the Constitution envisaged the separation of powers among the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary, the channels run by Parliament are accountable to Parliament and its members, not to the government of the day. Neither are they its mouthpieces. Yet, from time to time organs of the government encroach on one another’s domain. So it is here; the government thinks the channel must function as its mouthpiece. RSTV was in the news when allegations of overspending were hurled at it. A section of the media alleged that Rs.1,700 crore was spent on it in a period of four years, prompting some members to contemplate a privilege motion against the media outlets concerned. Finally, if the channel is criticised by the party in power, it can mean only one thing: the channel is not under its control. And it is the taxpayer’s money well-spent.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/not-a-mouthpiece/article7350791.ece
26,6,2015,Blocking justice,"India’s long-running quest for justice for victims of the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai has been stymied by lack of cooperation from Pakistan in bringing the accused to book. Now it has received another blow. This time it comes from the Chinese decision >to block India’s request in the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee seeking a clarification from Pakistan on the release of Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi. India has >rightly contended that the freeing of the Lashkar-e-Taiba commander violates UN Resolution 1267 that deals with designated entities and individuals with links to al-Qaeda and that has listed Lakhvi since December 10, 2008. The Chinese action is in contrast to broad support from countries such as the U.S. in asking Pakistan to rearrest Lakhvi. The U.S. State Department has released a report indicting Pakistan for not acting against the LeT. The >Chinese decision is unfortunate, and belies its own stated commitment to fight terror, as reiterated in its joint statement with India following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to China in May. This is also in line with earlier Chinese actions blocking or delaying India’s attempts at the UN to file separate proposals on Pakistan-based terrorists. China, which has itself faced terror attacks in Xinjiang province, should exert pressure on its “all-weather” friend to take action against sources of terror rather than buying Pakistan’s inconsistent reasoning that it is also a victim of terrorism. The twin-track, contradictory policy of the Pakistan establishment, especially its security wing, towards terror should not be lost on China. After all, Islamabad is at loggerheads with forces such as the Tehreek-e-Taliban, while maintaining a close relationship with some anti-India and anti-Afghanistan forces.
India has done the right thing in raising the Lakhvi issue in a multilateral forum, as it has done thus far in seeking justice for 26/11. A thorough case was built up against the apprehended gunman Ajmal Kasab, leading to his conviction. India sought cooperation from U.S. and Pakistan while diligently compiling proof of the involvement of the conspirators, including links in Pakistan’s security establishment. With the U.S. supporting India’s position and with the well-established global antipathy for terrorism, the use of multilateral institutions to raise concerns is warranted — although India in the past has generally avoided seeking the aegis of the UN to resolve bilateral issues. Pakistan will not be able to continue its lackadaisical response towards Indian concerns about the conspirators who are on its soil, provided there is sufficient international pressure. It is to be hoped that the External Affairs Ministry’s response to the Chinese action, making it clear that it would raise the issue at the highest levels of that government, would bear fruit. Terrorism is, after all, well-recognised by the U.S. and China as a global challenge.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/blocking-justice/article7354675.ece
26,6,2015,Death of a journalist,"The >death of Shahjahanpur-based freelance journalist Jagendra Singh of burn injuries earlier this month, continues to raise questions. And, instead of inspiring confidence that it would ensure a fair and impartial probe into the death, the Akhilesh Yadav government is focussing its energies on limiting the political damage from the allegations of the involvement of State Minister >Ram Murti Verma in the case. First, the government was slow to act after footage emerged of a seriously injured Jagendra Singh saying the Minister and his “goons” could have beaten him up instead of burning him. Next, the government offered a > financial compensation of Rs.30 lakh, and promised jobs to his two sons. Now, efforts seem to be under way to treat the death as a case of self-immolation. A >forensic report opened up the possibility of attempted suicide, on the ground that the right-handed Jagendra Singh had suffered more wounds on his left side than on his right side. For the police to give credence to such a possibility ignoring his dying declaration would be a travesty of justice. Whether or not the Minister or his associates were directly connected with the death will have to be a matter for further investigation, but there is no doubt that the journalist was attempting to expose the reported links of the Minister to illegal mining activities, with the aid of posts on the social networking site Facebook, and through litigation. Any investigation would necessarily have to look into these aspects.
Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav might be tempted to see his Samajwadi Party and the government as victims of trial by media, but his own actions have done little to help matters. Instead of being seen to be firmly on the side of the victim, the government came through as being bent on protecting the Minister. The proper course would have been to drop him from the Cabinet till the completion of the investigation. The offer of compensation was clearly a political move, after days of bad publicity and a dharna by the victim’s family members. If the leaked preliminary forensic report is any indication, the promised impartial probe into Jagendra Singh’s death is unlikely to happen. Despite the filing of a >first information report naming the Minister, the police are yet to act against him. Jagendra Singh’s death is a reminder of the perils that confront investigative journalists, especially those who take on the rich and the powerful. If the Uttar Pradesh government fails to act decisively in this case, the suspicion that it has a lot to hide will strengthen. It will also adversely affect freedom of expression. Issues far greater than the reputation of the Akhilesh Yadav government are at stake in this case.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/death-of-a-journalist/article7354676.ece
27,6,2015,"Needed, a new urban vision","Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched his flagship >Smart Cities Mission proclaiming that governmental intervention in planning the cities would be minimal. He referred to a “bottom-up approach”, but did not emphasise who exactly would benefit from the cities. The approach suggests that India is breaking away from its Anglo-European architectural tradition, promoted by Jawaharlal Nehru in the 1960s with the projection of Chandigarh as a template for urban planners. Nehru’s aim was to create mixed-income cities with easy access to community infrastructure and to institutions such as the judiciary, the legislature and the executive. But Mr. Modi’s urban-planning approach contradicts that view and largely resonates with American-style urbanism. The government is putting the spotlight on smart cities and allowing the business community to lead the development. Let us take an example in the U.S. to figure out who could benefit from the new urban plans in India. In New York City, most of the commercial and residential buildings from uptown to downtown Manhattan are inhabited by the rich who can afford the huge rents. They have installed biometric security systems to keep the ‘unwanted people’ — that is, the poor — at bay. The city government has largely outsourced the public services to private companies, which are replacing the labour force with mechanised technology. As a result, the job market has become saturated. The unskilled workforce is caught up in a low-wage job cycle.
Before pushing India on to a similar American path, Prime Minister Modi must step back and re-think whether his government should invest in smart cities, or rather empower the existing urban centres by means of policies that cater to poor and middle class Indians. For instance, at present almost every Indian city faces sanitation issues due to the absence or inadequacy of drainage networks. The migration of people from rural areas to the urban peripheries continues at a rapid pace, resulting in the mushrooming of slums and unauthorised colonies. According to Census 2011, some 65 million people live in slums. The government’s response to the issue in terms of planning to build affordable housing for them is short-sighted. Smart cities would simply institutionalise the disparity within the cities instead of filling the lacunae. The last decade of urbanisation did change the academic and policy consensus toward urban centres, but ignored the fringes of these centres where those from the poor and the lower-middle class who came in a large influx ended up. In Delhi, the government passed on powers to residents’ welfare associations, which now decide on the choice of basic civic matters — and they always give preference to their own gated communities. Mr. Modi must take a forward-looking stance when it comes to developing urban India. Otherwise, the glossy vision of building smart cities could end up triggering a process of social apartheid.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/needed-a-new-urban-vision/article7358629.ece
27,6,2015,The promise of freight corridors,"The much-delayed project to build the ambitious eastern and western dedicated freight corridors has received a boost with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs >approving a revised cost estimate for it. At Rs.81,459 crore, the figure is more than double the originally estimated Rs.28,181 crore. The 1,839-km-long eastern corridor will connect Ludhiana in Punjab with Dankuni in West Bengal. It will have two components, a double-track section and a single-track segment, both electrified. It will cut across six States. The eastern corridor will cater to traffic streams including coal, finished steel, cement and fertilizer. The western corridor will cover nearly 1,500 km, connecting the Jawaharlal Nehru Port near Mumbai with Dadri, and passing through States such as Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra. A substantial portion of the revised cost will be met by way of debt from multilateral institutions such as the Japan International Cooperation Agency and the World Bank. The equity requirement of the Railways will be around Rs.23,796 crore. Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Ltd., the special purpose vehicle set up by the Railways to implement the project, is keen to complete it by 2017-18. Once the twin-corridor system is in place, it will transform the very profile of the Railways. A host of positive outcomes, such as reduction in transportation costs and stepped-up commercial activity, benefiting a range of core industries, could flow from it. This could in turn have a multiplier effect on the economy.
Poor infrastructure has been a principal worry for Indian industry. More often than not, this has affected its ability to be efficient providers of goods and services. End-consumers have been forced to pay for the collective inefficiency. The twin-corridor project was conceived in 2005 and > was approved by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government in 2008. The huge cost overruns owing to the time lapse tell their own tale, and reflect the massive challenge facing policy-planners in pushing through a project of this size and magnitude that has inter-State implications. From a slow decision-making process to roadblocks to land acquisition, there are problems aplenty in the way ahead for the project. No doubt, land acquisition is turning out to be a touchy political issue. Prevarication on the decision-making front will hurt the viability of even soundly conceived projects. The Narendra Modi-led government would do well to ensure that the twin-corridor project goes through without any further delay. The key to doing so will lie also in taking along the States concerned.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-promise-of-freight-corridors/article7358630.ece
29,6,2015,Battling perceptions,"In a battle of perceptions, to concede an inch is to lose several feet. After having won the 2014 Lok Sabha election >on an anti-corruption platform, relying heavily on a carefully crafted clean image of himself, Prime Minister Narendra Modi cannot afford to now be seen as leading a party or government of corrupt individuals. But, with the former chairman and commissioner of the Indian Premier League, Lalit Modi, >embarrassing his colleagues in government and Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje in a series of revelations, all that Prime Minister Modi seems to be doing is to wait silently in the hope that the noise would die down. Acting decisively against Ms. Raje, as propriety demanded, would have opened up several fronts. For one, Ms. Raje is enormously popular within the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Rajasthan unit and >commands the support of a majority of the party’s members in the Assembly. Dislodging her would result in the national leadership, Mr. Modi and party president Amit Shah in particular, having to deal with a revolt in the State unit. Ms. Raje has in the past defied the national leadership, thwarting attempts to project alternative leaders at the State level. It would be unrealistic to expect her to go down without a fight. Secondly, to admit that the BJP in its avatar under Mr. Modi is no different from the BJP of old would be to admit that he has made no difference to it since he worked himself onto the national stage. If the BJP today comes across a lot like the Congress on an issue like corruption, then Mr. Modi would have to be deemed a failure. Thus, to even recognise that there is corruption in its ranks is for the BJP an issue of its very raison d’être.
Of course, one reason Ms. Raje remains powerful in Rajasthan is that a year after he assumed office Prime Minister Modi does not quite retain his national appeal. While there is no challenge to his authority at the Centre, regional satraps such as Ms. Raje and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan do not believe they owe him anything in their political careers. But inaction is not an option for the BJP at the national level in l’affaire Lalit Modi. If denial remains the default response, sooner or later the party would be seen as condoning corruption. Allowing Ms. Raje to continue could have long-term effects on its credibility and its anti-corruption stance. As for Ms. Raje, the >financial dealings of her son Dushyant Singh with Lalit Modi, and an affidavit she filed in favour of the former IPL commissioner, raise serious issues. Her continuance as Chief Minister without these issues being addressed quickly would only fuel the agitations that the Opposition parties have launched, and cramp the government’s functioning. In the long run, that would be disastrous for both Ms. Raje and the BJP.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lalitgate-need-for-the-bjp-to-battle-perception/article7364284.ece
29,6,2015,Disquiet over a claim,"The >claim made by Rohini Salian, the Special Public Prosecutor appearing in the case relating to the 2008 Malegaon blasts being investigated by the National Investigation Agency, that she was told by the NIA after the NDA government came to power last year to go slow on it, is a shocking one. While the NIA has denied this and has also said it was incorrect to suggest that it had bypassed Ms. Salian as prosecutor in the case, that is yet to go to the trial court, there is something distressing about this episode. The Malegaon blasts in Maharashtra were pinned on Muslim extremists, until diligent work by the Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad led by Hemant Karkare identified the >hand of Hindu extremists, many of whom were alleged to have carried out blasts such as in the Mecca Masjid in Hyderabad, the Samjhauta Express and Ajmer Sharif, all in 2007; in Modasa in Gujarat in 2008, and in Malegaon earlier in 2006. The investigation led by Karkare — who was killed later in 2008 during the terror attacks in Mumbai — led to the filing of a comprehensive charge sheet. This document and other police reports contained transcripts of secret meetings among extremists and revealed the chilling agenda of Hindu right-wing fringe groups, which allegedly sought to emulate jihadi terrorism and foment trouble by violently targeting people from the minority community and use that opportunity to gain political power. The NIA took over the investigation from the ATS, and it was tasked with looking into the broader scheme of actions by Hindu extremist groups. Since 2011, however, the case has been held up in courts, and only in April 2015 did the NIA initiate investigations following a go-ahead from the Supreme Court for the case to be heard by a new special trial court. The NIA is yet to file a fresh charge sheet.
Ms. Salian’s statement indeed raises questions about possible interference in the cases since the NDA government came to power, and the Supreme Court ought to take note of this. After all, only after the Supreme Court >intervened and directed investigations into various cases relating to the 2002 Gujarat riots and set up special courts, did the judicial process in those cases settle on a proper track. It is imperative that the sense of disquiet over any skewed justice when it comes to cases related to extremists from the majority community as opposed to those from the minority communities is dispelled. This is especially so with respect to Maharashtra, where the recommendations of the Justice B.N. Srikrishna Commission that investigated the Mumbai riots of 1992-1993 remained unheeded, and where the guilty were never brought to book.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/disquiet-over-spp-rohini-salians-claim-on-2008-malegaon-blasts-probe/article7364285.ece
30,6,2015,The woes of Greece,"As >financial markets worldwide tumbled over concerns that Greece would default on its debt to the troika comprising the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the people of Greece were being presented with a Hobson’s choice by its government led by the leftist party platform, Syriza. In the midst of intense negotiations with representatives of the troika over rolling over debt payments, the Syriza government sought to extend the deadline for payments in order to allow it to put the conditionalities of the troika for a bailout extension >to a referendum vote. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has denied that this referendum, scheduled for July 5, is on whether or not to continue within the eurozone; he says it is only on the acceptance of the troika’s demands. But with the troika unrelenting on the June 30 deadline for repayment of debts to the IMF, and Greece being in no position to pay, the referendum could more or less be on remaining in the eurozone. This presents a >difficult choice for the people of Greece. After all, the Syriza was voted to power in January 2015 precisely on the promise of halting the programme of austerity imposed by creditors that has resulted in a drastic contraction of Greece’s economy and increase in unemployment. Yet, the mandate was also for negotiations to remain within the eurozone as Greek voters had realised that the Grexit would mean too much pain (at least in the near term) due to capital flight, a run on the banks and other troubles in returning to the drachma as currency.
Over the past five months, Syriza representatives, true to their mandate, have sought to alter Greece’s terms of engagement with its creditors, seeking debt relief that would allow fiscal expansionary policies to spur the economy. Yet, the troika’s response has been to stonewall the proposals and instead push Greece to further the austerity measures it has pursued following the first major bailout in 2010 and >another in 2012. The troika’s reasoning is simple: tolerating a Greek default would amount to sending signals to other debtor-nations about similar leniency. Instead, the troika has merely offered a five-month extension of Greece’s bailout programme with fresh funds but with persisting austerity conditions. With barely a concession to the Greek position, there remains a wide gap between the Greek people’s expectations and the EU recommendations. With Greece already having to impose capital controls and bank holidays to avoid further capital flight — measures that were supposed to be taken in the event of an exit from the EU — it begs the question whether the Grexit is inevitable.

30,6,2015,Opening up legal services,"The government’s >proposal to open up the legal services sector to foreign participation in a limited way may mark the end of India’s policy of barring international law firms from entering the country and of keeping domestic firms and lawyers insulated from the growing global market for trade in legal services. The government says it has both the Bar Council of India and the Society of Indian Law Firms (SILF) on board. The proposed entry of foreign firms will be limited to aspects other than litigation and to international commercial arbitration. The presence of overseas lawyers in forums of litigation is of course ruled out. It is unlikely that foreign firms will be interested in litigation work, which is by and large organised and regulated on national lines. Further, unless there is reciprocity with regard to recognition of legal qualifications among member-countries, it will not be possible for visiting legal professionals to overcome basic eligibility norms. Ever since the General Agreement on Trade in Services was adopted by member-countries of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the potential for legal professionals to offer services outside their national jurisdiction has expanded exponentially. Apart from drafting of agreements and contracts and rendering general advice to overseas clients on domestic legal regimes and frameworks, advocates and law firms now play a big role in starting new businesses, mergers and acquisitions, advising on investments, complying with regulations and obtaining clearances.
At the same time, there has been disquiet in the legal fraternity about the possible adverse implications of the entry of foreign firms which, presumably, are better organised and have better resources to corner the legal services market. Some went to court and obtained favourable orders barring the entry of overseas players. The courts have so far said foreign firms cannot practise in India without adhering to the Advocates’ Act. However, the Madras High Court has allowed overseas professionals to fly in to offer advice to clients on international legal issues, and participate in international commercial arbitration. The matter is now in the Supreme Court, but if the government can carry the legal fraternity along on its proposals, India will be in a position to benefit from opening up the sector. However, all stakeholders must see to it that it does not have an adverse impact either on the cost of litigation or on the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people enrolled as advocates in the country. A key consideration would be whether India ought not to try and get a share in the estimated $20-billion global annual trade in legal services. The country now has better law schools and a vast pool of legal talent; there is no reason why it should not succeed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/opening-up-legal-services-to-foreign-participation/article7371566.ece
30,6,2015,A model for India,"It is rare that a decision made by the Supreme Court of one country gives cause for cheer across the world. The >U.S. Supreme Court’s momentous verdict allowing same-sex marriages across that country sparked celebrations among the LGBT community and expressions of support from others. Implicit in every such celebration or voice of support is the expectation that other societies too would follow suit, if not in recognising same-sex marriages, at least in ending open discrimination based on medieval prejudice. The community’s long battle for equal rights has reached its logical conclusion there. The court ruled that the bond of marriage cannot be limited to opposite-sex couples. From the time it upheld in 1986 a law that made homosexuality a criminal offence, to overturning the ruling in 2003, and now allowing same-sex marriages, the U.S. Supreme Court has made considerable progress in recognising the liberty of individuals with alternative sexual orientation and their right to equal treatment before the law. Instead of hiding behind traditional arguments to the effect that legal questions concerning personal relations such as marriage be best decided by elected bodies, the court has said that the ‘due process’ and ‘equal protection’ clauses in the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution are as available to the gay community as anyone else when it comes to marrying a person of his or her choice, including of the same gender.
It is inevitable that such a ruling occasions an evaluation of where India stands. Indian law on homosexuality continues to be retrograde. The >Supreme Court’s December 2013 judgment upholding Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which seeks to punish “carnal intercourse against the order of nature”, continues to hold the field. The pious observation by the two-judge Bench that it was up to Parliament to decide whether to retain, amend or delete the section has not been acted upon by the political leadership. The restraint that the court has shown in not striking down Section 377, and the reasoning that it should be left to the legislature to decide whether or not to decriminalise homosexuality, fell short of Indian judicial standards. There are several cogent arguments — including some that figure in the U.S. Supreme Court’s majority opinion — in favour of judicial intervention to uphold individual liberties. Now that the judicial opportunity has been lost, the legislature cannot shirk its responsibility any longer. It may seem unlikely that parties embroiled in electoral politics will risk antagonising conservative sections of society. However, progressive parties and liberal parliamentarians should come forward with amendments to delete or at least dilute Section 377. An outdated provision cannot be allowed to violate fundamental rights and offend human dignity by remaining on the statute book.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-us-supreme-court-legalising-same-sex-marriages-across-the-us/article7367786.ece
30,6,2015,Facing up to global troubles,"Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan has a certain stature in the global financial world. He had predicted the 2008 global financial meltdown much in advance: in 2005, during his tenure at the International Monetary Fund he wrote a research paper in which he warned of financial sector-induced turmoil. Since then, Dr. Rajan’s words and actions in his line of work are watched and read with more than a cursory interest. Not surprisingly, >his purported remark made at a London Business School programme last week on intimations of the Great Depression elicited wide reactions. The >RBI had to intervene with a clarification to put the Governor’s articulation in perspective and context. “What Governor Rajan did say, in his remarks, was that the policies followed by major central banks around the world were in danger of slipping into the kind of beggar-thy-neighbour strategies that were followed in the 1930s,” it clarified. For quite some time now, Dr. Rajan has been voicing his concerns over the ‘competitive monetary policy easing’ by central banks across the globe. According to him, the current non-system in international monetary policy is a ‘substantial source of risk’ to sustainable growth as well as the financial sector. Unconventional policies have the potential to trigger huge risks when they are terminated. He reckons that such policies will push the world economy towards ‘musical crises’. In an inter-connected world, actions in one place trigger consequences elsewhere. In such a situation, domestic policy-planners have to factor in this ‘outside influence’ in their strategies.
Indeed, Indian policy-planners find themselves in a predicament thanks to the continued monetary easing by some nations and the shrinkage in world trade. Given this ‘new normal’ kind of an environment, they will have to look at ways to protect the Indian economy from external vicissitudes. In this context, a fund-starved country like India will do well to focus on foreign direct investment rather than get unduly worried about foreign institutional investment, which will have its ebb and flow depending on the environment outside. A 75 basis-point reduction in the key repo rate made in three equal instalments this year by the RBI has not really helped spur investments. A combination of capacity overhang, slack demand and banks’ mounting non-performing assets has only compounded the problems. With everyone waiting for the other to act first, the onus is definitely on the political bosses to devise quick solutions to accelerate the economy. Perhaps, the prescription of the Depression-era economist John Maynard Keynes is relevant now. Indeed, a bit of a socialistic approach to spur demand is unavoidable.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/raghuram-rajans-great-depression-remark-and-facing-up-to-global-troubles/article7367785.ece
2,7,2015,Outcomes with a pattern,"Ruling parties have an inherent advantage in by-elections. With no possibility of bringing about a change of government, voters in geographically circumscribed constituencies have no incentive to offend those in power or to encourage those in the Opposition. The >results of the recent Assembly by-elections for six seats in five States were on expected lines. The surprises, if any, were limited to the margins of victory, and who came second. In Tamil Nadu, no one expected Chief Minister Jayalalithaa to lose in the R.K. Nagar constituency in Chennai. She was contesting for a seat in the current Assembly a second time, having forfeited her seat following her >conviction in the disproportionate assets case. Although the stakes were high for Ms. Jayalalithaa, the major Opposition parties did not field candidates against her. Only the Communist Party of India, with no significant support base in the constituency, >entered the fray. The record 88.43 per cent votes that she got was thus only a mild surprise. In Tripura, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) >won both the seats, and the surprise was the performance of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which finished second, ahead of the Congress. As in West Bengal, the BJP is rapidly expanding its base in Tripura. If in West Bengal it is the CPI(M) that is yielding ground to the BJP, in Tripura it is the Congress that is seeing erosion in its support base. However, in Kerala, another State with a strong Left presence, the BJP >failed to dislodge the CPI(M) from the second spot despite fielding former Union Minister O. Rajagopal. In Madhya Pradesh the BJP won the Garoth seat, but with a reduced margin. The Congress could do no more than claim this was a ‘moral defeat’ for the ruling party. But in Meghalaya, where it is in power, the party won the by-election in Chokpot.
If there is one running pattern in all these results, it is that the ruling party is always tough to beat. Over the last two decades and more, the Election Commission of India has done a lot to limit the advantages of incumbency in elections. The model code of conduct places restrictions on the government initiating welfare schemes and development projects in a constituency going to the polls. But voters know they would be rewarded later if they vote for the ruling party. However, there is no guarantee that the results in a by-election would hold in a general election. When voters sense an opportunity to throw out a ruling party in a general election, and not just embarrass it as in a by-election, they vote in a very different manner. While these by-elections are thus cause for some celebration for those in power in the respective States, they are by no means pointers to what could follow in a general election.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/2015-byelections-results-outcomes-with-a-pattern/article7375460.ece
2,7,2015,A new multilateral institution,"The >launch of the $100-billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, within two years of its conception, signals the arrival of a new multilateral institution on the world stage. It also represents a challenge to the older such institutions. Mooted by Chinese President Xi Jinping in October 2013, the AIIB took shape with 50 members, including Australia, India, Russia and the United Kingdom. The articles of agreement were initialled at a gathering in Beijing of representatives of the 57 founding-members. The remaining seven are likely to sign in by the end of the year. China will be the largest shareholder (at 30.34 per cent), followed by India (8.52 per cent) and Russia (6.66 per cent). Though one among the Asian giants, Japan has chosen to stay out of the Beijing-initiated AIIB. The Philippines, which has territorial issues with Beijing in the South China Sea, has held itself back from signing, for now. And Indonesia has sought to have the bank housed in Jakarta. These spell geopolitical roadblocks to the success of the China-led initiative, which in a way is meant to counter the purported bias among existing multilateral institutions, that are perceived to be driven largely by the diktats of the U.S. and Europe. Indeed, the AIIB is a culmination of China’s incessant articulation of the concerns of the emerging economies, which felt they were not being given an adequate say in institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Again, the AIIB is the consequence of the inability of these institutions to undergo change to suit changing times.
It is also essential to see the AIIB and >China’s ambitious plans for the ‘Belt and Road’ project as being complementary. The AIIB as envisaged by China is clearly meant to use its financial resources and surplus to invest in projects in the Asian neighbourhood, which is suffering from a massive infrastructure funding gap. The infrastructure projects in the neighbourhood, nevertheless, are a way of allowing Chinese companies (among others) to participate and invest in them at a time when there is a situation of industrial overcapacity. The participation of many countries from Europe and elsewhere in the AIIB attests to their understanding of the potential of the projects for which the investments could be used, especially the Belt and Road schemes. India’s participation in the AIIB, too, indicates that New Delhi is keen on a balancing act to suit its interests – to engage with the West and the dominant international finance order, at the same time exploring options with new financial institutions. This is a prudent strategy. Will the AIIB be different from the likes of the IMF and the World Bank? That will depend largely on how Beijing manages the cooperation game.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/asian-infrastructure-investment-bank-a-new-multilateral-institution/article7375461.ece
3,7,2015,Crime and compromise,"It is a matter of considerable satisfaction that within days of the Madras High Court >passing an indefensible order asking the perpetrator and the victim in a rape case to opt for mediation, the >Supreme Court has restated strongly that rape is an offence that does not brook any compromise. The latest ruling is a rebuke to appellate court judges who casually overturn convictions or reduce the prison terms of those found guilty of rape, often by citing claims that a compromise has been arrived at. With this ruling, the Supreme Court makes it amply clear that offers of marriage or forms of financial compromise cannot be applied in a rape case. It also denies the parents of a minor girl the right to arrive at a compromise with the rapist. By reiterating sharply that any thought of mediation in a rape case is “completely sans legal permissibility”, the court has gone a long way towards ensuring that the lower ranks of the judiciary have absolutely no reason to take recourse to such a “subterfuge”. The Supreme Court ruling was made in an appeal where the Madhya Pradesh High Court had converted a case of attempted rape on a seven-year-old girl into one of attempt to “outrage the modesty of a woman”, and had reduced the sentence from five years to the period spent by the convict in prison. A recent judgment from the Madras High Court that had allowed a convicted rapist to be freed on bail to work towards a mediated solution with the survivor >had shocked civil society and attracted severe criticism. The Supreme Court judgment is, thus, timely and essential.
A matter of graver concern, however, is the fact that the Supreme Court is so often being required to restate the basic principles of justice. It was only in 2013 that >it categorically ruled that there can be no compromise in a rape case. In several cases in the past, the apex court has deprecated the tendency of some judicial officers to take into account purported compromises and award lenient sentences on that basis. Also, when it comes to sentencing policy, it should be remembered that as part of the >amendments to criminal law made in 2013, a proviso in Section 376 of IPC (punishment for rape) that allowed judges to award lesser prison terms than what are set down, on ‘special grounds’, has been omitted. Judges are not allowed to consider offers of marriage, the passage of time, or the state of a woman being “happily married” as factors justifying a soft approach towards perpetrators of rape. That despite the Supreme Court’s repeated directions not all lower courts see the irreparable harm done to rape survivors by subjecting them to mediated solutions is disquieting. It is also an indication of how deeply patriarchy is embedded in our judicial system.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-call-for-rapistvictim-mediation/article7379600.ece
3,7,2015,A win-win deal,"The diplomatic breakthrough that has been made in U.S.-Cuba relations is a vindication of President Barack Obama’s policy of engaging with nations with which Washington has hostile relations. It shows that patience and creative diplomacy can work in solving even complex situations rooted deep in historical and ideological hostility. It took nearly two years of hidden negotiations, aided by the Vatican and Canada, before the U.S. and Cuba formally >announced their decision to restore diplomatic ties last December. Now, President Barack Obama has formally revealed his administration’s >plan to open a U.S. embassy in Havana, nearly 54 years after President Dwight Eisenhower broke off diplomatic relations. Successive U.S. governments tried to overthrow and isolate the communist regime through various means, such as a proxy war, attempts to assassinate leaders, and sanctions aimed at its economy. But this approach failed miserably: President Obama candidly admitted on Wednesday the U.S. had been “clinging to a policy that was not working”. Since 1992, the U.N. General Assembly has condemned the U.S. embargo every year. In Latin America, it is the U.S. that stands isolated, while the rise of new progressive forces to power has strengthened Cuba’s standing in the region. So the question Mr. Obama faced vis-à-vis Cuba was why his administration should follow a failed policy. Changes in the domestic constituencies, such as the blunted opposition of the Cuban American community towards the two Castro brothers and the demand from American capitalist sections, especially big farming, for new markets, may also have prompted this change of course.
The U.S. outreach comes at a crucial time for Cuba as well. The Communist Party of Cuba knows the country can no longer count on others for economic support. The Soviet Union, its Cold War-era benefactor, has become history. Hugo Chávez, the Venezuelan President who started the sale of cheap oil to Cuba, is no more, and the socialist regime in Caracas is battling its own challenges. To recover from its economic troubles, Cuba has moved to ease state controls over the economy and allow private capital greater play. Against this backdrop, better cooperation with the U.S. and the eventual removal of the blockade would prove boons for a changing Cuban economy. However, the bigger question relates to the impact of this rapprochement on Cuba’s domestic politics. While post-revolutionary Cuba has made tremendous achievements in terms of ensuring the welfare of its people, its record in respecting their political freedom is relatively poor. The defenders of the regime’s high-handedness have pointed to the military-political threats from the U.S. as one of the primary reasons for such policies. With the U.S. and Cuba deciding not to be imprisoned by their past, it is also an opportunity to deepen democracy in the island-nation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/us-reopening-embassies-in-cuba-a-winwin-deal/article7379601.ece
4,7,2015,Dreading the facts?,"The >deportation in November 2014 of young Christine Mehta who was researching human rights for Amnesty International (India) in Kashmir, raises some troubling questions about the engagement of the world’s largest democracy with research on human rights. The episode also >raises concerns about how the government treats Persons of Indian Origin and Overseas Citizens of India who seek to test India’s track record on human rights with ground research. Government guidelines for visa-seekers serve as useful indicators in showing how far a government can go to protect its short-term interests. Sadly, the guidelines are not very helpful when it comes to defining what research is. The dictionary defines it as systematic investigation into and study of materials and sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions. The catch-all word used in visa guidelines refers to all kinds of research, without spelling out the specifics. What does one make of the rules, then? Do we conclude from some recent actions of the government that while the authorities are comfortable with medical research, they are not so with research on human rights or environmental issues — considering the manner in which some people have been deported of late? The Central government has been sensitive enough in the matter of sending fact-finding missions to the Valley. Its unease with organisations researching the human rights track record is also well-chronicled. Ms. Mehta joins a list that includes film-makers and journalists. Do we therefore conclude that the government wants no news other than what it endorses, especially from States blighted by insurgency and the Maoist movement, and where the presence of the armed forces is an everyday reality? When India is on the information highway, it will be tough to suppress things for too long.
India never tires of the sobriquet of the world’s largest democracy, but the robustness of a democracy is tested by its ability to take criticism. Unfortunately, the government, whether it is the UPA’s or the NDA’s, has displayed a prickly disposition when it comes to issues of human rights, labour or environment. Governmental transgressions have been critiqued at home. Given the deep-rooted tradition of our democracy, external criticism should also not be construed as being inimical to India's interests. It was Amnesty that campaigned for the freedom of some of the stalwarts of the anti-Emergency movement who are now with the BJP. It is the same organisation that continues to look into the human rights track record of governments in Kashmir, Chhattisgarh and Manipur. And even more ironical is that some of those who criticise Ms. Mehta’s deportation now were at the helm when an American broadcaster was deported for allegedly overstepping in Kashmir. India needs to re-set its tolerance levels, now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/indias-engagement-with-research-on-human-rights-violations/article7383719.ece
4,7,2015,The Vyapam scam trail,"The >Vyapam scam in Madhya Pradesh dates back to 2007, with investigations in the case starting after some details came to light in 2013. Officers of the Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board (Vyavsayik Pareeksha Mandal, or Vyapam) were found to have been rigging a variety of eligibility tests for courses and recruitments for close to six years, perhaps for an even longer period. These included tests for medical entrance, and for those aspiring for government employment as police constables, teachers, banking officials and so on. Over Rs.2,000 crore is believed to have been exchanged as bribes. The State police have arrested some 2,000 people, and are looking for about 700 more. Those allegedly involved include politicians and bureaucrats across the board, as well as the >office of Governor Ram Naresh Yadav. The scale of the scandal was shocking enough but it largely escaped national attention until recent reports brought to light a particularly disturbing set of developments — more than 40 of the >accused persons or witnesses in the case have died, according to media reports. The State government’s Special Investigation Team recently admitted before the Madhya Pradesh High Court that 23 of these were ‘unnatural’ deaths. Many of the dead were between the age of 25 and 30, and ‘road accidents’ were cited as the leading cause of death. It all points to serious and persisting foul play.
The facts indicate significant lapses on the part of the State government. To begin with, the case is being investigated by a special task force that answers directly to Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan — and it seems to have no answers for the spate of suspicious deaths. Worse still, State government officials have appeared callous in their responses and have attempted to just shrug off the matter. State Home Minister Babulal Gaur attributed the deaths to natural causes, adding that “whoever is born has to die one day”. Earlier this year, Chief Minister Chouhan >claimed in a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi that the developments regarding the Vyapam scam provided proof of his honesty as he was the one who ordered a probe into it. That claim no longer holds water. Mr. Chouhan, whose reputation for good and clean governance has been damaged by the scam, should now act proactively to recommend an independent probe. Alternatively, the Central government should step in and hand over the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation, before someone ensures that is done by approaching the Supreme Court. That would be hugely embarrassing for the BJP government, which has already lost a lot of its moral sheen.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-vyapam-scam-trail/article7383720.ece
6,7,2015,"Right intent, misplaced action","The decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in Maharashtra to derecognise madrasas and institutions imparting vedic education unless they are also offering formal education including in subjects such as science, mathematics and social sciences has, predictably, created a controversy. More than a lakh of students — most of them studying in madrasas — could be affected. The decision to declare them “out of school” has drawn flak. The suspicion among critics is that this decision is in line with earlier moves by the State government that were seen to have been taken with a communal bias, such as the ban on beef. But looked at dispassionately, this particular government action does not seem totally without merit. It is clear that many madrasas — often the only resort for poor Muslims dependent on community support — require reform: education in these institutions needs to be modernised with the introduction of curriculum related to subjects beyond religious education. Less than 10 per cent of all Muslim children study in madrasas, according to data released by the HRD Ministry some years ago. In Maharashtra, of 1,889 madrasas, about 559 teach courses in science, mathematics and English, and depend on state support. Religious teaching in many madrasas is found to be largely sect-driven, where education on various interpretations of Islam is imparted. Some of the sect-driven madrasas, such as those affiliated to the Deoband school, have refused to make changes to the curriculum. But others have welcomed state and community support to reform and expand the scope of studies.
Theological education, while preparing Muslim children to take up religious vocations, does not equip them well enough to cope with the modern world, even if there are some exceptions to the situation. This brings out the need for madrasas to expand the gamut of their teaching to other subjects that are taught in non-religious schools. There has been a long-term imperative in education policy in India to standardise education to conform to secular and modern values. State governments should work towards realising this need. It is another matter whether the Maharashtra government’s decision to declare religious schools as ineligible for funding is the right way to persuade them to modernise. Instead, the government could have taken an approach that is proactive and inclusive, allowing for more time for madrasas that were already funded by the previous Congress-Nationalist Congress Party-led government to modernise and to involve the Ministry of Minority Affairs to help with the process of reform.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-right-intent-misplaced-action/article7389378.ece
6,7,2015,A question of justice,"The record settlement of $18.7 billion that the oil company BP has arrived at in the Deepwater Horizon environmental disaster case in the United States has naturally revived the debate on the denial of justice to the victims of a far bigger catastrophe — the Bhopal gas leak. As industrial accidents go, the blowout in BP’s well in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 was staggering, killing 11 people and spectacularly devastating an already stressed marine ecosystem with millions of barrels of oil. Five State governments and the federal government of the U.S. have been vigorously pursuing penalties and compensation claims with the company, resulting in the settlement. Yet, the impact of the oil spill pales in comparison with the magnitude of what happened at the >Union Carbide plant in Bhopal in 1984. The Narendra Modi government blandly told Parliament recently that the Office of the Welfare Commissioner had recorded 22,151 casualties in the gas leak under the death category, but after scrutiny of documents, medical records, affidavits and so on, only 5,474 deaths were acknowledged, while 6,809 claims were rejected and the rest were treated as cases of disability or injury. Independent accounts, however, have maintained that there are medical professionals on record who certified 10,000 deaths soon after the gas leak. What contrasts the BP settlement with the Bhopal case is the role of the state and its readiness to pursue justice for citizens and remediation for the environment, with demonstrably errant commercial entities.
The egregious neglect in securing compensation for the victims of Bhopal, who continue to suffer, is evident from the fact that the original settlement of $470 million for tens of thousands of people absolved the >Union Carbide Corporation of all future liabilities. The Centre, which adopted a paternalistic position on the issue and assumed responsibility for all victims, now says Rs.1,548 crore (about $258 million) has been awarded as original compensation in about half a million cases, a similar sum as pro rata compensation, and ex-gratia payments of about $100 million for medical treatment. On the ground, some victims say they have received as little as Rs.35,000. Medical facilities are grossly inadequate, and the Centre has brazenly neglected a festering problem: the site of the leak with some 350 tonnes of chemical around has not been cleaned up. Under the U.S. settlement, individual claims can still be pursued. Regardless of whether it represents the best model to address industrial accidents — often caused by short-sighted cost-cutting steps to boost profits — the Deepwater Horizon outcome has some pointers to advance the cause of Bhopal’s long-suffering victims. >Dow Chemical, which assumed Union Carbide Corporation assets, reported rising earnings last year and cannot evade its liabilities. The Centre and the Supreme Court should ensure that justice is done for the hapless families of Bhopal.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-a-question-of-justice/article7389380.ece
7,7,2015,Rural realities,"New data for rural households revealed by the Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC) represent a grim reminder of the state of rural India. In over 90 per cent of households, the main earning member makes less than Rs. 10,000 a month. Over half the households are landless and a similar share of them rely on casual manual labour for the larger part of their income. Just 20 per cent of households own any kind of a motor vehicle. These numbers should come as a reality check for those who talk of India’s unbridled growth, and arrival on the global stage as a superpower. The countryside remains unable to find jobs that can pull families out of poverty. Agriculture remains at subsistence levels, with low mechanisation, limited irrigation facilities and little access to credit. Just over 3 per cent of rural households have a family member who is a graduate, so skilled jobs are going to be hard to get. Female-headed households, and Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe households are the worst off. The eastern and central States of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha have the poorest indicators. Even in the developed southern States of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, family incomes are low and dependence on casual manual labour is high. Meanwhile, early results from the urban SECC suggest that levels of deprivation, while lower in cities, are still shockingly high.
What the government chooses to do with the data is as yet unclear. While commissioning the SECC, the UPA government had spoken of creating flexibility to enable States to draw up their own combinations of indicators to create tailor-made definitions of poverty. The Narendra Modi government is yet to make its intentions clear on the SECC, especially with regard to the thorny issue of where to draw the line. Instead of a fresh round of unseemly wrangling over precisely where to set India’s poverty line, the government would be well-advised to expand and universalise its social protection schemes, and leave some space for States to innovate. It would also be wise for the government to release caste-wise information on socio-economic indicators collected by the SECC but not yet put in the public domain. Those numbers would allow, for the first time since 1931, for the relative socio-economic status of various caste groups to be compared while framing policies of affirmative action. This government stands accused of suppressing vital new information on the status of malnutrition among children, contained in a survey commissioned by the previous government through UNICEF. It should not make a habit of suppressing inconvenient data. The Indian public might hotly contest some of these numbers, particularly those relating to caste, but even angry debates represent a democratic right that must not be curtailed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/socio-economic-and-caste-census-rural-realities/article7392533.ece
7,7,2015,The threat of Boko Haram,"In an abrupt surge of violence, Boko Haram insurgents killed around 200 people in Nigeria over the past week. The group, which swore allegiance to the Islamic State in March, targeted mosques, a church and a restaurant, in much the same fashion Islamists linked to IS have attacked people elsewhere in Africa and West Asia recently. The attacks have sent a deadly message to both the Nigerian government and the rest of the world: that notwithstanding recent military setbacks Boko Haram remains capable of carrying out large-scale strikes. From its beginnings in 2002 as a peaceful Islamist movement, it has transformed itself into one of Africa’s deadliest terror machines. It has killed more than 23,000 people, mostly civilians. Under Abubakar Shekau, it has targeted schools in the northeast, branding western education and science as haram (forbidden) for Muslims. In April 2014, from a school in Chibok in Borno state, a Boko Haram stronghold, 276 female students were abducted, triggering a global outrage. Mr. Shekau threatened to sell them as slaves as “God had instructed” him to do so. None of the young women have been rescued as yet.
The Nigerian government for long ignored the problem that Boko Haram posed, as also the conditions that aided its rise. Extreme poverty in the northeast, particularly in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe States, made the region a fertile ground for insurgency. Nigeria’s porous borders with Chad and Cameroon helped Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram’s founder, gather weapons in the early years of his rebellion. But it was his successor, Mr. Shakeu, who transformed the group into Africa’s IS. A failure to check Boko Haram played a part in the defeat of Goodluck Jonathan, who in March 2015 became the first Nigerian president to lose a re-election bid. His successor Muhammadu Buhari has promised to crush the insurgency. Indeed, he has made some initial gains, with the Nigerian army recapturing most of the territories from the militants this year. But the recent attacks show that Nigeria is nowhere near defeating the jihadists. The challenges before Mr. Buhari are huge. His supporters say that as a dictator-turned-democrat he has the strength to exercise command over the generals, compared to a “weak” Mr. Jonathan. But the problem relates not only to military action; it is also about endemic corruption, poverty and religious extremism in the north and northeast. Nigeria is the world’s 10th largest oil producer and has the largest GDP for any country in Africa. But over the years the country’s poor have not enjoyed this wealth. Any comprehensive strategy to counter Boko Haram should be supplemented by a plan to address Nigeria’s structural problems.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-threat-of-boko-haram/article7392534.ece
8,7,2015,Guardians for good,"Under the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, a child’s natural guardian, both of person and property, is first the father and then the mother. The law thus buttressed the patriarchal structure. With its recent judgment allowing unwed mothers to apply for sole guardianship of minor children, the Supreme Court has removed one more brick from this edifice. In this case, an educated and employed mother wanted to make her five-year-old the nominee for investments. The paperwork stipulated that she either provide the name of the father or get a guardianship certificate. When she approached the court, she was directed under Section 11 of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 to disclose the name and whereabouts of the father, and when she refused to do so, her claim was rejected. The High Court upheld the order, with the reasoning that a natural father could have an interest in the child even if there is no marriage. The Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Vikramjit Sen has now given a seminal ruling that recognises, first that the interests of the child are supreme, and it is therefore imperative to name the mother as guardian; and second, that the woman has a fundamental right on grounds of privacy to not disclose the father’s identity. It notes that the mother has taken responsibility for the child, with the father, a married man, possibly even unaware of the existence of this son.
This ruling will have far-reaching implications for women in India, who have fought long for equal rights in the matter of guardianship. From school admission and bank account opening forms to investment papers, official documentation insists on the father’s name. In 1999, writer Githa Hariharan appealed to the Supreme Court when she could not make an investment in her son’s name as his guardian because of the stipulation that she include the father’s name, though the couple was separated and Ms. Hariharan was the child’s caretaker. The court then declared that both parents must be considered equally as natural guardians, and the word ‘after’ in the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act should not be construed as making the mother’s position secondary. However, most public and private institutions still insist on the father’s name or signature on forms. In many countries, the law gives both parents equal guardianship. The new ruling not only gives single mothers a strong legal standing but also protects the rights of children born out of wedlock. It is of special significance to children born to sex workers. It gives a fillip to single women who want to adopt. Though the Guardianship Act names the mother first as guardian in the case of an illegitimate child, unwed mothers face harassment on all fronts. This judgment will go a little further in safeguarding their rights.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/hindu-minority-and-guardianship-act-guardians-for-good/article7396015.ece
8,7,2015,Equivocation on Palestine,"India’s policy on Palestine has slowly changed over time, from one of solidarity with the cause and a distinct position in line with the non-aligned movement, to the present state of equivocation over Israel’s actions. This was exemplified in the recent vote of abstention in the UN Human Rights Council on the question of forwarding to the International Criminal Court the Davis Report on Israeli war crimes committed last year. The reasoning provided by the Ministry of External Affairs was that India, not being a signatory to the Rome Statute establishing the ICC, abstained because of the reference to the ICC in the resolution; there is no change in India’s policy towards Palestine. This is clearly a fig leaf of an argument as India had in 2012 voted in the UNHRC in favour of resolutions that contained references to the ICC, on Syria, for example. Last year India voted for a UNHRC resolution seeking an inquiry into Israel’s strikes on Gaza, and earlier this year for resolutions that spoke against Israeli settlements in occupied Palestine and for Palestinian self-determination. The sudden change in stance must therefore be attributed to a conversation between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Israeli media have revealed that Tel Aviv lobbied hard among various member-nations of the UNHRC to abstain: only Kenya, Ethiopia, Paraguay and Macedonia did so apart from India. Very few countries including Israel’s staunch ally, the U.S., have voted in its favour or abstained on resolutions on the occupation of Palestine, the Gaza blockade, human rights violations and illegal attacks on the Palestinian people. India’s stance in the UNHRC must count as a decisive shift from its time-honoured and well-established position on Palestine — notwithstanding the External Affairs Ministry’s claims.
The real reason for this shift must be the burgeoning strategic relations between the two countries. India is reported to have become the largest buyer of Israeli defence exports. And military cooperation between the two has expanded since the NDA came to power. Such cooperation had existed during the earlier regimes, but India had consistently sought to maintain its position on the Palestine issue, which was in line with that of nearly every country in the world, considering the brazen ways of Israel with respect to Palestine. This is not just a moral imperative. Israel has consistently flouted international law in its actions in the Gaza strip and in its persistence of policies such as that on settlements in the West Bank. This equivocation does not behove well for India’s stature as a nation committed to a just international order. And it betrays the Palestinian cause. Narrow instrumentalities cannot determine foreign policy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/indiapalestine-bilateral-ties-equivocation-on-palestine/article7396017.ece
9,7,2015,The tentacles of Vyapam,"The >Vyapam scam in Madhya Pradesh can no longer be considered just another corruption scandal of the conventional sort. It appears to be unique in combining the average fraudster’s ability to manipulate systems, with the reach and ruthlessness of an organised mafia-like group that can eliminate inconvenient suspects and witnesses. From being a set of inter-linked corruption cases involving the manipulation of tests for admission to professional courses and government recruitments, the scandal has emerged as a hydra-headed monster consuming over 40 lives so far. New questions stem from the unexplained deaths, including that of a television journalist who collapsed mysteriously shortly after interviewing the parents of a medical student who had been found dead on a railway track three years ago. The State government has admitted that nearly two dozen of those who were within the ambit of the probe had died unnatural deaths, and that many of them were between 25 and 30, with ‘road accident’ being cited as the leading cause of death. An elaborate conspiracy to subvert the investigation and trial can be the only credible explanation for the string of deaths. The magnitude of the cover-up appears to have overshadowed the extent of the original scandal.
Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s move to approach the High Court to seek to hand over the probe to the Central Bureau of Investigation is but a bid to pre-empt a potentially damaging order from the Supreme Court to that effect. Mr. Chouhan seems to have recognised that he needs to do something to shore up the credibility of his administration. Governor Ram Naresh Yadav himself being named in one of the FIRs should have jolted the State government into serious action. Within weeks, the Governor’s son, Shailesh Yadav, who was named by a witness as the recipient of some cash and a list of candidates, was dead. The Union government’s silence on the Governor’s continuance in office is intriguing indeed. The death of Akshay Singh, the TV journalist, and new evidence that the police ignored an autopsy report that stated that Namrata Damor, a medical student and alleged beneficiary, died of strangulation, are further pointers to the fact that the investigation under the State government is vulnerable to interference, subversion and manipulation. Nearly 2,000 people have been booked and the kingpins and their accomplices arrested. What is needed now is an independent and comprehensive investigation into the cover-up and the wider conspiracy, if any, behind the series of deaths. It has to be determined whether these were engineered to protect someone. Such a probe will have to be done under the Supreme Court’s vigilant eye. This outrageous chapter has to come to an end.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/vyapam-scam-the-tentacles-of-vyapam/article7400007.ece
9,7,2015,"To be a bridge, not fault line","The Russian town of Ufa, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is attending the BRICS and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summits, is suddenly the most important city. President Hassan Rouhani will spend the week here even as the nuclear talks between the P5+1 and Iran have reached a critical point. President Xi Jinping will be there discussing the $100 billion BRICS-New Development Bank in a week the Chinese stock market has dropped 30 per cent of its value. President Ashraf Ghani will be there, soon after talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government in Pakistan, with Chinese and U.S. observers present. And Mr. Modi and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will have a bilateral meeting after more than a year. Each of Mr. Modi’s meetings will be important, but none perhaps more important than the reason he is attending the SCO: to begin the process of India’s admission into it.
India’s membership of the SCO is significant. To begin with, it opens up trade, energy and transit routes between Russia and China that pass through Central Asia, that were hitherto closed to India. Iran’s observer status will ensure the SCO serves as a platform for India to discuss trade through the Iranian ports of Bandar Abbas and Chabahar, and link them to the Russian proposal for a North-South Transport Corridor. This circumvents India’s situation of being hemmed in owing to lack of access to markets through Pakistan. While the SCO charter disallows bilateral issues being taken up, the security grouping provides a platform for India and Pakistan to discuss them, as it will when Mr. Modi and Mr. Sharif meet. With Russia and China taking the lead, the SCO could even prove a guarantor for projects such as the TAPI (Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India) and IPI (Iran-Pakistan-India) pipelines that India has held off on security concerns. The SCO summit will provide a valuable interface to engage with Afghanistan’s neighbours at a time when so much is changing in its security outlook, between the international troop pullout and talks with the Taliban. Finally, the SCO is an important counter-balance to India’s perceived tilt towards the U.S. and its allies on security issues. In a politically polarised world, with the U.S. and Europe pitted against Russia and China and where all the powers are economically interlinked, India’s best hope to emerge a leader lies in its ability to bridge the two. Speaking at the Nazarbayev University in Astana, Mr. Modi said Central Asia’s importance faded because it became “a new fault-line between great empires to the east, west and south”. In that sense, India’s emergence now depends on striving to be a bridge, not a fault-line, in full balance with the great powers globally.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/narendra-modi-at-brics-shanghai-cooperation-organisation-summits-at-ufa/article7400008.ece
10,7,2015,Making parties accountable,"Political parties seek to represent the people and to take decisions on their behalf. But in India they have so far resisted attempts to be listed as “public authorities” under the >Right to Information Act and thus be made liable to publicly disclose financial assets. With the Supreme Court now asking six national parties why they should not be brought under the RTI, India is a step closer to making its political organisations accountable in their financial transactions. In conducting their financial affairs in an opaque manner, some parties have been able to hide their sources of funding, and the extent of their assets and financial holdings. When the Central Information Commission tried to bring them under the ambit of the RTI, the previous United Progressive Alliance government actually considered amending the Act to nullify the order. Indeed, political parties have neither challenged the CIC’s order nor complied with it. But in March this year, the CIC reiterated its order as final and binding, even as it admitted it was unable to act against the parties that had not replied to its notices and had ignored its order. Similarly, the Election Commission, which is a party to the case before the Supreme Court, has been unable to check financial irregularities among political parties; it does not have either the ability or the mandate to verify the claims of ‘donations’ made to political parties. Although parties have to declare to the Election Commission all donations in excess of Rs.20,000 they receive, they resort to under-reporting to evade this clause. Most of the donations are shown as having come in smaller sums.
Donations to political parties are not always voluntary, and in any case the donors — big businesses and corporate houses — get favours in return when the parties they fund come to power. Most of the donations are made illegally, through off-the-books transactions, and the parties repay their benefactors in terms of policy concessions or amendments to rules. Business houses often strike deals with political parties, which result in acts of corruption when they get into government. Indeed, many business houses support more than one party, extending donations both legally and illegally as black money. Thus, requiring political parties to open up their financial transactions, the donations they receive and the expenses they incur, to public scrutiny is imperative to bring down levels of corruption and make them more accountable. What the CIC was unable to achieve since the implementation of the RTI, the Supreme Court should be able to do. As was argued in the petition before the court, the right to information has been held to be a part of the freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. That freedom cannot be undermined.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/right-to-information-act-on-political-parties-making-parties-accountable/article7404493.ece
10,7,2015,Lessons from the NYSE glitch,"The nearly four-hour halt in trading at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday was the longest technology-related disruption in recent memory at the 223-year-old ‘Big Board’, one of the world’s largest. The exchange, which had faced minor technology problems recently, suspended trading in securities by 11.30 a.m. local time citing “problems arising from our technical issue”, and could reopen only about 45 minutes before the close of the day. Interestingly, this episode had almost no impact on the overall trading of U.S. stocks. For, the NYSE is not what it used to be. If it accounted for about 80 per cent of total trading stocks in the U.S. in 2005, the share is now 20 per cent. Secondly, investors were able to route their buy and sell orders to other exchanges operated by Nasdaq OMX Group and BATS Global Markets, which continued to function. This was made possible because of the stock market’s inter-connected trading system. While stocks are listed on both the NYSE and Nasdaq, they are traded on at least 10 exchanges and at more than 40 private trading venues, known as dark pools, during the day. They only trade on the listing exchanges during the opening and closing auctions. The disruption, nonetheless, rattled investors, who already had reason to be on alert given the uncertainty over the Greek crisis and the rout in the Chinese markets. Chinese stocks plunged 6.7 per cent on the same day amid fears that a slowdown in the world’s second largest economy would spill over into its financial sector. In the U.S., the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell about 1.7 per cent, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped by about 1.5 per cent.
The freeze raises serious questions both about the functioning of the NYSE and the efficacy of automated systems that underpin financial markets today. The NYSE’s new owner, Intercontinental Exchange, had restructured the company after the $8.2 billion purchase in 2013. It sold the NYSE’s assets and sent away half its employees, including most of the 22 senior-most executives. This, according to some analysts, has affected the functional aspects of the exchange; if proved true, this needs regulatory oversight. But the NYSE was not the only American organisation that faced technical glitches that day. United Airlines grounded dozens of flights and delayed hundreds because of a systems issue. And around the same time as the NYSE trading halt, the website of the Wall Street Journal went down. Even if these outages were not caused by any coordinated cyber attack, as has been claimed by U.S. officials, the events demonstrate the vulnerability and fragility of technological systems. This aspect needs urgent attention. There are lessons here for every country including India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/new-york-stock-exchange-technical-glitch-lessons-from-the-nyse-glitch/article7404492.ece
11,7,2015,"Needed, a new strategy","When Sitaram Yechury, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary, shared a platform with Somnath Chatterjee at an event this week in Kolkata marking Jyoti Basu’s birth anniversary, the symbolism was hardly lost on anyone. Mr. Yechury asked Mr. Chatterjee to work jointly with the Left, avoiding any reference to his rejoining the party, making the intent behind the sharing of the stage clear. Mr. Yechury’s seeming proclivity to engage with such estranged friends suggests his party recognises that its road to recovery can only be through West Bengal, where it right now suffers from terminal decline. The new general secretary is evidently trying to move away from the legacy of his predecessor — who was instrumental in the expulsion of the veteran from the CPI(M) in July 2008 — by showing a certain willingness to accommodate leftist voices that are more amenable to building broad coalitions with parties such as the Congress. Recent statements by several CPI(M) leaders in West Bengal suggest the party is looking toward a workable alliance with groups including the Congress to mount a challenge to a formidable Trinamool Congress.
The problem for the CPI(M), however, remains to be that it has still not managed to offer itself as an agent of change in the State, and is perceived warily by an electorate that had seen three and a half decades of Left rule. Despite a change in its State leadership, the CPI(M) still has little to offer as an oppositional force. Meanwhile, the Trinamool Congress, by virtue of its posturing toward the more populist side of the Left, has earned the trust of the rural poor to a substantial degree. While a new alliance strategy, including an engagement with the Congress, could help the Left arithmetically, the inability to resuscitate its fortunes through internal reorganisation, and the absence of any movement towards pan-Left unity must be cause for greater worry for the CPI(M). The Left’s state of crisis is not limited to West Bengal. In Kerala, recent byelection results indicate that the Congress-led United Democratic Front is not facing any imminent threat on account of anti-incumbency factors, while the CPI(M) faces issues of factionalism. In Tripura it is holding on its own, although challenges are evident. The CPI(M) and other Left groups have been harping on the slogan of “Left unity” and a joint struggle, but this has remained more of a goal on paper than one that could be translated into anything meaningful on the ground. The CPI and the CPI(M), for example, seem to have little difference in terms of essential ideology anymore, but even in their most weakened and dire straits, such as now, they have not really pushed the envelope on a unification initiative. The future, thus, admittedly remains foggy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/cpim-leaders-meets-at-jyoti-basus-birth-anniversary-needed-a-new-strategy/article7408343.ece
11,7,2015,Going after crooked deals,"The agreement signed this week by the governments of India and the United States to implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is yet another weapon in India’s war against tax evasion and black money. It requires both governments to exchange financial information on offshore accounts of each other’s citizens in their respective territories. The agreement may not be of any great use to India in the immediate context — since the proportion of Indian tax-evaders hiding funds in the U.S. is negligible compared to those doing so in tax havens such as the Bahamas, Cayman Islands and Luxembourg — but signing it was still essential since the U.S. imposes strict punitive measures on companies that are not registered under FATCA. Basically, failure to sign it would have meant companies such as the State Bank of India and the ICICI bank would have become highly uncompetitive in the U.S. The U.S.’s motivation to get India to agree to FATCA is clear: the more signatories there are to it, fewer will be the number of places where tax-evaders can hide. There are 110 jurisdictions that have signed in, including several of the tax havens.
From India’s point of view, the agreement is a simple bilateral deal, but it must be looked at in the context of its concerted ongoing efforts to deal with black money. By means of legislation in India and multilateral agreements signed with other countries, India has been closing the net around tax-evaders as never before. The Black Money Act of 2015 makes failing to declare foreign assets or income a costly proposition: apart from the flat 30 per cent tax levied on foreign income, individuals who fail to declare it will have to pay a penalty three times the tax amount (which will work out to 90 per cent of the value of the income). They could also face a possible jail term. Internationally, India last month joined the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) on the Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information, which has 59 other members. This ensures multilateral sharing of financial information on an automatic and systematic basis, unlike in the previous system in which only information pertaining to specific individuals would be shared, that too when there was suspicion of wrong-doing. Taken together, the Black Money Act, the MCAA, and now the FATCA agreement comprise a formidable system aimed at curbing black money. Indeed, it is the most systematic and concerted effort made by India to date. This commendable and long-overdue initiative will send forth the message that the government is intent on doing what it had promised to do — to curb irregularities involving funds held in foreign lands, and black money.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/foreign-account-tax-compliance-act-going-after-crooked-deals/article7408344.ece
13,7,2015,"A welcome note, with caution","In the recent past, India-Pakistan relations have followed such a predictable pattern that even a wholesome turn of events, as in Ufa this past week, brings us to reflect on it with more than a smidgen of caution. The >joint statement that followed >Narendra Modi’s meeting with Nawaz Sharif in the Russian town was clearly a breakthrough after months of acrimony and passive-aggressive behaviour between the two countries. The statement called for talks between the respective National Security Advisers to discuss all issues of terrorism, and steps to expedite the trial in the > 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks cases. Other points included the need for early meetings between representatives of the border security forces and Directors-General of Military Operations of the two countries, to help address recurring incidents on the border. Clearly, the emphasis laid in the joint statement on these points signalled renewed sincerity on the part of Pakistan’s civilian establishment towards India’s concerns. Significantly, >Mr. Modi initiated the meeting in Ufa that led to the thaw. Yet, it has to be noted that such icebreakers in the recent past following actions and intentions at the highest levels did not really lead to enduring bonhomie.
Of course, the Pakistani security establishment taking a hawkish position and an upper hand in setting the agenda for Indo-Pakistan relations has often left the civilian government hamstrung in the past. Some of the bottlenecks — > the lackadaisical approach to bringing the masterminds of the Mumbai attacks to justice, and the failure to take stringent action against anti-India terror groups in Pakistan, for example — are consequences of the security establishment’s resistance to a thaw, and its warped understanding of the issue of terrorism itself. Since the time of the UPA government, India has gradually adopted a policy that has sought to engage with the civilian government despite grievances over the contradictions in Pakistan’s India policy owing to the overhang of its security establishment’s views. This policy delivered limited benefits; hostility had been brought to a minimum level since the 26/11 terror attacks despite incidents on the border. In the past year, additional wrinkles were caused by the BJP government’s knee-jerk reactions, such as the cancellation of Foreign Secretary-level talks following a meeting between Pakistan High Commission officials in India and Hurriyat Conference representatives. Following the Ufa meeting, there are rumblings within Pakistan on the absence of any reference to Kashmir in the joint statement, even as the BJP claims a “victory” for the very same reason. It is to be hoped that positive sentiments that follow a thaw, which invariably deteriorate into theatrics owing to narrow political reasons, can be avoided at least this time around.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/indiapakistan-relations-a-welcome-note-with-caution/article7414019.ece
13,7,2015,Mr. Rajapaksa in the fray,"Former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s decision to contest the parliamentary elections in August has come hardly as a surprise. Ever since he was unexpectedly defeated in the presidential election in January 2015, he has been rallying his supporters in an apparent >comeback bid. As >President Maithripala Sirisena dissolved Parliament and announced elections, Mr. Rajapaksa has seized the opportunity. What is intriguing, however, is the immediate decision of the ruling United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA), which is formally led by Mr. Sirisena, to nominate Mr. Rajapaksa as its candidate. Mr. Sirisena, who headed a combined Opposition campaign led by the United National Party (UNP) to defeat Mr. Rajapaksa in January, has remained silent on this. But UPFA general secretary Susil Premajayantha has said “Mr. Rajapaksa will be the leader of the election campaign with the blessings and advice of President Sirisena.” Mr. Sirisena’s critics see this as a signal that he has capitulated to pressure from the Rajapaksa faction in the alliance.
Though >Mr. Sirisena officially took the leadership of both the UPFA and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), the dominant constituent in the coalition, he has not been able to gain full control over either. A major section of the SLFP remains loyal to Mr. Rajapaksa and considers him the best bet in the parliamentary polls against a resurgent UNP under Ranil Wickremesinghe. In the first six months of his government, Mr. Sirisena has struggled to hold the party and alliance together. Most of his plans to undo the Rajapaksa legacy met with resistance from his own MPs. Even the constitutional amendment limiting the powers of the presidency, seen as a big legislative victory for the President, was watered down in the face of opposition from UPFA lawmakers. This shows the President is either too pliable or not fully committed to the promises he made during the campaign. He had promised to build reconciliation. His lack of resolve and authority has upset some of his allies and opened avenues for his opponents. Mr. Rajapaksa’s likely return to Parliament should be seen against this background. Although his brand of Sinhala nationalist politics suffered a setback in the presidential polls, it is still popular among the Buddhist majority. Going by his speech announcing the candidacy, where he accused the government of “undermining national security” and “supporting terrorists”, the former President will bet on that political plank. This could pose fresh demands before Mr. Sirisena and on his reform promises. Sri Lanka’s post-war challenges are huge. Though the army won a brutal war over Tamil rebels six years ago, the political and ethnic wounds remain. The country’s future lies in ensuring a path of lasting reconciliation on all fronts.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/former-sri-lankan-president-mahinda-rajapaksa-in-the-fray/article7414020.ece
14,7,2015,Get-together of the separatists,"It will be too easy to read major political intent into an > Iftar meeting hosted by the separatist leader of the Tehreek-e-Hurriyat, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, which also saw the presence of other separatists such as Mirwaiz Umar Farooq of the Hurriyat Conference and Yasin Malik of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front. The leaders, after all, reportedly called the meeting as “ >Unity Phase I”. Considering that such groups have various definitions of separatism and have significant differences in their approach towards Kashmiri nationalism, such a reading on the basis of political unity would be inaccurate. It is clear that the near-term reason for various separatist leaders meeting is a commonality of interests. First is the alleged threat from the obscure militant organisation that calls itself the Lashkar-e-Islam and whose targets included lower-rung Hurriyat activists. Second is the call from the militant and Pakistan-based leader of the United Jihad Council, Syed Salahuddin, for unity among separatists. The third is the fact that there has been a lull in separatist activity. This is in contrast to perceptions of more wind in the sails of the State government led by the Peoples Democratic Party in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party. The significant turnout in last year’s elections and the massive package now announced by the Central government for development in Jammu and Kashmir are clearly points of concern for the separatists.
That said, there are several differences within the separatist ranks that cannot be overlooked even if they have seemingly buried the hatchet and met at a social gathering. These persisting differences, which came to the fore even during the intense and nearly spontaneous protests in 2008, relate not just to ideology but also to questions related to leadership and tactics. Separatists belonging to the JKLF stream, for example, have clearly opposed the pro-Pakistan agenda of Mr. Geelani’s outfit and his supporters and rejected his claims of leadership of the separatist movement. There are few takers within the separatist stream in the valley for Mr. Geelani’s agenda of Kashmir’s merger with Pakistan. The slogan of azaadi itself has several nuances and meanings, not all of them related to the demand for self-determination. Another common thread among the separatists is their dismay over the resumption of >India-Pakistan high-level talks following the joint statement in Ufa without any explicit mention of Kashmir. That said, the renewed potential of the separatists, working together, to create trouble for India should not be underestimated. While the Indian government has done the right thing in seeking to address its immediate concerns with Pakistan, which Islamabad has rightly sought to work toward in the joint statement, it would be prudent on the part of both to keep talking about Kashmir in the background, a process that has paid dividends in the past.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/major-political-intent-into-an-iftar-meeting-hosted-by-geelani/article7418022.ece
14,7,2015,"Two greats, one tournament","There are moments in the careers of sportspersons where they shift levels, repositioning themselves from being extremely good, to signalling they are among the game’s greats or that they will be in the course of time. >Novak Djokovic did this at Wimbledon 2015, winning his third title and ninth Grand Slam, surpassing Andre Agassi, Ivan Lendl, Jimmy Connors and Ken Rosewall. He is just two short of the 11 won by Bjorn Borg and Rod Laver, which is well within his reach and — heaven knows — there may be a few more along the way. In the final, he and Roger Federer, who was in the form of his life right through the tournament, were locked in two extraordinarily tight sets, before Djokovic stamped his dominance on the match and won in four. The tall Serb lacks the innate and almost reflexive genius of Federer, who can produce tennis strokes that are surreal, defying both convention and the laws of physics. But what he has in full measure is a complete all-round game — anchored by a first-rate serve and an outstanding return of serve — that he uses to remarkable effect to constantly chisel away at the opponent’s defences and wear him down. Djokovic rarely wins by blasting his opponents out of court but by enfeebling them, using his elasticity and resolve to return pretty much everything thrown at him. Over the last three years, few players have been able to withstand the relentless and unforgiving nature of the Djokovic game.
If one man took a step towards greatness, this Wimbledon saw a woman strengthening her claim to being the greatest woman tennis player of all time. >Serena Williams won her 21st Grand Slam when she defeated dark horse Garbine Muguruza in straight sets to hold up the Venus Rosewater dish once again. She remains just short of Steffi Graf (22nd), but on current form she has a more than fair chance of equalling it at next month’s U.S. Open — a victory that will earn her a calendar year Grand Slam, last won by Graf in 1988. True, Margaret Court won as many as 24 Grand Slam singles titles, and while there is no taking away from her greatness, the fact is that some of these were logged in the amateur era; moreover, almost half came at the Australian Open in which many women players chose not to contest at the time. Williams has redefined the meaning of power in the women’s game — no one has served the ball as consistently hard as she has and very few have the power to out-hit her, as Maria Sharapova discovered yet again in the semi-final. Wimbledon 2015, above all, was about two great champions: Djokovic and Williams.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/wimbledon-2015-novak-djokovic-and-serena-williams-win-the-title/article7418023.ece
15,7,2015,A remarkable achievement,"Matters of peace and diplomacy in West Asia have hardly been coming up in news headlines of late. But the >nuclear deal reached on July 14 between Iran and six world powers is a historic step forward that solves an over-a-decade-long stand-off between Iran and the West. It sets the stage for a radical realignment of equations in West Asia, and has the potential to transform the conflict-ridden region in the long term. The credit goes to U.S. President Barack Obama and his Iranian counterpart, President Hassan Rouhani, who put aside historical acrimony, sidelined the hardliners, took a pragmatic view of ties and pushed hard for a deal. As the details emerge, the agreement looks like a “ >win-win deal” for all sides. Under its terms, sanctions imposed by the U.S., the European Union and the UN would be lifted, in return for Iran agreeing to long-term curbs on its nuclear programme. All of Iran’s nuclear facilities would be allowed to continue operations. This provision will let the Iranian government sell the deal to its public, pointing out that its right to generate nuclear energy stays intact. Tehran has also agreed to a “snapback” mechanism, under which some sanctions could be reinstated after 65 days if it violated the deal. A UN weapons embargo would remain for five years and a ban on buying missile technology for eight years.
But the real potential of the deal lies in the fact that it removes the greatest obstacle for a >rapprochement between Iran and the U.S. Though both sides have said the talks were related strictly to the nuclear programme and not other bilateral issues, the diplomatic warmth shown by these erstwhile enemies over the past few years is hardly lost on anyone. The changing geopolitical dynamics of West Asia have also played a major role in bringing the U.S. and Iran together. Both are cooperating in Iraq in the war against Islamic State. Iran, though hit hard by sanctions, is a major power in West Asia whose influence spans from Baghdad and Damascus to southern Lebanon. If the U.S.-Iran hostility could be transformed into cooperation, and Tehran is allowed to claim the economic and diplomatic status it deserves, that could have a positive impact on several conflicts in the region. That should be the obvious next step after the nuclear deal. But there are challenges, too: powerful sections, including the Republicans in the U.S., hardliners in Iran, and the Israelis and Saudis, remain steadfastly opposed to a U.S.-Iran rapprochement. The journey so far has not been easy. If Iran and the big powers continue to show the will and the commitment they have demonstrated during the talks, the goals of the deal will be achievable.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/iran-nuclear-deal-a-remarkable-achievement/article7422083.ece
15,7,2015,The game matters most,"The punishment handed out by a Supreme Court-appointed committee to teams and individuals involved in the betting scandal that hit the Indian Premier League two years ago ought to be welcomed by cricket fans and all those who cherish the game’s purity. The Justice R.M. >Lodha Committee has slapped a two-year suspension on IPL franchises India Cements Ltd., which owned Chennai Super Kings, and Jaipur IPL Cricket Pvt. Ltd., which owns Rajasthan Royals. The action is essentially based on >the involvement of Gurunath Meiyappan, a CSK team official, and Raj Kundra, a former owner of Rajasthan Royals, in betting activity, and in maintaining contact with bookies. The committee has carried out the orders of the Supreme Court which, i >n a January 2015 verdict, directed it to fix the quantum of punishment for Mr. Meiyappan and Mr. Kundra, and their respective franchises. Few will lament the fact that the two men have been suspended for life from any kind of involvement in cricket matches organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), but there will be anguish among many cricket fans over the punishment meted out to two key teams.
One question that arises from the suspension of the CSK and RR franchises is whether whole teams, players, support staff and their legion of fans ought to be punished for the misdemeanour of two individuals. But the question is misplaced as the operational rules of the IPL and clauses in the franchise agreement clearly provide for the termination of a franchise for certain kinds of misconduct by team officials. The >Mukul Mudgal Committee had found CSK clearly guilty of failure to ensure that its officials complied with the anti-corruption code, the operational rules and IPL regulations. Punishing teams for misconduct is nothing new in international sport. The scandal that rocked Italian football in 2006 led to even a top team, Juventus, being relegated and stripped of two titles. Mr. Lodha has made it clear that the spirit of cricket is larger than any individuals or franchises, or financial losses. In any case, the BCCI has the option to hold a fresh auction for the Chennai and Jaipur franchises, or let the affected players be bought by other teams. The outcome is not without significance for the BCCI itself. The entire episode had brought to light the manner in which it functioned as an opaque club of administrators who treated the game as their personal fiefdom, that suffered from obvious credibility deficit. Punishing those involved is one way to ensure that administrators reorient themselves firmly towards preserving the board’s institutional integrity. Such action is also vital to ensure the continued popularity of cricket.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ipl-betting-scandal-the-game-matters-most/article7422064.ece
16,7,2015,A pernicious law,"The Union government’s contention in the >Supreme Court that the provisions in the Indian Penal Code on criminal defamation do not have a chilling effect on free speech will disappoint proponents of fundamental freedoms. The zeal to retain a law that the state can use to stifle criticism is at the heart of the government’s position. It also goes against democratic opinion in many jurisdictions that treats defamation essentially as a civil wrong, and not something to be remedied by the use of the state’s coercive police powers. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, the Human Rights Committee of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other international bodies have called upon states to abolish criminal defamation, recognising that it intimidates citizens and dissuades them from exposing wrongdoing. The grounds cited by the Centre now to justify the continuance of Sections 499 and 500 of the IPC, which deal with defamation and prescribe a maximum jail term of two years, are specious: that in India, citizens are unlikely to have enough liquidity to pay damages for civil defamation; that online defamation in the Internet age can be effectively countered only by making it a criminal offence, and that the law is part of the state’s “compelling interest” to protect the dignity and reputation of citizens. What it fails to see is that the main feature of criminal defamation is its potential for harassment. It is a tool that can be easily invoked and that enables allegedly defamed persons to drag anyone to courts across the country.
>Criminal defamation has a pernicious effect on society: for instance, the state uses it as a means to coerce the media and political opponents into adopting self-censorship and unwarranted self-restraint; groups or sections claiming to have been hurt or insulted, abuse the process by initiating multiple proceedings in different places; and, more importantly, the protracted process itself is a punishment. Further, magistrates tend to mechanically summon defendants without first assessing whether the allegedly offending content comes within one of the many exceptions to defamation found in the statute. >Criminal defamation should not be allowed to be an instrument in the hands of the state, especially when the Code of Criminal Procedure gives public servants an unfair advantage by allowing the state’s prosecutors to stand in for them when they claim to have been defamed by the media or political opponents. Thanks to past verdicts of the Supreme Court, the government and its organs can no more file civil suits seeking damages for defamation, yet the pernicious law of criminal defamation is invoked to stifle free speech. Even as the court deliberates the matter, the government ought to reconsider its stand and come out against the criminal defamation law.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/criminal-defamation-a-pernicious-law/article7426091.ece
16,7,2015,Reality check on air quality,"Delhi’s poor air quality has rightly made it the centre of media and government attention. However, the Indian government’s own air quality monitoring apparatus now shows the focus so far may have remained too narrowly on some pollutants and, as a result, only on some cities. >India’s Air Quality Index, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in early April, presents >an AQI value for a given city based on the prominent pollutant in that city, calibrated for comparison. Six months of AQI values for 11 Indian cities show that Kanpur, Varanasi and Chennai have worse air quality than Delhi, on average. While Delhi and the rest of north India have higher particulate matter levels, cities such as Chennai find high concentrations of other toxic pollutants including sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. Dust, caused by a wide range of natural and man-made activities, can have a deeply damaging impact on the respiratory tract. But at the levels at which they are being experienced, gaseous pollutants have equally detrimental effects. The value of the AQI, one of the experts said, is in it being comparable across cities and across pollutants in terms of health impact. Some cities have been complacent over their low particulate matter levels. However, the new numbers show there is no room for complacency; other pollutants have been poisoning people.
The government has taken a great first step in setting up a >national Index and in making data for 11 cities, for now, public. Data for more cities and monitoring stations need to be brought online. The next step should be for policy-makers to actually look at this data; the government’s own website is clearly showing that a number of Indian cities are experiencing what should be health emergencies on a daily basis, going by their AQI levels. Local governments must clamp down on the specific pollutants that are pushing their respective cities into >the danger zone, whether it means moving polluting industries outside city limits or curbing the number of private vehicles by making available better public transport systems. They must also make it a habit to monitor pollution levels more closely. The Union government, meanwhile, must come out with an action plan for ‘severe’, ‘very poor’ and ‘poor’ air quality days; in Beijing, for instance, government vehicles are pulled off the roads, factories forced to limit production, schools shut down and citizens told to stay indoors on days when air pollution rises to an orange or red alert level. India needs similar clear instructions on what parents, teachers and commuters should do on poor air quality days. Else, all that they will be able to do is look at the index and worry for their health.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/indias-air-quality-index-reality-check-on-air-quality/article7426092.ece
17,7,2015,An avoidable tragedy,">Stampedes during >religious festivals are >quite common in > India. Over a dozen instances of pilgrims being trampled to death have been recorded in independent India, and the common thread running through every such tragedy is the utter failure of the authorities and the public alike to learn any lesson from previous disasters. At the Godavari Maha Pushkaram at Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh on July 14, >every ingredient needed for a tragedy was present — a rarely occurring religious festival attended by millions of people, the edge of a crowded bathing ghat, and the presence of VIPs causing waiting devotees to lose their patience. A host of factors appeared to have contributed to the >stampede that led to 28 deaths, not least among them being the fact that huge crowds were allowed to gather at the Pushkar ghat even as Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and his family members were taking a holy dip at the auspicious time. Pilgrims were apparently kept waiting for hours >before the VIP entourage arrived. This resulted in a surge towards the bathing ghat as the gates were opened. Mr. Naidu had his dip at the Pushkar ghat, which usually attracts tens of thousands of pilgrims, instead of at another facility earmarked for VIPs. The incident is reminiscent of the 1992 Mahamaham tragedy at Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu when nearly 50 pilgrims died in a temple tank, probably because the security measures made for the Chief Minister had restricted the space earmarked for the public.
Several factors appear to have contributed to the Godavari tragedy. These include lack of proper barricading to enable pilgrims to move in single file towards the river, the failure of the authorities to guide devotees, especially those unfamiliar with the town, to more spacious ghats elsewhere, and the absence of planning for crowd management. All this indicates that even a good deal of advance preparation and elaborate security arrangements are not enough to guarantee safety at mass events unless some elementary safeguards are in place. After the Maha Kumbh Mela tragedy in 1954, Jawaharlal Nehru had asked VIPs to stay away from such events. It was recognised even then that the presence of VIPs puts needless pressure and strain on the administrative machinery and severely compromises optimal measures to control milling crowds. The Kumbh at Nashik in Maharashtra is just a month away. On the last occasion, >40 people died in a stampede there. The authorities must take every precaution to prevent a repeat. While VIPs do have a right to participate in such events, it should be ensured that their presence does not compromise the safety of the public.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-avoidable-tragedy/article7430369.ece
17,7,2015,Manipur’s dilemma,"The fear of every state with a predominant indigenous population was summed up thus by the Naga leader A.Z. Phizo: “Nagaland cannot accept the Indian excess population [as] our country is too small.” >Many of the >recent exclusivist >outbursts in the northeastern States, including in Manipur, can be attributed to such a fear of losing ancestral land to “outsiders”. Manipur’s crisis intensified four months ago when its Congress-majority Legislative Assembly passed the Manipur Regulation of Visitors, Tenant and Migrant Workers’ Bill, 2015. It was opposed widely, including by women’s and students' groups, and even by a section of the ruling party. Eventually the Opposition became more united in demanding the withdrawal of the Bill, which failed to address their key concern of protecting the land rights of the original inhabitants. On July 14, >the Bill was withdrawn by the Manipur government in a nod to the protesters’ demands. The united Opposition rather underscored the long-standing demand for the imposition of an Inner Line Permit system, as in a few other northeastern States. The ILP regime, introduced by the British to protect tribal populations from encroachment into their areas, but later used to advance commercial interests, involves a system akin to the issue of visas to Indian citizens to enter a State of the Union.
The dilemma of the Indian state over the ILP is understandable. Can the Union afford to introduce a quasi-visa to its citizens to enter one State from another State? The question could be complex for a central party that advocates the removal of all speed-breakers when it comes to citizens’ access to travel and work in her own country. The dilemma of Manipur is perhaps even more severe. The 2001 Census indicated the size of the migrant community was nearly as much as that of the dominant ethnic Meiteis, thus bolstering the demand from Manipur’s erudite civil society to impose curbs on inward movement. But there has also been out-migration of the indigenous people. The demand is sought to be substantiated by citing many examples that indicate how Manipuris are losing land to “extractive” non-Manipuri industries. The leasing out of “one-sixth of the total area” of Manipur for oil exploration and drilling to international oil majors, unthinkable in the other States, is one of many such examples. In this backdrop, a half-baked Bill was passed, that exacerbated the insecurity. The demand, though, is more legitimately a consequence of the hill-valley divide in the State and the congestion in the valley rather than any huge influx of outsiders. The situation is thus complex but not out-of-control. But the State should ensure that alien-investor-driven development does not disrobe its people. After all, they are supposed to benefit from the growth generated out of its own domestic resources.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/manipurs-dilemma/article7430371.ece
18,7,2015,That familiar pattern,"The ink had hardly dried on the >joint statement issued in Ufa after the meeting between Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Nawaz Sharif when accusations, recriminations, and even shooting across the >Line of Control began. Not that such an upshot was entirely unexpected, given patterns seen in the past. The routine has included, following any statement of intent, phases of commentary and political wordplay from the respective establishments that would go around chest-thumping about short-sighted “victories” for either side. On the other hand, detractors would tend to nitpick about the absence of issues that matter, of course those that are dear to them, or cavil over the controversial clauses by overemphasising them. This pattern has just played out again. Added to this has been the recrudescence of cross-border incidents, resulting in casualties. This time, India has accused Pakistan of infiltration attempts in the Jammu sector, while Pakistan has complained that India sent in a drone and also started firing across the border. Attempts to follow the standard protocol for such situations, setting up conversations between the respective >border security forces, for example, have also not been possible, according to India.
The cross-border incidents in themselves represent a major issue bilaterally. Hundreds of such incidents have occurred since both countries signed a ceasefire agreement in 2003, which are clearly violative of it. These then beg the question whether the agreement as it stands is a dead letter. While many of the violations have been a consequence of “infiltration bids” by insurgents aided by Pakistan Rangers, the present set of incidents clearly represent the political fallout of recriminations following the Ufa agreement, indeed conforming to the pattern of the recent past. Ideally, India and Pakistan should strengthen the 2003 agreement by negotiating a new and more robust ceasefire agreement. But even that would not do. The two governments must work toward a robust media and political strategy to explain any agreements — such as in Ufa — to its domestic political opposition and even the noisy media in order to cushion themselves from the theatrics that inevitably follow a thaw. It is more so in the case of Pakistan, where the civilian government has hardly any leeway in working out its relations with India given the overhang of the security establishment. It is unfortunate that within days of the Ufa statement, >Sartaj Aziz, adviser on foreign affairs to Mr. Sharif, backtracked from the terms of the joint statement by reiterating the centrality of issues such as Kashmir, and came out with a litany of new complaints about “Indian interference”. Clearly, maturity and better management of the domestic constituencies and core establishments are sorely needed, especially on the Pakistani side.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/that-familiar-pattern/article7434814.ece
18,7,2015,The Greek let-down,"The latest phase of the protracted game of chicken between Greece and its creditors ended in a whimper for the country as Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s government >agreed to a continuation of the austerity programme in return for debt relief concessions. The government’s actions should be termed as a letdown. It sought a referendum on the conditions posed by the Troika — comprising the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund — that yielded an overwhelming “no” from the Greek people. Later under a new agreement, >it accepted conditions over and above what the referendum set out to seek. But with the eurozone being pushed by its largest economy, Germany, to prepare for Grexit, Greece had barely any wiggle room: the pain of a Grexit was seen to be more daunting than status quo for the economically crippled nation. There have been rumblings within the ruling Syriza against the latest agreement. But in the Greek Parliament the conditions accepted by the Syriza government have been ratified, and Greece will again try a round of austerity measures and privatisation to pay off its debt in the medium term. It is anybody’s guess if this would work; after all, five years of austerity has only exacerbated the problem for the economy.
That said, it must be asked what the goal of the agreement was: make an example out of Greece for other debtor-nations, or help its economy tide over its immediate and deep problems? Given the way the negotiations were held, and from the terms of the agreement, it could be said for sure that the latter was not on the agenda. In the past seven years the country’s GDP has shrunk by 30 per cent while unemployment has risen to over 25 per cent. If after years of austerity and >two bailouts Greece still has to seek a third bailout package to service its debt, that itself shows its path is unsustainable. What Europe should have done was to write-off a major part of Greece’s debt and allow the country to lift public spending. This, in a classical Keynesian way, would have helped revive demand and thereby economic growth. But instead, Europe’s leaders decided to toe the line of big finance by punishing Greece and its people, creating divisions within Europe. The present action against Greece exposes the fault-lines in the European project, which originally aimed to integrate a continent economically and politically but failed to do so because of the insistence on a faulty and unbalanced monetary union. While the mighty in the eurozone might have won the battle over retaining austerity, the war to sustain the eurozone as it is, will continue.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pm-alexis-tsiprass-govt-agreed-to-a-continuation-of-the-austerity-programme-in-return-for-debt-relief-concessions/article7434815.ece
20,7,2015,The question of primacy,"To a layperson, the question raised by a judge of the Supreme Court last week on the exact >constitutional identity of the country’s Chief Justice may appear to be only an academic doubt. However, seen in the backdrop of the current debate over what is the ideal process for appointing members of the higher judiciary, the question may have a bearing on the role of the Chief Justice in the process. The question from Justice Kurian Joseph, in the course of the hearing in the case relating to the validity of the National Judicial Appointments Commission, arose from the fact that Article 124 of the Constitution refers to ‘the Chief Justice of India’, while the ‘Form of Oaths and Affirmations’ in the Third Schedule uses the term ‘Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India’. Is there a distinction? The provisions concerning Supreme Court judges fall under the head ‘Union judiciary’ in the Constitution, implying that the CJ is indeed the head of the Supreme Court. In judicial matters, the CJ is the first among judges enjoying equal status, but in a constitutional sense, especially when playing the role of a ‘consultee’ in judicial appointments, he is the paterfamilias of the entire judiciary. This dual identity presents no conundrum when one remembers that the judiciary, unlike the executive or the legislature, is not federal in nature. While the State and Central governments, or the State legislatures and Parliament, which are sovereign in their respective domains, have an element of co-equality, the judiciary has a single hierarchy in which the Supreme Court is at the apex. This is demonstrated by the fact that under Article 141, the law declared by the Supreme Court is binding on all the courts.
However, the question acquires an entirely different dimension when seen in the context of the current debate on whether the country needs a new mechanism for judicial appointments — the NJAC — or it should retain the collegium system introduced by the ‘second judges’ case’ in 1993. The collegium, originally a three-member body conceived by the court, and later expanded to include five members by the ‘third judges’ case’ of 1998, was an institution in which the CJ’s consultative role was encapsulated. If the NJAC, in which the Chief Justice and two senior-most judges represent the judiciary, while two ‘eminent persons’ and the Union Law Minister represent the executive, is going to replace the collegium, does the CJ lose his constitutional identity as a necessary ‘consultee’, and his role diminished to that of an ordinary member in a multi-member commission? In other words, the question seems to be the one that the NJAC debate began with: should the judiciary retain its primacy in appointments, or should it share an equal responsibility with the executive?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/constitutional-identity-of-cji-question-of-primacy/article7440859.ece
20,7,2015,An unsound recommendation,"A big let-down amid an otherwise progressive narrative in the Department of Telecommunications’ recent >report on net neutrality is its recommendation to bring voice over internet protocol-based (VoIP) domestic calling services, including applications such as WhatsApp, under licensing. The suggestion is that such services be regulated “through exercise of licensing powers available under section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act to ensure a level playing field.” This does not straightaway mean such calls will be chargeable. The more obvious implication is that such applications can’t operate without the government’s permission, which might be granted only on the fulfilment of certain conditions or the payment of a fee, or both. The DoT’s report is by no means final and binding. Still, the stated logic behind such a suggestion is open to question. The report says telecom companies “may become reluctant to invest in expansion of broadband infrastructure” in an environment where apps that provide similar calling services eat into their revenues. Don’t telecom companies benefit from the apps that ride on whatever services they provide? Doesn’t more app usage mean more data consumed, which in turn mean more revenues for telecom companies?
The recommendation could be flawed on multiple grounds. One, there is a good chance that if the suggestion is implemented the consumer might be worse off for it. But before that, there is a big question mark over whether differentiating a domestic VoIP call from an international one is possible at all. Bar this recommendation, the report does seem to largely reflect a nuanced understanding of the complexities of today’s internet world. This is true even of its references to zero-rating schemes, under which the user is offered data or access to some sites free of cost. True, critics have taken the report to task for not recommending a ban on them. But there are novel zero-rating schemes where the user is given free data and not a pre-selected bouquet of sites, as Facebook’s internet.org does (the report doesn’t seem to be in favour of this). It’s heartening that the report repeatedly pitches for net neutrality, the principle of data equality that is important to ensure the internet remains a level-playing field. At the same time, it shows pragmatism in saying that “enforcing net neutrality principle is a new idea and may throw up many questions and problems as we go along,” and that this may require a process of oversight.

So on the eve of the monsoon session of Parliament, the ruling > Bharatiya Janata Party must be finding the attitude of the principal opposition party, the Congress, strangely discomfiting. While the Congress seems bent on disrupting the session over issues such as corruption charges against Ministers and Chief Ministers, the BJP is without the moral authority to demand a reasoned, regulated debate. After all, the strategy of the Congress and other opposition parties is the same one that the BJP had adopted against the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government. With two important pieces of legislation at stake, on land acquisition and the goods and services tax, the Narendra Modi government cannot afford to let the session descend into din and noise. The opposition wants to strengthen popular perceptions of wrongdoing and of an ineffectual government. But in the absence of an informed debate in Parliament, the government will be unable to advance its legislative agenda. Disruption works better for the opposition than for the government. The louder the noise the better it is for the opposition parties: unfortunately, commotion and confusion in Parliament seem to get them better media mileage.
Both the > Lalit Modi saga and the > Vyapam scam have put the BJP on the back foot. Although the leaders most under pressure are the BJP Chief Ministers in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, any mis-step will take a toll on the image of Prime Minister Modi and his government. Mr. Modi was able to generate a pan-India appeal ahead of the 2014 general election; this very appeal is now under stress, resulting in State-level scams tarring the BJP’s national image. As the undisputed leader of the BJP, Mr. Modi will be expected to discipline erring Union Ministers and Chief Ministers. Unlike his predecessor Manmohan Singh, who was seen as politically weak and therefore ineffectual, Mr. Modi will have no excuse for inaction. To not act in the face of grave allegations would be seen not merely as a sign of political weakness, but as a sign of complicity. The BJP’s strategy seems to be to back its Chief Ministers fully. But, despite its absolute majority in the Lok Sabha, the party would need the moral support of its allies to deflect Opposition attacks. The Shiv Sena would not be easy to placate. If the stand-off persists, it is the government that will have to force a resolution. But the opposition needs to do more than make some noise if it sincerely believes that the government is in the wrong. Informed discussion and smooth conduct of parliamentary proceedings will go a long way in clarifying the details of the murky affairs.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/monsoon-session-in-parliament-opposition-vs-bjp/article7444345.ece
21,7,2015,Japan’s security dilemma,"The security legislation proposed by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s administration moved a step closer to becoming law when Parliament’s lower house approved it. The bills, which seek to rewrite the country’s post-War pacifist security policy, are now before the upper house. Over a period of seven decades, Japan’s security policy, shaped under a war-renouncing Constitution following the misadventures of the imperial regime, has been focussed on self-defence. But the present bills seek to replace the self-defence doctrine with “collective self-defence”, that would allow Japan to send troops abroad to rescue allies under attack. This big shift in approach makes the legislation controversial and unpopular. According to recent polls, only a quarter of the Japanese population supports the legislation. But Mr. Abe seems determined to take it forward.
This is mainly because of two inter-connected factors. First, Japan has come under huge pressure from the U.S. to revise its security doctrine. During > Mr. Abe’s visit to the U.S. in April 2015, both Japan and the U.S. announced new security guidelines which urged Tokyo to take “more responsibility” in their bilateral security arrangement. Mr. Abe promised U.S. lawmakers to approve a new defence bill package “by this summer”. This explains why the Prime Minister is in a hurry to get the bills passed despite opposition. Second, the nationalist politician that Mr. Abe is, sees it as a necessity to have an outward-looking security policy to contain China’s rise. He had earlier proposed to have a “strategic diamond” of four maritime democracies — Japan, the U.S., Australia and India — to counter Chinese influence in the Pacific. Mr. Abe has criticised China’s territorial ambitions in the South China Sea, and Tokyo and Beijing have a dispute over islands in the East China Sea held by Japan. But the question is whether the move to reorient the pacifist security posturing, which ensured peace over the last seven decades when Japan rose as an economic powerhouse from the ruins of the Second World War, would help Tokyo address its security challenges, or lead to a flare-up of tensions in an already volatile East Asia. If the latter happens, that would create wrinkles in East Asian stability as the rivalry between China and Japan, that has historical dimensions, would worsen. That will not be in the interest of either Japan or Asia. Japan should also be wary of joining the great game between the U.S. and China in the Pacific — one an existing super power and the other a rising super power. Instead, it should focus on solving its problems with China bilaterally, and work towards essential regional stability. For that to happen, the best way will be to continue its acclaimed policy of renunciation of war.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/japans-security-legislation-approved-by-lower-house/article7444346.ece
22,7,2015,Trial and error,"The Supreme Court, in its 1980 Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab ruling, laid down the “rarest of the rare” principle in handing out the death penalty. However, the high frequency of the award of capital punishment by trial courts across the country should give pause for thought. New research findings from the Centre on the Death Penalty at the National Law University in Delhi show that trial courts handed down 1,800 death sentences over the last 15 years. Trial courts have been handing out death sentences at the rate of ten a month for the last 15 years. Much of the debate around the death penalty in India centres on Supreme Court rulings and observations, and with good reason. Last year, while handing down its Shatrughan Chauhan vs Union of India ruling, the Supreme Court spelt out clear guidelines on the legal rights of prisoners on death row. Higher courts have the opportunity to rectify flaws in lower court judgments; indeed, fewer than 5 per cent of the 1,800 death sentences were confirmed by the Supreme Court, and a third resulted in acquittal. However, the new numbers point to the fact that too little attention is being paid to the wanton misuse of the death penalty in India’s lower courts, resulting in decades spent on death row while there is only a slim probability of it being confirmed.
Why trial courts are handing out death sentences at such a >fast pace needs to be studied. These courts are more proximate to crimes than higher courts in terms of occurrence and distance, and their working is poorly scrutinised by the media. And the data are rarely supervised by the High Courts under whose jurisdiction they come. In addition, a fair amount of confusion prevails over the circumstances in which the death penalty should be given, on account of lack of clarity on the part of higher courts. The principle of the “rarest of the rare” seems subjective considering that among the 385 prisoners now on death row in India, the largest proportion is there for murder, and 25 per cent for committing a single murder. Nor can we automatically assume that the higher courts are confirming the deserving cases. Fourteen eminent former judges wrote to President Pranab Mukherjee about the death sentence having been wrongly given in 13 cases: two of these convicts had already been executed. These were cases in which not just the trial courts but the High Courts and the Supreme Court too had seemingly erred: every level of the system had then failed them. The moral imperative apart, the inconsistent outcomes from the judicial system on this question should be reason enough for India to urgently revoke its position on the death penalty.

22,7,2015,Historic fly-by,"History was made on July 14 when >NASA’s New Horizons became the first spacecraft to successfully fly by the dwarf planet Pluto, the last unexplored world in the Solar System. This it did after travelling a distance of nearly 5 billion kilometres since its launch in January 2006. The scientific treasure that has been returned since then by the baby grand piano-size spacecraft has already “dramatically surpassed” expectations. A satellite carrying the ashes of Clyde Tombaugh, the astronomer who discovered Pluto in 1930, confirmed Pluto’s pride of place as the largest object in the Kuiper belt: Pluto was demoted to dwarf planet status in August 2006 after the discovery of Eris, of similar size, in the Kuiper belt. Contrary to expectations, the first close-up image revealed that the surface of Pluto was not riddled with any impact craters formed by objects bombarding it. Without doubt, the surface is very young, probably less than 100 million years old, and the only way to explain this is by rejecting the grand old theory of an inert Pluto made up of ice and rock. Instead, the dwarf planet is geologically active with an internal heat source that drives the engine, and it has some yet-to-be deciphered mechanism that refreshes the surface from time to time; tidal heating can be ruled out as Pluto does not orbit any giant planet. Similarly, the existence of high mountains, possible volcanoes, fault lines, rift valleys and other features underlines the presence of active tectonics. Similar to the crater-free surface, a mountain range jutting out 3,500 metres above it is also less than 100 million years old, and is one of the “youngest surfaces seen in the Solar System”. Much like Pluto, its largest moon Charon too has a young surface with geologically diverse features. More images are expected to be sent on by the spacecraft until August next year, and these could contain invaluable information about both Pluto and its moon, and other objects in the Kuiper belt.
Getting as close as 12,500 km of the dwarf planet after travelling for nearly a decade and covering a distance of nearly 5 billion km is an extraordinary achievement; scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson likened it to “a hole-in-one on a two-mile golf shot”. With exploration being second nature to humans, it is expeditions such as these that awaken curiosity and fire our interest in science. Unlike other mega-science projects of equal importance, space exploration has always had the power to hold ordinary people under a spell. India’s m`oon mission Chandrayaan-1 and the recent Mars Orbiter Mission Mangalyaan, certainly rekindled interest in science among students. At a time when basic science appears to have become less attractive, expeditions such as these could help reverse the trend.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/historic-flyby-nasas-new-horizons-flies-by-pluto/article7448580.ece
23,7,2015,A case for mercy,"The rejection by the Supreme Court of a curative petition by Yakub Abdul Razak Memon, the only one sentenced to death for involvement in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, marks the exhaustion of his >last judicial remedy . However, hanging him will be cruel and inhuman, for more than one reason. With the masterminds Dawood Ibrahim and ‘Tiger’ Memon, Yakub’s brother, remaining out of the reach of the Indian authorities, it will only give the impression that the lone man available among the many brains behind the ghastly act of terrorism is being singled out. The other 10 men who had planted the explosives were also handed down the death sentence by the Designated Court, but the Supreme Court commuted those to life. It said Yakub held a “commanding position”, as he made financial and travel arrangements for the other accused who later planted the explosives. He cannot escape the consequences of his role, but whether hanging him will be the appropriate punishment is something to be pondered over. The Memon family came under suspicion mainly because ‘Tiger’ Memon was the principal conspirator. They fuelled further suspicion by fleeing, and were later found to have travelled abroad on Pakistan passports. However, most of them, including Yakub, ultimately returned to India to face the legal consequences. In the overall circumstances of the case, it is certainly debatable whether Yakub Memon’s case would fall in the category of the “rarest of the rare” cases the Supreme Court itself laid down would merit the death penalty.
Yakub Memon’s impending execution on July 30 may not take place as scheduled, as he has shot off another mercy petition to the President. Under a landmark ruling in January 2014, the Supreme Court has humanised the way the state deals with death row convicts. In terms of that judgment, a convict cannot be executed for 14 days after the rejection of a clemency plea. An earlier mercy petition filed on his behalf by his brother was rejected by the President, but his own plea may have to be considered afresh. Taking into account the fact that in the last 22 years Yakub is the only one whose death sentence has been confirmed by the judiciary in the case, the executive itself can reduce his sentence to one of life instead of fuelling another round of litigation by rejecting his mercy petition. There will be an inevitable debate on how a man who played a significant role in the serial blasts, which left 257 dead and 713 people wounded, could be shown any mercy. Some will see the situation on merits, and others will voice their principled opposition to the death penalty. The only way to avoid this endless debate is to abolish the cruel and irreversible punishment of death itself.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/yakub-memon-death-sentence-a-case-for-mercy/article7452747.ece
23,7,2015,"Good in principle, tough to practise","The ill-effects of indiscriminate liquor consumption on standards of living and public health are well-known. It is for this reason that the Directive Principles of State Policy of the Constitution require the state to endeavour to bring about prohibition of intoxicating drinks and drugs except those for medicinal purposes. After the decision of the Kerala government to close down bars other than those in five-star hotels and to introduce prohibition in a phased manner, political parties in Tamil Nadu are increasingly talking of pushing for a ban on liquor if they come to power. The >Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam has now joined the >Pattali Makkal Katchi in campaigning for a ban, with its president M. Karunanidhi promising total prohibition if voted to power. Actually, it was Mr. Karunanidhi who in 1971 >withdrew prohibition in Tamil Nadu, going back on the policy formulated by DMK founder and former Chief Minister C.N. Annadurai. At that time, his argument was that prohibition cannot work in isolation. Although Kerala has taken a huge step toward restricting consumption, Tamil Nadu is by no means surrounded by liquor-free States. For instance, Puducherry, not far from Chennai, is known as a tippler’s paradise. Moreover, the State’s finances are shored up by revenue from liquor sales. Many of the government’s freebie schemes actually run on revenues from duties and taxes levied on liquor. Also, political functionaries at the lower levels of the hierarchy benefit hugely from bootlegging and the sale of illicit liquor during periods of prohibition. While many women’s groups support prohibition, the political will to crack down on illicit liquor will doubtless be weak in such circumstances. Any ban on liquor sales will necessarily have to co-exist with a spurt in bootlegging and illicit distillation.
As a policy, prohibition has met with little success anywhere in India. Even when it has helped bring down overall consumption, prohibition has led to loss of lives in hooch tragedies. The high levels of enforcement required for prohibition result in a severe drain on the State’s finances. Prohibition enforcement agencies often become enmeshed in corruption. Tamil Nadu, like Kerala, has had a history of hooch tragedies. In recent years, with the easy availability of liquor in rural areas, the State has been free of such deaths. Indeed, in 2002 the AIADMK government encouraged manufacturers to introduce cheaper liquor to wean away rural workers from hooch. If history offers any lessons, it will require enormous resources and tremendous political will for prohibition to succeed. So far, political parties have not shown the necessary political will, and governments have been unable to muster the needed resources.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/liquor-prohition-in-tamil-nadu/article7452748.ece
24,7,2015,Undervaluing privacy,"The Attorney General’s contention in the Supreme Court that privacy is not a fundamental right is disquieting in the context of the ongoing debate over the implications of the collection of biometric data from citizens. It is true that the AG was only replying to the question whether making people part with personal data was not an intrusion into their privacy, and saying that there is a need to defend the > Aadhaar scheme. However, the government’s stand may give rise to the doubt whether it is truly committed to protecting its citizens from violations of their privacy by the unauthorised use of information provided by them. The Constitution does not specify ‘right to privacy’ as a fundamental right, but the law on the subject has evolved considerably in India, and privacy is now seen as an ingredient of personal liberty. Identifying citizens for providing various services, maintaining security and crime-related surveillance and performing governance functions, all involve the collection of information. In recent years, owing to technological developments and emerging administrative challenges, several national programmes and schemes are being implemented through information technology platforms, using computerised data collected from citizens. With more and more transactions being done over the Internet, such information is vulnerable to theft and misuse. Therefore, it is imperative that any system of data collection should factor in privacy risks and include procedures and systems to protect citizen information.
The government faces a formidable legal challenge in implementing its ambitious unique identification programme. Pleas have been made before the Supreme Court questioning the lack of a statutory basis for the collection of biometric details, and the government has to meet this point to the court’s satisfaction. Instead of arguing that privacy is not a fundamental right, it would do well to assure the court that it has the technology and systems to protect the data collected. And that it would do everything possible to prevent unauthorised disclosure of or access to such data. A Group of Experts appointed by the Planning Commission and headed by Justice (retd.) A.P. Shah, came out with a comprehensive report in 2012 containing a framework for a Privacy Act. Such a law, it said, should recognise all dimensions of the right to privacy and address concerns about data safety, protection from unauthorised interception, surveillance, use of personal identifiers and bodily privacy. Underscoring a set of privacy principles, the committee said the underlying idea should be that the data controller should be accountable for the collection, processing and use to which data are put. In its zeal to aggregate data in electronic form and target subsidies better, the government cannot ignore its responsibility to protect citizens from the perils of the cyber era.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/privacy-not-a-fundamental-right-says-centre/article7457168.ece
24,7,2015,India and the IS,"The meteoric rise of Islamic State into a state-like apparatus from the detritus of the civil war and insurgency-riven Iraq and Syria has been well-documented. How the terror group has managed to retain control over territory it holds, through a mixture of brutality, fear and immense money power, has also been noted widely. What is perhaps less understood is how it has managed to draw recruits from all over the world. A tentative reason being offered is the radicalisation of some alienated Muslims even in countries that promote multiculturalism and the ease of assimilation of minority identities within the nation-state. Another is the spread and reach of exclusivist ideologies such as Wahhabism and Salafism that are being promoted by West Asian state actors. IS practises with virulence even more extreme versions of these.
It is in this context that the Union Home Ministry’s decision to formulate a coherent national strategy to take on IS and prevent Indians being recruited by it must be seen. Reports have indicated that less than a dozen Indians have joined IS in the past year, even as IS symbols have been seen in places such as Kashmir at rallies led by separatist groups. The NDA government and the Prime Minister have gone on record saying that IS has negligible support among Muslims in India. This is accurate. IS’s millenarian and medieval notions of Islam treats Muslims who do not adhere to its ideology, especially members of other non-Sunni sects of Islam, as apostates. Islam in India, on the other hand, has a broad syncretic reach; despite the presence of a fundamentalist streak among certain pockets, Islam in India has generally been spared from the overweening influence of West Asian Wahhabism or the Saudi version of Salafism. In other words, the possibility of the ideological influence of groups such as IS coming to play in India is limited. Yet, there is the distinct possibility of IS targeting or influencing disaffected youth among the community. Radical groups have spread their influence in the last decade owing to grievances and disaffection, following incidents such as the Babri Masjid demolition and the Gujarat riots, and some of them have linked up with terrorist groups. The Indian state’s ability to hold true to its secular fabric and to its Constitution will determine how far it can stem such disaffection. The threat of IS in India has to be tackled not just by means of a security-oriented response — through coordination among police and intelligence agencies as has been proposed by the Home Ministry — but also by ensuring that the grounds of this disaffection among India’s largest minority community are addressed in a just way.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/indias-strategy-to-tackle-islamic-state-spread/article7457170.ece
25,7,2015,Give the RBI its independence,"A new era in monetary policy formulation is set to start with the Union Finance Ministry releasing the revised draft of the Indian Financial Code (IFC). It provides for the setting up of a Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to debate on monetary affairs and decide the policy rate. This move is in line with practices in many of the developing countries where the central banks have pursued the committee approach to address monetary policy issues. Currently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the monetary policy regulator, goes by the views of a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on such issues. The TAC comprises officials from the RBI besides a few external experts. It advises the central banker on the monetary policy stance based on macro-economic and monetary developments. However, the RBI Governor has the last word, and the right to veto any decision of the TAC. The draft IFC, submitted by the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC) headed by former Supreme Court judge B.N. Srikrishna, has suggested that the MPC members be appointed after due consultations between the government and the RBI. It has also recommended that the government have three nominees in the seven-member MPC. The FSLRC, however, has recommended veto power for the RBI Governor. The revised draft circulated for public discussion by the Finance Ministry, however, seeks to vest in the government the power to nominate four members to the MPC. It proposes that no veto power be given to the Governor, and that at best he be allowed a casting vote to use in the event of a tie.
In the context of the continuing uneasy relationship between the fiscal and monetary bosses and in light of the changing dynamics of the domestic economy owing to assorted factors falling outside policy controls, the importance of a cohesive action plan should not be underestimated. Given this, it is not incorrect to allow the government a say in matters of monetary policy. The revised draft, however, seems to be trying to push too much of government into monetary matters. Seen in tandem with its earlier bid to remove from the RBI the public debt management function, this move only appears intended to undermine the RBI’s autonomy, which had actually succeeded in insuring the Indian economy against the profligate policies of successive governments, and the financial shenanigans in other economies. If the government is to have majority control in the MPC, what is the point of giving the RBI Governor the right to a casting vote? Fiscal bosses have fixed tenures, unlike institutions such as the RBI that are not subject to electoral cycles. Prudence suggests that RBI and like institutions must be allowed to function independently.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/give-the-rbi-its-independence/article7461269.ece
25,7,2015,A subsidy and some questions,"The Central government’s decision this week to extend the >interest subvention scheme on bank loans given to land-owning farmers at 7 per cent is essentially a welcome move. This is especially so in a context where there is no real clarity on how the current monsoon will turn out to be, running at a deficit of 7 per cent as it does currently. With an additional subvention component of 3 per cent to encourage timely repayment, farmers can effectively avail themselves of up to Rs. 3 lakh at just 4 per cent interest. This scheme, basically offering a sort of agricultural subsidy, has been in place since 2006-07, with the subvention component fluctuating between 1.5 and 3 per cent. With agricultural yield levels and incomes per acre falling or languishing, the need to extend such loans to farmers at low interest levels admittedly exists.
However, what is less clear is the purpose for which many of these loans are being put to. The Reserve Bank of India recently initiated an investigation into the apparent diversion of agricultural loans for unintended purposes. It would appear that farmers’ existing debts to money-lenders, weak supervision of credit utilisation and the categorisation of gold loans as agricultural loans are creating significant grey areas and avenues for loan amounts to be used for purposes other than farming. At certain points of the cropping cycle farmers need large amounts of money and they turn to money-lenders, who charge high rates of interest and often insist on their loans being re-paid first — which forces farmers to divert a part of the subsidised bank loans to repay them. Some farmers put the amounts in fixed deposit accounts to earn higher interest than what they pay. Most farmers do not earn enough to meet their needs, including consumption expenditure, and so these loans serve as an auxiliary source of income. The government needs to recognise the fact that the system of interest subvention will increasingly finance consumption rather than farming, and take one of two steps. It could instruct banks to step up scrutiny on the use the loan is being put to. Or it could rethink the manner in which it wants to subsidise farmers. Implementing direct transfers to bank accounts and investing in research and development to bolster crop yields should serve the same purpose that the low-interest loans currently serve. This step will have the added advantage of potentially improving the plight of farmers. The soft loans are a good idea that needs to be managed and supervised well in order to ensure that the intended outcomes are ensured, and that they help address actual distress in the field.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-subsidy-and-some-questions/article7461270.ece
27,7,2015,Contestation in Delhi,"After a brief respite, hostilities between Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal have resumed. The issue this time is the appointment of the chairperson of the Delhi Commission for Women. Two days after the Aam Aadmi Party government appointed Swati Maliwal, the Lieutenant Governor annulled the appointment, saying it had not been “properly processed”. In a letter to the Chief Minister, he also made the ludicrous claim that he was “the government of Delhi”. Mr. Jung’s latest exercise in overreach comes more than a month after he and Mr. Kejriwal met Home Minister Rajnath Singh and promised to resolve the issues between them amicably. It was then thought that both sides had realised that their game of one-upmanship was damaging the images of both, and affecting the interests of the people of Delhi. Yet, it seems little has changed. By continuing to interfere with the day-to-day affairs of the Delhi government in a brazen manner, Mr. Jung is disrespecting the massive mandate with which the people of Delhi returned the AAP to power; neither is he helping to dispel the notion that he is a puppet acting at the behest of the Central government.
There is now a broader context to the whole confrontation. Soon after taking office, Ms. Maliwal sought an appointment with the Lt. Governor to discuss a brutal incident in Delhi in which a 19-year-old girl was stabbed to death by two youths. Following that incident, the AAP has, by means of a series of emotive radio and television advertisements, ramped up its demand for more control over the Delhi Police. Ms. Maliwal’s appointment to a body that was previously seen as ineffectual is also part of a wider narrative in which the AAP is battling to ensure that the security of women in the national capital is taken more seriously than at present. By blocking the move on bureaucratic grounds, Mr. Jung, and the Union Home Ministry by extension, appear in extremely bad light. Thanks to the AAP’s continuous campaigning on the issue, and the associated drama of their now-regular tussles with the Lieutenant Governor, the issue of full statehood for Delhi has become an important topic of debate. Most Delhi-ites want the issue resolved, if only so that they can have an effective government again, rather than one that is forced to switch to agitation mode periodically. Chief Ministers and Lieutenant Governors here have worked together amicably earlier within the limitations of their positions, but given the current lack of cooperation on both sides it appears that the only way out of the impasse is a proper consideration of the demand for full statehood for Delhi, or a clearer interpretation of the rules that define power-sharing between the state administration and the Central government.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/contestation-in-delhi/article7467259.ece
27,7,2015,Signals from gold prices,"The yellow metal dominated the world market scene all of last week. Gold slumped to a five-year low, slipping to an intra-day low-point of $1,072.30 by Friday. A late rally that day, however, pushed prices back to around $1,100 an ounce. At best, it helped pare losses from last Monday when the price slid to its lowest since March 2009, to $1,088.05 an ounce. The Comex gold futures for August still ended their fifth consecutive week in negative territory. Though the rally suggests that there could be an improvement in market sentiment, the bearish undertone persists among retail investors. At the moment, everyone in the international marketplace is wary of gold. Indeed, price movement is set for an uncertain phase, at least in the near-term. The reasons behind the slipping interest in gold is not difficult to fathom. A looming rise in the U.S. interest rate, for the first time in nearly a decade, is playing the villain. At the moment, a stronger dollar remains the topic that dominates discussions in the marketplace. An inadvertent release on a rate forecast on the website of the Federal Reserve, though it was subsequently withdrawn, only helped to confound the confusion. Understandably, all eyes are now on the Federal Reserve. Will it pull the trigger on rate hikes? Nevertheless, the dipping global oil prices hold hope for investors in gold. A protracted oversupply situation, weak demand, the Greek crisis and the Chinese market fall have all come together to pull oil prices down. The fall of oil could yet prove a rescuer for gold. If there is a serious consequential fallout on U.S. domestic inflation, the oil price fall could slow the Fed’s tightening policy. A sustained recovery in gold prices, it appears, is inversely related to the growth prospects of the U.S. economy.
What does the fall in gold prices portend for India? The country consumes 800 to 900 tonnes of the metal annually, and depends on imports to meet its entire demand. Gold and oil comprise a large part of India’s imports in terms of value, and consequently they are major contributors to the country's trade deficit. To an extent, the fall in gold prices could moderate the import bill in the near-term. There is a flip-side to this, though. A strengthening dollar could nullify the impact of the fall in gold prices. Indians have traditionally attached a sentimental value to gold. Given this, the government has to go the extra mile to coax them to park idle gold in banks and earn interest. The situation is tailor-made for the Central government to exploit this to its advantage. The proposed gold monetisation scheme, for example, must be made a lot more simpler and common man-friendly to aid this process.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/signals-from-gold-prices/article7467260.ece
28,7,2015,Terror at the border,"The terrorist attack on civilians and a police station in Gurdaspur district might have been the first such serious incident in Punjab in the last two decades, but it is of a piece with the recent violence from across the border in the Jammu region. The border district is situated close to Jammu, and the attackers would have found it a soft target. Any part of India close to the Jammu region could just as easily have been their target. After security was stepped up in the border areas of Jammu and Kashmir, militants operating from across the border appear to have been forced to take other routes close to Jammu to carry out assaults. Of late, terrorists have targeted not only army camps but also civilians in Hindu-majority Jammu. Although Pakistan-based militants would like to keep the focus on Jammu and Kashmir, any attack close to the Jammu region would serve their purpose. The Uri-Jalandhar highway runs close to the border with Pakistan at Pathankot near Gurdaspur, and provides access to the Jammu region from a section of the border that is not as heavily guarded as stretches in Jammu and Kashmir. If the Gurdaspur attack signifies anything, it is that militants are ready to shift their targets, and make a mockery of India’s efforts to secure the border districts.
For Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, the immediate challenge it seemed was to counter the impression that the attack had something to do with the demand for Khalistan. That the militants were suicide attackers who were intent on fighting till the very end, unlike the Khalistani militants in the 1980s who predominantly adopted hit-and-run tactics, allowed him to assert that the attack was not an indication of any revival of terrorism in the State. Also, the attackers were reported to have shouted Islamist slogans. However, irrespective of these facts, intelligence agencies have been warning of a rise in pro-Khalistan activity. Last month, the Research and Analysis Wing had sent a report to the Union Home Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office on the “Khalistan liberation movement” finding support in Pakistan, as also in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, France and the Maldives. The government needs to take threats from this quarter also seriously. The dastardly attack in Gurdaspur is a major setback to the confidence-building process initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif during their meeting in Ufa earlier this month. There can be no let-up on India’s part in countering acts of aggression from across the border. But attacks such as the latest one should not deter efforts to engage Pakistan in talks. It is crucial that Pakistan be made to realise the futility of nurturing militants on its soil as a strategy against India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/terror-at-the-border/article7470865.ece
28,7,2015,Positive turn in Bangladesh,"The Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s (BNP) decision to drop its demand for the formation of a caretaker government under whose charge parliamentary elections would be held, offers a fresh opportunity to resolve an extended political deadlock. Bangladesh has seen a political crisis since the re-election of the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League government in January 2014. The Khaleda Zia-led BNP and other opposition parties boycotted the poll after their demand for elections under a neutral caretaker was rejected. As a result, the election became a one-horse race, raising questions about the government’s democratic credentials. Since then, the BNP and its hardline Islamist ally Jamaat-e-Islami had been fighting street battles. Too often since the authoritarian H.M. Ershad era, Bangladesh has seen political instability due to the game of one-upmanship between the two leading political parties, with election and Parliament boycotts and incessant agitations becoming all too common. Nearly 19 months after the controversial election, perhaps having realised that the non-parliamentary oppositional politics was weakening the party, Ms. Zia indicated that she was ready for a compromise.
The animosity and mistrust between the two main parties have cost Bangladesh dear. While the BNP and the Jamaat resorted to violent protests, the government responded in a determined manner to crush the opposition. Political violence has been steadily on the rise since the last election, while many have criticised the undemocratic bent of the Hasina government. The situation remains volatile with forces opposed to secularism and democracy waiting to grab any opportunity to push their agenda. It is no secret that the Islamists have been aggressively trying to capitalise from the political mess. The Jamaat in particular has been at odds with the Sheikh Hasina government after two of its leaders were hanged for “crimes against humanity” committed during the 1971 Liberation War. Moreover, there was the real danger of the military finding a pretext for another political intervention if the law and order situation had worsened. It is against this background that the BNP has signalled a softening of its position. The Sheikh Hasina government should seize this opportunity and break the impasse, adopting a more conciliatory approach ahead of elections. The BNP should rethink its alliance with the Jamaat, and abandon the tactics it has been resorting to. Reinforcing secular democratic principles, on the basis of which Sheikh Mujibur Rahman led Bangladesh to freedom, should be the way forward. A proper concert of an effective government and an opposition in Parliament is an imperative for a democracy, especially for a fledgling one such as this.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/positive-turn-in-bangladesh/article7470866.ece
29,7,2015,Inhuman and unconscionable,"Judicial finality need not necessarily mean that India should hang Yakub Memon. Even in this situation, as his life >hangs on the slender thread of a fresh mercy plea to the President, is the irreversible and inhuman sentence of death the only recourse for a democratic government?
Carrying out the sentence will only have the appearance of a justice that is retributive and vengeful, not substantial or morally different from the very offence that gave rise to the proceedings. In recent times, we saw the horrific judicial murder of Afzal Guru, who was hanged in secret without a final opportunity for his family to meet him, marking an unprecedented abandonment of morality on the part of the state. It was only in apparent cognisance of this that the Supreme Court ruled early last year that a formal communication to the convict and his family, intimation to the local legal aid centre and a clear gap of 14 days between the communication and the execution were necessary. Further, there are bound to be questions each time someone is hanged or spared. Even in the Mumbai blasts case, the 10 men sentenced to death by the trial court for planting the explosives were given only life terms by the Supreme Court on appeal, while Yakub Memon alone was awarded the death penalty. Such distinctions may seem arbitrary to the layman. As also, the revelation that the Memon family may have been induced to return to India will cast a shadow on the legitimacy of hanging a man who cooperated with Indian agencies.
The debate on the need and desirability of retaining the death penalty has been overshadowed by much intellectual exertion on the nature of the crime involved, its gravity, its heinousness and the fatalities it caused. The time has come to end this debate once and for all by ascending to a moral position that there shall be no death penalty on the statute book, regardless of the heinousness of the offence, the circumstances or the number of fatalities involved. Anyone following closely the evolution of the law on death sentences and the clemency jurisdiction in India will understand that the Supreme Court is making it more and more difficult for the executive to carry out death sentences. It has evolved a jurisprudence that limits capital punishment to the ‘rarest of rare cases’, allowed a post-appeal review as well as a curative petition, and made decisions on appeals for mercy justiciable. It has laid down a cast-iron rule against undue delay in disposing of such mercy pleas, and it has humanised the process by repeatedly intervening in favour of condemned prisoners, often at the very last minute. A truly lasting solution to the moral dilemma that each instance of capital punishment poses will be to abolish it altogether and replace it with a sentence of imprisonment for the rest of the convict’s life. The quality of mercy is not strained. The President, under Article 72 of the Constitution, has the power to grant pardon, and to suspend, remit or commute sentences. To not exercise this expansive power in the service of mercy would be inhuman and unconscionable.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-hindus-view-on-yakub-memon-verdict/article7477992.ece
29,7,2015,Igniting minds,"In the passing away of former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, India has lost not only a visionary scientist and an institution-builder, but also a staunch nationalist who was an inspirational figure for people across generations. Turning India into a developed country of the first world was his dream, and he set about making this a reality through words and deeds, first as scientist, then as the President, and later, till the very end, as an ordinary citizen. Kalam began as a civilian rocket engineer and metamorphosed into a missile technologist, but it is as the “people’s president”, as the first citizen who was accessible and who stopped to listen to the grievances of ordinary men and women that he won the love and affection of his countrymen. In the fields of civilian space and military missile technologies, Kalam put India on the world map by laying strong indigenous foundations for them. When India joined the exclusive club of spacefaring nations comprising the U.S., Russia, France, Japan and China on July 18, 1980, Kalam was the Project Director of the Satellite Launch Vehicle-3 in the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Since then, India has joined the world leaders in satellite launches and space research.
Kalam’s tenure in the Defence Research and Development Organisation and as the director of the Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL) at Hyderabad heralded immense achievements in missile technology; he was part of the team that envisioned India’s Guided Missile Development Programme. Projects such as the development of the Prithvi, Akash, Trishul and Nag missiles were undertaken. Kalam also insisted on the development of a strategic missile with re-entry technology, resulting in the Agni missile. He insisted that both ISRO and DRDO develop composites such as carbon-carbon, fibre-reinforced plastic, etc to make motor casings lighter so that the vehicles can carry a heavier payload. His consortium approach led to the indigenous development of phase shifters, magnesium alloys, ram-rocket motors and servo-valves for missiles. As scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, he helped conduct India’s nuclear tests at Pokhran in May 1998. But more than as a scientist and a technocrat, Kalam will be remembered for his tenure as India’s 11th president, when he moved the institution away from being merely formal and ceremonial in nature. He used the presidency as a platform to inspire youth, who were readily impressed by his earthy demeanour and discursive approach to public speaking. The missile man had his critics, but India’s most popular president leaves behind the legacy of more than one generation of inspired Indians.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/igniting-minds/article7474635.ece
29,7,2015,Agrarian distress and suicides,"Too much of public discourse on farmer suicides could bring on unseemly haggling over the numbers. Activists and the media rightly question loopholes in the National Crime Records Bureau data, pointing out that several State governments often report no farm suicides, contrary to local media reportage. However, there is also much needless suspicion and conspiracy-theorising; the NCRB’s data are from police station-level First Information Reports, and FIRs are often contested documents, not conclusive proof. Attacking the NCRB for the numbers rising or falling is illogical; media reports about the NCRB changing definitions or manipulating the data this year are demonstrably false. For the government’s part, it could start by accepting that these numbers are the bare minimum, unlike Chhattisgarh’s Agriculture Minister who responded by insisting that no farmer had killed himself and the NCRB must be wrong. Moreover, while the NCRB lists several reasons, including marital and family problems and illness, as the causes of farm suicides, this should not be taken as the gospel truth; initial police reports often have little to do with the complex factors that drive someone to take his or her life. The government would do better to study more scientifically what is driving farmers to take their own lives at the rate of over one every hour.
What’s clear is that suicides represent only the tip of the iceberg that is agrarian distress in India. So far in July, an estimated 90 farmers have taken their lives in Karnataka, while the government and the media struggle to understand the immediate catalyst; these did not occur in the State’s drought-prone regions, nor was there a sudden crop failure or similar emergency. Interviews with farmers in the region have pointed to lack of institutional credit as one of the major problems, an issue that has been repeated by farmers across the country, including in the suicide epicentres of Vidarbha and Marathwada in Maharashtra. The income of an average farm household is just over Rs.6,400 a month, National Sample Survey Office data show, and this is grossly inadequate to meet consumption demands, not to mention rising input costs. Only households with over one hectare make more than they spend, and they constitute less than 35 per cent of all farm households. This leaves over half of all farm households in debt. These are no small debts; the average amount outstanding for a farm household today is Rs.47,000. These must be extremely heavy burdens for them. Farm suicides, whether owing to purely agricultural reasons like crop failure, or the complex pressures on an Indian farmer, must be tackled seriously on the basis of a comprehensive examination of the causative factors, and the context.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/agrarian-distress-and-suicides/article7474636.ece
30,7,2015,A coherent response,"Monday’s terrorist attack in Gurdaspur, Punjab, underlines the theory that the rogue elements in Pakistan would go to any extent to sabotage any breakthrough in India-Pakistan ties. The timing of the attack is hardly lost on anyone. Ever since the joint statement by India and Pakistan in Ufa, Russia earlier this month, the border region has been restive. The Prime Ministers’ meeting was immediately followed by firing across the Line of Control. Apropos Gurdaspur, initial reports suggest that terrorists based in Pakistan crossed the border into Punjab to carry out the attacks. This marked the first major terror attack in Punjab in the last two decades, setting alarm bells ringing in New Delhi for a number of reasons. First, it shows the terrorists based in Pakistan have now started targeting border towns outside Jammu and Kashmir. Second, there were recent reports that Sikh extremists were finding support in Pakistan, among other countries, triggering fears about the dormant Sikh militancy. Punjab could yet be a potential target of terrorists, something that New Delhi should be aware of. Third, such attacks obviously pose challenges to the normalisation of ties between the two countries.
The attacks have already led to the rise of demands for a “strong response” to Pakistan. In a clear change of tone, Home Minister Rajnath Singh has said India wants peace with Pakistan but not “at the cost of national honour”. But knee-jerk reactions cannot serve India’s strategic purposes as that is precisely the response the rogue elements in Pakistan seek. Instead, New Delhi should take a positive view of its recent policy of engagement with Pakistan, in place since the 2003 ceasefire. Apart from the sporadic cross-border firing, the border areas have been largely peaceful compared to the far more turbulent 1990s. India should take this policy of engagement forward, addressing both its internal security and peace-building with the neighbour through a multi-pronged Pakistan policy. India should prepare itself to prevent future terror attacks by bolstering its counter-terror and intelligence capacities further. Bilaterally, New Delhi should continue the dialogue with Islamabad and improve upon mechanisms that address border incidents. Internationally, India should not hesitate to raise Pakistan’s dual policy towards terrorism with the Pakistani army’s close allies such as the U.S. and China in bilateral and multinational forums. India can deal with Pakistan using an “iron fist in a velvet glove”.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-coherent-response/article7478104.ece
31,7,2015,A probe that lost its way,"The Delhi Police deserve credit for unearthing corruption in cricket, not once but twice in the last 15 years. In 2000, they stumbled upon sensational tapes indicating a deep bookie-player nexus; and in 2013 they detected spot-fixing during that year’s Indian Premier League tournament. If the earlier probe led to South African captain Hansie Cronje making a contrite admission, two years ago, three players — S. Sreesanth, Ajit Chandila and Ankeet Chavan — were among those arrested in a dramatic swoop. It was seen as the beginning of a cleansing process. Unfortunately, these achievements were not built upon by the Delhi Police. A sessions court in Delhi has now discharged all the 36 suspects arraigned for cheating, conspiracy and organised crime. The probe seems to have been so shoddy that there was not enough evidence even to frame charges. The move to invoke the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act to strengthen the case seems to have failed. The link with the Dawood Ibrahim crime syndicate was quite tenuous and limited to a few suspicious phone calls. The judge threw out the charge of organised crime and conspiracy easily. She concluded that even if the charges of receiving money from bookies and concealing it were true, these did not amount to cheating; what was caused to spectators was just disgust, and not wrongful loss.
That sporting corruption can be identified but allowed to slip through the definition of any law is disturbing. In similar circumstances, a British court had little difficulty in convicting Pakistani cricketers and sending them off to prison. The match-fixing phenomenon has been crying for a systemic response since the turn of the century, but there has been no effort so far to come up with a legal framework and a set of appropriate punishments to deal with it. The latest outcome is a big setback to efforts to deal with corruption in cricket. As far as the players are concerned, their discharge has understandably raised their hopes of getting the life ban on them revoked. They have reason to be aggrieved that they were put through the humiliation of arrest, imprisonment and judicial process that kept them out of the game and tainted their reputation, for two years. However, the BCCI has not yet agreed to lift the ban, saying the action against them was based on an internal disciplinary hearing and not linked to the criminal case. In this, the Board is right, as the standard of evidence for a criminal trial is substantively different from what it is in disciplinary proceedings. The BCCI must wait to see if the Delhi Police seek revision of the court order before considering a revocation of the ban.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-probe-that-lost-its-way/article7482870.ece
31,7,2015,Clearing roadblocks,"The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has taken one more step towards the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax, set to come into effect in April 2016, by dealing with several issues regarding the regime that have, in the past, served as substantial roadblocks to its implementation. The first of these has to do with the quantum of compensation to be paid to the States in case the revenue generated as GST falls short of what they have so far been earning through the existing tax system. Earlier, the Central government had agreed to provide the States compensation at the rate of 100 per cent for three years, 75 per cent in the fourth year, and 50 per cent in the fifth year. However, in June 2015 the States raised a fresh demand of full compensation for all five years, which at the time the Centre termed as a move that could potentially delay the roll-out of GST as scheduled. Another major sticking point was the 1 per cent additional tax on the supply of goods. This provision was added to the Bill on the insistence of the States that lead on the manufacturing front. They had argued that they should be compensated for the investment they had already made in manufacturing infrastructure. Many States opposed this additional tax saying, perhaps rightly, that it went against the spirit of the GST system and that it would have a cascading impact on prices. In fact, even Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian had at the time warned of the negative impact of the additional tax. The question to be asked is, what is the point of implementing a consolidated tax, only to have piecemeal levies added to it?
The Cabinet on Wednesday cleared an amendment by which the States will get to fulfil their wish of full compensation for five years, a move that should bring most of them on board without any of the reservations they currently hold. Regarding the 1 per cent additional tax, the Cabinet took a more circumspect route, exempting stock transfers within group companies from the additional tax on inter-State supplies, but keeping the overall tax in place. That issue may still see some resistance from some States. These nevertheless represent significant steps towards the implementation of GST by the April 2016 deadline, as they are solutions to the most significant hurdles faced by the Bill. The government and the Cabinet must be commended on their speedy handling of these issues since GST represents one of the most significant rounds of tax reform to be implemented, and it has the potential to benefit all those involved — the Centre, the States, the private sector, and consumers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/clearing-roadblocks/article7482869.ece
1,8,2015,A right and the reality,"The decision of the expert committee appointed by the Supreme Court to allow a minor who was raped, to undergo an abortion after 24 weeks of gestation, is a welcome one. And doctors thus initiated the procedure on the young person on Friday. In referring the case to the panel, the court looked beyond the rule book, while treating the right to life as a revered constitutional principle. Is the right to life absolutely inviolate? Earlier this week the court allowed the three-member committee to decide whether >the appellant, a 14-year-old, could undergo the abortion if it was “immediately necessary to save the life of the mother”. One of the judges wondered about the future of the foetus, practically in the sixth month of gestation. Under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act of 1971 it is legal for a registered medical practitioner to do the procedure within 20 weeks of gestation if “the continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or of grave injury [to] physical or mental health.” In cases of rape, the law says, the anguish caused by pregnancy shall be presumed to constitute a grave injury to the mental health of the woman. In the case of a person below 18, the decision should be taken by a guardian.
All such extenuating circumstances are applicable in this case — except that the appellant is a minor, and it is four weeks too late under the law. Obstetricians hold that while considering an abortion, a period of four more weeks does not really make a material difference. Going through with a pregnancy after a rape and having to raise a baby, could be extremely traumatic. Technological options for medical termination of pregnancy are far more advanced today than in earlier days, and the procedure, if done in a hospital setting with adequate support, can be safe enough for the mother. In fact, in cases where major fetal anomalies are detected at an advanced stage of pregnancy, termination is being done even up to 32 weeks, taking into account the health of mother and baby. Delivered at 24 weeks, a foetus will be extremely pre-term, with the possibility of developing major disabilities. On the count of the age of the survivor, there is a precedent, too: in a 1993 judgment, a Bench of the Madras High Court held that minors who are mature enough to understand the consequences of opting or not opting for an abortion must be allowed to make their own decisions. The state, ultimately, needs to look at its role in protecting the right to life from an expansive point of view. For the law is, obviously, more than the sum of its rules.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-right-and-the-reality-editorial-on-a-14yearold-rape-victims-abortion-case/article7486386.ece
1,8,2015,Taliban transition,"Mullah Omar had been a mysterious man. The world knew little about him, or his rise to power in Afghanistan through the mechanism of the Taliban. The Islamist government he imposed on the 30 million people of the country was largely cut off from the outside world during its repressive and misogynistic run from 1996 to 2001. After it was toppled following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001, Omar went into hiding. This week, the Afghan government and then the Taliban >confirmed he was dead. While the full details are still not available, it raises several questions about the brutal organisation that he led. The Taliban is today far from being a united force: one section is talking with the Afghan government while the political office, established in Qatar, has publicly disowned that process. On the other hand, its military wing has launched a deadly offensive against the Afghan troops, whose position weakened after most of the multinational troops withdrew from the country early this year. One possible explanation is that the divisions have run deeper after >Omar’s death. It remains to be seen whether Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour, who has been named Omar’s successor, would indeed be able to hold the group together. He is already facing competition from Omar’s 26-year-old son Mullah Yaqub, and also from former military commander Abdul Qayum Zakir. Besides, the Taliban is facing heat from the Islamic State, which is trying to poach from its ranks.
But the key question that the Afghan authorities face today is whether they could turn Omar’s death to their advantage in the civil war with the Taliban. There is little evidence to suggest that such a turnaround is in the offing. If Afghan intelligence reports that Omar died two years ago are indeed true, then it should be clear that the Taliban has been carrying out its recent attacks, including one on the Afghan Parliament, without its most infamous leader around. This should suggest that its operational efficiency remains intact. Also, though the Taliban’s internal problems remain, the government has still not developed a viable strategy to exploit the divisions. Above all, Afghanistan should become more proactive in getting the international powers to pressure Pakistan over its alleged links with the Taliban. The appointment of Sirajuddin Haqqani as the Taliban’s deputy leader itself raises questions about Pakistan intelligence’s complicity in the leadership selection process. The Haqqani terror network, now led by Sirajuddin Haqqani, is known for its ties with the Inter-Services Intelligence. President Ashraf Ghani should evolve a strategy, with help from his government’s international backers, which addresses the flaws in its approach to the Taliban. Omar’s death provides an opportunity. The Afghan government should seize it to decisive effect.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/taliban-transition-editorial-on-mullah-omars-death/article7486387.ece
3,8,2015,The logjam should end,"Parliament is halfway through the monsoon session, and the government-opposition deadlock persists. The Bharatiya Janata Party has not conceded the demand for the resignation of External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, both for their controversial role in the Lalit Modi travel documents saga, and of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Chouhan, embroiled in the deadly Vyapam scandal. It seems to believe that doing so would amount to an admission of guilt and weakness. The opposition, particularly the Congress and the Left parties, remains adamant that their resignations should precede any discussion. Thus far there has been little effort by the government to engage the opposition, barring a half-hearted effort by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to call some leaders for a meeting; but that ended in a boycott. On Thursday, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan called an all-party meeting. But her objective was limited: to appeal to MPs not to enter the well of the House or display any placards. But going by what has happened since then, her request has not been heeded. However, the Speaker extracted a promise from Home Minister Rajnath Singh that an all-party meeting would be called: that is slated for Monday. But the Congress has clarified its participation would be contingent on Prime Minister Narendra Modi making a ‘tangible’ proposal to end the deadlock. The aggressive posture adopted by senior BJP Ministers on Sunday does not augur well for the meeting.
Clearly, the impasse must end: in the fortnight since the session started, not one law has been enacted. And one account suggests over Rs. 20 crore has been lost to the disruptions. The Congress seems to say it has taken its cue from the BJP’s disruptive tactics during the decade it led the United Progressive Alliance. But this is untenable, beyond a point. The government, on its part, has displayed arrogance in not reaching out, not even conceding the demand that the Prime Minister himself explain in Parliament why he is defending Ms. Swaraj, Ms. Raje and Mr. Chouhan. Parliament’s importance lies in its providing an institutionalised context for discussions by people who represent all sections. There is a greater legitimacy to their discussions than that of the many groups that have sprung up outside claiming that they represent the people. MPs elected to office, and Parliament, constitute a microcosm of the larger polity. It does not matter that politics is adversarial — that is how it should be. But slogan-shouting cannot be a substitute for substantive debates. If discussions do not take place in Parliament, MPs begin to cede space to non-parliamentary actors, vitiating the decision-making process. In the process, people could lose faith in parliamentary democracy itself. That will be a dangerous prospect indeed for India, and it is for MPs from across the political divide to make the needed change.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-logjam-should-end/article7492139.ece
3,8,2015,Challenges of conflict diplomacy,"The abduction of four teachers in Libya by militants is another reminder of the dangers facing Indians working in crisis zones abroad. India was one of the worst-affected by the chaos and instability in the Arab world in recent times. Thousands of Indians who were in countries such as Syria, Libya, Iraq and Yemen were brought home following civil strife or wars. But a substantial number of them are still there, including in extremely dangerous places such as Sirte, where those abducted last week were working, driven by their need for financial sustenance. India clearly needs to be more proactive in its conflict diplomacy to ensure its citizens’ safety. To be sure, it is not easy to sustain diplomatic and other security channels up and running in such contexts. Libya is a case in point. After Muammar Qadhafi, who was in many ways a unifying force, it is under the hold of different militias. The anti-Qadhafi rebellion in 2011 involved a wide range of them, from secularists to moderate Islamists to hardline Salafists. Once the regime fell, they turned against one another, and no central authority could exercise control. This fractured political landscape makes Libya a dangerous place for both work and diplomacy.
But such chaos should not hold India back from opening and sustaining diplomatic and security channels. In the recent past, India has done a commendable job in evacuating its citizens from conflict-hit countries. But its track record in rescuing its citizens from kidnappers has been a mixed one. While it managed to bring back some 100 nurses who were held by Islamic State in Iraq a year ago, the fate of 39 other Indians abducted by militants in June 2014 from Mosul is still unclear. Two of those taken from the outskirts of Sirte last week are still in captivity. India cannot afford to leave such cases unresolved as many of its citizens will continue to work in conflict zones abroad. It needs to have a contingency plan to deal with such situations. It should frequently and systematically update its citizens working overseas, particularly in West Asia and North Africa (WANA), on the security situation there through advisories. Even while being mindful of the livelihood concerns involved, people living in extremely dangerous areas such as Sirte and Mosul should be persuaded to return, much the same way those who were in Yemen or Syria were brought back. The national security establishment should actively cultivate ties with influential actors in the region, to help solve issues such as kidnappings. More important, New Delhi should prudently stay out of the conflicts in the Arab world. Its stakes are high as millions of Indians are working in the WANA region.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/challenges-of-conflict-diplomacy/article7492140.ece
4,8,2015,Abdication of responsibility,"Far from helping find a way to end the impasse in Parliament, the decision of Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan to suspend 25 Congress members from the House for five days will only escalate the confrontation between the government and the opposition over the Lalit Modi affair and the Vyapam corruption case. No one disputes the powers of the Speaker to act to ensure order in the House, but democratic functioning requires more than just obeying rules to the letter. While exercising her authority to suspend members for “persistently and wilfully obstructing the business” of the House, Ms. Mahajan did not do justice to her role as facilitator of free and open debate in the Lok Sabha. Instead of being a model for Speakers of State legislatures, she followed the example of the presiding officers of some States who suspend members routinely to ensure smooth passage for the treasury benches through politically inconvenient sessions. Indeed, Ms. Mahajan was seen as having acted in the manner of the presiding officers of the Gujarat Assembly when Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister, prompting Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge to remark that the “Gujarat model” was being brought into Parliament. The Speaker’s verdict on whether the conduct of a member is “grossly disorderly” is final, and there is no doubt that Congress members came into the well and shouted slogans without allowing the conduct of proceedings. But muzzling debate is anathema to parliamentary democracy, and suspensions should have been only the last resort.
Unfortunately, instead of reaching out to the opposition and extending tangible assurances on ensuring the accountability of those in positions of power, the government appeared happy to show up the opposition as being disruptive. Meetings with opposition leaders were convened, but the end objective seems to have been to suspend some Congress members. Not only was the government unwilling to yield on the demand for the resignation of External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje over the Lalit Modi affair, and of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on the Vyapam case, it was also peremptorily dismissive of all allegations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not ready to engage the opposition leaders directly in discussions, and instead let his Ministers make some half-hearted measures. At stake are the political accountability of those in power and the democratic functioning of Parliament. Like the opposition, the government too holds the responsibility for the smooth conduct of the business of the House. To invoke the powers to suspend merely because the government failed in its efforts to persuade, is but an abdication of that responsibility.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/abdication-of-responsibility/article7496817.ece
4,8,2015,Freedom after many midnights,"Even the sternest of critics of Indian foreign policy will find it a tough task to question some of the diplomatic feats that New Delhi has managed to notch up of late. The settlement of the dispute related to the maritime boundary with Bangladesh in July 2014, albeit after an intervention by an international tribunal, was one of these. And as if to mark its anniversary, the long-running land boundary dispute was buried in July. The enclaves on both sides were exchanged quickly after the required formalities by the midnight of July 31. Settlement of inter-country disputes — especially those that involve sacrifice of territory — are always the most remarkable of achievements, howsoever cordial their relationships might be. So settling a dispute that involved issues that ran counter to the very opening lines of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations, that recognises ‘equal and inalienable rights’ of the ‘human family’ to ‘freedom, justice and peace’, is a creditable achievement. Indeed, the enclave issue involved the denial of the right to freedom and justice to many. It had its roots in Partition. Now, as the national flags of the respective countries fly in the 162 former enclaves, it is time for the state to set up the infrastructure as quickly as possible to mitigate the trauma of citizens who lived without a country for decades. From now on, the diplomats’ responsibilities are less than those of the local administrative authorities.
The enclave question was tossed around for too long and was never seriously acted upon. The obfuscation of justice helped none. Now the questions of citizenship and legality can be redefined. The ‘illegal Bangladeshis’ of the enclaves — predominantly those from the minority community — have become ‘legal’ because the states felt the time was conducive to award the ‘inalienable right’ to the poorest of the poor. Perhaps if there were different sets of political parties, leaders or diplomats in both the national capitals, the enclave-dwellers would still have been considered ‘a security threat’ and arrested across the line, as was being done until just last week. There are more people now crossing continents and concertina wires for survival — more often than not without state-stamped papers — and thus it may well be the time to recollect and record the memories of our nationals who suffered just for being born in the enclaves. Maybe what we need now is not a powerful state or a diplomat, but a historian to document the plethora of personal narratives on both sides, which are otherwise bound to be forgotten. For in the words of Tolstoy, “Historians are like deaf people who go on answering questions that no one has asked them.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/freedom-after-many-midnights/article7496812.ece
5,8,2015,Breakthrough in Nagaland,"Good beginnings are no guarantee to good outcomes. India has taken a big step forward in ending the protracted Naga insurgency by signing a framework agreement with the largest and most prominent of the armed Naga groups, the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah). However, not all the major issues stand sorted out with this agreement, and some smaller groups have not been part of the decisive phases of the peace process. While the Khole-Kitovi and the Reformation factions, which are not party to the present accord, have signed a ceasefire agreement with the government, the Khaplang faction of the NSCN, active in the eastern areas of Nagaland and with bases across the border in Myanmar, remains hostile to the engagement with the Isak-Muivah faction. The NSCN (Khaplang) is known to have carried out a deadly ambush on Army personnel in Manipur in June 2015 as a way of communicating its opposition to the evolving accord with the I-M faction, and demonstrating its capabilities. The NSCN (K) seems to have forged an alliance with other disgruntled splinter groups that are in opposition to the course taken by the I-M faction. Thus, while the agreement with the NSCN (I-M) is a breakthrough in the decades-long peace process, the Government of India will have to bear in mind that many of the players of the insurgency are still not on board, and several issues do not have a settled look yet.
To make matters worse for groups that are not part of the agreement, and that feel left out of the process, details of the accord have not been made public yet. There is no clarity on the controversial “sovereignty” demand that was central to the I-M group’s negotiations strategy, or on the demand for the creation of a Nagalim or Greater Nagaland that is tied to claims on the territories of the neighbouring States of Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. Issues relating to sovereignty and territories of other States offer no easy solution. For this agreement to hold, and to be built upon, the government needs to involve all the stakeholders, including other groups and members of Naga civil society, and representatives of the neighbouring States. Otherwise, the present agreement, which is no doubt a landmark event in the decades-long history of the insurgency, could falter in the months ahead. To recognise the Naga sense of identity without acceding to claims on the territories of other States, to allow the people of Nagaland greater autonomy in deciding their own lives and future without allowing concessions on the sovereignty of India: these are the challenges before the government. The agreement provides a basis for pushing ahead on these aspects, and is a hard-earned opportunity that should not be lost.

5,8,2015,Victory over Ebola,"The alacrity and eagerness shown by the research community to find a safe and efficacious vaccine against the deadly Ebola virus has borne fruit. The interim results of a Phase III clinical trial in Guinea using a novel virus vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV) have shown 100 per cent efficacy after 10 days of vaccination. People who received it three weeks after randomisation (delayed vaccination) served as the control group. Since the estimated efficacy is based on results from a small group of volunteers comprising 2,014 people who were vaccinated immediately after randomisation, the actual efficacy level will be known only when it is tested on a larger population. According to the World Health Organization, which sponsored and led the trial, the efficacy will be between 75 and 100 per cent. Given the promise, the trial is set to continue with everyone who has come in direct contact with an infected person (index case) and those exposed to the primary contacts set to receive the vaccine immediately. As of July 26, there have been 3,786 cases and 2,520 deaths in Guinea since the first outbreak more than a year ago; according to the WHO, as of July 26 there have been 27,748 cases and 11,279 deaths from Ebola in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
The virus is transmitted through direct contact with the body fluids of a sick person or a cadaver. Given the falling incidence, the Ebola c¸a Suffit (“Ebola this is Enough”) trial used a novel “ring” vaccination design, that was earlier used for smallpox eradication in the 1970s; people at high risk of infection owing to direct contact with an index patient or who had been exposed to the primary contacts, were chosen. Considering that people were suspicious of health-care workers during the initial stages of the outbreak, the active participation of families and communities in identifying those at risk for the trial is a testimony to the commitment to win the war against the virus. In addition to the protection that is extended to those who have been vaccinated, the trial has confirmed that the ring vaccination strategy will “most likely” be effective at the population level by creating herd immunity. Thus the vaccine can “hopefully stop” disease transmission in Guinea once it is administered to all the contacts. Similar results can be expected when the vaccine is used in Liberia and Sierra Leone. This is a big victory and a much needed weapon to fight the virus that killed many, devastated economies and caused the health-care systems to collapse in the three countries. The vigil should now continue, and it should be ensured that Ebola never makes a comeback anywhere on earth.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/victory-over-ebola/article7499868.ece
10,8,2015,Democracy’s essence,"India’s fundamental >belief in democracy is often taken as a given, but it is instructive to understand the basis and strength of this belief. A new national survey by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies shows that in 2013, under half the country unequivocally preferred democracy as the best form of government in all cases; the outcome was the same when a similar survey was conducted in 2005. The proportion of those who believe that an authoritarian government is acceptable in some cases has grown, but at 11 per cent it remains a minority view, and significantly lower than those with the same view in neighbouring Pakistan. Among the poor, the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, the preference for democracy was not what was significantly higher, but indifference as to the type of government. Satisfaction in the functioning of democracy has declined sharply in India, and with it, presumably, the belief that a form of government in which one notionally has a voice is the most desirable. Preference for authoritarianism was higher among those with the highest media exposure, those who lived in metros, those who were rich and those who were college-educated — groups for which democracy has delivered much more than for the marginalised sections, yet among whom such conservative views are growing. Even among those who identify themselves as democrats, many believe a strong leader would do well to take decisions on his or her own and do away with elections and Parliament, the survey reveals. Perhaps this reflects frustration with a system which while representative is simply not delivering equally and efficiently to all.
India would do well to watch out for the growth of such authoritarian tendencies, especially when they come in the garb of patriotism. This is evident, for instance, in the branding of criticism of the death penalty as “anti-national” and in support, even among some journalists, for the government’s move to go after television channels which aired views against >Yakub Memon’s hanging. Simultaneously, the government would do well to not misunderstand the nature of its democratic compact with its people, especially the poor. Top among the essential characteristics of democracy as rated by respondents in the survey was the freedom to take part in protests and demonstrations, evidence of a country that holds the right to dissent dear. Several welfarist ideals — provision of basic necessities such as food, clothing and shelter, as well as a narrowing gap between the rich and the poor and job opportunities for all — came next in the list of most cherished tenets of democracy. The everyday experience of dealing with the state for these is no doubt frustrating — ration shops are ranked as being among the most corrupt, and the police are seen as the least trusted. Majoritarian and jingoistic notions of democracy are not what the people of India are looking for, but a welfarist democracy that delivers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/democracys-essence/article7519144.ece
10,8,2015,Vengeance in Bangladesh,">Niloy Chatterjee Neel is the latest victim of a vicious campaign against secular bloggers in Bangladesh. His murder by machete-wielding men at his house in Dhaka underscores the grave dangers that writers critical of extremism and religious intolerance face in Bangladesh. It also raises questions about the commitment and capability of the Bangladesh government in protecting its citizens from organised violence. Neel is the fourth blogger to be killed this year, and Ansar al-Islam, the Bangladesh branch of al-Qaeda that has claimed responsibility for it, has held out a direct warning to other secular writers. On the face of it, it is an attempt to kill free speech. But the problem runs deeper. The Muslim-majority nation is going through a volatile phase. Ever since the >Awami League government opened the controversial war trial to indict those who committed serious crimes during the liberation war, the country has been on edge. The main opposition, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, has joined hands with the >Jamaat-e-Islami to unleash violent protests against the government, particularly against the war trial in which several Jamaat leaders have been indicted. The government has not heeded to the protests, but the street violence continues. The killing of the bloggers comes against this background.
The bloggers were supporters of the war crimes trial, and instrumental in shaping public opinion in cyber space against communalism, which obviously brought the Islamists’ wrath upon them. They were also soft targets compared to those involved in the trial, who get government security. By means of the murders the Islamists are sending a message to the government and the public that anyone who criticises them would face a similar fate. Yet, the government’s response in the face of the threat has been far from satisfactory. The murdered bloggers had received anonymous threats. Civil society groups say the Islamists have prepared a hit list of writers critical of them and are pursuing them one by one. If reports that Neel had sought police protection but the authorities instead asked him to leave the country are true, that would show the government’s callous approach on a serious issue. It should realise that these incidents have the potential to fracture the country further. The killers should be stopped, and brought to justice, and credible steps taken to ensure the safety of citizens, particularly the secular bloggers. Failing to do that would only send a message to the assailants that the authorities tend to tolerate such attacks.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/vengeance-in-bangladesh/article7519145.ece
11,8,2015,Stifling democratic debate,"The show cause notices issued to three television channels by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on Friday for their >coverage of the Yakub Memon issue and events in the run-up to his execution, are unwarranted and have little basis in law. The notices were issued to NDTV 24X7, ABP News and Aaj Tak, for alleged defamation and aspersions cast by them against the integrity of the President and the judiciary. A perusal of the content under question shows only critical discussion by individuals of the judgment dismissing the mercy petition. There was nothing there amounting to defamation or contempt of court, nor was any aspersion cast on the office of the President beyond mere criticism of the decision to reject the mercy petition. Yakub Memon’s execution led to >widespread debate on the issue of capital punishment and on whether his crimes deserved the highest punishment, apart from questions over what many felt were procedural lapses in the handling of his mercy petitions. Criticism of the President’s actions and of court judgments are normal in the public discourse and are an integral part of the freedom of expression guaranteed under Article 19 1(a) of the Constitution. The claim made in the notices that the broadcasts by two of the channels were likely to incite violence or promote anti-national attitudes is also a specious one as registering a contrarian opinion about death penalty is not by itself inflammatory or seditious. For the I&B Ministry to send a notice demanding a reply from the channels, which if not received would invite penal provisions leading to the suspension of permissions, is an outrageous overreach of its powers.
The section on the programme code of the Cable Television Networks Rules, 1994 that has been invoked to send the notices has clauses that are too broad and that could be misused as in the present cases. While print publications in India have been allowed a wide degree of freedom of expression in consonance with the constitutional provisions, broadcast channels have not been given the same leeway as in addition to the general laws they are also governed by the broadcast code that regulates content. The logic behind this distinction is that the audio-visual medium has greater and more instantaneous impact than print. Also, the licensing of the broadcast spectrum, which is a public resource, gives the government the authority to lay down additional restrictions. Yet the distinction appears invidious, and there is no reason why the broadcast medium should be subjected to more stringent restrictions than print. Both types of media serve the same purpose of informing and promoting public discussions of issues, necessary in a democratic society. It is dangerous for the power to regulate broadcasting to be vested in the I&B Ministry that can block content that is not to the liking of the government, using the broadly framed content code. The distinction between the print and broadcast media should be removed and the broadcast medium allowed in full the freedom of expression guaranteed under the Constitution.

11,8,2015,Turkey’s complicated war,"Turkey has finally joined the war against Islamic State. It has started bombing the terror group’s locations in the Syrian border region. It has also allowed access for U.S. aircraft to two of its airbases, departing from its long-held position. Despite pressure from the U.S. and other countries to “do more” against IS, > Turkey hardly did anything when it was steadily on the march in Syria, for Ankara’s main goal was to see the fall of the Bashar al Assad government in Syria. But Mr. Assad still controls Damascus, while IS has grown in strength in eastern Syria. IS attacks on Kurdish towns on the Syria-Turkey border have brought the >Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and its Syrian affiliate, the People’s Protection Units, known as YPG, into direct conflict with the terror group. Surprisingly, Kurdish militias pushed IS back from several border towns. Their increasingly effective resistance against IS even forced U.S. Air Force cover being offered to Kurdish militants. Turkey was alarmed. Its decision to join the war against IS should be seen against this background.
It can be argued that there is a realisation among the elites in Ankara that IS poses a threat to Turkey’s interests and that triggered its participation in the war. After all, the bombing of the Turkish city of Suruc by IS last month killed at least 33 people. But Turkey did not just decide to attack IS. It has started bombing PKK centres, claiming that both the Kurdish rebels and IS are “two sides of the same coin”. This makes the Turkish strategy a dangerously complicated one. Ankara might assume that by launching a two-phase attack it could weaken both enemies. Also, the promised joint operations with the U.S. would help it make sure no future air cover is provided to Kurds. But this strategy overlooks the fact that the Kurdish rebels were the most effective forces against IS on the ground. Even the U.S. air strikes were successful only when they were supplemented by ground attacks. By targeting Kurds, Turkey runs the risk of weakening the battle against IS. Any resumption of the war against the PKK could take Turkey back to violence. It ought to have focussed on its military operation against IS while taking forward the ceasefire with Kurds in order to build a sustainable peace plan. That would have strengthened the anti-IS war, while addressing internal problems. The decision instead to give up the peace process and bomb the Kurds raises questions about Turkey’s real intentions in the war against IS.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/turkeys-complicated-war/article7522899.ece
12,8,2015,Writing a new script,"On Tuesday, India woke up to the news of >Sundar Pichai, an engineer and executive hailing from Chennai who has made it big in Silicon Valley, becoming the CEO of Google. Far bigger in import was the news of the reorganisation of the internet behemoth Google itself, which propelled Mr. Pichai to the top slot. Larry Page, who along with Sergey Brin started the search engine in 1998, announced a corporate structure in which Google will be part of a new umbrella organisation, Alphabet. This organisation will also have a collection of other ventures, many of which are big bets that Google terms ‘moonshots’. This seems a drastic change for one of the most successful companies of the information era, a bellwether technology enterprise, a constant innovator, and one which has billions of people using its products. The company, which started off nearly two decades ago with the seemingly modest ambition of providing an organised gateway to all of the world’s information, proved hugely effective, popular and successful. Starting as a search engine and achieving success in producing a weighted ranking of webpages, it moved on to become a market leader in webmail (Gmail), browsers (Chrome), video hosting (You Tube), news aggregation (Google News) and mobile operating systems (Android), among other products. It has been so successful in its constant ownership of the latest trends in the internet that it has even created a fear of the monopolisation of the space, as a result getting embroiled in anti-trust cases in Europe.
But all that doesn’t explain the change in the corporate structure, one in which Alphabet will incorporate a “slimmed down” >Google among a number of other ventures. Why this change? In his post, Mr. Page simply wrote, “Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.” A distinguishing factor for Google all these years has been its capacity and inclination to expand the frontiers of technological innovation into newer ventures beyond its core business. So, while expanding, quite smartly, into adjacent areas of its business, it also ventured into ambitious projects where pay-offs can be expected only many years into the future: cars that are self-driven, balloons that power internet access, technologies that slow down ageing, and so on. Also, remaining true to its start-up roots, Google has been open to experimentation and, therefore, to some failures (Orkut and Google Plus, to name two of them). Sometimes this has led critics and investors to worry that Google was spending too much time, effort and money on such experiments. The reorganisation, led by Alphabet, may not only provide more clarity on these differently mature businesses but also provide the leadership a structure to think like a start-up again and not get drowned in the ‘big-ness’ of the $66-billion Google.

12,8,2015,Delivering a package,"The strange alliance between the Bharatiya Janata Party, which claims to speak for all Hindus in Jammu, and the Peoples Democratic Party, which seeks to represent all Muslims in Kashmir, is contingent on several factors, especially the attitude of the BJP-led government at the Centre to the PDP-led government in Jammu and Kashmir. In the absence of any special favours from the Centre to the State, the PDP will obviously find it extremely difficult to politically sell its alliance with the Hindutva party to supporters in the Kashmir valley. If the alliance is not to appear as a marriage of convenience solely for the perks of power, the PDP will have to wrest special concessions for the overall development of the State. The promised “special” financial package for J&K from the Centre is thus crucial for the continuance of the alliance. While the PDP certainly does not want to lose its hold on power, party president >Mehbooba Mufti has communicated to BJP president Amit Shah that the alliance would be untenable without the special financial package for J&K, which was meant to generate jobs and rebuild infrastructure in the State, affected by natural calamities and terror.
But what is problematic for the Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in announcing a package is its likely political fallout. Both the BJP and the PDP would want to take credit for it, and would want it to serve their own distinct political constituencies. Thus, while BJP leaders would want a substantial part of the package to be spent in Jammu, the PDP leaders are hoping the package would be mostly to revive Kashmir’s economy. It would do the BJP’s political prospects no good if the Centre is seen as succumbing to the PDP’s pressure. But the Prime Minister and his Ministers ought not to see the special package solely through the prism of the BJP leaders in Jammu. Whether the announcement is made as part of the Independence Day address or during the Prime Minister’s visit to the State in the third week of August might seem a matter of insignificant detail. After all, in real terms what is important for the people of J&K is the nature of the package, and not when and where it is announced. Petty political considerations should not be allowed to interfere with government decisions. What is material is not whether the package and the circumstances of its announcement would strengthen or worsen PDP-BJP relations or whether those would boost or bust the electoral prospects of the two parties, but whether the people of J&K get a package that is large, equitable and just.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/delivering-a-package/article7527068.ece
13,8,2015,Needless escalation,"It now appears to be Italy’s turn to stall the judicial process over the >killing of two Indian fishermen off the Kerala coast in 2012. For long, it was India’s dithering over whether to invoke a stringent law against maritime terrorism that delayed progress. In an unwarranted escalation, Italy has now moved the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) in Hamburg, at a time when the judicial process in India has been hampered by a petition from the accused marines questioning the jurisdiction of the National Investigation Agency to prosecute them. Italy’s request for provisional measures against India taking “any judicial or administrative measures” against Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone seems to be an attempt to stymie the pending prosecution and cite the interminable delay itself as a reason for the international forum to intervene. While in the past Italy may have had a legitimate grievance that the case was mired in legal tangles and that its marines were being detained in India without any tangible legal process, now the situation appears to favour it. The Supreme Court has been allowing one of the marines to prolong his stay in Italy, in the latest instance for six more months, while the other lives in a diplomatic residence in Delhi. Secondly, it is now a year and a half since the Union government decided to drop charges under the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation and Fixed Platforms on Continental Shelf Act, 2002, a law that provides for mandatory death penalty for the offence involved here. 
The Supreme Court has been asking the government to expedite the trial, but legal issues keep cropping up. As in the matter of invoking the 2002 Act, these questions are also being resolved. But Italy appears to have returned to its original position of questioning India’s jurisdiction altogether, despite the fact that the incident took place only 20.5 nautical miles off Indian territory, in the Contiguous Zone. While holding that only the Union government and not Kerala had the jurisdiction to pursue the case, the Supreme Court allowed the question of jurisdiction to be raised during trial. It also noted the relevance of Article 100 of the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, which says all states shall cooperate to repress piracy. Italy need not presume that a trial in India will result in any miscarriage of justice. Instead of fighting it out in an international forum, the two countries should agree on finding judicial closure in India. That will help avert any deterioration in India-European Union relations as well. ",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/needless-escalation/article7531490.ece
13,8,2015,"Choice, identity and privacy","The Supreme Court has once again made it clear that the government cannot insist on the possession of an >‘Aadhaar’ card or number as a precondition for citizens to avail of specified benefits and services. The court has been forced to reiterate its earlier order to this effect as more and more entities are trying to link their services with Aadhaar. From the beginning it was clear that making Aadhaar a mandatory requirement would evoke resentment and cause hardship to various sections. Some authorities caused alarm by indicating that people would stand to lose benefits or be denied routine services unless they enrolled themselves. There were even reports that some police stations asked for Aadhaar numbers before registering first information reports, and that certain educational institutions tried to make it a prior requirement to apply for some courses. By making it clear that no person should be in a position of disadvantage on account of not possessing an Aadhaar number, the court has protected the right of the people to make their own choice in the matter. It, however, has not brushed aside the relevance of the Unique Identification Number programme. It has allowed the authorities to link the supply of goods under the Public Distribution System and cooking gas cylinders with Aadhaar numbers. For all its exertions, the government must be relieved that to this extent its identification programme has obtained the court’s approval.
However, the question arising out of the scheme is not limited to whether it should be voluntary or mandatory. In its pursuit of better management of and greater efficiency in the delivery of services, it is natural that the government would want an identification mechanism to authenticate beneficiaries and consumers of its services and welfare measures. Previously, such a mechanism would have posed a technological challenge. It has now become a political and moral question. Can a government force citizens to enrol in an identification programme that involves submitting personal information and biometric data? The question, which involves determining the very validity of the scheme, has now been referred to a Constitution Bench. The reference will also cover the issue of the citizens’ right to privacy. One of the key points in the legal challenge is that collecting biometric data without enabling legal provisions and without clear norms to protect the data from misuse and theft may violate constitutional rights. Recently, the Attorney General caused considerable disquiet by arguing in the same matter that > privacy is not a fundamental right. What the country needs is not only a safe means of digitising citizens’ identity particulars but also a comprehensive law to protect their privacy and personal data from unauthorised surveillance and misuse. Anything short of that will leave the citizen short-changed.

14,8,2015,Stasis in the House,"The >monsoon session of Parliament ended predictably, with virtually no work done barring some essential financial business and an acrimonious debate in the Lok Sabha on the ‘Lalitgate’ issue. Neither the >Land Acquisition Bill nor the >Goods and Services Tax Bill — seen as being critical to taking the Narendra Modi government’s reforms agenda forward — could be enacted. The Congress-led Opposition made the resignations of External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, and the Chief Ministers of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, Vasundhara Raje and Shivraj Singh Chouhan respectively, a precondition to allowing Parliament to function. A government that came to power promising neither to make money nor allow its members to do so (“ na khayenge, na khaane denge”) failed to respond in a credible manner to serious allegations of conflict of interest, impropriety and corruption against some of its Ministers. It made virtually no attempt to break the impasse; the efforts were limited to stressing that its absolute majority in the last Lok Sabha entitled it to have its way. It also dredged up scandals from the Congress’s past and accused that party of “negativism” and of an “obstructionist attitude” to the GST Bill. And through all this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi remained silent.
Mr. Modi’s image as the Great Communicator, acquired as Chief Minister of Gujarat and burnished during last year’s campaign for the general election, was expected to be an asset when he became Prime Minister. Unlike during his many overseas visits, this attribute was not on display in Parliament this time. Even when Lalitgate was finally discussed, he left it to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to respond. The monsoon session cried out for a statesman-like intervention, especially after the government’s parliamentary managers failed to break the deadlock. Instead, Mr. Modi chose to copy his predecessor, who he had mocked as Maun-mohan Singh, playing on the word for ‘silent’. Indeed, over the past year Mr. Modi has rarely spoken in Parliament; even when he did, he never attempted to reach out. If the Opposition, particularly the Congress, can be faulted for choosing disruption over debate, notably it held its fire for the first couple of sessions. The party began to cry foul from the winter session of 2014 when it became evident that the Prime Minister had no time for Parliament. If during the Budget session Parliament cleared a large number of Bills, the credit must go as much to the Opposition as to the government. With this session declared a washout, it is time Mr. Modi took his official position as Leader of the Lok Sabha more seriously. He should perhaps also study how the Bharatiya Janata Party’s first Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajapyee, conducted himself in Parliament and government, using both his personality and charm to reach out and win the cooperation and admiration of the Opposition to a great extent.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/stasis-in-the-house/article7536176.ece
14,8,2015,Calculated devaluation,"When China sneezes, the world catches a cold. In a surprise action that set off shock waves across the globe and led to the currencies of many a nation taking a tumble, the People’s Bank of >China cut its daily yuan reference rate by 1.9 per cent on Tuesday. Even before the rest of the world could come to terms with the unexpected devaluation, Beijing made a further 1.6 per cent cut the very next day. The moves especially had a sharp negative impact on many Asian currencies. Though the rupee too fell to a two-year low on Wednesday in the wake of the double-dose devaluation, the Indian currency has been relatively less affected compared toits Asian peers. After the consecutive cuts, the People’s Bank of China clarified that “there is no basis for a sustained depreciation trend for the yuan”. It justified the second-round cut by citing a fall in the spot market. Is the devaluation an indication of China moving towards a more market-determined currency rate? Its subsequent intervention in the spot market to quell a further fall in spot rates, however, has led to a guessing game. Nevertheless, the International Monetary Fund is optimistic that the Chinese move will let market forces have a greater role in determining the exchange rate. The timing of the action – read in the context of a decelerating economy and in the light of China's heavy dependence on exports – suggests that it is a calculated move meant to regain economic momentum. It is a win-win move for China, in a manner of speaking. After all, Beijing is also making a strong pitch to make the yuan a global reserve currency at the IMF. For that to happen, it has to move closer to a mechanism of market-determined exchange rates.
The immediate tumble in global currencies aside, the wider implications of a largely devalued yuan on individual economies of the world will play out intensely in the minds of policy-formulators within governments across the world in the coming days. In the era of the inter-connected world, it is incorrect for central banks, especially of bigger nations such as China and the U.S., to assume that they could operate in separate silos. Given its overbearing status as an exporter, China’s step may trigger rearguard action on the currency and trade policy fronts. For New Delhi, in particular, this throws up a fresh challenge as it battles to stem a slide in exports. It has to make counter-moves to stop quickly and effectively the flooding of Chinese goods in the wake of the yuan devaluation, which could have a cascading effect on a host of sectors.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/calculated-devaluation/article7536177.ece
15,8,2015,A ban and some questions,"There has been little logic or clarity to the government’s actions around banning a popular brand of noodles, and now its unbanning by the > Bombay High Court is unlikely to clear the air either. In June, the >Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) said the snack, Maggi, was found to be “hazardous and unsafe for human consumption”. This followed from samples testing positive in some States for high levels of lead and monosodium glutamate (MSG), according to the FSSAI. Simultaneously, samples tested in other States came back with a certification of safety; Nestle, the manufacturer, said that 2,700 samples had been tested in India and abroad during the last few months and that all of them were found to have levels of lead far below the danger mark. The company maintains that it does not add MSG to its noodles. However, panic set in swiftly; the product went off the shelves across the country, partly in response to bans by individual States, and partly as a result of consumer fears. The High Court has now found that no opportunity was given to the company to prove its side before the ban was imposed, and that the tests were not conducted in accredited laboratories. While lifting the ban, it ordered further tests that follow proper norms. A class action suit against Nestle filed by the government before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission remains in process.
These contradictory signals leave the consumer confused and unsure where to turn for authentic information. When taking on a powerful multinational, the FSSAI should have been equipped with the full facts before putting what now appears to be half-baked information into the public space. If the food regulator is unable to follow proper norms, the consumer is left with little confidence that it is properly regulating the manufacture and sale of thousands of other potentially harmful food products in the Indian market, ones that are particularly prone to adulteration. There is little standardisation in food testing procedures, and laboratories — there are already too few of them — may throw up wildly differing results. In such a situation, Indian consumers, particularly parents of little children, are often forced to look up whether a particular ingredient in permitted by food regulators in the United States or the United Kingdom, given the utter lack of proactive, reliable information from their own food regulator. Companies will meanwhile have grounds for grievance against the FSSAI for the loss of revenue and reputation they might unfairly suffer. If India intends to ensure stringent food norms, it will need to be armed with the facts. Unsubstantiated warnings that have to be rolled back in no time inspire confidence about them in neither the consumer nor the industry.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-ban-and-some-questions/article7541808.ece
15,8,2015,For a durable engagement,"The >announcement by Sartaj Aziz, Adviser to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on national security and foreign affairs, that he would be in New Delhi on August 23 for talks with National Security Adviser >Ajit Doval, is welcome news, even though the Ministry of External Affairs has let it be known that the information had not yet reached it through official channels. Once the visit is announced, it will give both countries an opportunity to work out a way to ensure a sustainable bilateral engagement. Evidence that New Delhi and Islamabad are working towards such an objective has been sorely missing. If anything, over the last year New Delhi’s approach has been tentative, and in blow-hot, blow-cold mode. Prime Minister Narendra Modi got off to a splendid start by effusively calling leaders of the neighbouring countries to his swearing-in ceremony in May 2014, but events since then have left much to be desired, and there has been a lack of meaningful follow-up where Pakistan is concerned. By August, the Foreign Secretary-level talks had been called off at the eleventh hour on the rather unconvincing ground that the Pakistan High Commissioner in New Delhi had met leaders of the Hurriyat Conference. Such meetings had over the years become so routine that news about them would raise nary an eyebrow. It bears reiteration that when >Mr. Modi and Mr. Sharif met again at Ufa where they attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, hopes for an honest bilateral engagement were once again kindled by a joint statement that promised, among other things, meetings between the National Security Advisers, the Director-General of the BSF and his counterpart from Pakistan Rangers, and the two Directors-General of Military Operations.
Regretfully, thereafter the situation along the border deteriorated. There was a needless flap over a Chinese-made drone that Islamabad alleged was a sign of India’s mischief-mongering. There were a couple of attacks, one in Dinanagar in July and another in Udhampur this month, and then a Pakistani national was apprehended. On the issue of terrorism, neither India nor Pakistan has ever been short of talking points. The challenge that both Mr. Doval and Mr. Aziz will face will relate to how New Delhi and Islamabad should work to transform the relationship to something more meaningful and durable than one that is episodic, and where once a handshake between the Prime Ministers is officially recorded, things revert to recrimination and acrimony. Their first task will be to have a working ceasefire going along the LoC. It would be best as a sign of serious intention if it could be put in place before Mr. Modi goes to Islamabad for the 19th SAARC summit.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/for-a-durable-engagement/article7541807.ece
17,8,2015,Between words and deeds,"As he did in his first year as Prime Minister, Narendra Modi has used the occasion of his address to the nation on Independence Day >to talk up his government’s development agenda, offering hope to all and offending none. Last year >he promised governance based on consensus without relying on his party’s majority in the Lok Sabha. This time, despite the >rancour of the just-concluded monsoon session of Parliament, Mr. Modi adopted the same tone, insisting that if the country’s unity is destroyed the dreams of the people too would be. Casteism and communalism were mentioned in the same breath as ills facing the nation, and development was held up as the antidote. Without doubt, Mr. Modi made all the correct noises in his address, following the template he set last year. But if his speech is to generate the same level of hope, Mr. Modi might need to do more than just say the right things from the ramparts of the Red Fort. Without following up on his words with deeds, without ensuring that his ministerial colleagues and the entire government machinery live up to his well-articulated vision, Mr. Modi might find the magic of his oratory doing a disappearing act. Some of his Ministers do not seem to have any use for the political correctness that he has practised since coming to power. They seem to take after Modi the election campaigner, and not Modi the Prime Minister.
Although Mr. Modi renewed the emphasis on fighting corruption, starting from the top, the fact is that little progress has been made in putting in place institutionalised systems to prevent corruption. The >promise to bring back black money stashed abroad remains unfulfilled. Mr. Modi’s >dream of a Digital India, where people are united by information technology, is not any closer to reality than it was last year. Despite the strides made in providing toilets in all schools, and the impressive start to the financial inclusion scheme of >Jan Dhan Yojana, the achievements of the last one year have failed to meet the rising expectations — which the Prime Minister himself had fanned. Even as the >‘Make in India’ initiative is just beginning to gather steam, Mr. Modi has introduced a new catchphrase: ‘Start-up India, Stand up India’. True, unlike the previous government, the Modi government divides its attention among a fleet of programmes without putting all its effort behind one or two flagship schemes. Alongside the initiative to boost start-ups, Mr. Modi did not forget to mention the importance of raising farm productivity, and providing electricity and irrigation facilities to farmers. But the real challenge for Mr. Modi is finding the resources to give concrete shape to his words; and not finding new things to say on each Independence Day.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/narendra-modis-independence-day-speech-between-words-and-deeds/article7547034.ece
17,8,2015,Breach of propriety,"When the Chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification, Pahlaj Nihalani, says that as a citizen who voted for Narendra Modi he has a right to express what he feels, who can possibly contest that? But as he >unabashedly lavishes praise on his action hero, Prime Minister Modi, he seems to forget that he is also the head of a statutory board with quasi-judicial powers — appointed by the BJP government this year. The CBFC regulates the public exhibition of films under the provisions of the Cinematograph Act, 1952. It performs a critical role in setting standards for sensible, good cinema, and is often called upon to adjudicate on matters of film certification. There are many who believe Mr. Nihalani got the job literally for a song, that went along these lines: Har ghar Modi, ghar ghar Modi (In every house, a Modi; his a household name”). If the first song-documentary made in the run-up to the 2014 elections sought to whip up ultra-nationalistic sentiments, with larger-than-life images of Mr. Modi covering TV screens, a year later comes this sequel lionising and thanking him profusely for a job well done. Mr. Nihalani has already been in the news for his inability to get along even with other BJP-appointees on the Board; some of them termed him authoritarian and dictatorial. Till now, his achievements as Chairperson include >having given directions to remove cuss words from films, prompting sharp criticism from some CBFC members and the film fraternity at large. At a more fundamental level, Mr. Nihalani’s fulsome praise of the Prime Minister is unbecoming of the chair he occupies; after all, its occupants change with each political dispensation. Perhaps he is unaware of the weight of the job he has been entrusted with. As CBFC chairperson he cannot possibly be partisan to an ideology or a person.
That is not to say Mr. Nihalani is not entitled to his views. But there are questions to be asked on whether he is indeed equipped to dispassionately look at the world through a critical lens that his role demands. More important, if the Prime Minister would recall how the Congress under Indira Gandhi was reviled for the sycophancy that surrounded it, made memorable by the comment by one senior leader, “India is Indira and Indira is India”, perhaps he would want to distance himself from such crass eulogising — all the more when it comes from a man he has handpicked. The propaganda documentaries made by Mr. Nihalani, at best, can be avoided. The film-maker-producer known for his commercial potboilers would be better advised to set standards for cinema that would ensure a place for himself in posterity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pahlaj-nihalani-sings-paens-to-modi-breach-of-propriety/article7547035.ece
18,8,2015,"Regulate, but let them ride","Uber and Ola, the ride-sharing aggregators that match cabs with passengers through smart phone applications, have become extremely bullish in their bid to outstrip each other. Ola, the home-grown competitor to the global operator Uber, is spread across 100 cities in India and records 700,000 consumer rides a day. Uber counts 200,000 trips in 18 cities. To maintain the lead, Ola is intent on maximising its capital. In June, it >attracted an investment of $400 million from the Russian billionaire Yuri Milner. Since then there have been reports of more money coming Ola’s way. This has sent Uber into a tizzy, and it recently >pumped in $1 billion into the Indian market. More money means more cars plying, and history shows such growth cannot continue without regulation. But the government is yet to fathom the concept of “aggregation”, which provides an algorithmic advantage that makes app-based taxi services more in the nature of community organisers than contractors. The tech-heavy aspect places them under IT laws, which the companies are happy to comply with. But this also helps them evade motor transport laws. Can a government put a cap on such operations that organise drivers and facilitate business for them, they ask. That’s where the debate stands in other countries. But in India the debate is in its infancy. It’s only after December 2014, when an Uber driver in New Delhi >was convicted of raping a passenger, that the government sharpened its focus on ride-sharing apps. Consumer security became the focus of the regulation debate, and it remained so until a ban >was recently imposed in New Delhi on app-based taxi aggregators. Since a majority of the Uber and Ola vehicles are diesel-run, the government said they posed an environmental threat. Karnataka is now weighing a similar approach, as is Kolkata.
Is suspending them the right solution? There are about 500,000 taxis attached with Uber and Ola nationwide. Most of them have been bought on high-interest loans, and the companies are adding 200-300 chauffeurs a day. The Delhi-based ones are brushing aside the ban and continuing to operate. The police are fining them, even impounding some cars. Several hundred drivers who have stopped working are in distress; many have missed their loan repayments or are on the brink of defaulting. The Central government must intervene and stop allotting new licences to diesel-run taxis while letting the existing ones to operate. It should devise a regulatory framework to make aggregators such as Uber and Ola accountable to consumers, and end predatory pricing, market saturation strategies and similar practices. But let them ride on.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/cab-aggregators-regulate-but-let-them-ride/article7554400.ece
18,8,2015,Foes join forces,"Nothing brings political rivals together as a bigger, common rival does. With the BJP emerging as the front runner in the approaching Assembly election in Bihar, the old foes, Nitish Kumar of the Janata Dal (United) and Lalu Prasad of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, >have joined forces with the Congress in a grand ‘secular’ alliance. The RJD was the common enemy that unified major opposition parties more than a decade ago; it is the BJP in that role now. All three parties, the JD(U), the RJD and the Congress, have formed governments in Bihar independently of one another, but the recent shifts in electoral fortunes mean they are fighting for the same anti-BJP political space. With Mr. Prasad no longer in contention for the Chief Minister’s post — given his conviction in a corruption case and disqualification from contesting any election — what remained to be settled was the number of seats for each party. In any case, Mr. Kumar, as the sitting Chief Minister, could not have been expected to step aside in a race for the leadership of the alliance. The two main parties agreeing to fight in the same number of seats must have been a solution that suggested itself. However, after they split 200 of the 243 seats between them, and apportioned 40 for the Congress, Mr. Kumar and Mr. Prasad had only three seats to offer to the Nationalist Congress Party. Not surprisingly, the NCP opted out.
This was not the scenario that Mr. Kumar envisaged >when he broke his ties with the BJP after Narendra Modi’s rise to national prominence ahead of last year’s Lok Sabha election. The JD(U) leader must have been hoping to do a repeat of what Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik did: he dumped the BJP as an ally at no political cost. However, Mr. Kumar has had to seek the help of the RJD and the Congress to stay in power. After the JD(U)’s heavy defeat in the Lok Sabha election, he had to quell an inner-party revolt as his hand-picked successor, Jitan Ram Manjhi, defied him repeatedly. By all accounts, Mr. Kumar is worse off now than when his party was in alliance with the BJP. By entering into a poll pact with Mr. Prasad, the JD(U) leader risks alienating sections of his own core constituency, which was built up over the years on an anti-Lalu Prasad platform. After campaigning against Mr. Prasad for years over issues such as corruption and law and order, Mr. Kumar will have to fight off the perception that his new alliance is motivated solely by his desire to stay in power and keep the BJP out. In electoral arithmetic, two plus two plus one is not always five.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bihar-assembly-election-foes-join-forces/article7550929.ece
18,8,2015,Much-needed reform,"The move by the United States to oppose any large-scale reforms in the United Nations Security Council does not match the promise President Barack Obama made to India, that it would >back New Delhi’s candidacy for a permanent seat at the global decision-making body. Though U.S. Ambassador to India Richard Verma later >said his country remained committed to its promise, Washington’s policy towards UNSC reforms still lacks clarity. If the U.S. is keen on reforming the Council, why did it, in the first place, team up with Russia and China to oppose negotiations on reforms? And the assertion by these countries that the prerogatives, including the veto power, of the existing permanent members should remain intact even if there are reforms, is tantamount to pre-empting any major reform. The UNSC, created in the post-War context, doesn’t actually reflect the changes that have occurred in the international system after the end of the Cold War. In a quarter century, the global economic architecture has undergone massive changes. The developing nations, including India, now play a bigger role in international affairs. But within the UN, the five permanent veto-wielding members still effectively take all the crucial decisions. The Indian position is that this “democracy deficit in the UN prevents effective multilateralism” in the global arena. The way the UNSC handled — or failed to handle — some of the recent crises would underscore the soundness of the Indian position. Take the examples of Libya and Syria. While the western nations are accused of distorting the UNSC mandate in Libya, the Security Council failed to reach a consensus on how the Syrian crisis may be resolved. This clearly points to a worsening institutional crisis within the UNSC.
Meaningful reform of the Council to make it more representative and democratic would strengthen the UN to address the challenges of a changing world more effectively. India’s demand for a permanent seat has to be looked into, duly considering the merits of the case. It is the world’s largest democracy and Asia’s third largest economy. The Indian Army is the largest contributor to the UN peacekeeping mission since the inception of the mission. More important, India’s foreign policy has historically been aligned with world peace, and not with conflicts. As a permanent member of the UNSC it will be able to play a larger role concerning pressing international issues. But the latest development shows the path will not be smooth. New Delhi should continue its efforts to build a democratically evolved global consensus on restructuring the Security Council, at the same time pursuing bilateral diplomacy with the big powers. The permanent members ought to realise that there are much more serious issues at stake globally than their own so-called prerogatives, and they should be flexible in addressing those issues.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/restructuring-the-unsc-muchneeded-reform/article7550930.ece
19,8,2015,Healthy mandate in Sri Lanka,"Seven months after the presidential elections that saw President Mahinda Rajapaksa >being defeated by a coalition of disparate forces, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party strongman has been dealt another blow in the parliamentary elections. United National Party leader and presumptive Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe’s United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) >emerged as the largest coalition with about 46 per cent of the votes. It is set to form the government with likely support from the Tamil National Alliance and parties such as the leftist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. The coalition that defeated Mr. Rajapaksa was intact in these elections, as President Maithripala Sirisena had also endorsed the UNFGG, scotching any speculation that he would back Mr. Rajapaksa’s comeback bid. The coalition was bolstered by strong support from the minorities yet again, and by the UNP’s surge in votes among the Sinhala population. It also benefited from the President’s rural electoral base. The fact that Mr. Rajapaksa’s party still managed to retain a nearly 43 per cent vote share (from preliminary estimates) suggests that the winners have no reason to be complacent. That said, the UNP victory is a reiteration of the message from the presidential elections — against the authoritarianism associated with Mr. Rajapaksa’s tenure, and the narrow communal campaigning style he adopted in these elections. He resorted to a virulent campaign against the UNP and the presidency, playing on fears of a return of the LTTE and re-living the triumphalism of his tenure. His defeat reinforces the message for democratisation and the politics of reconciliation that the electorate had supported in the presidential elections.
The minorities’ support to the coalition that was most capable of defeating the SLFP (the TNA in Jaffna and Vanni, the UNFGG in the Eastern Province, Colombo and elsewhere) should only push their just and democratic case for greater devolution of provincial powers: the government should not hold it up any longer. Steps taken to empower democratic institutions such as the Constitutional Council, and the creation of independent commissions as a check on the executive presidency, seem to have gone down well. So has the >fixing of a two-term limit for the President. These were seen as a negation of the authoritarian and nepotistic trend of the Rajapaksa regime, which thrived on militarisation. This victory will enhance the credibility, internationally, of the government’s efforts to aid a process of reconciliation and rehabilitation of the war-affected Tamil minorities, something that remains unrealised six years since the end of the horrific civil war. All things considered, despite the inherent differences between the market-friendly UNP and the more statist SLFP in power, the results suggest a healthy mandate.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/healthy-mandate-in-sri-lanka/article7554398.ece
20,8,2015,The Sena and its twisted logic,"It is difficult to say whether the Shiv Sena takes offence or feels proud when its founder Bal Thackeray is spoken of as a terrorist with a religious cause. After the weekly Tehelka carried a cover story with pictures of Thackeray, Dawood Ibrahim, Yakub Memon and Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale above the legend, ‘Who is the biggest terrorist?’, the Sena responded in a rather strange manner. While condemning the depiction of Thackeray alongside those who engaged in violence in the name of religion, the Sena organ Saamna, in an editorial, >asked Hindus to act as “human bombs” and invade Pakistan. Thackeray, the editorial wrote approvingly, had instilled the “fear of Hindus” in Indians of other faiths. Far from defending the Sena founder against the charge of being a Hindu terrorist, the editorial appeared to be defending his support of violence in the name of Hinduism. What differentiated Thackeray from the others? According to the editorial’s reasoning, the Sena founder was a dharmabhimaani, a person who took pride in his faith, and not dharmaandh, someone who was motivated by blind faith. This line of defence, whether true to the facts or not, would have been fine but for the editorial’s exhortation to Hindus to turn themselves into human bombs and attack Pakistan. In one stroke, the disputes between India and Pakistan were turned into a Hindu-Muslim issue. By arguing that Hindus would have to be highly religious if they wanted to respond to Pakistani extremists, the editorial, in effect, identified nationalism with Hinduism.
The veiled threats aimed at Tehelka and the exhortations to violence are typical of the politics of the Sena, which is mostly a combination of Marathi chauvinism and Hindutva. Normally, the Sena when in power is less virulent than when it is out of power. But of late the party has been under pressure in Maharashtra, >having ceded political space to the Bharatiya Janata Party. Having been for long the senior partner in the alliance of the two Hindutva parties, the Sena ended up as a poor second to the BJP in the Assembly election last year. Although its breakaway group, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena led by Raj Thackeray, >is no longer serious competition, the Sena doubtless feels obliged to push the limits of its extremist politics. As the senior partner in government, the BJP, which usually bristles whenever there is talk of ‘Hindu terror’, saying the phrase is an oxymoron, will have to ask the Sena to give up its aggressive brand of politics laced with threats of violence and talk of communal hatred. The Sena must be made to necessarily tone down its rhetoric, and behave more like a responsible party in government.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-sena-and-its-twisted-logic/article7558125.ece
20,8,2015,Thailand’s turbulence,"Thailand is no stranger to political violence. The country, which has seen two military coups in less than 10 years, has been riven by street battles between protesters and security personnel in the past few years. Besides, in the so-called Deep South, the country is fighting armed Muslim separatists since 2004; this has claimed some 6,500 lives. Still, >Monday’s blast outside a Hindu temple on a busy Bangkok street, which killed over 20 people, was unprecedented in terms of scale. This was the most devastating explosion ever in Bangkok. The location and the timing showed that the perpetrators wanted to wreak maximum damage. The Erawan shrine is a popular tourist destination, especially among Buddhists from Thailand and other East Asian nations, and the bomb went off during the evening rush hour. It is still not clear who did it. The investigators say a “network” is behind it, but stop short of pointing fingers at any particular group. Given Thailand’s recent turbulence, it could be anyone from the Muslim separatists to the political opponents of the military junta.
But whoever did it, the attack was aimed at weakening the country’s already fractured polity and stultified economy. Ever since >the army took power in 2014 after toppling the civilian caretaker government, Thailand has suffered several violent incidents, including a grenade attack on a court house in Bangkok. The military’s claim that it captured power to bring stability to the country was far from the truth as the coup itself had sharpened the political divisions. The army is also accused of deliberately targeting supporters of the self-exiled former Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra. The Thai army is notorious for its highhandedness. Five years ago, an army crackdown on a public protest in Bangkok, close to the same Erawan shrine, left at least 80 people dead. Such use of violence has triggered violent responses from factions opposed to the army, while repeated coups and coup attempts have weakened the country’s democracy and governance structures. The tourism-dependent economy has also suffered from the recent political instability and protests. The latest blast will weaken the tourism industry further. The Thai authorities should realise that the country will be able to address the multiple challenges it faces only by sorting out the internal fissures first. And the best way to do it is to return a legitimate government to power. The generals have pledged to bring back democracy, but no one knows when elections would be held and whether they would be free and fair. There are also worries that the blast would be used as an excuse by the military to extend its hold over power and continue suppressing democracy. Such a move would only accelerate Thailand’s downhill slide.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/thailands-turbulence/article7558126.ece
21,8,2015,Banks for the unbanked,"For the first time in India’s banking sector, the Reserve Bank of India is giving out differentiated banking licences. The in-principle >go-ahead given on Wednesday to 11 ‘payments banks’ is, by the RBI’s own admission, an experiment — the latest in a long series of attempts to take banks to the unbanked. The push towards financial inclusion started with the nationalisation of 14 commercial banks in July 1969 through the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Ordinance, 1969. Then a second round came in 1980, involving six more commercial banks. With a view to economically mainstreaming rural areas, the Indira Gandhi government established regional rural banks by means of an ordinance in 1975. But even 45 years later, all these attempts have had little success in expanding banking coverage to the desired extent and scale: only 7 per cent of India’s villages have a branch of a rural or commercial bank. The policymakers seem now to have finally understood that banking inclusion cannot be just one among many businesses of a bank: it has to be the core business. The licensing condition that puts a Rs. 1-lakh cap on deposits that payments banks can receive from customers defines the market they will target — primarily the unbanked population. The RBI expects payments banks to target migrant labourers and the self-employed, besides low-income households, offering low-cost savings accounts and remittance services so that those who now transact only in cash can take their first step into the formal banking system.
Going by the international experience, this innovation of basically transforming a citizen’s mobile phone into a stripped-down bank branch has a greater chance of success. The initiative takes Vodafone’s M-Pesa closer to the version that is working successfully in Kenya, where payments on this product constituted about 30 per cent of the country’s GDP in 2014. Similar products in India so far were essentially mobile applications dependent on tie-ups with banks to make cash withdrawals and interest payments. The licence frees these companies to provide such services on their own. The greater operational flexibility will enable them to draw in more customers. Their operations could now become more cost-effective as the licence-holders will be banks in their own right, albeit without the provision to extend loans to individuals. If they indeed succeed in becoming the target market’s chosen mode of financial transactions, this technological solution could also turn out to be a major step in achieving a truly cashless economy. So, while this is a bold move, and underscores that the RBI is anything but conservative, it is ironical too that the cycle of experiments that started with the 1969 round of nationalisation has now come full circle. The responsibility of financial inclusion is now almost entirely entrusted to the private sector.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/banks-for-the-unbanked/article7562312.ece
21,8,2015,Not quite an endorsement,"Local issues invariably define local elections. While the Bharatiya Janata Party did well >to win eight of the 10 municipal bodies in the Madhya Pradesh civic elections, this is no popular endorsement of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government’s acts of omission and commission relating to >the Vyapam scam. In its campaign the opposition Congress sought to centre stage the scam, but in the local body elections the voters were seemingly more interested in issues of civic amenities directly concerning them. There was no way they could have assumed that their vote would affect the course of the Vyapam investigations or the fortunes of those who are believed to be involved in the scam. Also, the scale and size of the polls do not allow the results to be read as being indicative of the mood of the people. Thus, for >the BJP to claim that the results of the municipal elections show that the allegations on Vyapam were fabricated is totally unacceptable. The vote for the BJP reflects its strengths at the grass-root level, and its robust organisational structure developed over the years. In contrast to the Congress, a party in disarray in Madhya Pradesh without any one leader in the forefront, the BJP managed the campaign well with Mr. Chouhan as its face. As is not unusual in local body elections, a positive campaign worked better than a negative one.
But the electoral battle with Vyapam as the central issue is yet to come. The success in the municipal bodies is by no means a vindication of the BJP’s stance that none of its top leaders in the State needs to be held accountable for the lapses and cover-ups. There is little doubt that the Chouhan government has lost some of its sheen since the scandal broke. Attempts to trace the roots of the corrupt operation back to the days when the Congress was in power, can offer only limited purchase for the BJP. True, for the Congress, the loss in the municipal polls is a setback in its attempts to raise the Vyapam issue as part of a nationwide campaign. But the BJP and Mr. Chouhan would be mistaken if they think they have seen the last of the Vyapam-centric campaigns. Without the wide network of fraud involved in the employment and admission tests scam being undone, and the offenders ranging from lowly touts to persons in high office being brought to justice, the controversy would not come to rest. If the perception that the BJP and its government are not being sensitive to issues of corruption and accountability continues to gain credence, there would be an electoral price to pay in Madhya Pradesh eventually.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sweeping-victory-for-bjp-in-madhya-pradesh-civic-election-not-quite-an-endorsement/article7562313.ece
22,8,2015,A second Uphaar tragedy,"The Supreme Court’s decision to reduce the prison sentence imposed on the owners of New Delhi’s Uphaar cinema, which suffered a horrific fire tragedy that consumed 59 lives in 1997, and instead >award a compensation of Rs.60 crore to the state, reduces the entire criminal process to an empty formality. By preferring to sentence Sushil Ansal and Gopal Ansal to the period they had spent in prison — hardly five months — a three-judge Bench seems to have treated the entire issue of criminal negligence as a matter of civil compensation, and criminal liability a very minor aspect. The verdict almost renders nugatory the 10-year trial process that saw the Ansal brothers, the cinema’s managers and others being sentenced to varying prison terms in 2007. Acting swiftly on the appeals, the Delhi High Court in 2008 >reduced the prison terms of the main accused from two years’ rigorous imprisonment to one year. The trial court and the High Court declined to frame a charge against the Ansal brothers for culpable homicide under Section 304 (part two) of the Indian Penal Code, and instead limited the case to Section 304A (causing death due to rash and negligent act).
The appeals by the accused against the conviction, and by the CBI and the Association of the Victims of the Uphaar Tragedy seeking enhancement of the sentences or challenging the acquittal of a few have now been disposed of after seven years. Last year, a two-judge Bench >came to the same findings on fact against the accused, but differed on the quantum of sentence. One of the judges affirmed the one-year jail term and the other favoured a two-year sentence, of which one year will be offset by a payment of Rs. 100 crore as compensation. Another 17 months elapsed before this final order. Every court has held the Ansal brothers guilty of such gross negligence as to render them culpable for the 59 deaths, and injuries to nearly a hundred people. The court has stressed on compensation, whereas the >issue was decided by the Supreme Court in 2011 when it fixed it at Rs.10 lakh for the death of each person above 20 years, and Rs.7.5 lakh for those younger. If the punishment for someone found guilty of failing to discharge the common law duty of care and committing statutory deviations that caused the deaths of film patrons whose quick dispersal and egress from the premises were prevented by the gross negligence of the accused, is a mere few months in jail, the necessity of the entire criminal process comes under question.

22,8,2015,The Iran momentum,"India’s >decision to remove Iran from the list of countries in the restricted visa category is another indication of New Delhi’s resolve to reinvigorate its engagement with the Gulf country. The move will primarily liberalise the visa approval process for Iranian citizens, paving the way for enhanced people-to-people cooperation. But more important, it is part of a series of steps India has taken to deepen partnership with Iran since an interim agreement was reached between Tehran and six world powers (P5+1) in November 2013 over its nuclear programme. Iran used to be India’s second largest supplier of oil. But India, under pressure from western nations, voted against Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency over its nuclear programme and subsequently cut energy imports. The interim agreement offered India a window of opportunity to revisit its Tehran policy. In February, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval went to Tehran to discuss bilateral cooperation. In April, the Iranian Ambassador to New Delhi, Gholamreza Ansari, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had accepted an invitation to visit Tehran. This new direction in India’s approach to Iran got better clarity when the final nuclear agreement >was reached between Tehran and P5+1 in July: it will remove not just sanctions against Iran but also the tag of untouchability given to it by the West.
Ties with Iran are vital for India’s economic and strategic interests. India has to seize the momentum provided by the nuclear deal to step up energy trade with Iran. Imports from Iran are relatively cheap because of the geographical proximity and the extended credit period it offers. Iran has one of the largest gas reserves, and these are expected to be opened up soon for global investments. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation already has interests in the Farzad-B gas field, and Iranian gas will help India’s fuel-starved power stations. More important, New Delhi and Iran share an interest in stabilising Afghanistan. Both realise that a return of the Taliban to Kabul would affect their key interests. Iran and India >have signed an agreement to develop the Chabahar port. The Iranian port, which lies outside the Gulf region and is easily accessed from India’s western coast, will give New Delhi an alternative sea-land access route into Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan and providing a gateway to the resource-rich Central Asian region. But, for the success of these projects India needs to have a consistent policy towards Iran that is defined by mutual interest and not by global pressures. The period of tepid engagement with Iran has delayed the Chabahar port project and affected India’s energy security. Now New Delhi has to make up for lost time by accelerating bilateral diplomacy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-iran-momentum/article7566449.ece
24,8,2015,No alternative to talks,"The failure of India and Pakistan to hold the planned meeting between their National Security Advisers, as was agreed in Ufa six weeks ago, is unfortunate, indeed disquieting. It should give pause to both Islamabad and New Delhi on what kind of relations they could possibly expect to have in the foreseeable future. Arguments to the effect that there were earlier periods when they had agreed to disagree are at best disingenuous. At Ufa there was a limpid agreement on the agenda for the New Delhi meeting: that the NSAs would “discuss all issues connected to terrorism”. Ufa had also yielded a discernible road map to bring about a modicum of peace and tranquillity along the border and the Line of Control (LoC), which has been witnessing rounds of wanton firing and unacceptable casualties. External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj put the number of ceasefire violations since Ufa at 91. Barely a week after Ufa raised modest hopes of an upturn in relations, there was firing in the Akhnoor sector. Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar spoke of four attempts made by the Director-General of the Border Security Force to “make telephonic contact with Sector Commander Sialkot” as per laid-down procedures, which met with no response. He mentioned how this was unacceptable. Now, with the prospects of even a limited engagement having receded, the question that arises is: how will the two nuclear-capable neighbours deal with each other?
There is no doubt that through its grandstanding on Kashmir and Hurriyat, Islamabad reneged on the understanding reached in Ufa. It is equally obvious that New Delhi has recalibrated its Pakistan policy, willing perhaps to take a calculated risk that the world would be better disposed to its preferences in the matter of dealing with Pakistan, almost 14 years after 9/11. Yet, the new situation may have willy-nilly rendered India vulnerable to facing gratuitous advice, possibly worse. To assume that those who formulate India’s Pakistan policy believed Islamabad would respect the sudden red line drawn on the Hurriyat, would stretch credulity. The Hurriyat certainly does not have a place in bilateral processes. It is at best a Pakistani side-show with some nuisance value and without much consequence. India had indeed learnt to tolerate that. Now, New Delhi’s actions may have the unintended effect of making the outfit larger-than-life — which is an avoidable prospect. Pakistan has also not covered itself with glory by overloading the agenda with issues that the two NSAs meeting for an hour or two wouldn’t have been able to come to grips with. It is best at this point to open a discreet back channel that ensures better bilateral deliverables than has been the case over the last year and a half. There is simply no alternative to talks.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-indiapakistan-nsalevel-talks-no-alternative-to-indopakistan-talks/article7572184.ece
24,8,2015,The Korean conundrum,"The Korean Peninsula is no stranger to tensions. But the ultimatum given by North Korea to the South to either stop its propaganda broadcasts across the demilitarised zone (DMZ) or face war has raised them to their highest level in many years. The Koreas are still technically at war, as the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice agreement and not a proper ceasefire. Since then there have been several incidents of border violence, and leaders on both sides have occasionally exchanged high-decibel rhetoric. The latest flare-up is particularly menacing because of at least two factors — the growing unpredictability of the North Korean regime under Kim Jong-un, and the relatively more assertive response by South Korea to provocations. The North is going through several internal challenges. At least 70 top-level government officials, including the Vice-Premier, were reportedly executed since Mr. Kim took power in 2011, indicating that the regime is using brute force to sustain itself and silence dissent. Second, the North Korean state media have confirmed that the country is facing the “worst drought” in a century. This spells a major economic crisis. Whipping up tensions with the South could be a deliberate strategy on the part of Mr. Kim in order to divert attention from crucial internal problems. The latest crisis started with a landmine blast in the DMZ in which two South Korean soldiers were injured. Seoul retaliated by resuming anti-North propaganda, which led to shelling from the North and counter-artillery fire from the South.
While the two countries have not had a full-scale armed conflict since 1953, tensions on the peninsula have remained high, particularly after the North went nuclear in 2006. With the U.S. remaining committed to “defending” South Korea, any major confrontation between the North and the South could potentially lead to a nuclear conflagration. South Korea’s dilemma is understandable. Dealing with an erratic dictatorship will never be easy. But responding to provocations from the North in the same coin is not going to serve its interests. Seoul should rather regain its rational restraint, and use diplomatic means to tone down tensions. It could reach out to China, the only major ally of the North, to put pressure on Pyongyang. If Beijing is serious about taking a more proactive regional leadership role, North Korea will be the best starting point. The recent Iran nuclear deal shows that even complicated international issues could be resolved through imaginative diplomacy. But whether the Koreas and their respective backers have the will to earnestly pursue a diplomatic solution, is the big question.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-north-koreasouth-korea-conundrum/article7572185.ece
25,8,2015,The crash of the markets,"Market regulators and even governments have very few options when financial markets go into the kind of panic-driven free fall as witnessed on Monday. The shock waves triggered by an over 9 per cent fall in Chinese stocks hit capital and currency markets worldwide. India was no exception to the global sell-off, with the BSE Sensex shedding over 1,624 points — nearly 6 per cent — and the rupee tumbling at one point to Rs.66.60 against the U.S. dollar, its lowest level since 2013. The immediate task for the market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, will be to put in place measures to ensure that there are no major settlement defaults, which can trigger a systemic collapse. Other than that there is little it can, or indeed should do, to prevent the current re-rating of asset prices in the market running its course. On the currency front, Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan has given out the assurance that the central bank has sufficient foreign currency reserves — around $380 billion — to dampen any major volatility of the rupee. However, it can only flatten the trajectory of any fall, not reverse it. Besides, it needs to keep the powder dry to tackle any further devaluation of the yuan, which China might be forced to do if growth continues to be slow. After all, Monday’s global sell-off was prompted by poor industrial output numbers, only confirming the fears of global investors that China’s ‘managed slowdown’ was proving less manageable than it had let on.
For India, the Chinese collapse might actually provide an opportunity. As Dr. Rajan has pointed out, India has a low current account deficit (CAD), the fiscal deficit is manageable, inflation is moderating and short-term foreign currency liabilities are low. Despite a downward revision by global rating agencies in the growth forecast, growth is still fairly robust compared to other major economies. The fall of the rupee has been largely offset by a slump in crude prices, which should further ease pressure on the CAD. A cheaper rupee will also help revive exports. Progress on key reform measures such as the GST and Land Bills, and a step-up in infrastructure spending, could boost industry. A strategically timed interest rate cut can help revive consumer and investor sentiment. For that to happen, the Centre needs to demonstrate greater political skills in pushing its reforms agenda, and speedier reflexes than it has shown so far. A case in point is the delayed PSU disinvestment programme. Monday’s offer for sale of 10 per cent of shares in Indian Oil Corporation barely scraped through amidst the bloodbath. Future asset sales will have to be in a markedly more bearish market, leading to lower realisations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/stock-market-mayhem-dalal-street-disaster-the-crash-of-the-markets/article7575732.ece
25,8,2015,Unsavoury swipes,"Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam general secretary Jayalalithaa did well to put a quick end to the protests by her party’s workers against > Congress leader E.V.K.S. Elangovan, who made a rather flippant and tasteless remark about her luncheon meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at her residence in Chennai on August 7. With Mr. Elangovan in no mood to offer anything by way of an apology, other than to say his remark was misunderstood, and AIADMK cadres getting restive, the law and order situation could have taken a turn for the worse but for the Chief Minister’s intervention. Of course, politically, Ms. Jayalalithaa did not give Mr. Elangovan even an inch: she clearly saw the protests as being justified, and the reason she wanted those halted was that she thought her party workers had already expressed their anguish. Thus, while the street protests are off, the AIADMK is certainly not inclined to forgive and forget the episode. That Mr. Elangovan had failed to maintain civility and dignity in public discourse with his allegations and insinuations was clear. And this was not the first time the TNCC president had got into trouble for intemperate remarks. But beyond drawing public attention to his indiscretion, the AIADMK would have realised, the street protests only served to inconvenience the public and create tense moments for the police. The job of disciplining Mr. Elangovan is best left to his party leadership, and to the voters he seeks to represent.
What this sordid episode has done is once again expose the underlying misogyny in India’s electoral politics. Like Mr. Elangovan, Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav had made similar derogatory statements about Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayawati, prompting her to write to the National Commission for Women and the Election Commission on different occasions. In West Bengal, Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee likewise came under attack from leaders in the lower rungs of the Left Front. When the standards of public discourse fall, sexist attacks on women politicians become the norm. India has had a woman as President and as Prime Minister and as Chief Minister in several States, but patriarchal attitudes remain entrenched in the public sphere. While misogyny cannot be banished from the political discourse in one stroke, Indian voters need to make the deviant politicians pay politically. Party leaderships too should not allow space for those in the middle and lower rungs to take sexist swipes against top political rivals. The Congress leadership must rein in Mr. Elangovan in its own interest. India needs more women among its elected representatives, not fewer.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/modijayalalithaa-meeting-evks-elangovan-derogatory-comments-unsavoury-swipes/article7575734.ece
26,8,2015,Transcending cricket,"Rare is the cricketer who meets the exacting demands of unconditional greatness; rarer still the one who transcends the game. It says everything about >Kumar Sangakkara ’s life in cricket that he appeared to accomplish both with masterful ease. There isn’t the smallest doubt that the Sri Lankan is among the very best the game has seen. Only four batsmen have exceeded his tally of 12,400 Test runs, and no one with more than 8,500 runs has averaged as much as his 57.40. But what truly sets him apart from even the elite is the fact that as a pure batsman — without the responsibility of keeping wicket — he averages a staggering 66.78. Only Don Bradman (99.94), among those with at least 1,000 runs, has done better. And only the peerless Bradman has more scores of over 200 — 12, to Sangakkara’s 11, although in far fewer innings. It’s important that these numbers are not glossed over, for while Sangakkara’s greatness has long been abundantly clear, not many have appreciated how close he has been, at least statistically, to Bradman. Not that Sangakkara would have minded — neither universal acclaim nor the trappings of stardom drove him. His motivation came from within; the only approval that he sought, from a cricketing perspective, was his team’s and his country’s.
Indeed it was his concern for Sri Lanka, his desire to help his strife-torn land, and his courage to speak truth to power that saw him emerge as a transcendental, unifying figure. Mahela Jayawardene — a close friend who saw Sri Lankan cricket and life similarly, but also challenged Sangakkara’s thinking, holding it to higher scrutiny — played an invaluable role. Together they strengthened Arjuna Ranatunga’s legacy of inclusiveness, which had enabled the likes of Muttiah Muralitharan and Sanath Jayasuriya to thrive. While there was plenty of work behind the scenes to harness the game’s transformative power, it was the MCC Spirit of Cricket lecture, at Lord’s in 2011, that trapped lightning in a bottle. Never were Sangakkara’s ideas more forceful; never was his articulation as lucid. His evocative discourse centered on Sri Lankan cricket, but wasn’t confined to it. One of the speech’s successes was that through the example of Sri Lankan cricket it addressed the larger problems the world game faced: narrow-mindedness, corruption, political manipulation. He challenged those in charge to set themselves higher standards, indeed to “adopt the values enshrined by the [Sri Lankan] team over the years: integrity, transparency, commitment and discipline”. The lecture was a tour de force that shook administrators everywhere. It was also proof, if any were needed, that Sri Lankan and world cricket’s interests are best served if Sangakkara’s association with the game doesn’t end with retirement.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/indias-tour-of-sri-lanka-sri-lankaindia-test-series-transcending-cricket/article7579417.ece
26,8,2015,Time to act on FTII,"As the strike action at the Film and Television Institute of India crosses two and a half months, the visit by a three-member committee appointed by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has kindled hopes that the impasse would end. The panel held detailed discussions with students and alumni and sought the views of the faculty and other staff members. The students expressed satisfaction that they were heard “objectively”, and hoped for a solution when the committee submits its report to the government this week. The controversy over the appointment of actor Gajendra Chauhan, best-known for his portrayal of Yudhishtira in B.R. Chopra’s TV serial ‘Mahabharat’, turned intensely political with the entry of Rahul Gandhi, who accused the RSS of “a consistent, systematic assault on India’s academic and democratic institutions”. He led the students to President Pranab Mukherjee seeking his intervention to protect public institutions from ideological or political interference. The visit led to a war of words between the Congress and the BJP, which became an extension of the confrontation inside Parliament. Days later, the arrest of five students during a midnight police raid on the Pune campus frayed tempers further, and the government was accused of launching a “witch-hunt”. Though the Ministry responded swiftly and sent in the panel, the raid indicated the government had not handled the issue as sensitively as it should have.
The committee’s recommendations are not known as yet, but it’s time the NDA government used the opportunity to reassure liberal and progressive sections that it does not intend to “subjugate” cultural institutions. It should instead chart out a road map that would make the FTII a sought-after centre of excellence. It should even consider whether the first step in this direction could be to grant the students’ demand to keep Mr. Chauhan’s appointment in abeyance. A panel of eminent film-makers could be set up to frame a transparent structure for future appointments of the FTII Chairman, where merit and capability, and not political or ideological credentials, are given due priority. Actor Mohan Agashe, a former Director, suggests that the government appoint a governing council comprising students and headed by the I&B Minister to resolve campus issues. The FTII has a legacy of producing fine film talent, and the government’s focus should be on making it a world-class centre. Asian cinema – whether it’s Indian, Iranian, Chinese or Korean – is making an unmistakable mark at the global level. And film-makers moulded by the FTII should continue to be able to lead this creative wave into the future.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-the-strike-of-film-and-television-institute-of-india-students-time-to-act-on-ftii/article7579418.ece
27,8,2015,Questions of timing and context,"Numbers lend themselves to words in myriad, complex ways. > Data on population by religious communities in a country of India’s size and diversity can be especially sensitive, with deep, long-term implications for communal harmony and political stability. Going by experience, population figures in terms of just religious affiliation will only serve as fodder for political groups pursuing conservative and majoritarian agendas. Without any correlation to other demographic features such as income, education, occupation and mortality rates, to merely present the rates of growth in the population of specific religious communities as stand-alone facts makes no sense at all. For a government to authorise the release of such potentially polarising data almost randomly, without taking any institutional responsibility, is highly questionable. The Registrar General of India, who reports to the Union Home Ministry, was given the clearance by the Prime Minister’s Office, but not enough thought appears to have gone into the issues that might crop up consequent to the release of such data. The release came unannounced, almost as a matter of routine. Neither the Home Ministry nor the PMO took responsibility: there was no media briefing by any minister or official, just the release of raw data without providing context. The inescapable conclusion is that the government was not worried about the sensitive nature of the data, and about their potentially divisive effects in the absence of explanatory addenda. All collections of data are value-neutral, but the manner of their release and potential for use and misuse are not.
Of course, even in 2004, when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government allowed the release of the data on population by religious communities, the situation was not very different. The then Census Commissioner, J.K. Banthia, defended the release of demographic characteristics based on religious composition as being in the public interest and resulting ultimately in public good. Though the collection of data on religion has always been part of the census exercise, 2004 was the first time such data were released as a separate report. What is intriguing is that the manner of the release of the 2011 data is in sharp contrast to the care being taken in the release of the caste census of groups other than the Scheduled Castes and Tribes. If the release of such data is to serve any purpose, that should be to better direct policy initiatives to target socio-economic backwardness of specific groups. That the release was timed close to the Bihar Assembly election injects an unnecessary political taint. But what is most disconcerting is that the government did not step forward to take institutional responsibility, or to provide an explanation of why it was necessary to release such inherently polarising data without clear context. Governments are meant to uphold peace among communities; law and order is their primary responsibility. It is therefore important that when sensitive data of this kind are released, they take citizens into confidence on the context of such data.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Questions-of-timing-and-context/article10334822.ece
27,8,2015,Looming crisis,"The crisis-ridden textile sector, being labour-intensive, should have been an ideal candidate for a push as part of the Prime Minister’s pet ‘Make in India’ initiative, but as the issues it is mired in remain unresolved, and with losses mounting, the situation is grim. Nearly half of India’s power looms are at a standstill: the spinning industry in the northern and southern regions has pressed in shutdowns of as much as 15 to 20 per cent of production capacity. The textile industry as a whole is reeling under high input and transaction costs. The products find it hard to compete in export markets, where India-made yarn, fabrics and garments attract duties respectively at rates of 3.5, 8.5 and 14 per cent. Yet, Pakistan, Vietnam and Cambodia enjoy zero-duty access in some categories in the U.S., EU and China. India’s trade negotiators need to seek expedited results. China is not picking up much from India this year.
> Cotton was cheaper in India this year initially. But the Cotton Corporation of India for several months sold the good-quality produce procured in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and parts of Maharashtra at prices higher than international levels, making > Indian cotton uncompetitive. This added to the problems of the industry, especially the spinning segment, before an intervention by the Union Textile Ministry ensured resumption of smooth supplies. Tinkering with the cotton market through Minimum Support Price operations must be avoided. Instead, direct cash subsidy benefit to farmers could help reform the sector. China has also decided to go in for direct subsidies to cotton growers, with its textile industry free to source cotton at international prices. The Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme that was originally brought in by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government and launched in 1999, is a ready framework available to the Centre to address the needs of the textile sector. The scheme, that is estimated to have so far resulted in investments of over Rs.3,00,000 crore in the whole textile value chain, will expire in March 2017. It should be extended. A comprehensive National Textile Policy must be announced at the earliest to create a level playing field with regard to tariff rates, raw material costs, cost of funding and transaction costs. Each power loom provides work to about 2.5 workers. Closures all across the country could endanger livelihoods on a large scale. Conversely, a healthy textile sector could potentially create millions of jobs. That should be the target.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/looming-crisis/article7583387.ece
28,8,2015,The politics of backwardness,"If political mobilisation could win for it the fruits of reservation in employment and education, the massive shows of strength over these last few days in Gujarat should have yielded results for the Patel community by now. Their agitation to get the community included in the Other Backward Classes list has brought the State almost to an administrative halt. Not only Chief Minister Anandiben Patel, but also Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders of parties in other States have been given a rude awakening to the intensity of the demands of the agitators. However, even if the Gujarat government wanted to, it cannot extend reservation benefits to the Patel community merely on the basis of an executive order. Inclusion of more communities in the reservation list is already a highly controversial issue and fraught with procedural and legal obstacles. Not only would communities that are already enjoying reservation benefits oppose any move that would shrink their pie, but other communities currently excluded from the OBC list would demand to be treated on a par with the Patels. More importantly, any decision to extend reservation benefits to new claimants might not pass judicial scrutiny. Recently, the decision to include Jats in the OBC list was overturned by the Supreme Court, which ruled that the perception of a self-proclaimed socially backward class of citizens cannot be a constitutionally permissible yardstick for determination of backwardness. Indeed, the court specifically warned against a caste-centric definition of backwardness, and called for new practices, methods and yardsticks to be evolved to identify socially disadvantaged groups for extending the benefits of reservation. Like the Jats, the Patels will not find it easy to meet the specified criteria for social and educational backwardness.
For the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is in power both at the Centre and in the State, the Patel agitation is a fresh political headache. The party, which counts the Patels among its key constituencies, will need to be seen as having backed the agitation to the full in order to arrest any erosion in its traditional vote-bank. For Prime Minister Modi especially, to envision the loss of the BJP’s political hold in Gujarat would be particularly distressing. There is simply no way to appease the Patels without alienating some of the other backward class communities in the State. Moreover, the BJP finds itself dealing with a new, youthful leadership of the community focussed on jobs and livelihood concerns, and not political power. In a situation where it can neither support nor antagonise the agitators, the BJP and its governments in the State and at the Centre must resist the temptation to grant the demand of the Patels in principle and deny it in practice. It would be cynical to merely wait for the movement to somehow lose steam with time, and not confront the issues that are at stake.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/patel-community-agitation-the-politics-of-backwardness/article7587372.ece
28,8,2015,A chronicle of our times,"Events as they have played out in the rapidly unfolding drama surrounding Indrani Mukherjea and her murdered daughter Sheena Bora, would put a Bollywood scriptwriter to shame. The story involves money, fame, love, secrets and a corpse, but these are not just the elements of a potboiler. Rather, they are striking pointers to a once-traditional society’s speedy metamorphosis into an acquisitive FMCG economy with its attendant attributes of obsessive ambition and ruthless self-indulgence. And like fast-moving consumer goods, this lifestyle too revolves around a use-and-throw philosophy. The personality of Indrani Mukherjea that is surfacing from media reports suggests a woman eager to leave behind the humdrum middle-class life of a homemaker in small-town Guwahati and transform herself into a jet-setting society lady in the country’s commercial capital. She appears to have had no qualms in abandoning her first husband and two young children in her search for the good life. Her second husband Sanjeev Khanna, too, was jettisoned quickly. He has said that they parted ways since he did not want to stop her from realising her ambitions. She then met future husband and former Star India CEO Peter Mukherjea, who finally allowed her to find the social reputation and wealth she sought.
It is interesting that Ms. Mukherjea’s chronicle and the new mores she could be seen as representing reject the one value so dear to old India — the sanctity of motherhood. Ms. Mukherjea is accused not only of abandoning her young children but also of strangling the daughter she thought might unravel her hard-won life of a social butterfly. And, in what appears to be an attempt to conceal her age and a humble past, she told her first-borns that she could not jeopardise her social status by revealing their existence and would therefore introduce them to the world as her siblings. Even more disturbing is the second motive that the police are suggesting for the brutal murder, that of money. If there is one thing that could be said to characterise the consumerist economy most, it is the insatiable hunger for more — more money, bigger cars, swankier homes, or more fame. And the newly emerging social praxis endorses individuals who show a single-minded determination to acquire all of this at any cost. But in this particular case, at least the avarice has culminated in a tragic denouement.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-sheena-murder-case-a-chronicle-of-our-times/article7587373.ece
29,8,2015,Secure haven for a terrorist,"In an ideal world where the rule of law mattered and geopolitics did not dominate the conduct of international relations, Pakistan would have cooperated in the capture and extradition of Dawood Ibrahim and the criminal and mass murderer would have faced justice in the country of his origin. Instead, in this real world Pakistan persists with its long-pursued policy of “plausible deniability”, refusing to acknowledge the presence of the underworld “kingpin”, let alone responding to accusations that he has been sheltered by the agencies of the state. While he has been absconding from Indian justice after being identified as a key conspirator in the 1993 Mumbai blasts that killed hundreds of people, it has been widely reported that he lives a secured life of comfort in Karachi, among other places. How Ibrahim can live such a life without protection accorded by Pakistan’s security establishment is not an unfathomable mystery. He was after all playing a leading role in Pakistan’s strategy of trying to “bleed India by a thousand cuts”, that it has seemingly followed fervidly in the 1990s.
Much water has flowed down the Indus since then; today Pakistan suffers festering wounds inflicted by its own strategy of terror. There is some degree of realisation among its civilian establishment that the nexus between the security establishment and the jihadi complex has hurt its fledgling democratic institutions. This led to an assertion of civilian supremacy in the latter half of the decade of the 2000s, and a degree of acceptance by the security establishment of the need to do away with military preponderance. But there has been little reorientation in Pakistan’s overall foreign policy towards India, beyond tokenism and a grudging acceptance of a changed world at large that has little tolerance for terrorists and their sponsors. Despite an Interpol Red Corner notice out for him, and notwithstanding the UN Security Council Resolution 1267 that obligates UN members to help apprehend individuals included in a UN sanctions list against the al-Qaeda where Ibrahim’s name figures, there has hardly been any action taken by Pakistan’s state establishment. Indian governments over the years have patiently built a case for his extradition through dossiers submitted to Pakistan. But these have been of no avail, and unsurprisingly so. After all, the most wanted terrorist of the last decade, Osama Bin Laden, was ensconced in a compound in Abbottabad not far from the Pakistan Military Academy campus. “Plausible deniability” did not work with the U.S., as President Barack Obama ordered an operation to take out Bin Laden, showing little regard for Pakistan’s sovereignty. It is to be hoped that the Pakistan government will revisit the lessons learnt and cooperate on the issue of Ibrahim’s extradition. Among other things, such a step will aid in mending the fraught relations between India and Pakistan.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-dawood-ibrahim-secure-haven-for-a-terrorist/article7591464.ece
29,8,2015,Another confident launch,"The Indian Space Research Organisation’s second consecutive successful launch of the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), with an indigenous cryogenic upper stage (CUS), proves that its earlier success in January 2014 — which came after a failed launch in 2010 — was no fluke. Also, this is the first time a GSLV rocket with an indigenous CUS has crossed the two-tonne payload mark: the GSAT-6 that it lifted weighed all of 2,117 kg. The ability of ISRO scientists to learn from failures, and their resilience in overcoming technical obstacles, are commendable indeed. Gaining mastery in managing the CUS, which involves a complex process of using propellants at extremely low temperatures in flight, requires higher-order skills in space technology. ISRO has not had a single launch failure in four and a half years, a fact that boosts the confidence level and morale of the scientific fraternity in the country. The record also buttresses the image ISRO commands in the realm of space launches, especially given that other global players are not very generous with technology transfers. ISRO has registered many a successful launch over the last few years, including its mission to the Mars.
However, earning the ‘operational rocket’ tag for the GSLV-Mk-II following the two consecutive successful launches will not immediately mean much, as most of the communication satellites ISRO currently makes are beyond the GSLV-Mk-II’s two-tonne capability. India’s dependence on foreign space agencies to launch those heavier satellites will continue till the GSLV-Mk-III is tested and declared operational. India spends approximately Rs.500 crore per launch, and the cost is rising with each launch. The GSLV-Mk-II, at most, can save money on our own launches but it is not a revenue-earner yet. The INSAT-4A weighing over three tonnes was designed way back in 2005 by ISRO, and the GSLV-Mk-II has cleared two tonnes only a decade later. As global trends reflect an increase in the size of communication satellites and a reduction in the size of earth observation satellites, rocket-making should aim to match future requirements besides being cost-effective. For India, a developing country, every rupee spent has to be worth it. ISRO will require more flawless Mk-II launches to understand GSLV behaviour adequately and develop the requisite confidence and expertise. But the paucity of launch pads might still limit the process. While the Mars mission and the experimental crew capsule mission are feathers in ISRO’s cap, making rockets for satellites should be the priority. Even as ISRO expands its capabilities, how soon it would achieve true self-reliance will be a crucial factor.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-gslv-launch-another-confident-launch/article7591465.ece
31,8,2015,"Needed, smart solutions","After the >unveiling last week by Union Urban Development Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu of the government’s list of 98 cities that it wants developed as smart cities, companies ranging from “smart” energy management firms to surveillance equipment providers have typically welcomed the “great clarity and focus for industry players to engage with the cities’ administration”. They all seem upbeat about selling their hi-tech products to the cities. But the government is >yet to reveal what kind of technology it intends to procure and deploy. So far it has maintained the line that the smart cities are meant to integrate public transportation, drinking water, solid waste management, sanitation and sewerage. But the same convergence is seen in the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut). From the objectives of the new policy, nothing appears ‘smart’ about them; they simply aim to straighten up haphazard municipal services. And you are left wondering what smartness the government could now add to the cities. Is it about having an IT-driven city where one massive control room would deliver public services? Is it about analysing police data to forecast shootouts? Is it about using rodent-related data to neutralise potential infestation spots? That’s how “smart” municipalities function in Europe and in the U.S. But in the Indian context, the new urban renewal theory is far from those lines, and the adjective “smart” is actually misplaced. This vagueness does put a finger on India’s urban planners. Have they paradropped the concept, or do they actually believe in bringing about such a radical change? And considering the amount of time and energy the urbanisation experts at the Planning Commission have invested in discarding old policies and experimenting with new ones, you wonder why they chose to invoke the flashy adjective when their motive was pretty basic. Perhaps the answer lies somewhere between the time the country had a change in political leadership in May 2014 with the BJP coming to power, and now.
Two years ago, when the Congress was in power, the urban planners at the Planning Commission believed the correct thing was to focus on setting the process of urbanisation right. Because various urban renewal programmes had failed they realised that engineers and contractors cannot make urbanisation happen; they can only support the process where it happens organically. And for the time being, they decided to keep the IT companies at bay and work towards fixing the holes. But now that thought seems to be eroding with Mr. Naidu urging local and international investors to invest in the smart cities. His office seems crammed with representatives of Chinese and German companies showcasing smart power grids, smart waste disposal plants, and smart water tanks. He must decide soon whether he’d like to entertain them, or stick to basics.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/needed-smart-solutions/article7596767.ece
31,8,2015,Resolve the OROP agitation,"It is rather strange that even as the government and the veterans of the armed forces are >engaged in a conversation to sort out the remaining areas of disagreement on the implementation of the ‘One Rank One Pension’ principle, the issue should seem set to >take a turn for the worse. >There are suggestions that the veterans will now take their agitation to Bihar, a warning that was held out earlier as well, if their demands are not met. The threat of a deadline itself spells brinkmanship or a deadlock, possibly both. This is contrary to the perceived state-of-play. As recently as on Friday, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar had remarked that some “small gaps” were all that remained to be sorted out. During >his Independence Day speech, the Prime Minister had seemed to walk away from making an announcement on OROP, only saying that he had accepted it “in principle”. He said negotiations were moving forward, and that >a decision would be reached soon. >The Defence Minister followed up on it, pushing the time-frame for the delivery of the promise by saying the government had to do it during its current tenure, and “we will do it quite early”. Nonetheless, he let it slip in the same breath that there were “technical difficulties in [implementing] OROP”. In the interest of ensuring a quick resolution, it would be logical for the government to make a full disclosure of what these technical difficulties are, and also what the gaps that need to be filled are. It should also come forward and set a precise time-frame in which the gaps are likely to be filled. Only when these are properly and publicly identified will it be known whether any reasonable give-and-take is possible. Failure to clarify on these points will introduce suspicion over motives and inject distrust into the process, both among those involved in the negotiations and the larger audience.
It must be stated that the veterans, who in their time no doubt brought themselves glory defending the country’s borders, would be rendering themselves open to criticism and worse if they do not pause and think through their move to take the agitation to Bihar, ahead of the Assembly elections there. That would impart a distasteful political flavour to the agitation. There are sizeable segments of people both in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh who have been or are in the armed forces. Both sides have to show flexibility and come together to end this stand-off as quickly as possible. A prolonged agitation of this kind is in no one’s interest. That there is a rising trust deficit between the veterans and the government is clear; this should be addressed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/resolve-the-orop-agitation/article7596768.ece
1,9,2015,The government gives in,"In letting the land acquisition ordinance lapse, the Union government must have hoped to come across as an administration that is responsive to public criticism and acknowledges key stakeholders’ concerns on important issues. But after having tried hard to sell the amendments as a pro-reforms measure, and to paint the opposition as a misinformed and obstructionist lot, >the Modi government may find it difficult to gain any political mileage from the decision. Indeed, opposition parties are already claiming credit for having forced the government’s hand. And, in contrast, >attempts by Union Ministers and leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party to present the decision as being in the interest of farmers appear to be insincere and hollow. Too much had already been invested in the growth and reforms agenda for the government to now portray the decision as pro-farmer. The confusion in the government’s mind over the legislation showed up in more ways than one. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and BJP president Amit Shah described the decision as pro-farmer, in part acknowledging that some of the provisions were indeed anti-farmer. On the other hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi insisted that “rumours” had been spread on the land bill, indicating that there was nothing fundamentally wrong with it.
The >decision to let the ordinance lapse was the culmination of a series of measures to salvage at least parts of the legislation. The government diluted it in some respects before getting the amendments passed in the Lok Sabha in March 2015. Originally, it had exempted five types of projects — involving defence, rural infrastructure, affordable housing, industrial corridors and infrastructure and social infrastructure — from the consent clause in the 2013 Act brought forward by the UPA regime. It then dropped the ‘social infrastructure’ component. After seeking to exempt the five categories from the social impact assessment requirement, the Modi regime added a condition that it should first be ensured that only the minimum extent of land was being acquired before applying the exemption. It sought to make the Bill more acceptable by introducing a norm that one person in every affected family be given employment. It dropped a controversial amendment that would have enabled the acquisition of land for private hospitals and educational institutions. Later, it considered giving State governments the flexibility to have their own acquisition laws. Even the idea of extending the benefits of the Act to 13 laws — pertaining to railways, highways and such other projects — through an executive order is only in consonance with the original law that held back their inclusion till January 1, 2015. Thus, from the beginning the government, which on other issues was tough and determined, appeared unsure and defensive on the land ordinance. It was inevitable that in the end it had to give in.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/land-ordinance-acquisition-bill-modi-government-gives-in/article7600392.ece
1,9,2015,Act against right-wing groups,"Sunday’s murder in Dharwad of the outspoken Kannada scholar, M.M. Kalburgi, is tragic and alarming. It is the first such instance in Karnataka, which has a tradition of free speech and a record of outspoken scholars and writers. >Kalburgi, a Sahitya Akademi award winner and an authority on Vachana literature, was known for his >sharp criticism and questioning of superstitious beliefs, and received a death threat from the leader of a fringe right-wing group last year. Since June 2014 he was given police protection but some months ago he requested that it be withdrawn. While the identity of the two assailants, and their motive, >are yet to be conclusively established, the nature of the threats against him has led investigators and the intelligentsia to suspect the role of fringe groups. This, especially given the backdrop of the murder of rationalist writer Narendra Dabholkar in 2013, and of CPI activist Govind Pansare in 2015, both in Maharashtra. In all the three cases the assailants were motorcycle-borne, and shot from point-blank range.
While hasty conclusions on the latest murder would be imprudent, there is no denying that fringe right-wing groups have created an atmosphere of intolerance to outspoken writers and academics who question religious practices and myths, thereby putting pressure on freedom of speech and expression. Soon after Kalburgi’s murder, a case was filed by the police in Mangaluru against a Bajrang Dal activist who tweeted that >the “next” victim would be the Kannada writer K.S. Bhagwan, and the activist was arrested. The social media have amplified such threats, which are acerbic and abusive in nature and typically target writers or academics who question ideologies and religious beliefs. There is enough evidence of the use of brute force by these fringe groups to enforce their points of view. There is a need to crack down on these groups which profess violence. It is important to use for some of these outfits the same yardstick as is used for other religion- and ideology-based extremist groups. Unfortunately, a majority of the cases filed against them or their leaders for inflammatory and abusive remarks and even violent acts do not result in convictions, and that emboldens them further. It is also crucial to monitor and promptly curb threats made through social media. These actions are needed to ensure that daring, fierce and tempered academic and literary opinion continues to be freely expressed without fear of any retribution. Whether or not fringe groups were involved in Kalburgi’s murder is immaterial here.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mm-kalburgi-murder-case-act-against-rightwing-groups/article7600393.ece
2,9,2015,Erasing history,"Roads are a city’s arteries, and when they are given new names, the old lose their connect, and with it a part of history is lost. The Bharatiya Janata Party has picked on Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to rewrite New Delhi’s history by renaming a road named after him. Aurangzeb is the archetypal villain in the Hindu nationalist imagination — the cruel ruler who put a sword to people’s heads, offering them a choice between Islam and death. And a despot who hated music so much he ordered it buried deep so that no sound could escape and reach anyone’s ears. Perhaps much of it was true, but often the nuance is lost in textbooks where the process of internalisation of history begins at a young age. Not only cruel, Aurangzeb for the BJP is an outsider, a part of Mughal history, and history it desires to wish away. And when the party decided to replace Aurangzeb with another Muslim, a former President who was the antithesis of the Mughal ruler, a man who loved to play the veena, a benevolent man who pardoned many people from being marched off to the gallows, it was hard not to miss the political statement being made. Mahmood Mamdani wrote in his paper, ‘Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: A Political Perspective...’: “Whether in Afghanistan, Palestine, or Pakistan, Islam must be quarantined and the devil must be exorcized from it by a civil war between good Muslims and bad Muslims.” In India, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, then, was a good Hindu-Muslim. Twitter broke into applause and exhaled a happy sigh. A piece of history was erased for good, some Twitter handles proclaimed. Of course, once the process of correcting perceived historical wrongs begins, there is no stopping it. Delhi and other cities have many roads named after Muslim rulers, and the clamour for change has only just started.
It is a good question to ask whether the departed President could have some other road named after him. When > The Hindu first reported the renaming plan (on July 30, 2015), the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee suggested that Aurangzeb Road be spared to be named after Guru Tegh Bahadur, who died defending the Hindu faith, and another road be chosen to be named after Abdul Kalam. It is fair to ask whether the BJP could have chosen to rename Prithviraj Road or Rajesh Pilot Marg after Kalam. The Congress would then have broken into more than a rash. The party had gone on a spree of relabelling roads named Connaught and Curzon after Indian leaders, and defended the decisions saying it was shaking off the colonial legacy. But Aurangzeb is a part of India’s (pre-colonial) history. A part acknowledged through this road named after him. This renaming is an attempt to excise that part.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/renaming-aurangzeb-road-after-apj-abdul-kalam/article7604307.ece
2,9,2015,Europe’s refugee crisis,"“I pity the poor immigrant, who wishes he’d stayed at home,” sang the American folk-singer Bob Dylan. That verse today finds extra resonance in the scarring images of forced human displacement across treacherous sea and land routes into the promised land of Europe. Thousands leave every day from the war-ravaged and economically broken countries of northern Africa, Syria and West Asia. The harrowing images of mass death captured by the media — the most recent, the 800 people feared drowned when the boat they travelled in >capsized in the Libyan waters south of the Italian island of Lampedusa in April, or the > 71 fleeing Syrians found dead in a truck in Austria last week — point to the magnitude of the human catastrophe that is unfolding across this part of the world. The statistics on recent migration are staggering. According to the UNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency, 59.5 million people were forcibly displaced in 2014, a figure that rose sharply in 2015. A record number of 1,07,500 migrants reached the borders of the European Union last month. The Migrants Files, a collaborative project of journalists, claims the number of refugees who died or went missing while making the crossing is 3,016 this year alone. Between 2000 and today the number is 30,817.
A practical response to the refugee crisis has not, regrettably, been forthcoming from the governments of those countries most affected by the recent influx, namely those of the European Union and Britain. They have tried to turn the focus on criminal trafficking rings that conduct risky refugee escape operations, even as they tighten their own borders. By contrast, there is the laudable spirit shown by organisations, groups that have conducted perilous rescue operations on the high seas, and provided refugees shelter and timely support despite their constrained capabilities and remit. The political and economic destabilisation of countries from where the refugee flow is the greatest — those in West Asia, Libya and Syria — are due in large part to western military intervention carried out on the strength of promises to bring democracy to peoples portrayed as the victims of totalitarian rule. Not only has that promise been belied, the doors have been closed on people who now desperately seek to escape the anarchy and civil breakdown of those countries, which were once relatively stable. A scheme of mandatory quotas to take in refugees, proposed by the European Commission, has met with stiff opposition from several member-states. Germany has given asylum to over 200,000 refugees last year, and Britain to just 32,000. The EU and Britain must adopt a more humane and responsible asylum and immigration policy on the refugee crisis — or be consumed by it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/europes-refugee-crisis/article10345909.ece
3,9,2015,Risky portents in Manipur,"The >crisis in >Manipur stems from the demand to stop ‘outsiders’ from buying land in the State, in a context where the local population, predominantly the Meiteis, harbours fears of being marginalised. The valley constitutes only 10 per cent of the State’s geographical area and Meiteis constitute about 50 per cent of the population there. The long-standing demand has been to introduce a system similar to the >Inner Line Permit (ILP) in other northeastern States, or some similar stipulation, to stop in-migration. But for this to be effective, the State needs to identify the ‘outsiders’ first. But that is a complex issue anywhere in the northeastern region as the borders are largely porous and the Government of India has not done enough to check the passage of people across them. One reason this was not done was to protect the state’s own interest: for a long time now, a section of the immigrants have been engaged to counter local insurgent groups. But as the demand for an ILP >escalated, a cut-off year of 1951 was determined in the new Bills passed on Monday in order to identify outsiders. However, one of them, the Protection of Manipur People’s Bill, and two amendments, have been opposed by the tribal organisations, which claim control of the Manipur Hill districts. These are chiefly groups of Kukis, Mizos and Chins. They feel insecure as many of them who came to Manipur after 1951 or whose lineage may not meet the list of criteria set out in the Bills, could now be legally identified as ‘outsiders.’ Many of them also believe a rumour that the two amendments would be valid in the Manipur Hills districts, which is untrue.
The issues might not have escalated had the State government consulted the Hill Areas Committee before passing the Bills in order to clear any misunderstanding. Neither the organisation that had led the pro-ILP movement nor any of the tribal organisations was approached for any kind of dialogue. The pro-ILP movement was mostly confined to the Valley districts, while the people in the Hills isolated themselves, assuming and arguing that they were protected from outsiders under existing laws. As the tensions grew in the absence of dialogue, political groups added fuel to the fire to try and topple the Congress-led government and invite President’s Rule. Hence, it is not any genuine fear of becoming marginalised but realpolitik that is playing out in the hills of Manipur. But from any perspective, this is a dangerous portent for all the northeastern States. The Centre and the State need to come forward quickly to engage the people and figure out a solution to the crisis in order that it won’t go out of control.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/risky-portents-in-manipur/article7608364.ece
3,9,2015,The case against death penalty,"The Law Commission of India has taken a historic step by >declaring that the abolition of the death penalty must become a goal for India. >It has recommended, for a start, the scrapping of the death penalty for all crimes except terrorism-related offences and those that amount to waging war against the state. The Commission’s report on the death penalty >declares deterrence to be a myth, based on extensive research. It makes a clean break with the ‘rarest of the rare’ principle that was laid down in Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab (1980): that judgment noted that the application of the death penalty would remain arbitrary and judge-centric and hence would be constitutionally unsustainable. It has attempted to raise the level of discourse on the death penalty by observing that opposition to it amounts to objecting to the taking of lives, and not to all punishment as a concept. Retributive justice is important, it notes, but it must not descend to the level of vengeance, as numerous Supreme Court decisions that refer to “the conscience of the people” seem to indicate. It has sought a return to the notions of restorative and reformative justice, and urged a change in tenor, in such a manner that victims are not made to think that the death penalty is the only, best or ultimate form of punishment. Most crucially, it has placed the death penalty in the context of India’s flawed criminal justice system, noting that even safeguards such as the right to appeal and mercy petitions do not provide foolproof protection from miscarriage of justice, given the uneven and error-prone application of relief.
But the Commission has not gone far enough. By creating an artificial distinction between terror cases and others despite admitting that there is no penological justification for doing so, it has created an unfair hierarchy of crime and justice. It notes the death penalty is no deterrent for even a terrorist. Some of the most egregious instances of miscarriage of justice that it cites as an indictment of India’s criminal justice system relate to terrorism-related cases; the 2002 Akshardham temple attack case, for instance, in which the death penalty was imposed by the trial court and confirmed by the High Court, was based on what the Supreme Court later ruled was wholly fabricated evidence. The concerns such instances raise about the death penalty disproportionately affecting the poor and marginalised are more sharply in evidence in terrorism cases — 93.5 per cent of those on death row in terrorism cases are Dalits or those from the religious minorities. By holding itself back from recommending a total abolition, the Commission has put the ball in Parliament’s court. The government and the principal opposition are unlikely to support such an abolition at this point. It can only be hoped Parliament will complete the good work the Law Commission has begun.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-case-against-death-penalty/article7608365.ece
4,9,2015,Welcome step on oilfields,"The government has taken a refreshing and progressive approach with respect to the unutilised natural resources locked away in the 69 small and marginal oilfields lying with the state-owned exploration agencies. The Union Cabinet has not only >approved the auction of these oilfields to private, and even foreign, companies, but also initiated a new approach in the licensing and proceeds-sharing mechanisms. The >first step was to move from a profit-sharing mechanism to a >revenue-sharing one. This may appear to be a technical difference, but the effect on the ground is likely to be huge. The profit-sharing approach meant the government had to pore over the cost details of those undertaking the exploration, often leading to extended delays and disputes. The revenue-sharing approach is simpler, and is likely to earn the government more money. Under the new plan, companies will be allowed to sell crude oil or natural gas at market prices, without any interference from the government. The revenue and royalty-sharing mechanism will be pegged at this market rate. If companies are forced to sell at below-market prices, then the government will still get a royalty share pegged at the market rate. If, however, the company manages to sell at higher-than-market prices, then the sharing mechanism will be pegged to this higher price. That’s a win-win for the government: less oversight and an assured minimum income.
The other welcome step has to do with the >licensing method. At present, companies need a separate licence to exploit each of the different hydrocarbon resources in a given field. Under the new scheme, they will receive a unified licence for all hydrocarbons, including conventional ones such as oil and gas, and non-conventional ones such as shale oil and shale gas. This goes a long way in the government’s move towards enhancing the ease of doing business. Apart from that, the simple act of auctioning oilfields is a step towards weaning India away from oil imports. The Oil Ministry says there are hydrocarbon resources worth Rs.70,000 crore lying unutilised in these fields. At the current crude price of $45 a barrel, the production of hydrocarbons from these new fields will be worth around Rs.3,500 crore a year. This may seem like a drop in the bucket compared to India’s total hydrocarbon imports of Rs.7.6 lakh crore in 2014-15, but every little drop counts. So far, these progressive steps are limited to the 69 oilfields on the block, but hopefully they will be extended to all the oilfields in the country. With growth in oil production slowing and natural gas production contracting, there is a sore need for steps like these to boost domestic production.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/welcome-step-on-oilfields/article7612325.ece
4,9,2015,"Sport, politics and business","Keeping politics and sport separate is easier said than done. In the Indian sub-continent especially, sport is heavily coloured by nationalism: for large sections of a game’s fans, every win on the field is an occasion for display of national pride, and every loss a cause for national despair. Cricket matches between India and Pakistan have more to do with jingoism and less to do with sport as suspense-filled drama and spectacle. Some of the flag-waving and chest-thumping patriotic fervour on show is inevitable as long as sport at the highest level is played in national colours. As George Orwell wrote, “even a leisurely game like cricket, demanding grace rather than strength, can cause much ill-will” between the competing nations. In such a context, the calling off of a cricket series between India and Pakistan is best seen as a disappointment for genuine cricket fans and not as a setback to bilateral relations. But between two nations which otherwise find it difficult to engage with each other in normal, structured dialogue, regular sporting relations — not just a rare, one-off cricket series — can do a lot of good. Sport would then stop being a war by non-violent means.
However, there are factors other than the politics surrounding India-Pakistan relations at play in a cricket series involving the two countries. There has >not been a full bilateral series since the terror attacks in Mumbai in 2008 — although Pakistan did visit India for a >short, limited-over series between December 2012 and January 2013. But the decision to revive cricket ties had little to do with fostering better relations or satisfying fans by promoting a marquee rivalry. Pakistan last year agreed to the International Cricket Council’s revamp, which increased the powers of the Indian, English and Australian boards, on the condition that it would be part of bilateral series with all the full members. Key to its change in stance was the promise of financially lucrative cricket with India: the then Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Najam Sethi had said, “It’s very important to play India because it generates a major chunk of money.” But the memorandum of understanding that the two boards had >reportedly signed to play six bilateral series between 2015 and 2023 faced hurdles much before those created by the recent diplomatic tension. The host broadcaster for the proposed series in December 2015 was TEN Sports, which has a deal with the PCB for home series. However, reports of the network having ties with the Essel Group, which not only has an adversarial relationship with the BCCI but has also threatened to form a breakaway international league, >created issues. Ultimately, what would weigh with the BCCI and the PCB is not the interest of jingoists or fans, but the power play within the ICC, and the irresistible draw of commercial sponsorship.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sport-politics-and-business/article7612326.ece
5,9,2015,Unravelling of the Janata Parivar,"Splits in political parties are the inevitable consequences of their growth and evolution. But the merger of parties, when it happens, is invariably artificial, forced by the transient expediency of immediate circumstances. The Samajwadi Party, the Janata Dal(United), the Rashtriya Janata Dal, and the Janata Dal(Secular) >came together under the Janata Parivar umbrella only because they suffered decimation at the BJP’s hands in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. Other than a common rival, there was little that bound them together. Now, with the >Samajwadi Party pulling out of the ‘grand alliance’ in Bihar with the JD(U) and the RJD, the Janata Parivar faces the prospect of unravelling. Although the SP does not have much clout in Bihar, its inclusion in the alliance in the State was crucial in the context of attempts to project a national-level alternative to the BJP. After the >JD(U) and the RJD in Bihar between them took 200 of the 243 seats for contesting in the upcoming Assembly elections, and gave 40 to the Congress, the expectation was that the SP would be accommodated by the RJD from its quota of seats. But the RJD’s offer did not go far enough: two from its own quota of 100 seats, and three from that of the NCP, which had exited the alliance. Now the formation will remain largely Bihar-specific. The SP does not need the backing of the JD(U) or the RJD or the JD(S) in Uttar Pradesh; the JD(S), similarly, will not benefit in any manner from the support of the other parties in Karnataka, the only State where it has a substantial presence. The two parties that really need each other are the JD(U) and the RJD, and only their alliance is likely to endure, if at all.
What prompted >SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav to jeopardise the Janata Parivar by walking out of the alliance in Bihar for the sake of a few seats is unclear. But evidently it was obvious to the SP that the vision of an alternative to both the BJP and the Congress at the national level was no more than a chimera. In Bihar, the RJD and the JD(U) wooed the Congress but took the SP for granted. Both the RJD’s Lalu Prasad and the JD(U)’s Nitish Kumar knew what they were doing: trying to win the election in Bihar and not worrying about a national alternative to the BJP and the Congress. But in so doing they seem to have left the SP miffed. Clearly, parties that cannot even come to an understanding on seat adjustment will not be able to merge into a single entity. The SP’s exit might not point to the success or failure of the grand anti-BJP alliance in Bihar, but it signals that another 1970s-like Janata experiment at the national level is doomed to fail.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bihar-elections-unravelling-of-the-janata-parivar/article7616375.ece
5,9,2015,Friendly signal,"The >Union government’s decision to waive, through an amendment to the Income Tax Act, minimum alternate tax (MAT) liability on capital gains made by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and >Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) is a welcome move, especially from their point of view. It is in line with the spirit of the promise in the BJP’s manifesto for the 2014 general elections to put an end to “tax terrorism”. The announcement and the subsequent instructions issued to the tax department to keep in abeyance, till the appropriate amendment is carried out, pending proceedings and to not pursue the recovery of outstanding demands in such cases is a big relief to FIIs. In these times of heightened uncertainty in the global financial markets, when risk appetite of investors is especially low, the government’s decisions would serve to restore some of the lost faith of investors in India as an investment destination that doesn’t resort to “retrospective taxation”. But to further demonstrate its resolve, the government must also move to rein in the tax department, which had served notices on 68 FIIs for MAT dues adding up to about Rs.600 crore on the basis of a direction from the Authority for Advance Rulings in 2012 to a Mauritius-based investor Castleton. In 2010, this investor had approached the Authority seeking a confirmation that it was not required to pay MAT on a transaction it was planning to execute. The department has been in too many disputes with global companies such as Vodafone and Cairn, some of which have even dragged India into international arbitration. It has been said that India’s image as an investment destination has suffered as a result.
The same way as the government has taken a position on and dispelled the uncertainty around MAT, it must quickly make up its mind and come out with an announcement on another outstanding issue, concerning participatory notes (P-Notes). India’s indecision on this matter is affecting FIIs. The Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team has asked regulators to put in place regulations to identify individuals holding P-Notes and take other steps to curb black money and tax evasion through the stock market route. P-Notes are offshore derivative instruments that a large number of FIIs use to park funds in the equity market without disclosing their identity to Indian regulators. The tax authorities suspect that a huge chunk of these investments could in fact be Indian money masquerading as foreign funds. The government had said it won’t immediately act on the recommendation after the stock markets reacted sharply to news on it. But sooner or later it will have to decide what has to be done, given that action against black money too was a big election-time promise of the BJP.

Senior BJP leaders constantly reiterate their links with the Sangh Parivar, and RSS sanghchalaks never tire of offering ‘advice’ and ‘guidance’ to the BJP top brass. A private meeting between leaders of the two organisations should not ordinarily have caused concern. After all, political, cultural or social organisations must be free to hold closed-door discussions on policies and programmes. But what took place at the samanvay baithak, or coordination meeting, between the BJP and the RSS was much more than an interaction between the party and its ideological mentor. It was not just senior BJP leaders who were in attendance: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and most of his ministerial colleagues from the BJP lined up for the meeting that seemed more like an inquisition than an interaction. Why an elected BJP government feels it is accountable to the secretive RSS is not difficult to fathom, given the history of Hindutva politics that is sometimes micro-managed through remote-control by the sanghchalaks. But the meeting is invested with a meaning that goes beyond the political interests of the RSS or the BJP, and relates to the accountability of an elected government to democratic institutions and processes.
The samanvay baithak is surely an indication of the sense of ownership that RSS sanghchalaks feel over this government, the first BJP-led government that does not depend on the support of allies. In the 2014 Lok Sabha election, RSS volunteers, in numbers greater than ever before, were involved in the campaign and fieldwork for the BJP. After the BJP secured a majority, many among them seemed to believe the government ought to have followed a core Hindutva agenda. But if the BJP managed to extend its support base beyond its traditional strongholds, it was on account of the party adopting a more inclusive programme of growth and development. While he did not always rein in Ministers and leaders speaking the language of religious hatred and communal divisiveness, Mr. Modi was himself all political correctness. But his participation in the meeting, and his speech — its contents unpublicised — in which he described himself as an RSS swayamsevak, have again raised doubts about the direction his government is taking. It is not as if A.B. Vajpayee, the only other Prime Minister from the BJP, did not have discussions or meetings with RSS leaders while in power. However, a meeting of this kind, with almost all the Union Ministers from the BJP present with report cards, is unprecedented. Clearly, the RSS is seeking to appropriate for itself the role of an extra-constitutional super-parliament, accountable to none but its own sanghchalaks. A coordination meeting of this kind, by whatever name it is called, raises serious questions about the functioning of the government, about hidden agendas and opaque decision-making .",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-relationship-between-bjp-and-the-rss/article7622237.ece
7,9,2015,The gag on Greenpeace,"For a while now, Greenpeace has been in the >cross hairs of the government , first under the UPA and now under the BJP, as it championed civil liberties and causes. Its activists have been prevented from travelling abroad. The non-governmental organisation (NGO) stands accused of concealing and mixing foreign contributions with local contributions. The latest step by the Ministry of Home Affairs simply cancelling Greenpeace’s registration was but an expected next stage in the chain of events leading to a gag that is meant to choke. The obvious assumption is that without funds Greenpeace in India will not be able to function. This has come even as a petition from Greenpeace seeking release of funds to pay its staff, and alleging arbitrariness in the government’s action, is before the Delhi High Court. The action taken under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) — which many NGOs say is a bad application of a poorly drafted piece of legislation — means Greenpeace will not be able to receive any foreign donations. The move has made other NGOs vulnerable too; they face a tough choice, of either complying with the government’s line, or fading out. The media have reported that the invoking of the provisions of the Act followed certain actions by Greenpeace that were deemed inimical to the economic interests of the state. Everything from placing advertisements in newspapers to organising protests against the Kudankulam nuclear plant to anti-nuclear activism, was deemed inimical. Already there is word of some NGOs trying to tailor their activities to suit the interests of the government. What can a democratically elected government possibly achieve by enforcing such compliance and conformity?
Also, it is time to have another look at the FCRA. Passed in 1976 and amended in 2010, it has come in for criticism not only for the overarching control it seeks to have over people-based movements but also for the guidelines framed around it. The MHA is now changing the rules, spelling out what NGOs are required to do, even seeking to scrutinise their social media engagement. Whether the MHA should be looking into expenditure incurred by an NGO to teach street children, for instance, is a moot question. There is hypocrisy involved when some political parties are free to receive corporate donations, especially from abroad, without any questions asked. Equally, all NGOs must respect the law of the land, maintain transparency and remain above board: admittedly, there are some black sheep. Most of them comply; some don’t. But that should be no excuse to gag. Civil liberties and free speech go hand in hand. The government will be ill-advised to trample on these.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-the-govts-gag-on-greenpeace/article7622238.ece
8,9,2015,OROP and after,"Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar’s announcement that the government has decided to implement the > One Rank One Pension scheme came as a huge relief to the veterans of the armed forces and also to those now in the services. There remain some wrinkles that need to be ironed out and gaps in clarity that have to be filled. Most of the doubts are bound to be put to rest when the formal government order is issued. Credit must be given to the government for bringing a sense of closure to an issue that has been hanging fire for over 40 years. That the Prime Minister’s Office finally had to step in after nearly three months of wrenching agitations by the veterans is a telling commentary on the complicated nature of the issue and the hardened, almost intransigent, positions that had to be addressed. Yet it must be said that the government could have handled this better. The same could be said about the timing of the announcement too. By dragging the issue to a point nearly coinciding with the run-up to the Bihar Assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi risked pushing it squarely into the political arena, but he acted deftly. In the time it took for the government to take a decision, the Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party and sections of the Left were raring to move into the breach by beating a path to Jantar Mantar where the veterans were on a hunger strike in a determined attempt to goad the government into action. The veterans should not be allowed to become tools in the hands of politicians. Indeed, by fielding a former Defence Minister to mount a nit-picking attack after the announcement was made, the Congress showed a certain inability to grasp the reality. The fact is that the Congress did not come through when it could have; instead it cited administrative, technical and funding difficulties.
Now that most of the expectations on OROP have been met, a spirit of give-and-take should inform the rest of the engagement. Maximalist positions should be shunned. A pension review every year is desirable, but it should be asked if it would really be practical. The announcement of a single-member judicial committee to examine the interests of retirees may not be the ideal way forward. Given the complexities involved, the government should rather consider an appropriate advisory committee to expedite the process. It would be a pity if the opportunity is not utilised to close the perceived gap between the bureaucracy and the armed services in terms of the compensation package. The government must meanwhile remain determined to discourage any unrealistic expectations and demands that may now come up from other sectors following the OROP announcement.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-one-rank-one-pension-scheme/article7625871.ece
8,9,2015,The Syrian catastrophe,"The shocking image of the lifeless body of Aylan Kurdi, the three-year-old boy who drowned while fleeing Syria’s Kobani, was a tragic reminder of the humanitarian crisis in the > West Asian country. Aylan and his family had been making a perilous journey through the Mediterranean Sea to reach the Greek island of Kos. They were not alone. Thousands flee Syria every day as it grapples with one of the greatest humanitarian tragedies in recent history. More than two lakh people have already been killed in the four-year-long civil war, according to the United Nations. Around four million people have been made refugees. Millions of other Syrians are trapped in the war in which nobody appears to be winning, forcing more people to flee the country. Aylan Kurdi was a victim of this situation. After the image of the boy lying face-down on a Turkish beach surfaced, several European governments, including that of the United Kingdom, have agreed to take in more Syrian refugees. While such moves should be welcomed on humanitarian grounds, it can’t be forgotten that the policies of the very same European governments towards Syria helped cause the chaos in that country.
Ever since the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, there were no meaningful international efforts to find a political solution to the crisis. Instead, regional powers turned Syria into a geopolitical battlefield. Rich Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar supported different rebel groups against the regime because they wanted President Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Iran, to be toppled. Turkey, driven by its regional ambitions, also threw its weight behind the rebels and kept open its long border, through which fighters could cross into Syria to join the war. Western powers such as the U.S. and Britain joined the ‘regime change’ chorus and offered support to the rebels. This drive failed to oust Mr. Assad, but has destabilised Syria, leading to the rise of terror groups such as Islamic State. It’s already too late now to find a political solution. IS controls almost half the country and it is trying to advance into areas controlled by the regime. If that happens, the humanitarian situation in Syria will worsen, triggering a further refugee exodus. To stop that from happening, regional heavyweights such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia and their backers in the West should reverse their policy towards Syria. They should rein in the rebels they bankroll and directly engage with the Assad regime to push for talks. Mr. Assad has to be blamed for the excessive use of force against his people. But he still controls the most populous areas of Syria and rules from Damascus, the seat of power. Mr. Assad clearly has to be an integral part of any future plan for Syria.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-Syrian-catastrophe/article10361407.ece
9,9,2015,Welcome conviction,"The conviction of six Army personnel by a court martial in the >Machil fake encounter case is an important step in ensuring the accountability of the armed forces in Jammu and Kashmir and other States where the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act is in force. The Army opted for a court martial in this case after the Supreme Court ruled in an earlier case of ‘encounter’ in Pathribal that unlike civilian investigating agencies, which under AFSPA required prior sanction to prosecute its personnel, the Army was free to try its members by a court martial. That justice has been done by the court martial is significant in the larger context of efforts to make the armed forces answerable for their actions in conflict zones, and to force the withdrawal of special laws that grant impunity to security personnel in such areas. When police investigations revealed the culpability of its personnel, the Army chose to refer the issue to a Court of Inquiry, which confirmed the murder-for-reward conspiracy. Three Kashmiri youths were lured by counter-insurgents in April 2010 with the promise of Army jobs and handed over to the Army personnel, who shot them at point-blank range in order to earn cash rewards meant for those who eliminate militants. The counter-insurgents were paid off to deliver the youths to the Army personnel for the ‘encounter’. Clearly, from beginning to end the ‘encounter’ was part of a cynical and ruthless project to claim the monetary rewards set aside to eliminate militants.
After the denials and delays in the Pathribal case, the Army did well to hold the rogue elements in its ranks to account in the Machil instance. The Army top brass knew this was no case of mistaken identity or bad judgment in a conflict situation. There was simply no excuse to tolerate such elements in a force claiming to fight militancy and terror. For too long, the default response of the Army has been that its personnel cannot be subject to the regular processes of the criminal justice delivery system. But post-Pathribal, cries to do away with AFSPA had grown shriller. The verdict by the court martial in the Machil encounter case represents the first instance where Army personnel have been convicted for an instance of human rights abuse in Kashmir; it should thus give civil society greater confidence in the internal mechanisms of the Army in dealing with deviant behaviour by its personnel. In the long run, the life sentence handed down to the six men will allow the Army greater room in dealing with militancy in the Valley. The verdict actually reduces the pressure on Army personnel doing their job in Kashmir and other conflict zones in India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-the-conviction-of-army-personnel-in-machil-fake-encounter/article7629920.ece
9,9,2015,A blow for gender parity,"It took the Delhi High Court to set right last week a largely inexplicable instance of official gender discrimination: it ruled that the Indian Navy must grant >permanent commission to women as well, as the Army and the Air Force had to do following a 2010 order by a different bench of the same court. Until now, women could qualify only for the Navy’s Short Service Commission with a tenure of up to 14 years; this made them ineligible for pension and often unable to find other work they were qualified for, virtually midway through their working lives. Following the latest ruling, women who qualify for permanent commission will be able to work until the age of 54, as their male counterparts do. The 19 women who filed petitions before the court argued that they had received the same training as their male counterparts and worked for a comparable number of years in different departments, but could go no further for the only reason that they were women. The High Court rightly ruled that it could not support any provision that would restrain the professional advancement of women. Grant of permanent commission would allow women to rise in rank along with the men, and gain pay parity.
In the Army, since the grant of permanent commission to women began, 340 women have been granted such positions, Defence Minister >Manohar Parrikar recently told Parliament. The latest order will open the doors for women in the Navy too. However, the Defence Ministry and the armed forces must go further. For one, the forces must tackle entrenched sexist attitudes towards women that were in evidence when the Army argued before the Supreme Court against the grant of permanent commission for them, saying that junior officers from rural areas would not be willing to accept a woman as a leader in front line situations, or that society was not yet willing to accept women in combat roles. The proportion of women in India’s armed forces and the police forces is low in terms of global comparative figures, and recent research indicates that persistent bias is a strong ground that drives women away from seeking to serve in them. There has been little effort to go the extra distance to increase female representation: India’s first woman in the Army to receive a gallantry award, Lt. Col. Mitali Madhumita, had to move the Supreme Court for permanent commission after she was denied it on the ground that she had earlier turned it down. Suicide rates among women in the forces have also been disproportionately high, and they do not seem to be getting enough support in coping with the dual tasks of handling work and family life. India’s armed forces must do more now to transform themselves into a space of truly equal opportunities.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-the-delhi-high-court-ruling-to-give-women-permanent-commission/article7629922.ece
10,9,2015,A transfer amid a probe,"The unceremonious transfer of Rakesh Maria from the post of Mumbai’s Commissioner of Police raises a set of serious questions. It came at a time when the 1981-batch IPS officer was steering the investigation in the Sheena Bora murder case towards crucial financial dealings possibly linked to the crime. The investigators had put together a team of chartered accountants and Economic Offences Wing officers to probe a complex web of shell companies, and requested the Enforcement Directorate to follow the money trail. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis signing the transfer order just before leaving for Japan reinforced the impression that the government did not want Mr. Maria to proceed with the probe. Though the Home Secretary explained that the transfer was deliberated over two to three weeks and had nothing to do with the fact that a high-profile figure was caught plotting the murder of her own daughter, the timing was clearly wrong. Mr. Maria was due for a cadre promotion on September 30 following the retirement of two senior officers. That promotion was advanced by 22 days, while he was effectively shunted out from the murder investigation. Moreover, appointing Ahmed Javed, who is one batch senior to Mr. Maria, to the post of Commissioner of Police, and then asking Mr. Maria to continue “monitoring” the Sheena Bora case as Director-General (Home Guards), has created a situation where two DG-level officers, who have not been in the best of terms with each other, have been put in charge of a high-profile case. Though Mr. Maria has indicated that he wouldn’t resign, his “punishment posting” amounts to dissuading him from pursuing the case in the right spirit.
Such ad hoc measures point to the malaise of the political class seeking to exert control over police officers and playing a game of favourites. Given the power and prestige that go with it, the post of Mumbai Police Commissioner is a coveted one. There have been legal battles over it. A cumulative effect is that the Maharashtra Police are now top-heavy: there are seven posts of Directors-General, of which four, including that of DG (Home Guards), are insignificant, non-operational postings. In order to end ad hocism, eliminate lobbying for posts and make top-level appointments the outcome of collective decisions, a Police Establishment Board was set up. However, Mr. Maria’s transfer was not referred to the PEB, and the government used its discretionary powers. Only time will tell what impact this reshuffle may have on the investigation into the Sheena Bora case. But the message the transfer has for Dinesh Kadam, the investigating officer at Mumbai’s Khar police station where the case is registered, is far from encouraging.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-transfer-of-rakesh-maria/article7633837.ece
10,9,2015,Irrational violence,"The most striking commonality among the murders of rationalists Narendra Dabholkar (in Pune, August 2013), Govind Pansare (in Kolhapur, February 2015) and M.M. Kalburgi (in Dharwad, August 2015) is not the modus operandi — motorcycle-borne men shooting to kill and speeding away — but the intolerance and hatred toward their strong views on religion and superstition that the acts reflect. Though investigators have found no substantive leads in any of these cases yet, and the killers’ motives remain unclear, there is little doubt that the three rationalists had provoked religious fanatics and sectarian elements in a deeply conservative society. What is particularly worrying is that the killings have been meant as a warning to other writers and intellectuals who may dare to question established belief systems. Activist-writer Bharat Patankar recently received hate letters asking him not to go the ‘Dabholkar-Pansare way’, and holding out a warning that it would be his turn next. Pansare himself had received threats after the killing of Dabholkar for opposing superstitious beliefs. Kalburgi too had come under pressure for his writings against religious beliefs. Often the threat of physical violence is held out against writers and intellectuals by casteist and communal groups, which are quick to take offence at anything that criticises matters of faith.
Article 25 of the Constitution not only allows the free profession, practice and propagation of a religion of one’s choice, but also an individual’s freedom of conscience. Atheists, agnostics and rationalists have the right to propagate their views on religion as much as believers have the right to spread theirs. What Article 25 guarantees is not a collective religious right but an individual’s freedom of choice. However, communal and casteist groups have often asserted they have a right not to be offended by any writing or work. In effect, they seek a right to thwart or force the withdrawal of the publication of anything that they imagine gives them cause to take offence. Also, political mobilisation along caste and communal lines gives such groups an enormous veto power, that strikes at the very root of freedom of speech and expression. Sadly, whenever freedom of speech is thus threatened, the state, supposedly in the interest of maintaining law and order, takes the side of the collective mob against the writer/ artist/intellectual. Surely, the lack of any progress in identifying and nabbing Dabholkar’s killers must have emboldened the assailants of Pansare and Kalburgi. Whether or not there is a common thread connecting the three murders, it is imperative that the killers are tracked down. Otherwise, irrespective of the motives, the killings would have had the effect of silencing other voices of dissent and reason as well.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/violence-against-rationalists-in-maharashtra-and-karnataka/article7633835.ece
11,9,2015,Sceptical Old Guard?,"Under ordinary circumstances, the extension of > Sonia Gandhi’s tenure as Congress president by a year would not have been cause for any surprise. After all, she is the party’s longest-serving president and the senior-most member of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. But the vote of confidence in Ms. Gandhi by the Congress Working Committee was more than just that: it was, in effect, a vote of no-confidence in Rahul Gandhi, the party vice-president and leader-in-waiting. For more than a year, Mr. Gandhi was being prepared for this greater responsibility, and his non-elevation thus raises some serious issues for the party’s future. Whether the decision was taken to protect Mr. Gandhi from future shocks in the Assembly elections that are due in the coming year — in which the Congress is not expected to do well — or to let him know that his work so far has been below par, the implication is obvious: no matter what Ms. Gandhi thinks, the party is not ready to let her hand over the reins to her son. Even if the CWC was merely giving him more time to succeed his mother, Mr. Gandhi can hardly take comfort from the fact that the party’s highest decision-making body thought he needed protection from the impact of electoral losses. In Bihar, which is already in election mode, the Congress is a minor partner in the opposition alliance. In West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, where elections are due next year, the party is not even a contender for power. In Assam and Kerala, it may well have a tough time retaining power. Clearly, senior Congress leaders thought he could not be of much help, and actually could do a lot of harm to the party’s prospects in these States.
After his two-month sabbatical earlier this year, Mr. Gandhi did seem like an improved version of himself, putting up a spirited attack on the land bill and the government’s handling of the agrarian crisis. But the Old Guard in the Congress remains sceptical of his capability to lead from the front, and his acceptability among prospective allies of the party. Some of the misgivings of senior members of the party might also be on account of their apprehensions about their own role in a party led by Mr. Gandhi, who keeps a coterie of a younger generation of leaders. However willing Mr. Gandhi might appear to be to lead the party, the Old Guard is wary of his abilities to take on the rhetoric of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mr. Gandhi ought not to think of leadership as privilege and of public service as sacrifice, but of leadership as public service. In this, he has a lot to learn from Prime Minister Modi. There can be no power without responsibility; he certainly cannot hope to be in the vanguard without being exposed to the line of fire.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-extention-of-sonia-gandhis-tenure/article7638046.ece

But it will be an even more challenging test for the popularity not just of the “grand alliance” of the Janata Dal (United), the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress led by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, but also of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is heading the Bharatiya Janata Party-led combine’s campaign. With the BJP having decided not to project a chief ministerial candidate, Mr. Modi’s > personal charisma and his 15-month-long record at the Centre will be under scrutiny. The BJP’s decision is dictated not just by the failure of Kiran Bedi, who it chose to challenge Arvind Kejriwal in the Delhi Assembly elections earlier this year, but also by the fact that in > caste-dominated Bihar, focussing on any one individual could alienate those who do not belong to his or her community. Coming as it would less than a year after the BJP lost Delhi 67-3 to the Aam Aadmi Party, a victory for the grand alliance will give the opposition a shot in the arm. It will also give a fillip to the formation of similar alliances in the context of other State elections. A BJP victory here would bolster the belief that the party, and Mr. Modi, remain invincible.
With > so much at stake, it is no wonder that both sides are pulling out all the stops. As caste still remains the determining factor, the grand alliance is looking to Yadavs, Muslims and Kurmis (which is Mr. Kumar’s own community), who together account for roughly 32 per cent, for core support while working to break into the BJP’s extremely backward castes (EBCs) votes by pitching the battle as one between backward and forward castes. The BJP-led combine hopes to secure the backing of the upper castes, the EBCs and Dalits, even as it leverages Mr. Modi’s life story with the youth and the aspirational class — who account for over half the votes — to shatter the hold of caste. Mr. Kumar and RJD supremo Lalu Prasad are friends-turned-rivals-turned-uneasy-partners who between them – along with Mr. Lalu Prasad’s wife Rabri Devi — have ruled Bihar for some 20 of the last 25 years. If Mr. Lalu Prasad has not abandoned his image of an old-style socialist if backward-caste leader, Mr. Kumar would like people to describe him as a development-oriented, modern politician. The two have come together to stave off political irrelevance, and have so far succeeded in keeping their heads above the water. Mr. Kumar has even hired for his campaign a publicist-strategist who worked for Mr. Modi in the 2014 general elections. Now, it is left to Bihar’s 66 million voters to determine the direction of politics not just in this populous and backward State, but perhaps in the country at large.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-the-stakes-in-bihar-polls/article7638047.ece
12,9,2015,Advantage Tamil Nadu,"For a State that has long enjoyed a reputation for being an attractive investment destination, the last few years have been sub par for Tamil Nadu. Even as Gujarat seemed to overpower virtually every other State in the mind space of investors, Tamil Nadu has had to contend with one piece of bad news after another. From the closing down of the high-profile Nokia and Foxconn factories to the seemingly never-ending infrastructure and power woes, there has been little going for it. It hardly helped that there were larger issues affecting investment in India, including concerns about the aggressive taxman, infrastructure woes and the cost of finance. Of late, States such as Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal have taken a cue from Gujarat in staging their own investor summits, stirring up a bit of competition. Also, those such as Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh came across as being more proactive in seeking hi-tech industries. Tamil Nadu has always underplayed itself. It is in this context that one has to see Tamil Nadu’s successful staging of its first-ever >Global Investors Meet , an event that was postponed twice and at one point even seemed a doubtful starter. The icing on the cake is that investors have pledged >Rs. 2.4 lakh crore , more than double of what the initial target seemed to be. One of the important implications of investment is in job-creation. Tamil Nadu, with its huge talent pool of engineers and students with technical skills, needs those jobs.
But the challenge starts now. There is data to show how little of the investment promises actually translate to investment on the ground, not just in Tamil Nadu but across India. Even those that materialise eventually do so over a period of time. Typically, clearances and the process of land acquisition take time. The State has made some progress in dealing with its grave power crisis but isn’t as yet completely out of the woods. For the promises to become reality, power reforms need to continue. Also, its plan, under the Vision 2023 document, to invest $250 billion toward infrastructure needs to come good. What also matters is the health of the economy, both global and domestic. The global economy looks fragile, and in an increasingly inter-linked world could affect domestic investment. There are many things going for the State, though, not least the traditional advantages it has had – skilled manpower, peaceful industrial relations and a strong manufacturing ecosystem. Something else that could woo investors is its amended land acquisition Act, which experts are already talking about as a model for other States. There’s a lot that needs to be done to make promises a reality but, importantly, a start has been made. The pitch is good. Will the end result also be?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-tamil-nadus-global-investors-meet/article7642371.ece
12,9,2015,The perils for Yemen,"The bombing of two boats carrying >also Indians off Yemen’s coast by Saudi warplanes this week shows that Riyadh is indiscriminately using air power to pound Yemen in the name of fighting Houthi rebels. It’s still not clear why the Saudis targeted the boats, which were moving across the Red Sea from the Somalian port of Berbera to Mokha in Yemen. The bodies of six of the >20 Indians who were on board have been found; one is yet to be accounted for. Who will answer for this tragedy? But such questions are of little concern for Saudi Arabia, whose months-long air campaign in Yemen has triggered a humanitarian crisis. Over 4,500 people have been killed and 23,000 wounded since its aircraft started hitting Yemen in late-March. The destruction of infrastructure and the import restrictions imposed by a Saudi-led coalition have led to 21 million out of the population of 26.7 million being deprived of essential commodities and basic services. They now need humanitarian assistance. The Saudi version is that it intervened to defend Yemen’s internationally recognised regime of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi against Houthi rebels. But the ground reality is different.
The Houthis are Shias, who make up between 30 and 45 per cent of Yemen’s population, and are reportedly close to Iran. They were instrumental in the 2011 public protests in Yemen that led to the ouster of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. But the Saudi-managed post-Saleh transition kept Houthis out of political power, leading them to break peace with Sana’a and resume their armed rebellion. When President Hadi failed to consolidate power, the Houthis marched towards the capital, eventually forcing him to flee the country. What made this crisis worse were its sectarian underpinnings. Saudi Arabia’s main concern is over Iran gaining a foothold in its backyard through the Houthis. It must have calculated that a military intervention in Yemen and a possible defeat of the Houthis would weaken Iran and strengthen its regional standing. But the operation has been largely counter-productive, as in the case of several other external interventions in West Asia. Seven months after Riyadh started bombing Yemen, the rebels are still in Sana’a. Meanwhile, the chaos and human tragedy caused by the war are helping terror groups such as al-Qaeda. It’s unfortunate that the people of Yemen are being forced to bear the brunt of the Saudi-Iran rivalry. The international community cannot look away. It has to put pressure on Riyadh to end the bombing, and try to facilitate talks between the rival camps in Yemen. It won’t be easy to bring both the pro-Hadi factions and Houthis to the table. But failing to do so could further devastate Yemen. The human costs of such a development will be catastrophic.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-saudi-warplanes-bombing-yemeni-boats/article7642372.ece
14,9,2015,No thought for food,"Can one person’s religious freedom interfere with another’s food preferences? And what if the freedom of one religious group is in conflict with that of another? The ban imposed in some States on the sale of meat during the Jain community’s annual fasting period of Paryushan is problematic for more than one reason, and militates against the food preferences of a majority of the people in the States concerned. Not surprisingly, the order of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation requiring slaughter houses and meat shops to remain closed for four days during the fasting period led to public outrage, and the Bharatiya Janata Party came under attack from the Shiv Sena, its own ally in Maharashtra, over the decision. When more States began announcing similar bans, the issue became contentious and took on a communal colour. Indeed, the Shiv Sena warned the Jain community that it risked being alienated from mainstream Indian society if it continued to insist on a ban on meat. In Jammu and Kashmir, meanwhile, the High Court called for the strict implementation of a long-forgotten law that prohibits the slaughter of cows, oxen and buffaloes. This fed into the political unrest in the Muslim-majority State, with separatist leaders calling for a shutdown in protest. That the States ruled by the BJP are the ones seeking to impose the ban on meat is not lost on anyone. After Maharashtra, the States of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh and Haryana followed suit, raising the suspicion that the idea of a ban was meant to further the BJP’s political agenda. In Maharashtra, the government had already introduced a ban on beef; the bar on all meat varieties was therefore seen as an extension of the same Hindutva agenda.
Although such a move is nothing new, the publicity given to the ban this time, and it being extended from two days to four and eight days, resulted in much disquiet. Many sellers and consumers of meat are not opposed to a ban on the sale for a day or two; usually the days preceding and following those days would see an increase in sales and compensate for the day of the ban. But a bar for four consecutive days, and the wide publicity given to it, raised fears that the implementation would be strict and that those who did not conform might face prosecution. The stated rationale for the prohibition — which does not cover fish and eggs — is to prevent ‘slaughter’ during the period of fasting. But that did not convince the Bombay High Court, which termed the move “regressive” and “absurd” in a cosmopolitan city like Mumbai. By ordering a ban on meat for an extended period, the BJP governments have revealed a fundamentalist streak, and thus risked a backlash from some of their own core supporters.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-thought-for-food/article7648684.ece
14,9,2015,Act with firmness,"In a country that has seen much outrage over cases of rape and has passed strict laws in the past few years to check such crimes, it seems ironic that the Indian government must watch helplessly as a diplomat who has been accused of brutalising two women is able to evade police action. The Saudi Arabian official cannot even be taken in for questioning on the allegedly barbaric crimes he and some of his family members participated in at their residence in New Delhi. While it would be unfair and imprudent to pronounce him (and possibly others) guilty without going through due process of law, the facts of the case, the outcome of medical examination procedures and eyewitness accounts have led officials to admit that prima facie there is evidence that the victims were repeatedly raped, sodomised, and held captive at knife-point over months. Regardless of the gravity of the crime, however, international diplomatic conventions must be followed, and unless the Saudi government can be prevailed upon to waive the diplomat’s immunity, he will no doubt be on a flight to safety and out of the reach of Indian authorities pretty soon. While Riyadh is unlikely to give up its diplomat, waiving immunity has been done in exceptional cases in the past. In 1997, Georgia did so for its deputy ambassador to the United States who was held guilty in a drunken driving accident that left his 16-year-old co-passenger dead. Other countries have also waived immunity when the crimes merited a full investigation. However, Saudi Arabia has always protected its diplomats, despite what one official termed a “disproportionately high” number of cases involving Saudi officials in heinous crimes. In the U.K. and the U.S., charges of enslaving women have been brought against Saudi Arabian diplomats — to no avail. There was particular anger in the U.K. in 2004 when a Saudi official was accused of sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl, but he too got away.
India must push the Saudi government for accountability. India has an added responsibility, given that those involved are citizens of a third country and came here from earthquake-hit and impoverished parts of Nepal seeking livelihood opportunities desperately. India will need to be sensitive to Nepal’s concerns in the matter. If it fails to secure the Saudi government’s cooperation, New Delhi will still have several options to pursue the case at the bilateral level. Sustained pressure may bear results given that Saudi Arabia expects to host Prime Minister Narendra Modi this year. At the very least, if New Delhi shows its determination to pursue this case, that will serve as a deterrent to any others who may seek to use their diplomatic status to claim immunity from the consequences of their crimes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/act-with-firmness/article7648683.ece
15,9,2015,A blast and some questions,"A horrific blast in Petlawad, in Jhabua district of Madhya Pradesh, has claimed the lives of about a hundred people. It was caused by a stockpile of gelatine sticks stored illegally in a building. The detonation, which ripped through a three-storey residential-cum-commercial complex that also housed an eatery, raises disturbing questions about the practice of illegally storing explosives in congested residential areas. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan was heckled when he arrived in the town to visit the families of the dead, and the State government immediately took the predictable corrective measure — of suspending the local Station House Officer, for not having taken action against the illegal storage of explosives. However, the real problem goes deeper and involves the question of proper regulation of the sale, purchase and subsequent monitoring of explosive materials across the country. According to reports, there are a number of unauthorised contractors in Jhabua district with significant stockpiles of gelatine sticks and detonators, largely to aid the business of sinking wells for irrigation. Rajendra Kasawa, the owner of the seed and fertilizer shop where the stockpile caused the devastation, is only one such.
The sale and transport of such explosive materials is meant to be regulated by the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation, under the Union Commerce and Industry Ministry. PESO has now claimed, with alacrity, that no licences had been issued to Mr. Kasawa. But an incident like this raises a multitude of questions about the ability of a Central agency to monitor all explosive substances everywhere in the country. PESO has its headquarters in Nagpur and it is responsible for the administration of a host of laws pertaining to the regulation of explosives. These include the Explosives Act, 1884; the Inflammable Substances Act, 1952 and the Explosives Rules, 2008. In 2011, the agency announced plans to computerise its operations but that project still appears to be a work in progress. At the district level, the police and the Collector have access to a portal that features data on the sale of all explosive materials through legal vendors, but a system is yet to be worked out for a real-time tracing and tracking programme. A better system should enable a process of decentralisation by allowing States to make their own laws to regulate explosives and have an Explosives Control Bureau, like the Narcotics Control Bureau. Such a step, that will allow the States to take control of what happens in their own backyard, is overdue.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-blast-and-some-questions/article7652360.ece
15,9,2015,Into uncharted waters,"The election of avowed socialist Jeremy Corbyn to the leadership of Britain’s main Opposition party is viewed as being of a piece with recent European movements challenging the established status quo of parties dominated by the Centre-Right. That is true, but only partially. In his entire political career – longer than his 32 years as the Labour Member of Parliament from Islington North – Mr. Corbyn has stood firm with the traditional Labour Left. His views on privatisation and markets, nuclear disarmament, Europe, and war and peace, have been remarkably consistent over time. Mr. Corbyn, who scraped through the nomination process with the minimum needed number of 35 parliamentary backers, astounded the country and probably himself by rapidly rising in the polls, leaving the three other contenders far behind. His unconventional campaign that broke with the political tradition of stage-managed engagement indeed rejuvenated the ranks. He held rallies across the country – drawing audiences in their thousands. And that was buttressed by a lively social media campaign. Sixteen thousand young people signed up as his campaign volunteers. Clearly, Mr. Corbyn tapped into a vein of discontent within the party and the Left, disillusioned by Labour’s electoral defeat in May, and its platform of ‘austerity-lite’.
Despite a 60 per cent mandate from his party, Mr. Corbyn now faces his real test – maintaining his radical agenda and the momentum he has built, while readying the party for the 2020 general elections. This challenge cannot be underestimated. There is a sharp mismatch between his standing among the party rank and file on the one hand, and among the 232 Labour MPs on the other, who worry about the electoral competitiveness of a Labour led by Mr. Corbyn. Only 20 of them voted for him, and several shadow Ministers resigned after he was elected. His demands to end austerity measures and for a national education service akin to the National Health Service, are among the policies that may win backing from some of the parliamentarians. However, his calls for the re-nationalisation of the railways and the energy sector, and the withdrawal of the U.K. from NATO, his opposition to military intervention in Syria, and most controversial of all, the proposal to dismantle the Trident nuclear missile programme, will meet with stiff resistance. Even some unions oppose the last-mentioned demand. The election result made it clear that Mr. Corbyn has a huge public backing and has even won over those who were at one time alienated from conventional politics, heralding what many think could be a transformative leftward shift in Britain. These are, however, uncharted waters that Mr. Corbyn is setting out into. It is one thing to command the overwhelming support of the Labour rank and file; reaching out to the larger electorate is going to be a huge challenge.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/into-uncharted-waters/article7652361.ece
16,9,2015,Fresh initiatives in Sri Lanka,"The Sri Lankan government’s revelation in the current session of the UN Human Rights Council that it is committed to the setting up of a Constituent Assembly of Parliament that will adopt a new Constitution, besides a truth and reconciliation commission, is a laudable step forward six years after the end of the horrific civil war. It reflects the dramatic change in the political context in the country. The setting up of a government of national unity with the two largest political parties, the United National Party and the Sri Lankan Freedom Party, sharing power, with the Tamil National Alliance being given the post of Leader of the Opposition, has provided a welcome space for a credible initiative on the Tamil question. This is in pointed contrast to the nationalist approach of its predecessor government led by President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who appeared to be deflecting attention from its record in the civil war by playing up perceived differences in the international community. The previous regime’s promises of taking steps for reconciliation and rehabilitation and specific steps towards devolution of power to the provincial councils, never manifested on the ground. Notwithstanding the outcome of the UNHRC meeting, it is clear that institutional mechanisms are being put in order by the Sri Lankan government. This offers the hope that there will be a redressing of the long-standing grievances of the minority community related to devolution of power. This is besides the pressing issues of rehabilitation and reconciliation. The involvement of a substantive chunk of Tamil representatives belonging to the Tamil National Alliance in the prospective Constituent Assembly should give a fillip to these processes, and provide an ideal opportunity to thrash out differences related to devolution of power and questions concerning federalism and diversity, in a democratic manner.
It was always clear that the flowering of an inclusive republic in Sri Lanka was not delinked from the democratisation process. If violence, chauvinism and military conflict hampered this transition before the civil war, triumphalism, persisting militarisation and the concentration of power within an increasingly authoritarian coterie acted as restraining fetters after the defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The defeat of the quasi-authoritarian and chauvinist forces in both the presidential and parliamentary elections, the formation of a national unity government and its explicit call for an accountable and democratic form of governance by both the elected President and the Prime Minister, have eased the process of building an acceptable solution to the conflict. The international community should encourage Sri Lanka on this history-making reconciliatory path, and ensure that these efforts are not derailed on any account.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fresh-initiatives-in-sri-lanka/article7655968.ece
16,9,2015,Double the honour,"The adage in Indian sports, other than in cricket, goes thus: its leading practitioners have succeeded not because of the system, but despite it. A Viswanathan Anand or an Abhinav Bindra stands testimony to this. So does the tennis duo of Leander Paes and Sania Mirza, who won the U.S. Open mixed doubles and doubles crowns, their 17th and fifth Major titles respectively, in the company of former singles World No. 1 Martina Hingis. It is easy to dismiss these victories as nothing extraordinary. In fact, it is true that doubles as a format is on life-support. The Bryan brothers are famous, but how many know the second-best team of Horia Tecau and Jean-Julien Rojer? On the women’s side it has taken the Williams sisters and now Hingis to give it a fillip. It is also true that singles players are the ones who have revolutionised tennis: like a Li Na in China or a Kei Nishikori in Japan. In the Indian context it is a potent argument to make, particularly when the country is struggling to produce top-100 singles players. As for mixed doubles, it rarely exists outside the Grand Slams.
Yet, it would be remiss not to celebrate the success stories of Paes and Mirza. The 28-year-old Mirza’s story has been, as the title of her upcoming autobiography puts it, Against All Odds. She is the first Indian woman to win a WTA tournament, the first to be ranked inside the top-30, the first to win a Grand Slam of any kind, and the first to reach the top of world rankings. The last of these came in April this year when she became the No. 1-ranked doubles player, a position she still holds. As an 18-year-old in 2005 she reached the fourth round at the U.S. Open – her best-ever singles finish. Along the way she beat Marion Bartoli – a later-year Wimbledon champion – on the second biggest show court there, the Louis Armstrong stadium. These are the things racquet-wielding young women in India dream of. On the other hand, the 42-year-old Paes has been giving longevity a whole new meaning. With age, a sportsperson is often bogged down by an increasing set of limitations. He also has to make sense of the advancements around him. Paes has not reached a Grand Slam doubles final in two years. But his competitive zeal and persistence even when the mind and the body no longer always act in sync have fetched him three Major mixed doubles titles this year. In a way this has been the essence of the latest U.S. Open – of an epilogue being as good as the book. Be it for Paes or for Mirza, for Roger Federer or for Serena Williams, or for the two Italians in Flavia Pennetta and Roberta Vinci.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/double-the-honour/article7655969.ece
17,9,2015,"New parties, new alliances","That the Bharatiya Janata Party is willing to go to great lengths to accommodate prospective allies in Bihar is an indication of the intensity of the contest in the coming Assembly election. Both the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party, which is yet to prove its strength by contesting on its own, and the untested Hindustani Awam Morcha led by former Chief Minister Jiten Ram Manjhi, were able to bargain hard: the RLSP got 23 seats, and HAM 20. Neither has any ideological affinity with the BJP. Not surprisingly, this seems to have upset the existing equilibrium within the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. Besides, under a behind-the-scenes agreement, some of the HAM candidates might be given the BJP ticket. For the Lok Jan Shakti Party led by Ram Vilas Paswan, which has been given 40 seats, the just-concluded seat-sharing arrangement with HAM is particularly distressing as the support bases of the two overlap in several constituencies. Both Mr. Paswan and Mr. Manjhi are seeking to project themselves as the sole representatives of Dalits, and they now find themselves on the same side of the political fence.
But going by the experience in the rival camp led by the Janata Dal(United) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal, which saw desertions by the Nationalist Congress Party and the Samajwadi Party, the BJP was keen that all partners were on board. Also, the party did not want a situation where it would have to look for post-election allies to form the government in the event of it falling just short of a majority. In Maharashtra last year, although the break-up with the Shiv Sena over seat-sharing was unavoidable, the party was forced to renegotiate the alliance with it after the election, though from a position of greater strength. But deciding on the number of seats for each partner is only the first hurdle in seat-sharing talks. In the close contest that the Bihar election is likely to be, all parties want a winnable seat. Thus the BJP will have to settle the rival claims of the LJP and HAM over several of the seats, and the JD(U) and the RJD will have to sort out their differences. The JD(U) is actually contesting fewer seats than it won five years ago; and the levels of discontent among aspirants for the ticket would be high. As for the RJD, which effectively gave up its claims for the leadership of the alliance, it is important to win as many seats as the JD(U) in order to avoid the possibility of being relegated as a junior partner permanently. Bihar is certainly witnessing a political churn. New parties and new alliances have given the election an added edge.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/new-parties-new-alliances/article7659942.ece
17,9,2015,Time to reform the UNSC,"The adoption by the United Nations General Assembly of a resolution to use a framework text as the basis of discussions on Security Council reforms is a welcome step forward. As India’s Ambassador to the UN, Asoke Mukerji, said, this is the first time in the history of the intergovernmental negotiation process that a decision on UNSC reform has been adopted by means of an official document. This also indicates that most countries in the General Assembly support a restructuring of the UNSC. Meaningful reform of the Security Council is overdue. The institution, formed to meet the challenges of the post-War world, has struggled to cope with the dynamics of the post-Soviet Union world order. In the past quarter century, the global order has seen massive changes, from American unilateralism to the rise of multilateral institutions such as BRICS. The developing nations, including India, now play a larger role in both the international economy and politics. But these changes are not reflected in the UN, where all critical decisions are still being taken by the veto-wielding permanent members of the Security Council. Besides, the geopolitical rivalry among the permanent members has prevented the UNSC from coming up with effective mechanisms to deal with global crises. Syria is a case in point. Even as a humanitarian tragedy is unfolding in Syria, there is no consensus in the Security Council on how to tackle it. Even UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon admitted recently that the UNSC had failed Syria. If the UN still shies away from reforming the Security Council, the possibility of the institution being sidelined by emerging powers cannot be ruled out. The resolution adopted in the General Assembly offers a chance to break the logjam.
But the road ahead is not easy. Three powerful members of the UNSC — Russia, China, and the U.S. — are opposed to any major restructuring of the Council. While Russia and the U.S. have said they would support India’s UNSC bid, when it comes to proceedings at the UN their positions represent a far cry from the promises they make at bilateral meetings. The U.S. favours only a “modest expansion” of the UNSC, while Russia doesn’t want any change in the veto arrangement. Even if the General Assembly members reach a consensus on reform, it could be shot down by the permanent members. The permanent members should realise that a more democratic and representative Security Council would be better-equipped to address global challenges, and that there are more pressing issues to be tackled at the global level than merely preserving their prerogatives. The champions of reforms — India, Japan, Germany and Brazil, or the G4 — should continue their multilateral diplomacy to build a democratically evolved global consensus on restructuring the UNSC.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/time-to-reform-the-unsc/article7659943.ece
18,9,2015,Moving towards accountability,"Accountability for past excesses is not easily achieved in post-conflict societies, but its need and relevance cannot be brushed aside. Fostering peace and reconciliation among formerly feuding sections of society, and finding constitutional solutions to core political issues are often the final objectives. However, transformative and substantive justice requires establishing the truth about past crimes perpetrated as part of a deliberate policy. The human rights investigation report on Sri Lanka, submitted to the UN Human Rights Council by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, seeks to address the crucial question of accountability in the island nation for the “horrific crimes” committed by all parties to the conflict that ended in 2009. The report proposes a special hybrid court that will integrate international judges, prosecutors and investigators with domestic resources. It concludes that many of the instances established may amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity. The report records unlawful killings, disappearances, deliberate bombardment of hospitals, and other crimes by the security forces. It also records the killing of civilians by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, its forced recruitment of adults and children, and preventing civilians from leaving the conflict zone. The report marks a major step towards independently establishing “system crimes” — showing a pattern of conduct on the part of “perpetrators working within an hierarchical command structure”.
The report recognises the present national unity government’s efforts to engage the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Sri Lanka’s brief response does not contain any explicit reference to the proposed hybrid court, but only a promise of reconciliation and non-recurrence of violations. Colombo now has a unique opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to durable peace and reconciliation by accepting the recommendations, especially the one relating to enacting special legislation to establish ad hoc hybrid courts. The process will not be easy. The political will of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government will come under test, as there may be forces opposed to any non-domestic mechanism. India will also be looking at the process closely, the South Asian region being new to such a trans-national inquiry. However, it should not be forgotten that the Sri Lankan conflict always had an international dimension, with many countries involved in supporting both war and peace. The new proposal strikes a necessary balance between the clamour for an international probe and the need to involve domestic institutions. It is time to render justice to the victims of what was South Asia’s longest war.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/moving-towards-accountability/article7662608.ece
18,9,2015,On the road to recovery,"A government that was elected to power on the promise of ushering in an economic revival nationally, will have good reason to cheer over the latest data showing an increase in investments in the road and power sectors. With roads and electricity acknowledged as significant multipliers of economic activity, any substantive improvement in these infrastructure sectors can presage a major boost to the real, productive economy. McKinsey & Co. estimates an increase in infrastructure investment equivalent to 1 per cent of GDP would generate an additional 3.4 million jobs, directly and indirectly. Conversely, the low global ranking of India’s infrastructure — the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index placed it in the bottom half among 144 countries — is one of the commonly cited impediments to attracting foreign direct investment. A 2014 study by Dr. Geethanjali Nataraj of the Observer Research Foundation estimated that lack of world-class infrastructure shaves off 1 to 2 per cent from GDP growth every year. It is in this backdrop that the 46 per cent surge in project announcements, representing an amount of Rs.1.2 lakh crore, in the first quarter of the fiscal offers much hope. More important, the 31 per cent jump in the completion rate of projects during the period signals a distinct improvement in the investment climate, especially in terms of efforts to reduce red tape and revive stalled projects. Success in bringing long-mired projects to fruition also bodes well for the banking and finance industry, which has struggled to reduce the levels of non-performing assets. And with the NDA government’s focus being on encouraging more private-public partnerships, this is a promising augury for private investors in the road and power sectors. The Vajpayee government’s Golden Quadrilateral project, completed during the UPA’s term, has brought socio-economic change and development to the hinterland along the more than 5,800 route km of the highway network. That gives a glimpse of the potential that can be unlocked through better urban-rural connectivity.
Still, the data have made only a broad classification of the road transport sector. Not offering a breakdown of the real level of investment in road construction and maintenance could be partly misleading if the aggregate investment in the automobile sector is being included in the overall numbers. Also, the national road network has been blighted by an abysmal safety record. The government’s announcement of $93 billion worth of projects in the highways sector has to be seized as a chance to build world-class expressways and ensure that systems are put in place to lift safety levels for the road transportation network to global standards.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/on-the-road-to-recovery/article7662609.ece
19,9,2015,Unwarranted pettiness,"Nothing could be more ironical than the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government fighting over the secularist legacy of Jawaharlal Nehru institutionalised in the form of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library in the heart of New Delhi. And nothing could be more insulting to the memory of Nehru than the sordid slugfest between the BJP and the Congress over the appointment of Mahesh Rangarajan as the director of the NMML. Dr. Rangarajan, a respected scholar and academic, was eventually forced to tender his resignation after an unseemly controversy over irregularities in the process of his appointment. The NMML is a tribute to independent India’s first Prime Minister, his vision and dreams for the country; it was intended to inspire generations of people who walk in to get glimpses of the making of a nation. Despite assurances from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to revere the memory of Nehru, it is now quite apparent that members of his Cabinet, who draw their strength and inspiration from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, are not willing to let the Museum be. Murmurs about changing the basic structure of the Museum to make it “more contemporary” have slowly gained ground. And while Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma might have scored a legal point by highlighting the irregularities in Dr. Rangarajan’s appointment as director, it is no secret that the government wants a more pliable person to head the NMML.
The proposal to turn the NMML into a memorial for governance not only smacks of political petty-mindedness, but also undermines the very purpose such memorials were meant to serve, as repositories of history. Indeed, the battle over the institution seems but only a small part of a larger project of the ruling establishment to challenge received historiography and erase collective memories. The significance of the controversy over the appointment of the NMML director thus goes beyond personalities, and touches on the future of public institutions and the dangers of officially sanctioned manipulation of historiography. Questions will be asked of the UPA too, as to why the previous government demonstrated such a tearing hurry to appoint Dr. Rangarajan. Clearly, the party thinks of the Memorial as its fiefdom and thought nothing of rushing through the appointment process just before the country went into election mode. While the attempt to provide institutional stability to the Memorial is understandable, due process could have been followed and Dr. Rangarajan spared the embarrassment of having to battle a new government on the propriety of his appointment. At the very least, the Congress could have protected the integrity of an individual whose tenure it had sought to retain in perpetuity. Going by the yardstick being applied to the Nehru Memorial Museum, why not turn Gandhi Smriti too into a memorial for all the nationalists who were Gandhi’s contemporaries, and make it representative of their collective vision? Surely, to do so would be to knock all meaning and symbolism out of such institutions, and reduce them to their functional use as bricks-and-mortar buildings that could house anything and everything.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unwarranted-pettiness/article7665651.ece
19,9,2015,A diplomatic failure,"The quiet departure from India of Majed Hassan Ashoor, the Saudi Arabian diplomat accused of sexually assaulting two Nepali maids at his residence in Gurgaon, is a blow to New Delhi, both in terms of its pursuit of the issue on the diplomatic front and its commitment to fight crimes against women. Mr. Ashoor and some others face serious allegations. The women, rescued by the police from his apartment, allege they were held against their will, denied food and water, beaten and repeatedly raped over a period of at least 15 days. Their medical examination appeared to support the charges. India could not even question the accused before he flew home. If early reports are true, Mr. Ashoor’s departure was part of a diplomatic bargain struck between India and Saudi Arabia. Though New Delhi’s decision to release the name and designation of the diplomat — Mr. Ashoor was the First Secretary at the Saudi Arabian Embassy — is an unusual step, it failed to coax the Saudis into lifting his diplomatic immunity and bring him to justice. Saudi Arabia should have cooperated with India in the investigation, setting a precedent for its own diplomats and other nations in such situations.
As far as India is concerned, the case is far from being resolved. With the diplomat’s departure, what was a triangular crisis has acquired the form of a bilateral standoff between India and Nepal, which is an important neighbour. Apparently upset over the departure of Mr. Ashoor, Kathmandu insists India should continue the investigation to bring the diplomat’s partners in the crime to justice. The fact that the women in question were also victims of human trafficking networks needs to be taken into account. India thus has a legal and moral responsibility to get to the bottom of the case. At the same time, it is time for the international community to revisit the Vienna Convention, which offers a high degree of legal protection to diplomats and their families in the countries where they are posted. The Convention was meant to enable diplomats to carry out their duties without obstruction in the Cold War environment. Using its provisions to save diplomats facing charges of heinous crimes such as enslavement and rape cannot be justified under any circumstances.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-diplomatic-failure/article7665653.ece
21,9,2015,The enigma remains,"West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s >decision to declassify 64 files pertaining to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose has resurrected a seven-decades-old controversy. The files have little in terms of definitive evidence on Bose’s death or disappearance post-1945, but have documented unconfirmed reports that he may have survived the plane crash of 1945 in Taiwan in which he was supposed to have been killed. The release of the files in Kolkata has stepped up pressure on the Narendra Modi government to declassify those in the Central government’s custody so that the truth about whether Netaji indeed died in the crash comes out. Although the BJP had while in opposition at the Centre demanded the declassification of the files, the Prime Minister’s Office under Mr. Modi >recently turned down a request made under the Right to Information Act, citing concerns over relations with other nations.
The Bose story has been the stuff of legends, and many anecdotes have been heard over time. Some said he was sighted in Russia, others that he returned to India as a sadhu. There is little in terms of compelling evidence any which way. However, rumours kept the issue simmering. There have been subtexts of conspiracy theories. Bose’s grandnephew and scholar Sugata Bose wrote in his book, His Majesty’s Opponent, that even in Nehru’s lifetime “some rumourmongers hinted darkly at foul play by Nehru himself”. Here, the controversy acquires political undercurrents. While the book says available evidence suggests Bose died in hospital after the crash, stories that he outlived it allow attacks on the Nehru regime and, by implication, the Nehru-Gandhi family and the Congress. In the fact that the Bose family was snooped upon for a time after Independence, some saw Nehru’s ‘fear’ of the family. Little can be said about the motives of the snooping till all the files are available. Also, keeping an eye on political leaders is widely believed to be an aspect, however unfortunate, of statecraft, even if it has implications for citizens’ privacy. There has also been a belief that Bose was “wronged” by Mahatma Gandhi and his supporters in 1939, when Gandhi refused to work with Bose as Congress president, citing ideological differences; the latter had to resign. Many feel Nehru didn’t back Bose enough, though evidence suggests that Nehru did try to broker peace between Gandhi and Bose. The issue has a strong emotive appeal in West Bengal. Chief Minister Banerjee’s master stroke has put pressure on the BJP, which was expecting to ride the Bose legacy in a State where it has had hardly any presence. Pressure will now mount on the Centre to declassify the files in its own custody, before the State goes to the polls in 2016.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/netaji-subhas-chandra-bose-files-the-enigma-remains/article7671215.ece
21,9,2015,Amber light for the RBI,"The U.S. Federal Reserve’s >decision last week to leave interest rates unchanged offers an amber signal for Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan as he prepares to make the fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement for the fiscal year on September 29. The Fed’s move in delaying the much-anticipated start of ‘normalisation’ of interest rates provides some elbow room to Mr. Rajan as it removes, for now, the risk of rate arbitrage seeking capital outflows. The reasons cited by Fed Chair Janet Yellen for the decision to postpone the initial increase were mainly heightened uncertainties in the global economy including in China and the emerging markets, and a slightly softer expected path for inflation in the U.S. While Mr. Rajan’s decision will predominantly flow from the RBI’s reading of domestic conditions — including food price trends, banks’ lending rates and how far they reflect earlier interest rate reductions, removal of supply-side bottlenecks and assessments of the targeting of public spending and credit flows — one factor predicating the retention of the RBI’s accommodative stance as spelt out in August was the sign from the U.S. To that extent, the Fed decision opens a window of opportunity for the Indian central bank to further lower domestic borrowing costs if in its reckoning the balance between spurring growth momentum and taming inflation expectations has tilted favourably away from price gains. The latest data from the government on wholesale and consumer prices >indicate an appreciable slowing of inflation, while the Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index for August shows a softening in both output growth and new orders from the preceding month.
That Mr. Rajan himself and Deputy Governor Urjit Patel, speaking separately and in different contexts but on successive days, have both underlined that the central bank believes >inflation expectations need to be anchored from a longer-term perspective rather than reading much into the latest data points, makes one less sanguine that the RBI may be ready to switch the green light for further policy accommodation. And Mr. Rajan’s caveat that the pursuit of growth must be tempered by the lessons offered by developments in Brazil, and that too much stimulus risks fanning inflation and deficits along with faster growth, is another straw in the wind. With a drought-like situation looming and the prospect of renewed pressure on prices from farm products and a waning base effect further clouding the picture, the prospect of the central bank opting to wait and watch till its December 1 meeting is real. And the Fed will inevitably have to bite the bullet and initiate its lift-off: it is only a matter of timing. This gives scope for Mr. Rajan to see the amber as a cautionary pause.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/amber-light-for-the-rbi/article7671216.ece
22,9,2015,Constitution sans consensus,"Eight years after the adoption of an interim Constitution that heralded a peace process, Nepal has finally >managed to promulgate a Constitution. The path to becoming a secular, federal, democratic and republican Nepal — as the Constitution envisages it to be — was tortuous, and it could not be concluded on the basis of a consensus among the elected legislators in the Constituent Assembly (CA). But it has moved Nepal significantly and in a progressive manner away from the 1990 Constitution that maintained the state as a constitutional monarchy ruled by a Hindu king. That said, did Nepal’s polity — 507 out of the 601 lawmakers in the re-elected CA voted in favour of promulgation, with 69 abstentions, mostly by legislators from the Terai, and 25 from the Opposition — live up to the promises in the interim Constitution, which was itself the outcome of the Jan Andolan seeking republicanism and state restructuring? The substantive answer to that question must be in the negative. For one, the promulgation happened >even as violent protests raged in the Terai against “injustice” meted out to the Madhesis. The protestors were upset that the federal restructuring of Nepal into seven provinces left the Madhesis divided among five provinces, with only one of them having a majority of plains-origin people. Clearly, the lack of consensus in the run-up to the promulgation will remain a political sticking point in the restructuring process. The leaders of the three main political parties — the Nepali Congress, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) and the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) — have affirmed that the federal boundaries could be changed later. But it begs the question why even after seven years of deliberations the concerns of the Madhesis were not taken on board. The conclusion is that the hill elite have thwarted what could have been a truly inclusive and democratic Constitution.
There were also other reasons for discontent over the new Constitution. These include the delineation of electoral constituencies in the Terai (where more than 50 per cent of Nepal’s people live) which has not been done on the basis of the population in the plains; this creates a grievance about gerrymandering. Other complaints relate to citizenship norms that disallow children of Nepali mothers married to foreigners from inheriting Nepali citizenship. All said, the people of Nepal would be somewhat relieved that there has been a degree of closure to the Constitution-writing process. The recent earthquake had only worsened economic conditions and there was a sense of fatigue with the Constitution-writing process. The people required their polity to focus on governance in a stable Nepal. The polity could do well to take the necessary constitutional steps to address the Madhesi concerns and to live up to these expectations on governance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/constitution-sans-consensus/article7674746.ece
22,9,2015,Justice for the victims,"The >seven peak-hour serial explosions on July 11, 2006 in Mumbai came as a blow to the collective consciousness of Maximum City. For months after the explosions, daily commuters entered the compartments of suburban trains, rightly called the lifelines of Mumbai, with suspicion in their eyes, and fear in their hearts, every single day. The task of securing the lives of 7.5 million daily commuters against attacks still remains a challenge. In these nine years, the Railways spent over Rs. 10 crore to upgrade security on the Central and Western Railway systems. From a situation where there were virtually no CCTV cameras, the suburban train lines now have over 3,600 cameras. But Mumbaikars know in their hearts that while commuting on the train network they are really on their own in a city that has faced seven major terror attacks since 1993 — three of them on its trains.
The 2006 train bombings killed 189 people; in terms of numbers it is second only to 257 victims in the 1993 serial bombings. The trial of the 1993 serial bombings case took 14 agonising years, but Judge Y.D. Shinde has managed to complete this trial in less than five years. At least two more terror trials including the Aurangabad arms haul case of 2006 and the Malegaon bombings case of 2008 are still pending in Maharashtra. Mumbai’s two worst terror attacks make for a strong case to expedite terror trials through fast-track courts. It will not only help bring quicker closure to the victims and reduce their helplessness in the face of a tardy justice system, but also aid the rehabilitation of unfortunate people like Abdul Wahid Shaikh, a 37-year-old teacher who has now been acquitted after nine years in jail. The final verdict in this case will be significant as it will be the first major terror case after the >July 30 hanging of Yakub Memon to bring into focus the question of the death penalty. The Law Commission of India in its draft report >recommended speedy abolition of the death penalty for all crimes except those involving terrorism. The defence team led by advocate Yug Mohit Chaudhry, a strong voice against the death penalty, has made pertinent points before the court. He submitted that the Law Commission’s August 2015 report points out that only 4.3 per cent of all death sentences awarded by trial courts were upheld by the Supreme Court; the rest either resulted in acquittals or were commuted. Arguing that the train blasts case rests merely on the confessions of the accused, which may be a basis for conviction, he urged the court to award the death penalty only if culpability is absolutely certain. Now, Judge Shinde has the task of defining the direction of the debate on capital punishment with his verdict.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/justice-for-the-victims/article7674748.ece
23,9,2015,Living down a covert unit,"The > Technical Support Division, a covert intelligence unit of the Army raised during the tenure of > General V.K. Singh as Army chief, is in the news for all the wrong reasons. The revelation that sensitive documents relating to it were destroyed illegally in 2012, in the final days of General Singh’s tenure — he is a Union Minister today — deserves a thorough and serious inquiry. The > TSD has faced allegations that it misused funds earmarked for secret service operations, indulged in unauthorised surveillance and made attempts to destabilise the Jammu and Kashmir government. Some of these charges are attributed to the findings of an inquiry report by a Board of Officers. The latest exposé by this newspaper, with documentary evidence, shows that between May 22 and May 25, 2012, the Pune-based Southern Army Command assembled two different boards of officers to destroy all > TSD-related documents in its possession. It is puzzling that the military authorities went ahead with a general court-martial against a havildar who was charged with offering these documents to the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), though the originals had been destroyed. Further, the documents that were used during the court-martial proceedings were not certified copies. And two different sets of copies appear to have been produced by the Army and the DRI in the court-martial. To compound the problems, Havildar Sham Das D. has not been given a copy of the verdict, citing reasons of secrecy, making it difficult for him to go in appeal. Whether he was actually trying to leak official secrets or was framed as part of a larger feud among the Army top brass, requires investigation.
The entire episode concerning the TSD, its functioning as well as the inquiry against it, and the manner in which the fallout of disclosures about the probe report was handled, indicate that two factions may be at work within the Army seeking to discredit each other. Given the sensitive nature of the unit that is involved, it is possible that the destruction of the documents may be part of an effort to clean up the mess left behind by disclosures about the TSD. The most sensitive aspect from a diplomatic and national security point of view concerns the claim that the TSD was actually involved in covert operations in a neighbouring country. It may be for reasons of secrecy and the need to protect the dignity of the Army as an institution that no public disclosure has been made about all aspects of this controversy. There have been only occasional news reports and leaked information about purported inquiries and findings. What is required to live down the operations of a disbanded covert unit is a comprehensive and independent judicial investigation, followed by internal reform in all such agencies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-technical-support-division-documents-living-down-a-covert-unit/article7678264.ece
23,9,2015,Mixed-up narratives,"Like death and taxes, it has become a certainty: every passing week brings forth a reminder that freedom of speech and expression are wobbly concepts in our country. Recently, Bengaluru-based producer, entrepreneur and independent MLA Ashok Kheny announced a film based on the persona of Tipu Sultan, with > Tamil superstar Rajinikanth possibly in the lead. The mere mention of the project was enough, it seemed, to unsettle the BJP and its ideological allies. Some of its Tamil Nadu-based figures quickly denounced Tipu as an aggressor who had committed “atrocities against Hindus”. Then they brought in another angle, saying Tamils had suffered during Tipu’s rule, and so making a film about him “would be an insult to Tamils”. Even the actor’s reputation was not spared. Given that > Rajinikanth portrays himself as a spiritual person, they questioned the appropriateness of his acting in a movie about someone who robbed this country. Such reactions to a film that is just in the stage of a proposal is but further proof that sections of India’s political establishment have lost the ability to distinguish between artistic expression and historical accuracy. It would appear that they want to control the narrative of figures and events from the past to reflect a view that corresponds with their own, with scant regard for history or artistic freedoms.
After all, the issue is also about an artist’s fundamental right to re-examine a mythological or historical figure – through books or paintings or cinema. If the political parties involved believe in the democratic system, then they should debate the legacy of Tipu Sultan. Was he a courageous anti-colonial crusader, or just a religious imperialist who lusted for political power? What did he mean to Tamils, to Hindus? But that would mean allowing the possibility of another point of view emerging, in the manner democracy should function. The protagonist of the Hollywood film The American President says, “America isn’t easy… It’s gonna say ‘You want free speech?’ Let’s see you acknowledge a man whose words make your blood boil… You want to claim this land as the land of the free? Then the symbol of your country can’t just be a flag; the symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest.” Or take the case of The Queen, which was an unflattering portrait of the British royal family in the aftermath of Princess Diana’s death. There was nary a protest from any quarter, or demands to ban the film, despite the story being about people who were still alive. In contrast, in India, even long-dead figures seem to be beyond the hands of artists. Apparently, they belong only to politicians.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-freedom-of-speech-mixedup-narratives/article7678265.ece
24,9,2015,The encryption debate,"The thing to appreciate most about the government’s draft encryption policy, brought forth with the ostensible goal of ensuring privacy and promoting Internet security, was the speed with which >it was withdrawn. There was little in the draft that was true to the goal; the provisions, instead, had enough in them to harm the cause. Encryption, a process in which digital messages are scrambled so they can’t be accessed by anyone other than those they are meant for, is a means to ensure freedom of expression and to keep information secure in the digital world. The aliases one uses in the social media environment can be a fun way to keep casual users from identifying you. But that isn’t enough. The digital world also comprises criminals and terrorists, and repressive regimes. Some of them would not only want to know who you are and hack into your information and messages but also have the means to do so. Encryption keeps intruders at bay. So, on Monday when the draft was released, experts and netizens could quickly figure out that the provisions had the real potential to undermine encryption. One of the provisions sought to give the government access to encrypted data that rest with government departments (save the sensitive ones), corporates and individuals. Another provision required users to store all encrypted communications >for a period of 90 days. The backlash had its effect; the draft was withdrawn the very next day.
Union Minister for Communications and Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad rightly and quickly chose to emphasise that it was “just a draft and not the view of the government”. But while the draft goes back to the drawing board, it is important to realise that any debate on encryption isn’t going to be easy and straightforward. Bigger battles await us. The world over, administrations have sought weaker encryption standards or backdoor access to Internet products. They present this as a public safety vs privacy issue. Administrations cite public safety as the reason for asking for encryption access. FBI Director James Comey even complained to U.S. lawmakers recently: “We cannot break strong encryption.” British Prime Minister David Cameron has already created a stir by calling for a ban on strong encryption. Granting governments the power to tap into every message and item of information and store them, will have the potential to make the system extremely vulnerable. David Kaye, UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, wrote in a report in May: “It is a seemingly universal position among technologists that there is no special access that can be made available only to government authorities, even ones that, in principle, have the public interest in mind.” Access to encrypted data should, therefore, be provided as an exception, not as a rule.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-the-encryption-debate/article7681977.ece
24,9,2015,Putin’s plans for Syria,"President Vladimir Putin seems set for a grand bargain over Syria. Going by reports from U.S. officials and satellite images released by various organisations, including private intelligence companies, Russia has sent offensive aircraft, advanced tanks and hundreds of troops to Syria to defend the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, its ally. The deployment, which represents the largest overseas >military presence for Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union, indicates Moscow is preparing for its first major military operation outside its neighbourhood since Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989. Mr. Putin is expected to present his Syria strategy at the UN General Assembly later this month. The Kremlin has apparently sought a meeting between Mr. Putin and President Barack Obama to discuss the Syrian conflict. The details of the Putin plan are yet to emerge, but statements from Russian officials and the nature of the military presence in Syria point to a two-pronged strategy — to prevent any rapid collapse of the Assad regime, and to push for talks with all the stakeholders but the jihadists, to find a political solution.
Why can’t Mr. Putin now be given a chance? The Western strategic disarray has proved disastrous for Syria. The U.S. and its European allies backed anti-Assad rebels at the beginning of the civil war, but that only aided Syria’s destabilisation and the rise of powerful jihadist groups. Then they started an >airstrike campaign against Islamic State , which has been ineffective in countering the jihadists. Even a $500-million U.S. programme to train “moderate Syrian rebels” to fight IS collapsed; the Pentagon recently admitted that only four or five fighters are now on the battleground. There has to be a strategic shift in the way the world is handling the Syrian crisis, and Mr. Putin seems to be trying to effect such a shift. To be sure, there is criticism that Russia is complicit in the Syrian tragedy as it supports the Assad regime and therefore its overtures cannot be taken seriously. If Russia is complicit, so are other countries including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, the U.S. and those of the European Union. This war is not just one between a ruthless dictator and his opponents; it is a complex geopolitical confrontation in which several countries are involved, directly or through proxies. So any meaningful multilateral effort to find a solution to the conflict should be welcomed. The question is whether the two powerful groups — the West and its Gulf allies and the Russia-Iran-Syria trio — can find common ground on Syria. The ferocious rise of IS is a good enough reason for such a common ground, provided there’s the political will.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-warplanes-on-russian-drone-surveillance-on-syria-putins-plans-for-syria/article7681978.ece
25,9,2015,Revisit the sedition law,"As ironies go, this one is rich. A circular in Maharashtra containing guidelines aimed at preventing the misuse of the law relating to sedition appears to endanger freedom of speech and expression. The Bombay High Court has now >stayed the August 27 circular, pending a decision on its constitutional validity. The controversial aspect of the circular is that it seems to tell police personnel that strong criticism of public servants can possibly attract the sedition charge if it shows them as “representatives of the Union or State government”. The circular was an offshoot of a judgment by the High Court in March this year on the question whether the police were right in slapping the sedition charge against a cartoonist in 2012. Though the charge was dropped subsequently, the court reminded the authorities that sedition as an offence requires the element of incitement to violence and disaffection against a government established by law, and mere criticism of government policy or public servants will not attract the provision. The Advocate General had said the government would come up with guidelines as a circular to police personnel on when and how Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code may be evoked. It seems a point in the High Court order that sedition will not be attracted by words or signs or representations against politicians or public servants, unless they were shown to be representative of the government, was loosely translated in Marathi to the effect that any criticism against politicians and public servants representing the Union or State government would attract the charge.
The potential for mischief from the circular has been stalled by the court order now, but the fact is that police officers continue to invoke Section 124A indiscriminately. Flagrant instances in recent times include the >registration of a sedition case against cartoonist Aseem Trivedi, one of the petitioners against the latest circular, for cartoons produced in 2012 highlighting corruption, and the >attempt to book some Kashmiri students in a university in Meerut last year for cheering for Pakistan in a one-day cricket match against India, using a pre-Independence era provision that was meant to suppress the freedom movement. While the possibility of groups and individuals promoting disaffection against a lawful government still exists, there is little justification to invoke the sedition charge against political movements unless they promote violence and public disorder. Instead of ad hoc attempts to put in place loose safeguards and guidelines, the government would do well to review such outdated penal provisions. Legislation exists to deal with unlawful activities and armed movements. There is no need to criminalise words spoken or written, however strong and provocative they are in their criticism of the state.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/revisit-the-sedition-law/article7686039.ece
25,9,2015,Bangladesh’s imperilled writers,"The >threats issued by the Ansarullah Bangla Team, a Bangladesh-based Islamist group, against secular writers and activists pose a challenge to the polity of Bangladesh. The ABT, which has been blamed for a series of murders of secular bloggers, has released a hit list on the Internet. It names Bangla writers living in different countries, and threatens to kill them all unless its demands are met. It wants the government to revoke the Bangladeshi citizenship of the writers listed, who it terms “enemies of Islam, apostates… and unbelievers”. This threat is a direct challenge to the state of Bangladesh. It comes weeks after ABT leader Abul Bashar and several other activists >were arrested in connection with the murder of blogger Avijit Roy. Yet, the ABT has sent out a clear message that its violent campaign against critical thinkers and writers would only continue.
The secular bloggers are victims of an ongoing conflict between the ruling elite and violent Islamists. Ever since the Awami League government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina opened the trial of those who committed war crimes during the country’s liberation war, Bangladesh has seen a steady rise in violence. The Islamist groups are steadfastly opposed to the trial, but they lack the political capital to influence either the society or the state. So they have chosen to vent their anger through violent street protests. The Jamaat-e-Islami, whose leaders were indicted in the trial, and the main opposition, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led the protests, which worsened the law and order situation. It was against this background that rightwing fringe groups such as the ABT started targeted killings. They attack the bloggers as they know they are soft targets. Hitting government officials and others involved in the trial would invite the wrath of the state machinery. The government’s response was on expected lines. Instead of immediately taking action against the assailants, the authorities advised the writers to “avoid provocative statements on sensitive religious issues”. It took four murders this year for the government to finally start cracking down on the ABT; by that time it had grown in strength. The government has to crack down on such fringe groups that are threatening free speech. The very survival of Bangladesh as a secular-democratic country may be at stake. Mainstream parties such as the BNP should set aside narrow political calculations and back the government in the fight against religious fundamentalism. They should realise that teaming up with fundamentalists might fetch short-term dividends, but in the long term it would only weaken the state and rupture the society.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bangladeshs-imperilled-writers/article7686041.ece
26,9,2015,A case for decorum,"The confrontation between the Bench and a section of advocates in the Madras High Court is >adversely affecting the image of the legal fraternity in Tamil Nadu. It is not the first time that unsavoury events are eroding the dignity and prestige associated with the black robe. There is a growing public perception that a belligerent section of the lawyer community >is responsible for this. Another view is that lawyers want to raise accountability issues against judges through such protests. More than the occasional issues involved — not all of them related to the legal profession — these perceptions have created the current atmosphere of mistrust between the Bench and the Bar. Disruption of work, protests and slogan-shouting within High Court compounds constitute one form of indecorous behaviour. Other forms that have been on display include organising advocates on caste lines and forming support groups for individual judges, making grave allegations of misconduct and corruption against the judiciary, and creating an atmosphere of fear. The latest standoff arose from an unusual cause that advocates in Madurai took up: against an order directing the Tamil Nadu government to strictly enforce the rule that makes the wearing of helmets mandatory for two-wheeler riders. Other matters of discord too arose: allegations against some judges, followed by initiation of suo motu contempt proceedings against two office-bearers of the Madurai Bar Association.
Some lawyers >took up a new cause: the use of Tamil as the language of the Madras High Court. There was a day-long sit-in inside a court hall, something that drew a vehement rebuke from the Chief Justice of India. The police also found themselves at the receiving end of adverse comments by judges for inadequate action to prevent such protests. The court now wants the Central Industrial Security Force to be in charge of security on the premises. The State government has declared the High Court premises in Chennai and Madurai as high-security zones but does not favour any Central agency handling the security tasks. The situation bodes ill for the litigants’ interests: they may not only lose court time because of various protests, but their access to the premises may also be curtailed. It is time for the State government to work out a foolproof security arrangement that does not affect public access to the courts, but at the same time ensures smooth judicial functioning. The Bar should close ranks and seek to address the judges’ concerns. Contempt proceedings and suspension of some protagonists from their Bar Council membership do constitute a legitimate response, but what is more important is the restoration of an atmosphere of amity. The dignity and reputation of the legal profession are at stake.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-case-for-decorum/article7689713.ece
26,9,2015,Portents of radicalisation,"What runs common between a middle class Indian mother of three and a Delhi college student, as also an obscure religious group based in a Goan village and a militant group in the northeast? They are all manifestations of a renewed radicalisation that is gripping major religions, as old divides come to life and new gashes open. Afsha Jabeen, who was >deported to India for her evangelisation efforts, and some youngsters from Kerala who were sent back by the UAE for sharing radical posts on social media, do not represent isolated instances of a new acceptance that Islamist fundamentalism has found among many Indians. There have been reports of several Indian youth joining Islamic State, and more wanting to do so. The latest is the case of a young woman from the national capital, a Delhi University graduate and daughter of a retired Army officer, who wanted to join the ranks of the regressive, violent movement in Syria that is behind one of the biggest humanitarian catastrophes of our times. These could still be cited as isolated instances for now, but they could well turn into a tide. India’s experience with radical religious tendencies is still far better than that of many other countries that have seen hundreds of youngsters leaving modern comforts and heading for the ‘battle-front’. What Indian society at large should worry about is also that the fundamentalism is not limited to Islam. Obscure groups such as Sanatan Sanstha >are trying to impose their irrational arguments, often through violent means, infringing upon the fundamental rights and seeking to subdue India’s celebrated diversity. In the northeast and in Kashmir too fanaticism is finding new life and vigour, its ripples felt beyond immediate geographical boundaries.
The signals are clear: religious radicalisation is not a distant threat anymore but a reality closer home. Forces of obscurantism are feeding on global and local discontent to create narratives that appeal to even those brought up on a liberal education. Religious fanaticism has found new vigour not just in the clash of civilisations being played out across continents, but also in the dangerous political atmosphere created by some mainstream parties domestically. The vigour of movements in one religion feeds similar ones in others. Their misleading messages find roaring life on the information highway. As governments, political leaders, and society at large reap the benefits of globalisation, they cannot ignore its dark underbelly where obscurantist ideas flourish. One of the fallouts of the information revolution propelled by the Internet is that messages of fanaticism could also spread like wildfire, and governments could be overwhelmed by their power. India needs to wake up to this threat.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/portents-of-radicalisation/article7689712.ece
28,9,2015,The challenge of skills and jobs,"The scale of the skilling challenge that India faces, and the urgency involved, have been palpable for some time, but new official data put into cold numbers the extent of the problem. Fewer than one in 10 adult Indians has had any form of >vocational training, and even among those who have, the type of training is not the sort of formal skilling that employers seek – the majority had either acquired a hereditary skill or learned on the job. Just 2.2 per cent in all had received formal vocational training. In comparison, 75 per cent of the workforce in Germany and 80 per cent in Japan has received formal skills training. Even among the BRICS countries, India lags behind – nearly half the Chinese workforce, for example, is skilled. Very few Indians get a technical education in medicine, engineering or agriculture; fewer than one in ten Indians is a graduate, and among those who are graduates, the majority get undergraduate degrees in arts, science or commerce. The problem is more acute in rural areas and for women. Without access to affordable and appropriate skills training, young people, particularly those leaving rural areas and small towns for big cities, will be stuck in low-wage, insecure jobs that will leave them in want or poverty.
The Narendra Modi government has made skills and jobs one of its focus areas from the beginning of its term. In July, the Prime Minister launched an ambitious mission to impart skills training to 40 crore people by 2022, and the new government has a dedicated Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. The problem is that the previous government talked the same talk on skills but was able to achieve precious little; the proportion of young adults who had received vocational training was virtually unchanged between 2004-05 and 2011-12. There isn’t any clear evidence yet that the new government is charting out a radically new path on skills. There remain multiple decision-making authorities on skills and little clarity about who exactly will do the work. Promises of corporate and foreign partnerships on skilling are pouring in, but how these mass skilling programmes will take off is unclear. Employers complain that job-seekers do not have the skills they look for; there is little evidence yet that curricula with these objectives in mind have been designed, or that new and affordable training institutes have been set up on a mass scale. Job creation has not kept pace with India’s demographic momentum, and that will in the coming days pose a problem for a skilled workforce. But let’s not put the cart before the horse – a poorly trained young workforce can neither bring workers out of poverty nor help a country grow quickly.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-challenge-of-skills-and-jobs/article7695056.ece
28,9,2015,The message from New York,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s takeaways from his ongoing visit to the United States are being keenly watched. His primary challenges in this phase relate to improving India’s overall relationship with the U.S. while furthering his country’s global ambitions. The decision, just hours before Mr. Modi boarded his flight, to clear >defence purchases worth $3 billion from Boeing in many ways demonstrated the importance that New Delhi attaches to the state visit. Expectedly, the Prime Minister has vigorously pushed for the reform of the UN Security Council — in speeches at the UN and later at a multilateral summit. Mr. Modi’s decision to host the summit of the Group of Four nations was one of the key moments of his diplomacy in New York. While backing one another’s bid for permanent seats in the UNSC, India, Germany, Japan and Brazil have collectively called for urgent reforms of the Security Council within a time-frame. At another gathering, Mr. Modi invited U.S. companies to step up investments in India. The top-level participation of American companies at the meeting, pointed to the importance U.S. industry is giving India. Executives from 42 Fortune 500 companies, with a combined net worth of $4.5 trillion, were there.
While the overall message from New York is positive, the government has to work hard to bring to fruition the goodwill established: the task begins now. India’s most important challenge here is to continue the campaign to reform the Security Council. Nothing much has come out of India’s push over the years to restructure the global body. The challenge is to build a democratically evolved consensus among world powers, particularly among the Security Council members, on the need to reform the UNSC. Second, though American companies are keen to invest in India, they remain wary of “complicated regulations, confusing bureaucracy and poor infrastructure”. If the government is serious about enhancing business and trade relations with the U.S. further, it should accelerate the pace of reforms at home and build quality infrastructure — of course making sure that its own long-term interests are not sacrificed or compromised. Third, bilateral relations between India and the U.S. have always been a tricky area for decision-makers. While defence cooperation has improved over the years, the failure to operationalise the nuclear deal, Washington’s continuing support for Pakistan and reluctance to second major reforms at the UNSC are issues. Besides, the principle of a multilateral approach in India’s foreign policy has not gone down well with the Washington elites. Mr. Modi ought to take up some of these issues when he meets Barack Obama on Monday. They should address them, so that what has often been termed a “natural alliance” could be firmed up to mutual advantage.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-message-from-new-york/article7695055.ece
29,9,2015,Wages for the parliamentarians,"The idea of creating an Emoluments Commission to recommend >salaries and allowances for Members of Parliament has not come a day too soon. The pay and reimbursements drawn by lawmakers may not be unusually high in India by global standards, but two points have been agitating the people in recent times: the power enjoyed by legislators to fix their own salaries and the loss suffered by the exchequer as day after day is lost to parliamentary logjam, resulting in MPs drawing daily allowances through whole sessions during which no business is transacted. In this backdrop, the proposal of the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs to establish an independent, three-member commission to fix the pay and allowances of parliamentarians is a sign that the government and the elected members themselves are sensitive to growing concern about the public expenditure incurred in their name. The proposal is on the agenda of the All-India Whips’ Conference to be held in Visakhapatnam, and may form the basis for future legislation to de-link members of the legislature from the process of fixing their emoluments. Members of Parliament currently draw a monthly salary of Rs. 50,000, a constituency allowance of Rs. 45,000 and a sumptuary allowance of Rs. 15,000. They may also hire secretarial assistance for Rs. 30,000. They are entitled to daily allowances and travel concessions besides other perquisites. The present levels of pay and allowances, however, have not been revised since 2010.
If an independent body is created for the purpose, India will be following the example of the United Kingdom, where an Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority has been created by law to oversee and regulate ‘business costs’ or the expenditure incurred by lawmakers in their parliamentary functions, and fix their pay and pension. Such a mechanism may help put an end to criticism, and sometimes public outcry, over legislators rewarding themselves with pay hikes and additional allowances from time to time. In a country where public life is associated in the popular imagination with unbridled greed, and parliamentary representation is seen as a means to amass wealth, it will be tempting to wonder why lawmakers need a salary at all, or, looking at legislative work often coming to a standstill, to question the present pay structure or the need for regular revision. However, payment for legislative work is an important element in attracting public-spirited citizens to participative democracy. As a general principle, pay ought not to be the primary attraction for elective office, nor the privileges and perquisites that come with it. At the same time, it cannot be so low as to be a disincentive to the public for entering the legislature. An independent pay panel for parliamentarians is surely a welcome proposal.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Wages-for-the-parliamentarians/article10397221.ece
29,9,2015,Mr. Modi in Silicon Valley,"Right through his whirlwind tour of the U.S. West Coast, the first by an Indian Prime Minister since 1982, it seemed Narendra Modi could hardly put a foot wrong. The >meeting with all the Silicon Valley technology companies that matter set the stage nicely for him to play the charming salesman representing a resurgent India in a digital age. This may be a narrative that critics, many of them back home, don’t want to buy. But whatever the political orientation, it would have been hard to miss the buzz generated when the elected head of the world’s largest democracy met the who’s who of new-age businesses, including Google’s Sundar Pichai, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, and Apple’s Tim Cook. Mr. Modi also participated in another highly anticipated event – a town hall meeting with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. It’s remarkable that the only other leader who had participated in a town hall with Mr. Zuckerberg is President Barack Obama. There is little doubt that Mr. Modi is a master at creating a larger-than-life feel around his events. Amplifying that feel was the fact that a large number of Indians call Silicon Valley, the hub of technology innovation in the world, their home. Indians came in huge numbers to cheer Mr. Modi wherever he went. The Prime Minister, a skilled orator and one who has more than a feel for the digital world and its mores, obliged them gladly.
But what does all this translate to? To equate Mr. Modi’s efforts in Silicon Valley just to the initiatives promised by the big technology firms during this trip, as some have done, would be to miss the larger point. For the record, Google plans to enable Wi-Fi in 500 railway stations, Microsoft wants to make available low-cost broadband in five lakh villages, and chip manufacturer Qualcomm is launching a $150 million start-up fund in India. These efforts would involve tiny sums given their scale. But again, the point isn’t that. The point is to hard-sell India as an attractive investment destination, a country with skilled manpower, and a nation on the move. Mr. Modi looked more than convincing with that marketing message. Of course, it helped tremendously that India has one of the highest growth rates today in the world amid a sea of troubled economies. Also, the success of India’s diaspora is a selling point in itself. All this means that the big corporates of the world can ill afford to ignore India. But the question now is whether investors are seeing enough positive changes on the ground. Having successfully made the India pitch, Mr. Modi’s challenge will be to don a different hat and deliver on those promises.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mr-modi-in-silicon-valley/article7699143.ece
30,9,2015,Pump-priming growth,"Reserve Bank of India >Governor Raghuram Rajan has opted to send an unequivocal message that as long as the domestic growth momentum remains tentative and price pressures don’t pose a threat to the central bank’s inflation target, monetary policy will remain accommodative. The RBI’s decision to surprise markets and cut the >benchmark repo rate by a sharp 50 basis points to 6.75 per cent — the lowest level in more than four years — is the most emphatic signal that it stands ready to help boost domestic demand and investment. In saying that “more domestic demand is needed to substitute for weakening global demand in order that the domestic investment cycle picks up”, Dr. Rajan has underlined the fact that local demand and investment hold the key to sustaining an incipient recovery. Clearly, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision earlier this month to continue to maintain the funds rate near zero in the backdrop of heightened uncertainties in the global economy, including in China and the emerging markets, has fed into Dr. Rajan’s calculations. So has the fragility evidenced in the financial markets following the devaluation of the yuan. And slowing inflation appears to have made the central bank sanguine about price gains being unlikely to pose a near-term threat to the economy, prompting it to lower its >Consumer Price Index inflation projection for January to 5.8 per cent.
That growth appears to have for the moment taken pre-eminence and been placed front and centre in the RBI’s reasoning for its policy decision is, however, cause for some concern. As central bankers down the ages have reiterated, there are two key elements that form the bedrock of any communication emanating from the monetary policy authority — consistency and credibility. It is the consistency of messaging that may now be questioned by critics. For, Dr. Rajan had, less than two weeks ago, flagged the risks of too much stimulus fanning inflation and deficits, stressed the importance of anchoring inflation expectations from a longer-term perspective, and cited the example of the meltdown in Brazil. Indeed, the latest policy statement itself acknowledges that inflation is likely to start accelerating for a few months from September as “favourable base effects reverse”. And the central bank goes on to stress the role that the government needs to play to ensure food price stability by proactively managing the supply side so as to head off any pressures. That Dr. Rajan has chosen to frontload monetary action and pass the baton to the government, the banks and industry — in order to help ward off inflationary risks, transmit the benefits of interest rate cuts to borrowers, including home buyers, and increase productive investments — could put at stake his best-regarded asset. And that asset is his credibility.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pumppriming-growth/article7703139.ece
30,9,2015,Space observatory takes wing,"With the successful > launch of the space observatory, Astrosat, the Indian Space Research Organisation has put India in a select group of countries that have a space telescope to study celestial objects and processes. The ability to simultaneously study a wide variety of wavelengths — visible light, ultraviolet and X-ray (both low- and high-energy) bands — has tremendous implications for scientists globally, particularly those in India. Though stars and galaxies emit in multiple wavebands, currently operational satellites have instruments that are capable of observing only a narrow range of wavelength band. Since the Earth’s atmosphere does not allow X-rays and ultraviolet energy from distant cosmic objects to reach ground-based telescopes, space observatories become important to unravel celestial mysteries. With Astrosat, Indian researchers will no longer have to rely on other space agencies for X-ray data, and scientists everywhere need no longer source data from more than one satellite to get a fuller picture of celestial processes. As in the case of Chandrayaan-1 and the Mars Orbiter Mission, Mangalyaan, the Astrosat telescope will have no immediate commercial or societal implications. But the instruments have been carefully chosen to allow scientists to pursue cutting-edge research. Chandrayaan-1 and Mangalyaan returned invaluable information, although they were launched several years after other countries sent satellites to the Moon and Mars. Given the uniqueness of Astrosat, it will enable Indian researchers to work in the frontier areas of high-energy astrophysics.
It is for the first time that a majority of the payloads for an Indian satellite has come from outside ISRO. In fact, ISRO has built just one of the five payloads for >Astrosat; the rest comes from scientific institutions based in India. Two of the payload operation centres that would validate the data obtained by Astrosat will be located in the Mumbai-based Tata Institute of Fundamental Research that built three of the payloads, and one each in the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics in Pune, and the Indian Institute of Astrophysics in Bengaluru that built one payload. This is in recognition of their contribution to the mission. Besides providing an opportunity to build world-class instruments, Astrosat will present an ideal platform for researchers in these institutions. As is the norm internationally, for a year the teams that built the payloads would have exclusive control over what is observed by the satellite. That singularly will be the biggest benefit to Indian researchers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/space-observatory-takes-wing/article7703140.ece
1,10,2015,IS terror at the doorstep,"The >killing of Cesare Tavella, a 50-year-old Italian aid worker who was out on an evening jog in a relatively secure Dhaka locality, should be a wake-up call for governments in South Asia, especially India. The possibility of international terrorism taking a deadlier trajectory stares them in the face. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the murder this week. If that is confirmed, it would be the first attack by the particular terrorist group in a South Asian country, barring war-torn Afghanistan. India’s long and bloody face-off with terrorism has been mostly in the form of bomb blasts and suicide attacks, all of them the handiwork of one large group or the other. The activities of such groups inherently have the weakness of information leaking out, and consequently Indian agencies have been able to thwart several terror attacks. Though the IS, which controls swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria, doesn’t seem to have established any organisational network in India and its immediate neighbourhood until now, the Dhaka incident is an announcement that lone-wolf attacks could happen in India as well. To be sure, the IS has negligible support among the Muslim community in India. Besides, Islam in >India has a broad syncretic reach and has generally been spared the overweening influence of West Asian Wahhabism, or the Saudi version of Salafism, from where IS seeks to draw ideological legitimacy. Still, there are fundamentalist proclivities among certain pockets and there is a possibility of IS targeting or influencing disaffected youth among the community. This poses a serious challenge.
The security establishment must ensure that it has the capabilities to prevent any attack by IS and other fringe groups. For long, Indian intelligence agencies have been heavily dependent on technical intelligence to monitor terrorist activity. Indian agencies need to reinvigorate their field operatives, strengthen their numbers, and recruit more cadres from among minorities. But the potential IS threat cannot be tackled just by means of a security-oriented response. The government has to ensure that the grounds of disaffection among the largest minority community in the country are addressed in a just way. Growing intolerance, invasion of private spaces, and abuse of individual freedom and of rational thought are all signs of fringe elements revealing their fangs. Such tendencies hold the potential to rupture social harmony, creating opportunities for extremists to gain traction. For a multi-religious, multicultural society, this would be disastrous. India needs to have a comprehensive approach to check extremism that addresses both the issue, irrespective of religion or sect, and its causes. It should build its anti-terror strategy on a social foundation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/is-terror-at-the-doorstep/article7707999.ece
1,10,2015,Development and security,"Development comes in many forms and serves multiple purposes. Over the last few months, the Central government has initiated a series of steps to upgrade communications and transport >infrastructure in areas affected by naxalite activity. The larger project is to not only usher in development in the tribal areas and improve the living conditions of populations in hilly and forest terrains, but also facilitate security operations against Maoists, who specialise in ambushes and hit-and-retreat tactics. Hundreds of mobile phone towers have been erected along the >Red Corridor, and roads and bridges are being built to connect naxalite-affected districts. Ending the isolation of some of the villages in remote areas of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand is, no doubt, part of a strategy to win over local populations and wean them away from the influence of armed groups of Maoists. But, coming as it does with heavy deployment of Central police forces, such infrastructure development is suspect in the eyes of many villagers in the tribal regions. The ‘development’ is often seen more as an effort to allow access to tribal areas for security personnel in pursuit of Maoists rather than as an attempt to open up the outside world to the villages. Invariably, the state is seen as an external agency waiting to wield its authority and extend its reach without allowing substantial consequential benefits to the villages. Any state-sponsored activity, even if it is in the name of development, is thus met with hostility, and viewed as no more than an extension of the security apparatus.
Better facilities can at best mark the beginning of a process of addressing the livelihood concerns and social insecurities of tribal populations. Without investing in health and education infrastructure, increasing employment opportunities, and raising the quality of life in tribal areas, it would be difficult to address the >socio-economic grievances that feed into the Maoist agenda. While the government ought to do everything in its power to end arbitrary and irrational violence by the Maoists, ‘development’ should not be reduced to building mobile towers, roads and bridges. Democratic institutions are yet to take root in many of the villages where Maoists have their sympathisers. In many areas Maoists have assumed a representative character and elections are boycotted at the instance of leaders of the Communist Party of India (Maoist). Thus, merely concentrating on upgrading infrastructure without addressing long-standing grievances will not meet the government’s objectives. Representative institutions in the villages must be made party to decision-making in the development process, which should go beyond the infrastructure needs of the security personnel.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/development-and-security/article7708000.ece
2,10,2015,The archives beckon,"The West Bengal Government on September 18 >declassified a cache of 64 documents relating to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, some 70 years after he disappeared and left behind many larger-than-life myths. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee followed that up with the release of confidential Cabinet meeting papers from the period from 1938 to 1947. How should one look at these decisions? As something that should have happened a long time ago, or as a signal of things to come in the future? Government documents, papers, personal memoirs, correspondence, Cabinet notes, virtually anything can have a classified tag put on them in India, rendering them beyond scrutiny for an indefinite period, to be accessed only by those who are authorised to do so as set down in the Manual of Departmental Security Instructions that categorise classified documents as Top Secret, Secret and Confidential. Any breach could attract the draconian provisions of the Official Secrets Act, a legacy of the colonial period. The Right to Information Act seemed to offer some hope of transparency being ushered in, and of a willingness on the part of governments to take citizens along in the process of governance. But Section 8 of the Act continues to provide the means to hold documents in official custody. The U.S. has a strong de-classification tradition, though it retains the right to keep some documents away from the public gaze. The U.K., over the years, has declassified documents after a lock-in period. Now Germany has opened up its archives to scholars. So what do classified documents mean for the world’s largest democracy?
Ideally, >the disclosures on Bose — although what has been released is only a small part of the collection, with a substantial portion remaining in the custody of the Central government — should open the floodgates on several documented events from the past. Journalist and historian Neville Maxwell put online a year ago a telling account of India’s debacle in the 1962 war from the Henderson-Brooks Report that had been marked Top Secret. There is now a clamour to make public documents relating to the sudden and rather mysterious death of Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, some 50 years ago in Tashkent. Other documents that ought to be made public include those on the misuse of the intelligence agencies and other questionable actions during the period of the Emergency, the run-up to Operation Bluestar and the Indian Peace Keeping Force operations in Sri Lanka. The way to aid informed public discussion is by making authentic information on the past accessible — without of course forgetting that not everything can be put out in the public domain.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-archives-beckon/article7712680.ece
2,10,2015,The old chorus and a false note,">India’s response to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s latest comments at the United Nations General Assembly marks a shift in the government’s strategy in dealing with the periodic references to Kashmir that Pakistan has made it a practice to make at UN fora. To begin with, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it clear that he intends to stick to his ‘ >red lines’ on Kashmir. So any talks between the two countries will not be on terms set by Pakistan, which seeks to make Kashmir the central point of such exercises. That Mr. Modi and Mr. Sharif stayed in New York at the same hotel and attended the same conference along with world leaders, and yet did not make the time for a bilateral meeting — they settled for a simple hand-waving gesture while at the peacekeeping summit — indicates that there has been no diplomatic headway since National Security Adviser-level talks between the two countries were cancelled in August. Later, in its sharp response to Mr. Sharif’s speech at the General Assembly, India demonstrated a major shift in its approach on Kashmir at the UN. In a point-by-point reply to Mr. Sharif’s reference to Kashmir as a land “under foreign occupation”, India brought up the condition of Kashmiris in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), saying it was up to Pakistan to vacate Kashmir and not the other way round. Consequently, India dismissed Mr. Sharif’s four-point formula that included points on demilitarising Kashmir and the Siachen glacier. It was delivered not directly to India but to the UN, in yet another attempt to internationalise the issue rather than offering a sincere solution.
However, India’s decision to reply to the Pakistani line on Kashmir with counter-allegations on the PoK seems to be a false step. Despite all its attempts over the years, Pakistan has been unsuccessful in getting the United Nations or the P-5 Security Council members to consider any reference on Kashmir; the subject was last discussed by the UNSC in 1971. All of its references and pleas to UN committees to take up the dispute have been disregarded, and every P-5 nation has counselled both countries to resolve the issue bilaterally. At a time when India’s position on this question is actually being upheld, it is puzzling why New Delhi wished to take this new line at the UN; it would only invite the multilateral spotlight back on to the Kashmir issue. As an active aspirant to a permanent seat in the Security Council, India’s stature would be enhanced internationally if it instead sets in motion a bilateral process to resolve issues with its neighbour, with a view to ending the decades-old dispute. That will need the bricks-and-mortar of sustained discussions on the basis of common interests. Such a process cannot possibly be replaced by a simple wave between the two Prime Ministers across a crowded floor at a UN meeting.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-old-chorus-and-a-false-note/article7712679.ece
3,10,2015,Social movement to political party,"In terms of immediate impact, single-agenda social movements are often more effective than multi-dimensional political parties. That the >Patel reservation agitation managed, within a short time, to mobilise large sections of the Patel community in support of a separate reservation quota for it is in no small measure owing to the singular focus on a pressing demand. What drew many youth to the movement, and to its >leader Hardik Patel, was the prospect of a quick realisation of the demand for reservation in education and jobs, not any desire for long-term political change. By seeking to expand the role of the movement by launching a political party, the Akhil Bharatiya Patel Navnirman Sena, Hardik Patel is thus taking a big gamble. True, the reservation movement was unable to make any headway despite having forced the Gujarat government to offer financial assistance for higher education and relax the age limit for government employment. But there is no way the new party can immediately advance the cause of the community’s demand for reservation. That Mr. Patel is intent on expanding the scope of the agitation even without anything to show for all his efforts thus far, betrays a political ambition that wants to vault over ground realities. While the reservation agitation found the backing of Patels affiliated to different political formations, this will not be the case with the new party. Many among the community who have been traditional supporters of the BJP will doubtless see this as counter-productive. Instead of being able to pressure the BJP government in Gujarat to back their demand, the Patels could now find themselves further alienated from the power centres. The new Sena would have to adopt an all-or-nothing political strategy while taking on the BJP.
While Patels account for more than 10 per cent of Gujarat’s population, they do not have the numbers to elect a government on their own. If political power is what >Hardik Patel is after, he would have to build political alliances. That he is trying to cut himself loose from the BJP was clear from his stated support for Nitish Kumar in Bihar. His party wants to negotiate with the Gujarat government from a position of strength, not as a supplicant. But as an active political player it would lose its ability to negotiate with parties. Networking with other caste groups such as Kurmis and Gujjars can only offer limited political purchase. If the new outfit enters the electoral fray, that would be at the cost of the efficacy of the reservation movement that Hardik Patel helped build. There is no way he can be both apolitical lobbyist and partisan politician.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/social-movement-to-political-party/article7716225.ece
3,10,2015,Preparing for Paris,"India’s commitment to adopt low-carbon pathways for development is welcome reaffirmation that it fully recognises its >role in averting dangerous climate change. In the statement of climate goals and plans — formally called the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs — which has been submitted to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Narendra Modi government has emphasised the expansion of clean technologies to generate power, greater energy efficiency in infrastructure, and a significant widening of forestry as key measures. There are several other actions that it will take in the areas of transport, buildings, agriculture and waste management in order to balance economic growth with carbon emissions. With all this, India promises to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030, from 2005 levels, while not committing itself to any absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. What is significant is that the national plans given in the INDC, ahead of the Paris Climate Conference in December 2015, depends on the “unencumbered availability of clean technologies and financial resource from around the world”. Such a position is consistent with the principle of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’ that guides climate negotiations. Yet, India cannot avoid addressing the internal contradiction — affluent citizens have access to cheap, abundant energy and mobility while the poor and the vulnerable are forced to fend for themselves — in facing the negative effects of climate change.
On the positive side, since much of India’s infrastructure is yet to be built, the Central and State governments can adopt the greenest technologies to ensure that the long-term impact on emissions is positive. This is particularly important in the design and construction of built structures, including housing and offices, mass transport systems and lighting, to name a few. New coal-based power generation facilities have a prolonged lock-in effect of high emissions, and it is vital to opt for the cleanest systems. Financing such a major effort requires massive funding; the INDC data estimate that between now and 2030, at least $2.5 trillion would be required for the country to meet climate change action requirements. Some of the funding could come from the taxing of fuels. As with the coal cess, there could be a climate tax on transport fuels — this would result in a tax-and-share arrangement where high-volume users would pay a tax to fund common facilities. Another area that needs support is in helping citizens scale up their contribution to renewable energy. Incentivising citizen-investment in roof-top solar installations would unlock private funds and help the country exceed the 100 GW it aims to generate from this source. That will be a world-leading achievement.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/preparing-for-paris/article7716223.ece
5,10,2015,Great expectations in Sri Lanka,"The unanimous adoption of a >resolution by the United Nations Human Rights Council on Sri Lanka last week is notable for the pragmatism that informs it. The idea of an external investigation into the conduct of the military and the political leadership has been bearing down on the island nation for some years now. The erstwhile Rajapaksa administration responded with defiance and belligerent opposition to any move towards accountability, except one that was formulated and executed by the government on its own terms. The moves tended to divide the international community on whether to bail out Sri Lanka or come down on it. In a welcome departure from this trend, countries have come together and adopted, with Sri Lanka’s consent and participation, a resolution that emphasises justice and accountability for excesses committed by both sides, especially in the last phase of the civil war; on a political process to devolve power to the ethnic minorities; and an overall commitment to strengthen governance and democracy and end what many thought was an atmosphere of impunity. The political transformation that this year’s presidential and parliamentary elections ushered in is the main reason for the international community to have come together to aid Sri Lanka in a much-needed process of self-rejuvenation. Its democratic institutions and instruments of governance require a systemic overhaul after having been undermined by the previous regime. This factor has obviously impelled the world to encourage the present Sirisena-Wickremesinghe dispensation by means of a consensus resolution rather than weaken the government’s domestic popularity by imposing an intrusive mechanism.
However, the road ahead will not be smooth. A credible judicial mechanism will have to be evolved and foreign resources such as judges and prosecutors will have to be incorporated with care. An investigation process that inspires the confidence of victims to come forward and depose will have to be put in place. Fixing command responsibility for the bombing of civilians and the execution of those who surrendered, especially on political functionaries and their family members, is not going to be easy and must be marked by due process. The challenge is much bigger than the one relating to finding a political solution. For some, the idea of a judicial mechanism that includes foreign judges to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of war crimes and other offences may seem to fall short of the international inquiry of the sort they favour. To others, it is a rare opportunity to address several issues that defy a solution. A fair conspectus of assumptions underlying the Human Rights Council resolution is that it promotes reconciliation and truth-seeking and may lead to a sense of closure for the victims and a possible guarantee of non-recurrence, and that it opens up yet another opportunity for a political solution. These expectations cannot be belied.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/great-expectations-in-sri-lanka/article7723289.ece
5,10,2015,Gas pricing and some issues,"The government last week announced the >new price of natural gas produced in the country, as part of a periodic revision mandated by the new gas pricing formula that it adopted in October 2014. The formula mandates a price revision once every six months on the basis of the prevailing prices in gas-surplus countries such as the United States, Mexico, Russia and Canada. So >the new price of $3.8 per unit — in effect from October 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016 — is 18 per cent lower than the previous price. This is likely to hurt producers such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Oil India, but will be welcomed by CNG and PNG consumers, not to mention the government, which will now find its fertilizer subsidy an easier pill to swallow. However, despite the perceived benefits of the new gas pricing policy, there are several issues that come along with it. The first is to do with how the formula is constructed. The price in India is pegged on the benchmark prices of the previous year, and takes effect after a time-lag of a quarter. For example, the price applicable in the period April 1-September 30, 2015 was based on the average benchmark prices over January-December 2014. This means India’s gas prices follow the global cues with a time-lag.
Another point to consider is why the government in its wisdom decided to peg the price of Indian gas to these four hubs. Prices in Asia are higher. The Rangarajan Committee took this fact into account and recommended $8.4 per mmBtu, but it was ignored. Then there is the question that was once raised by Arvind Kejriwal, on why gas prices must be linked to the market if the cost of supplying it in India — namely, out of Reliance Industries’ KG-D6 basin — is a fraction of the market rate. There has been much controversy surrounding this, to no adequate conclusion. One of the most important issues to do with the price of domestic gas being pegged to global benchmarks is that any gains could be offset by losses on account of the rupee’s movement. Several research agencies say the almost 6 per cent depreciation of the rupee over April-September 2015 will mean the net impact of the fall in the price of gas will actually be significantly lower. Gas pricing is a politically sensitive issue, it being a key input in important sectors such as fertilizer and power. Much as in the case of oil, the government has been lucky that prices of natural gas are falling globally. But this could well be temporary: if the global price increases, then the price in India will also eventually increase.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/gas-pricing-and-some-issues/article7723290.ece
6,10,2015,Feeding the frenzy,"In India, the cow has taken on communal colours. It would seem that eating beef is no longer the simple exercise of a food choice, but a pre-meditated act intended to offend Hindus and show disrespect to Hinduism. The > lynching of a Muslim, Mohammad Akhlaq, in Dadri last week, followed rumours that he had consumed beef, and an announcement over the loudspeaker in the midst of a kirtan from the local temple that a cow had been killed in the neighbourhood. Therefore, for >Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh to appeal that a “communal colour” should not be added to the incident is deeply intriguing. Not only do the immediate context and the trigger for the murder appear to point toward the violence being ‘communal’ in nature, but also the wider environment in the communally sensitive western Uttar Pradesh in the last couple of years speaks to a situation of communal hatred and religious identity politics. After the > recent controversy over a meat ban effected in some areas during days of the Jain fasting period and Vinayaka Chaturthi, meat consumption moved up as a topic of discussion from dining areas to media platforms. But if the meat ban threatened to divide Hindu society, the beef ban exacerbated the Hindu-Muslim divide as the cow has had the status of a sacred animal within many traditions of Hinduism. Unfounded rumours of a Muslim family consuming beef were enough to instigate a mob.
Banning cow slaughter is a key component of Hindutva politics. True, the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutional validity of legislation in many States against cow slaughter. And, prohibiting the slaughter of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle is part of the Directive Principles of State Policy. But the rationale in the Constitution was economic, relating to the organisation of agriculture and animal husbandry in a predominantly rural economy, and not religious. However, the stridency in the recent demands to ban the slaughter of cattle and the sale of meat, is part of the new muscular Hindutva that allows for no differences or exceptions or reasons other than the invocation of religious sentiments. Indeed, after the Bharatiya Janata Party came to power at the Centre last year, there has been a renewed demand for a central legislation banning cow slaughter. Currently, such legislation is under the State List. Surely, Mr. Rajnath Singh is seeking to divert blame, and not clarify the issue in black and white, when he is asking that the killing of Akhlaq not be given a communal colour. To ignore the social context and the prevailing political atmosphere while situating the killing is to ignore the Hindutva politics of communal hate and religious intolerance. Those who feed the mob frenzy must be made accountable for the mob violence.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/feeding-the-frenzy/article7727178.ece
6,10,2015,Prospect of a clean-up,"For long, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has fairly been perceived as an organisation in which the more things change, the more they remain the same. It is therefore premature to view the >election of Shashank Manohar as its president — in light of his promise to cleanse the Board — as the dawn of a new era. But there is no doubt that the moment contains the potential for the transformation of organised cricket in India. At the start of his second term, Mr. Manohar has certainly said a lot of the right things. >He accepted that the BCCI was facing a crisis of credibility, caused largely by matters relating to conflict of interest and corruption. The announcement that an ombudsman, independent of the BCCI, would be appointed to deal with such complaints is a step in the right direction. Greater transparency, especially in financial matters, was overdue — Mr. Manohar sought to address it by saying that the Board’s constitution, inaccessible to the public thus far, and its balance sheet (and entries of any single item of expenditure over Rs. 25 lakh) would be posted on its website. As significant, in terms of rhetoric, was the acknowledgment of the vital role the Indian cricket fan plays. For a body that does not often display concern for this forgotten stakeholder, it was an interesting statement to make.
But though the message the BCCI strived to convey was overwhelmingly positive, there were signs that not too much should be read into it just as yet. Mr. Manohar’s assertion that “nothing wrong is being done in the Board”, and that it was all “myth” and “perception”, was disappointing. He left himself open to criticism that the BCCI would not proceed beyond cosmetic changes. Although the decision to air more of the Board’s working is welcome, the fact remains that the BCCI is not accountable to outside agencies or the public under the Right to Information Act — a situation that Mr. Manohar said must continue unless the government amends the law. And while the new president has a reputation as a man of personal integrity, it must not be forgotten that it was during his first term in office that the BCCI amended its constitution to allow office-bearers to have a stake in the Indian Premier League — the root of the >conflict of interest issue concerning N. Srinivasan. Critics moreover will interpret Mr. Manohar’s comments on Sunday about the need for unity — particularly his praise for Mr. Srinivasan’s administrative abilities — as an indication that there are no permanent friends or enemies in Board politics, only permanent interests. The BCCI faces several challenges to the old order, not least the recommendations for reform that the Supreme Court-appointed Justice R.M. Lodha committee will put forth. It will be judged not by declarations made at media conferences, but by actions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/prospect-of-a-cleanup/article7727179.ece
7,10,2015,Violence as the new normal,"In directing States to show “zero tolerance” to attempts to “weaken the secular fabric” of the country, the >Union Home Ministry was voicing its concern at the widening social acceptance of communal violence as a normal part of everyday life. The l >ynching in Dadri of Mohammad Akhlaq for “eating beef” was an extreme case, but the circumstances that led to the murder were not dissimilar to those in many other parts of the country following the political mobilisation along communal lines against cattle slaughter. That the Ministry thought it fit to issue the directive despite law and order being a State subject indicates the seriousness of the situation in several States. Many Hindutva activists have projected cow slaughter as a deliberate assault on the religious sensitivities of Hindus by butchers and traders and exporters belonging to other religions. In such a situation, it would not take much effort on the part of extremist elements to portray any meal in a non-Hindu family as a grave provocation. Thus, the advisory issued by the Ministry — warning against the exploitation of religious emotions or sentiments and calling for the “strictest action as per law” against the culprits — demands the urgent attention of State governments. Law enforcers need to act at the very first sign of trouble.
However, the BJP-led government at the Centre should guard against letting this issue descend into a political slugfest with State governments run by other parties. In Uttar Pradesh, especially, the stage seems set for a blame game between the Samajwadi Party and the BJP. In its report to the Centre, the SP government avoided listing any motive for the Dadri attack. To readily grant that the violence was the result of sudden outrage over beef consumption would have been to ignore the systematic, communally charged campaign against cattle slaughter by Hindutva activists. While noting that there were allegations that Akhlaq was killed for consuming the “meat of an animal whose slaughter is banned”, the report said no conclusion had been reached as yet. Evidently, the report stuck to the bare, verifiable facts, in order to prevent Hindutva elements from making political capital out of religious sentiments around the cow. Also, this has left the window open to charge the accused with attempting to instigate large-scale communal violence. The Home Ministry, in issuing the directive, might have wanted to shift the onus to the States to prevent such incidents. But, beyond apportioning blame and shifting responsibility, the Central and State governments ought to realise the potential for trouble from this campaign against beef by communally motivated elements.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/violence-as-the-new-normal/article7731262.ece
7,10,2015,Revolutionary therapies,"The >Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2015 has been awarded to three scientists for the “revolutionary treatments” they developed for devastating diseases that predominantly affect people in the developing countries. The discovery of the drug ivermectin, a derivative of avermectin, by William Campbell of Drew University in Madison, New Jersey, and by Satoshi Ômura of Kitasato University in Tokyo, nearly eradicated river blindness and radically reduced the incidence of lymphatic filariasis. The >discovery of artemisinin by Tu Youyou of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences in Beijing in the early-1970s was a decisive step in the battle against severe cases of malaria. Unlike the quest by the two Laureates for a remedy for roundworm infestation, Dr. Tu’s hunt for a potent anti-malarial drug turned out to be as dramatic as the drug itself. “In keeping with Mao Zedong’s urgings to explore and further improve the great treasure house” of Chinese medicine, she pored through ancient texts for leads. The secret operation, named Project 523 and announced on May 23, 1967, investigated more than 2,000 preparations before an extract from Artemisia annua (sweet wormwood) showed promise. Deftly combining traditional knowledge with modern science, she redesigned the extraction process, and purified the extract to make it both potent and safe. She was involved in isolating the active ingredient, conducting clinical trials and publishing the results. In 1973, she modified artemisinin to generate a powerful drug.
The >miracle drug has prevented millions of malarial deaths. Yet, in 2013 there were 198 million cases of malaria and an estimated 584,000 deaths worldwide, over 90 per cent of them in Africa. As in the case of many other wonder drugs, resistance to artemisinin is fast emerging. As of February 2015, artemisinin resistance has been confirmed in five countries of the Greater Mekong subregion — Cambodia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. What is alarming is that artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum has been found to occur across much of Upper Myanmar “including regions close to the Indian border in the Northwest”. In fact, the zone where resistance to artemisinin exists has come to within 25 km of the Indian border. Since the Myanmar-India boundary was a “path followed by resistance to chloroquine” to spread from South East Asia to the Indian subcontinent, a recurrence in the case of artemisinin-resistant malaria has to be averted at any cost. Already over 40,000 people in India die each year, and according to the World Malaria Report 2011, over 70 per cent of India’s population is at risk of malaria infection. The tasks and the challenges thus remain.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/revolutionary-therapies/article7731263.ece
8,10,2015,Getting down to business,"Chancellor >Angela Merkel’s visit to India and her meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi represented a much-needed dosis realitaet, or “dose of reality”, for both India and Germany. The fact that Ms. Merkel came to India despite a brewing refugee crisis back home that >kept both her Economy Minister and Defence Minister back in Berlin, shows the importance that she accords to the relationship. Mr. Modi, during his third meeting with Ms. Merkel in six months, demonstrated that he sees Germany as an important partner in trade, a provider of technology and means to clean energy, and as a partner on the UN stage. Their meetings in Delhi and Bengaluru were, however, shorn of the kind of pomp, splendour, and joint photo-ops that were the hallmarks of other bilaterals. This was for a reason: both countries seem to have realised it is time to get down to business.
As a result, Ms. Merkel spoke candidly of the problems that German businesses have faced in operating in India, and hoped that the new agreement for a special “fast-track” mechanism would help them secure licences and clearances expeditiously. For his part, Mr. Modi must be lauded for a grounded speech in Bengaluru, telling the Chancellor what India hopes to become, rather than making any bombastic claims on where the Indian economy has reached. “We’re committed to doing everything possible to convert these analyses into reality,” the >Prime Minister said about the recent positive prognoses from the International Monetary Fund and the World Economic Forum about India. He listed 11 initiatives taken in order to achieve the immediate priorities of improving India’s ease-of-doing-business ranking, make a push to take manufacturing to 25 per cent of GDP in order to increase jobs, and for investment. Ms. Merkel’s response has been welcoming of the sentiments, but watchful of delivery before making any big commitments. Even the German announcements of €1 billion towards solar energy and a like sum for >clean energy constitute a fraction of India’s requirements, given the decision to increase renewable energy capacity four-fold to 175 GW, for which India has told the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change it needs $2.5 trillion by 2030. The realism was particularly welcome when it came to the Joint Declaration on Intent on education: both reversed earlier positions on language studies, to ensure that modern Indian languages would be available to German students while Indian students would continue to be able to >opt for German, without giving up Sanskrit. It is to be hoped that the template of the visit is an indicator of the future: of a government transitioning from the euphoria and excitement of its bilateral forays in its first year, getting down to brass tacks in the second.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/getting-down-to-business/article7735240.ece
8,10,2015,Dealing with black money,"The worth of the new, stringent law against Indians stashing away unaccounted money in foreign destinations cannot be judged by the quantum of assets disclosed within the compliance window that ended on September 30. Assets worth Rs. 4,147 crore, yielding tax to the tune of Rs.2,488 crore, >were disclosed within the deadline. If one believes that fabulous sums lie in safe havens abroad, untouched by Indian law, the amount may seem woefully inadequate. On the other hand, if one believes that much of the black money resides comfortably in India, and undisclosed income in foreign countries represent only a small fraction of the total, it may seem a significant disclosure. In any case, the figure falls short of the Rs. 6,500 crore cited by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day address. The stage is now set for the provisions of the >Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015 to be invoked against defaulters who failed to make use of the compliance window. The true test of the efficacy of the enactment will be two-fold: in its ability to deter any further flight of money to offshore destinations in the belief that tax can be evaded that way, and in the rigour with which investigation and prosecution are pursued against those who still hold assets abroad. Any undisclosed foreign income that is detected will henceforth attract tax at the rate of 30 per cent, a penalty of 90 per cent and a 10-year prison term. With new arrangements in place to share tax-related information among many countries, this will surely have some deterrence value.
However, what ought to be of concern to the public is a fact that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has also highlighted: the bulk of the >black money is within India. A confidential report by the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy on the true extent of >India’s parallel economy quantified it in 2013 at 75 per cent of GDP. The black economy is powered mainly by the higher education, real estate and mining sectors. The report had spoken of capitation fees contributing Rs. 5,953 crore to the black money component in a particular year, while real estate transactions could have generated Rs. 5,68,879 crore. In recent times, letting money idle in tax havens, which offer safety and confidentiality but not much by way of interest income, is no more the norm. Assets held abroad find their way back to India as investments in business and participatory notes in the market. The real challenge is in having a regulatory regime that promotes tax compliance and income disclosure. Preventing black money accumulation may be more important than even unearthing it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dealing-with-black-money/article7735241.ece
9,10,2015,Security concerns trump diplomacy,"New Delhi’s decision to highlight the atrocities by Pakistani forces in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) and in Balochistan, as >reported by this newspaper, is a clear departure from past practice. The difference can be gauged by comparing the strong reactions six years ago to the previous Indian government’s acceptance of Balochistan in the Sharm el-Sheikh statement, with how the Ministry of External Affairs now openly accepts in the context of Balochistan that India “is home to persecuted people everywhere”. Meanwhile, a spokesman of the Baloch Liberation Organisation — that faces a barrage of charges in Pakistan — has been speaking freely at public meetings in Delhi. Coming as they do a week after India highlighted suppression of protests and atrocities in PoK, these meetings make it clear that the government is on the “front-foot”, as officials have indicated, and that it intends to use PoK and Balochistan to counter Pakistan’s persistent allegations of human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir. These allegations have been particularly sharp over the last year, perhaps owing to Islamabad’s discomfort over the progress India has made in pushing for a seat in the UN Security Council. It remains to be seen whether New Delhi’s new tack will help tone down Pakistan’s position on J&K. Or will it only serve to highlight international issues that India has preferred to keep in the bilateral space so far, and to flag Pakistan’s outrageous allegations that India is responsible for terrorist acts on its soil? In any case, with this turn of events, India-Pakistan relations, which have remained at a low ebb for decades, are worsening. Diplomacy is the loser.
What is perhaps more significant is that the government’s new policy indicates the growing space ceded to India’s security establishment in the external relations sphere. By engaging in a “spy-vs-spy” and “tit-for-tat” engagement, and seeking to answer Pakistan’s false claims on J&K with a series of counter-allegations, New Delhi has only stooped to the level of the neighbour that it seeks to contain. India’s actions have included the handing out of videos, and leaking of details from dossiers of wanted criminals and terrorists under investigation. More important, it is unclear how its efforts would play out on the international stage. There, Pakistan is already discredited on the issue of sponsoring and training terror groups, while India is seen as a powerful and responsible country waging war against terror. Eventually, diplomacy is a projection of a country’s own values, and must prevail over all other instincts. Former U.S. National Security Adviser Walt Rostow, credited with America’s original push into South East Asia in the 1960s, once said: “We are the greatest power in the world — if we behave like it.” That should hold true for India, too.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/security-concerns-trump-diplomacy/article7739397.ece
9,10,2015,A wake-up call in West Bengal,"Successive electoral victories at various levels in West Bengal seem to have provided a cover for the Trinamool Congress (TMC) to indulge in >brazen displays of violence in the recent civic polls. West Bengal’s ruling party openly defends its unruly cadres who engaged in irregularities. Had the TMC been responsible enough to accept that its sympathisers were responsible for the widespread vote-loot, it would have been reasonably easier for the party to publicly acknowledge that regulating the cadres is impossible once they believe that the customs of their tribe are the laws of nature, to echo George Bernard Shaw. However, as the scholar Gregory Benford theorised, “... stable societies oscillated between banquets and barbarism”, and the TMC’s management decided to let the cadres resort to the latter to ensure the party’s electoral success. Such barbarism in order to win an election, be it to the civic council or the State Assembly, is nothing new in West Bengal. What the Congress had done in the 1970s the Communists replicated in elections in the years that followed, especially when they faced the prospect of losing the mandate. In later years, the TMC used the inimitable phrases, ‘scientific rigging’ and ‘social engineering’, in order to embarrass the Left Front.
The Communists made way for the TMC after three decades in power; but no one would have expected the TMC to amend its predecessor’s formula of ‘social engineering’ to outright barbarism so very quickly. Thrashing senior citizens, targeting journalists and capturing booths, the TMC won conclusively. And its leaders refused to express any regret and blamed the Governor, the Opposition and even the State Election Commission for the mayhem in the Asansol and Biddhannagar municipal areas. In doing this, they seemed to overlook the fact that the electorate had earlier refused to countenance similar arrogance on the part of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). State violence in Nandigram and Singur united the anti-CPI(M) bloc to facilitate the TMC’s victory in the 2011 election. Soon after the first round of violence in Nandigram in March 2007, Kolkata had witnessed protest rallies by civil society activists : it turned out to be a shrill wake-up call for the CPI(M). This week, some journalists came together again to protest against targeted attacks made at them. Many who took part in the rally were close to the ruling party. Meanwhile, the TMC also lost in the Siliguri Municipal Corporation and Mahakuma Parishad. So the wake-up calls are loud and clear in the run-up to the 2016 Assembly elections.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-wakeup-call-in-west-bengal/article7739398.ece
10,10,2015,"Beneath the veneer, partisan parlance","When Prime Minister Narendra Modi chose to >comment on the lynching of a Muslim in Dadri while speaking at an election rally in Bihar more than a week after the crime, he must have been hoping to take advantage of both the time-lapse and the distance. Evidently, he felt no compulsion to dwell on the horrific nature of the murder, its immediate circumstances and context, and the motives of the perpetrators. Instead, he couched the references to the lynching in generalities and homilies, talking of the need for Hindus and Muslims to work together to fight poverty, and of the importance of communal harmony for the nation’s progress. While appealing to the people to ignore “controversial” statements by politicians, he did not refer to the involvement of persons affiliated to his own party in the lynching. Torn out of its context, the violent act was almost reduced to an abstraction, just another instance of the supposedly long-standing communal conflict between Hindus and Muslims. By blaming all Hindus and all Muslims, Mr. Modi in effect blamed none. By refusing to name the politicians who made inflammatory speeches and asking the people to ignore them, he made it appear that this was a general malaise with no cure. That many of his party men were among those who made incendiary speeches on this issue does not appear to have struck Mr. Modi at all. The same day he spoke in Bihar, BJP legislators >beat up independent MLA Engineer Rashid in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly for organising a ‘beef party’. What was jarring when Mr. Modi broke his silence on the lynching was that his words seemed part of some evasive action, and not meant to tackle a serious problem head-on.
But, although he spoke at an election rally, Mr. Modi seemed intent on appearing as being above the political fray. By invoking the speech of President Pranab Mukherjee, who warned the nation against wasting the core values of Indian civilisation, Mr. Modi did sound like the Prime Minister and not as the BJP’s principal campaigner. However, at other rallies in Bihar he did not shy away from using the controversy over beef and cattle slaughter to attack his political rival Lalu Prasad of the Rashtriya Janata Dal for his comment that some Hindus do eat beef. Clearly, Mr. Modi is refusing to make the connection between the Hindutva campaign against cattle slaughter and the Dadri murder. In equating Hindu communalism with Muslim communalism, he appeared oblivious to the dangers of majoritarianism. All communalism is undesirable and reactionary, but the communalism of a majority group holds greater dangers for a democratic polity. As a quote attributed to Thomas Jefferson puts it, there is nothing more unequal than the equal treatment of unequal people.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/beneath-the-veneer-partisan-parlance/article7743760.ece
10,10,2015,Two sides of an ambitious deal,"The >Trans-Pacific Partnership pact reached this week between the United States and 11 Pacific Rim nations including Canada and Japan, has raised both hopes and concerns. The commercial value of the deal, when it is approved, is immense, tying together as it does almost 40 per cent of the world’s GDP. It seeks to eliminate or reduce about 18,000 tariff and non-tariff barriers. Its supporters, including President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, say the pact would boost growth in the U.S. as well as the Asian economies. But it faces opposition inside and outside the U.S. Several members of Mr. Obama’s Democratic Party oppose the deal, saying it would only help American companies send jobs abroad. Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders calls it a “trade disaster”. Critics in other countries say it would benefit large corporations, particularly American big pharma, with the common people at the receiving end. Health advocacy groups say it would reduce access to generic medicines in developing countries; Internet freedom campaigners see it as a big threat.
Mr. Obama has made the TPP the centrepiece of his trade and foreign policies, and seems determined to push it in Congress and persuade other governments to accept it. The strategic potential of the deal is clear. The U.S. started pushing for a Pacific free trade agreement at a time China was emerging as an economic super power in the region. Defending the accord, >Mr. Obama said: “We can’t let countries like China write the rules of the global economy. We should write those rules, opening new markets to American products”. The strategic ambitions of the U.S. are clear. Traditionally, the U.S. has tried to isolate its enemies and integrate allies with its own worldview. With Beijing it couldn’t do either. China is now the world’s second largest economy, which has invested trillions of dollars in U.S. treasury bonds; “isolating” such an economy is next to impossible. Though the U.S. reversed its hostile China policy in 1972 in order to exploit internal rivalries in the communist bloc, China never became a U.S. ally. And the chasm only widened after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Now, with China emerging as an economic powerhouse with new institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in place, the U.S. is trying to form a grand alliance that would shore up its influence in Asia. But will this strategic push be at the expense of its own workers, and the poor in the developing world? If it is, as economists such as Joseph Stiglitz have pointed out, the TPP would hardly meet either its declared commercial goals or its undeclared strategic ambitions, and could turn counterproductive.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/two-sides-of-an-ambitious-deal/article7743761.ece
12,10,2015,End the Sena’s veto power,"What the Shiv Sena could earlier do only with threats of violence, it can now do with a mere letter or an appeal. The organisers of concerts planned in Mumbai and Pune by >Pakistani ghazal singer Ghulam Ali were quick to cancel the programmes after the >Shiv Sena asked them not to host a singer belonging to a “country which is firing bullets at Indians”. A meeting with Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray must have convinced the organisers that the letter of request to cancel the show had the sanction of those at the very top of the Sena leadership, and that the “request” was no less than a threat in disguise. Now that it is in power, the Sena can effectively veto any cultural programme without even organising a public protest. The lesson that the organisers would have taken from the Sena’s missive is that no help would be forthcoming from officialdom in a State where a party that draws support from lumpen elements is in power. From digging up the cricket pitch and forming balidani jathas to stop matches between India and Pakistan, the Sena is known to oppose any kind of cultural or sporting interaction between India and Pakistan. Now that it is in power, the Sena seems intent on its agenda of imposing a boycott on all things Pakistani without resorting to open threats or violence.
The irrationality seems to have struck all but the most ardent of the Sena’s supporters. While Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal spoke to Ghulam Ali and >persuaded him to agree to come to Delhi for a concert in December, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee offered to host him in Kolkata. But the issue is far more important than Ghulam Ali being able to perform in India. This is not on whether art, culture and sport can bring people together or worsen relations between nations. Whether they do one or the other depends on the peoples involved, and not on some intrinsic quality of these forms. The issue actually relates to the unbridled political power that the Sena wields in Maharashtra, a power that is not drawn from any electoral mandate, a power that is not accountable to any democratic institution. The Sena quite arrogantly assumes it can speak for all people when it asks for a show to be cancelled “considering the emotions of the citizens”. If the Sena was so offended by a Pakistani artiste performing in Maharashtra, it could have asked its supporters to stay away from it. The Sena’s senior ally in government, the BJP, and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, need to guard against a repeat of such incidents. What is at stake is not the right of a Pakistani artiste to perform in India, but the right of Indians to decide who they can listen to or watch in India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/end-the-shiv-senas-veto-power/article7750246.ece
12,10,2015,Honouring a robust civil society,"The award of the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize to the National Dialogue Quartet comprising the Tunisian General Labour Union (UGTT), the Tunisian Confederation of Industry, Trade and Handicrafts (UTICA), the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH) and the Tunisian Order of Lawyers, is richly deserved. This quartet of civil society institutions, that came together in 2013, had managed tortuous political negotiations for a consensus-based Constitution and a transition to a robust democracy in Tunisia. The UGTT in particular played a pivotal role, after massive protests erupted in 2013 against the Ennahda-led government. These followed the political assassination of left-wing dissidents and moves by the government to pack the independent bureaucracy with members of the ancien régime. The transition in Tunisia has been unique among the countries that experienced similar change. Tunisia was the site of the first set of popular uprisings in 2011, which came to be known as the Jasmine Revolution and triggered similar protests across the Arab world in what was termed the Arab Spring. Egypt saw the return of a “managed democracy” with a military leader coming to power following a political coup against the popularly elected but increasingly authoritarian Muslim Brotherhood-led government. Libya’s uprising threatened to turn bloody, leading to the intervention of NATO, and following the death of Muammar Qadhafi that country descended into anarchy. Syria’s woes have been well-documented.
Democratisation, as India’s own history shows, is invariably a slow and tortuous process. Its success is predicated by the strength of civil society organisations, the legitimacy of political organisations, and the forbearance and foresight of exceptional individuals who are willing to look beyond the immediate and the expedient. The UGTT has a long history, having been formed in 1946. Its members constitute five per cent of the country’s population. Its clout as an economic bargaining entity, its widespread presence in Tunisia and its leaders’ extensive experience in the art of negotiations, helped bring political parties to agree to a new political road map in 2013. This led to the creation of a largely progressive Constitution in January 2014 and to parliamentary elections in October 2014. Legitimacy was accorded to the UGTT’s negotiating role by the other members of the Quartet, which have also had a historical presence. The lesson from the story of Tunisia’s unique success in the post-Arab Spring set of events in the Arab world is that a robust civil society with organised labour power as a pivot has an important role to play in any process of democratisation. Neither external intervention nor sporadic outbursts of street protests would do for that. The Nobel Committee must be commended for recognising this fact.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/nobel-peace-prize-2015-awarded-to-national-dialogue-quartettunisia/article7750248.ece
13,10,2015,Anger beyond words,"Over the past week, a growing number of writers have returned literary honours that had been awarded to them in recognition of their work — and in doing so reminded the state of its failure to protect the last man standing. What started with >writer Nayantara Sahgal returning the Sahitya Akademi award she won in 1986, led to a >wave of protests. The others also chose to give up their precious Sahitya Akademi awards, given by writers to writers. Their protest is against an impassive state that remains a >silent spectator, effectively complicit in the act of writers and rationalists being hunted down, and a Muslim man being lynched by his own neighbours for allegedly storing beef in his home. Their rejection of the honour is a symbolic reminder of the times, as a wave of intolerance cascades from >Dadri even to the most cosmopolitan of Indian cities, Mumbai, threatening to choke the air. What the writers have reminded India is what its people are today witness to: a society turning upon itself. And in asking the state to act now, the writers are telling India of the need to preserve and hold on to its pluralistic fabric. The letters serve as reminders of the fragile times we live in, when mere rumours can rob a man of his right to life. A writer speaks out when his or her conscience is numbed beyond pain. For many of them, the lynching of the Muslim man was the last straw. After all, since Partition this is probably the first time that rumours of a man killing a cow have cost him his life, in his own neighbourhood. Their protest is also against several non-state actors that owe allegiance to the Bharatiya Janata Party government and that call the shots in towns and villages far from the public gaze in general.
It is in this climate of intolerance and complicity by the state that the letters of protest have found their way to the Akademi and to the public realm. The Akademi is an autonomous body but has refrained from speaking out. Its silence is the silence of the state. Even the once-formidable media adviser to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has had ink thrown on his face for taking a stand on former Pakistan Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri’s book launch event, which was opposed vehemently by the BJP’s ally, >the Shiv Sena. The Shiv Sena is known for acts of that kind, but they don’t behove a city such as Mumbai that prides itself on being India’s most cosmopolitan city. As for Prime Minister Narendra Modi who leads the BJP, a party that has premised itself on extending its hand to the common man, words have to match deeds.

13,10,2015,The path to economic recovery,"A dividend payment of Rs. 66,000-crore from the Reserve Bank of India, the highest in its 80-year history, helped tip India’s fiscal balance to surplus in August. A combination of the pick-up in the Centre’s revenue receipts and its declining expenditures, especially on subsidies, helped keep the fiscal deficit during the first five months of the current financial year under Rs. 3.7 lakh crore, lower than the Rs. 3.97 lakh crore during the corresponding period last year. The Central government’s unfailing commitment to fiscal consolidation is conducive to macroeconomic stability. But sticking to the road map for fiscal consolidation isn’t easy: expenditure and tax reforms can be tricky politically. In its budget for this year, the Narendra Modi government had shifted India’s fiscal consolidation road map by raising the fiscal deficit target for the year to 3.9 per cent from 3.6 per cent earlier. By doing so it created fiscal room for Rs. 70,000 crore of public investments, which it hopes would kick-start the jobs-generating infrastructure sector. Earlier governments too postponed targets. The fiscal deficit reduction targets that were originally a part of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Bill, 2000 were eliminated from the Act that Parliament passed in 2003; the annual numerical targets were left to the government to formulate in the FRBM Rules. Since then, the road map has been halted four times — in 2005-06, 2008-09, 2012-13 and 2015-16. And so the resolve that the Union Finance Secretary expressed at a media conference last week — that though the government expects a shortfall in tax revenues this year it won’t deviate from the 3.9 per cent fiscal deficit target — is welcome.
With inflation now under 4 per cent, interest rate cuts adding up to 125 basis points in the past 12 months, and the Centre and the States going all out to revive stalled projects and improve the ease of doing business, India remains well-poised on the path to economic recovery. Fiscal credibility, important as it is to macroeconomic management, will make it possible to sustain India’s current growth rate and to convert potential into actual growth. The focus will be on the budget-makers’ tricks of funding subsidies through non-transparent, off-budget borrowings or higher taxes on fuel and so on. The Finance Minister has undertaken to clean up the clutter of tax incentives for the corporate sector to plug revenue leakages, in order to set the stage for lower tax rates. He is bound to find the business lobbies less enthusiastic about giving up sops, and must resist pleas for their retention.

14,10,2015,Tarred by its own brush,"With its attention-grabbing antics and intimidating tactics laced with violence, the Shiv Sena is turning out to be a huge embarrassment for not only the BJP, its senior partner in government at the Centre and in Maharashtra, but also for Indian diplomacy. The >black-paint attack in Mumbai by its activists on >Sudheendra Kulkarni for organising the launch of a book written by former Pakistan Foreign Minister Khurshid >Mahmud Kasuri might have been intended as a challenge to the BJP in Maharashtra, but it also poses difficulties for India in dealing with Pakistan, and in seeking the support of other nations against Pakistan. To many in Pakistan, the Indian political class as a whole must have appeared as a mirror image of their own politicians and jihadists, spewing venom and instigating violence. Not surprisingly, >the attack drew criticism from several quarters, including former Indian diplomats who would have known what damage such incidents can do to bilateral relations. The Sena came through no better than those very forces in Pakistan it was seeking to condemn. If it thought that blackening the face of Mr. Kulkarni would appeal to sections beyond its core constituency, the Sena was badly mistaken. The attack was evidently meant to break the spirit of Mr. Kulkarni, but it only hardened his resolve: refusing to be intimidated, he faced the media with the paint still on his face, showing up the Sena for its petty-mindedness and cowardliness. Even those who might have sympathised with the >Sena’s larger intention would have seen how counter-productive its actions turned out to be.
Evidently, the Sena was trying to retrieve lost ground in Maharashtra, and not to make things difficult for Indian diplomats engaging with Pakistan. The Sena, after having been the senior partner in its alliance with the BJP, is now reduced to the status of a junior partner in the Devendra Fadnavis government. As a party that had realised the limitations of Marathi chauvinism as a political tool, the Sena embraced Hindutva, hoping to use the BJP as no more than an electoral prop. But it was the BJP that grew at the Sena’s expense, leading to the break-up of the alliance last year, and the BJP winning nearly twice as many seats as the Sena in the Assembly election. Not surprisingly, the attack on Mr. Kulkarni saw some sharp comments by Chief Minister Fadnavis, who chided the Sena for bringing disrepute to Maharashtra. The Sena responded by announcing that it would contest the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation election without an alliance with the BJP. Thus, besides causing a serious erosion of India’s moral authority in dealing with Pakistan, it could unsettle again the BJP’s relations with the Sena. Mr. Kulkarni washed away the paint, but the attack on him might have tarred the Sena for a long time to come.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/shiv-sena-an-embarrassment-for-indian-diplomacy/article7758006.ece
14,10,2015,A Prime Minister in a new setting,"Khadga Prasad Oli of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) has been elected >Nepal’s 38th Prime Minister by legislators in the Constituent Assembly. What has made the occasion momentous is the fact that he is the first Prime Minister of the republic of Nepal after an elected CA had adopted a popular Constitution. Considering that Mr. Oli was seen as a leader from among those who were less than exuberant about the peace-building and state restructuring processes that guided Nepal’s transition from monarchy to republic, it is remarkable that he is at the helm now. This has come at a time when the country has finally managed to complete the long-drawn Constitution-writing process — notwithstanding some critical flaws that remain in it. These flaws are what have impelled the plains-dwellers, the Madhesis, to agitate to seek amendments that would ensure a fair deal to them in terms of federal restructuring and constituency demarcation, among other issues. The Indian establishment’s support to this demand had drawn a predictable nationalist response from political parties that have their leadership dominated by those from the hills. This reaction also in a way propelled >the victory of Mr. Oli, who sought to use this “nationalist” impulse to spur his candidacy. Nothing else explains the Nepali Maoists, the former royalists and the UML having got together to elect Mr. Oli, pipping Sushil Koirala of the Nepali Congress to the post. Many in Nepal’s political class have often swung towards “anti-India nationalism” to whip up support for themselves, even as they relied on India to advance their own interests at expedient moments.
India’s response to the recent protests in the Terai region might be a consequence of its discomfort with the instability spilling over into Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, but the not-so-subtle economic coercion being used on the border could definitely have been avoided. Any such action in the nature of what Kathmandu terms an economic blockade will only end up stoking ultra-nationalist impulses. Such an outcome will not help the domestic processes that would otherwise normally play themselves out. To India’s credit, >Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated his counterpart for his election, while expressing the hope that Mr. Oli would “carry all sections of society along, so that there is peace and stability”. This is a subtle and well-thought-out message to the Nepal government to work towards addressing the disaffection in the Terai. In sending such a message, Mr. Modi avoided any possibility of it being misinterpreted as interference in Nepal’s domestic affairs. Mr. Oli indeed has his task cut out.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/khadga-prasad-oli-a-prime-minister-in-a-new-setting/article7758007.ece
15,10,2015,The importance of Article 370,"Article 370 of the Constitution is the current bedrock of the constitutional relationship between Jammu and Kashmir and the rest of India. With its abrogation being an avowed policy of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the J&K High Court’s recent observation that the provision has acquired a state of permanence may cause some disquiet in the party and the government. However, >the High Court’s comment should be seen in the limited context in which it was made. Its remark that Article 370 is beyond amendment, repeal or abrogation flows from an analysis of the question whether the section had become inoperative after the State’s Constituent Assembly framed its Constitution, and then the Assembly itself ceased to exist. In fact, the question whether its temporary provisions had acquired permanence was not before the court; nor was the court hearing a challenge to the validity of the Article per se. It was dealing with the validity of reservation in promotions among government employees in J&K. Ultimately, it struck down the provision for quotas in promotions on the ground that clause 4A of Article 16, introduced by the Constitution (77th) Amendment to protect reservation in promotions, was not applicable to J&K. This is because there is no Presidential Order making the new clause applicable to the State. One of the features of Article 370 is that a Constitution amendment becomes applicable to J&K only after the President issues an order. Without the protection of the clause, there is no scope for reservation in promotions, as the Supreme Court had barred such quotas in Indra Sawhney.
In its implications for Article 370, the High Court verdict has not broken any new ground. If anything, it is a reiteration of earlier Supreme Court rulings that Article 370 continues to be operative. It impliedly rules that the President’s power to issue orders, as has been done over the years making several laws and provisions of the Constitution applicable to J&K, remains untrammelled. By reiterating the core requirement that even provisions affording constitutional protection require the use of Article 370 and orders issued under its imprimatur, the court has reaffirmed that importance of the Article and showed how abrogating it will weaken the legal basis for J&K to be part of India, as the accession was linked to its getting special status. Some may find the observation that Article 370 is beyond repeal or abrogation debatable. Parliament’s amending power under Article 368 remains available for such a measure, but it is far wiser for any dispensation to wait for a resolution of the dispute with Pakistan over the entirety of Kashmir’s territory before revisiting the State’s constitutional status. Any premature action on this front may be a needless misadventure.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-importance-of-article-370/article7762192.ece
15,10,2015,Fresh challenges in the northeast,"It is time the government paid the right kind of attention to the northeastern region, that stunning and strategic locale that ‘mainland India’ often does not understand, and routinely tends to ignore. It has been more than two months since the >Narendra Modi government euphorically announced a peace accord with the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), the largest among the armed outfits involved in the long-drawn Naga insurgency. What has transpired since the announcement on August 3 leaves very little room for optimism. Now, instead of working towards peace, the NSCN(I-M) is reported to be recruiting cadres, and possibly setting up camps, in the Manipur hills. Meanwhile, >Manipur continues to be tense over tribal protests against the State government’s hasty passing of three key bills without proper discussion. It has been accused of being insensitive to relations among the settlers in the valley, the hill tribes and the migrants. Agitations over the last few weeks have claimed many lives. Reported instances of smuggling of arms and drugs and extortion in Manipur have gone up. Given the complex and >bloodied history of the region, recent developments provide stark warnings of the possibility of even more anarchy.
New Delhi needs to deal with the region with a broader political response than through a few intelligence officers. Securitising the entire challenge is not the way to go. >To take forward the peace accord with the NSCN(I-M) and to find a meaningful and lasting solution, the government should first acknowledge that what was signed on August 3 was only a basic framework for a possible accord, and broaden the efforts. The government should reach out to the opposition parties, regional outfits and civil society movements to form a national secretariat in mission mode in order to tackle the region’s many challenges. With the empowered secretariat in place, the government should get down to dealing with the nagging insurgencies of the region and the grievances of its many tribes and residents. Convincing all the insurgent groups, and not just splinter Naga rebels, in an inclusive manner to come to the table for > peace talks, dealing with their demands with a non-condescending approach, and disarming them would all help the region find peace. The security forces should be empowered, though with due judicial accountability, to put down the industry of extortion and smuggling networks. The region’s significance in security terms cannot be overstated, given its historic geo-strategic role.

16,10,2015,Take the cue from the President,"In those moments when questions emerge about the fragility of the state’s constitutional principles — over what has transpired since the >Dadri lynching and the killing of Kannada scholar M.M. Kalburgi, for example — it is incumbent on high constitutional functionaries to rise to the occasion and seek to answer them. These incidents have triggered a response from India’s intellectuals who have earned recognition, with a string of litterateurs returning their >Sahitya Akademi awards , concerned about the silence of the august body over rising intolerance. Right-wing chauvinists have seemingly become more emboldened, with even former fellow-travellers of the BJP such as Sudheendra Kulkarni being targeted for initiatives related to bettering India-Pakistan ties. It is in this context that President Pranab Mukherjee’s statement a week ago at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where he underlined the need to retain diversity, plurality and tolerance as the core values of our civilisation, came as a balm. The President later re-stated those sentiments on foreign soil – in Israel, speaking to politicians in the Jewish state, suggesting that “religion should not be a basis for a state”. While the remarks were more apposite to the Israeli context, these could be seen as a reiteration of how India should not go the Israeli or Pakistani way. The words by the President, who occupies a ceremonial role, are in contrast to the reticence shown by the Prime Minister in reassuring citizens about his government’s seriousness in tackling communal hatred.
The Prime Minister could do that in several ways. He could reprimand >Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma who has come up with several controversial statements recently. He could acknowledge that communalism — especially of the majoritarian kind that seems to have received a fillip since the present government came to power — would not be tolerated. He could reiterate the commitment of his government, which was elected on the promise of development, to stem the rising tide of intolerance, and reassure those returning their Akademi awards of his government’s commitment to secularism and law and order. Instead, we have heard Narendra Modi merely expressing sadness about the Dadri lynching, and using the clichéd argument of law and order being a State subject, trying to avoid the onus. Mr. Modi’s colleague, Nirmala Seetharaman, tasked with giving a response, also came up with a faulty argument, suggesting that there is something to be debated about communalism. Secularism is a bedrock of India’s Constitution, and what needs to be debated is the means to achieve the separation of religion and the state. The sense is that the ruling party wants to disregard this and bring the very question of secularism under debate. This is clearly untenable, and it is to be hoped that Mr. Modi would live up to his constitutional role. The President has shown the way.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/take-the-cue-from-the-president/article7766516.ece
16,10,2015,Lessons from an agitation,"The end of the 17-day strike by nearly three lakh plantation workers in Kerala, following a wage settlement before a tripartite committee, should come as welcome relief to the ailing sector. It took six rounds of negotiations at meetings of the Plantation Labour Committee, comprising representatives of managements, trade unions and the government, to do that. Under the settlement, the daily wages of workers in tea, coffee, cardamom and rubber plantations will go up by a fair measure. The agitation drew much political attention as it followed a successful strike by women workers at Kanan Devan Hills Plantations Ltd in Munnar last month. Keeping out the mainstream trade unions, the women organised themselves independently to extract a 20 per cent bonus offer from the management, comprising 8.33 per cent statutory bonus and 11.67 per cent ex gratia payment. It was obvious that the women’s initiative gave the required impetus to a wider agitation across the State, and fuelled fears of fraternal strikes in other plantations in the country. The State government, which knew that the workers’ demand for higher wages for livelihood was justified, was caught in a dilemma as it was equally aware of the crisis gripping the sector owing to falling commodity prices and allied ills. It is possible that the authorities got the managements to arrive at a wage settlement by offering concessions in the form of lower plantation tax and agricultural income tax, besides subsidised electricity supply.
There is little doubt that the conditions of workers in the plantation sector leave much to be desired. Many of them live on-site in one-room line houses, and the scope for quality education for their children is limited. The government’s plans to upgrade housing and provide more schools in the plantation areas are welcome, but it requires sustained effort to bring about a significant change in the workers’ lot. The plantation managements have their stories of woe too. They say rising production and labour costs have made their produce uncompetitive in both domestic and overseas markets. Contending that the average price of each kilogram of tea, rubber or cardamom is less than the cost of production, planters have sought to link wage increases with a corresponding enhancement in labour productivity. It is in the fitness of things that the government has also decided to appoint a one-man commission to go into the gamut of issues in the sector. The bottom line is that while the entire sector needs to improve its competitiveness and productivity, it is equally important that the plantations remain responsible employers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-strike-by-plantation-workers-lessons-from-an-agitation/article7766517.ece
17,10,2015,An assertion of primacy,"It is extraordinary that there should be near-unanimity in the country that the present system of judicial appointments that was put in place in 1993 is deeply unsatisfactory, and yet the most significant legislative effort to reform it should fail before the Supreme Court. It is no surprise that a five-judge Bench has struck down the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, 2014, by which the government established a >National Judicial Appointments Commission to select members of the higher judiciary. There were doubts whether the composition of the NJAC, especially the inclusion in it of the Union Law Minister and two “eminent persons” appointed by the government, would survive judicial scrutiny. For, the law also gave any two members a veto over all decisions, raising the question whether the judicial members could be overruled by the executive representatives. The Attorney General could not convince the court that the amendment, along with the >NJAC Act, was aimed at restoring the system of checks and balances which, according to the government, was lost after the Supreme Court created the collegium scheme of appointments. The core question was whether the new institutional mechanism to appoint judges impinged on the independence of the judiciary, a basic feature of the Constitution. The court has ruled that it does. Justice J.S. Khehar, writing the main judgment, has held that the clauses provided in the amendment are inadequate to preserve the primacy of the judiciary. The inclusion of the Law Minister in the body impinged on both the independence of the judiciary and the doctrine of separation of powers.
Nobody on either side of the debate disagrees that the judiciary should be insulated from political interference. Yet, should the judiciary retain its primacy, or should the executive have a say in order that flawed choices do not erode the institution’s credibility? Justice Khehar has said the conduct of the political executive showed it tended to reward favourites in many fields. Preserving the primacy of the judiciary was a safe way to shield the institution from “the regime of the spoils system”. Justice J. Chelameswar, in his dissenting opinion, is candid in questioning the lack of transparency in the collegium system. Even while restoring this system, the majority has invited suggestions to improve it so that it is more responsive to the expectations of civil society. While to some it may appear that striking down a Constitution amendment passed unanimously in both Houses of Parliament and ratified by 20 State Assemblies amounts to negating the people’s will, it cannot be forgotten that the judiciary remains the sole authority to decide whether a law violates the basic structure of the Constitution. What the situation indicates is that India is still struggling to put together a transparent appointment system not vitiated by executive patronage or judicial nepotism.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/supreme-court-bench-order-on-national-judicial-appointments-commission-act-an-assertion-of-primacy/article7770892.ece
17,10,2015,For a slice of history,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to > declassify documents in the government’s possession relating to Subhas Chandra Bose on January 23, 2016, the date of his birth anniversary, and also send a request to Russia and other countries to share any documents in their custody, is a welcome step. Mr. Modi has assured Netaji’s family members that opening the files to scrutiny would help lift the veil of secrecy surrounding his life and death. It should end a long wait for the family, as also students and scholars of history for whom Bose remains an enigma. Part of the credit for the momentum on this front should go to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who last month released Bose-related Cabinet papers from 1938 to 1947: what the CPI(M) government in the State could not or did not do even at the height of its power. While it is hoped that the decision to make the files public would help lay to rest the many conspiracy theories that have swirled around Bose since his disappearance following a 1945 plane crash, there is no telling whether this would indeed prove to be the last word on the issue. Part of the mystique and the urban folklore surrounding Bose have to do with the actions of governments past that held him hostage to history by keeping under wraps crucial bits of correspondence and files. The reasons cited were vague, and typically referred to threats to India’s integrity and unity and potential impact on external relations. Three judicial commissions went into the disappearance. Their findings not being accepted by the government only deepened the mystery.
It is also about time India joined other countries that have a stated policy of declassifying official documents after a stipulated time period. Thus, this opening up should be the norm, and it should not be confined to Bose. And this set of documents should be made accessible not only to scholars and students of history but all those who are interested in learning about the country’s past. Bose belongs to history, and the present generation must engage with his actions fully. In this age of assured transparency, Mr. Modi’s step, and especially his observation that “nations that forget history are bound to lose the power to create it”, must go beyond mere words. Whether the BJP will get any dividend out of this decision on a hero whose name evokes strong passions in West Bengal — set to go to the polls in 2016 — only time will tell. As the party under Mr. Modi looks towards more States to conquer, it is hard to miss the timing and the nature of the overture.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/declassification-of-netaji-subhas-chandra-bose-documents-for-a-slice-of-history/article7770893.ece
19,10,2015,A needless encore,"The instinctive resort to moral or cultural policing can make any administration blind to its own folly. The ill-advised move of the Maharashtra government to > re-introduce legislation to ban dance bars in Mumbai even after an earlier provision was > struck down by the judiciary, has now been stayed by the Supreme Court. Hanging on to the legacy of former Home Minister R.R. Patil, who took it upon himself to preserve the dignity of women dancing in hotels and restaurants in Mumbai to make a living by banning the activity, the Devendra Fadnavis government also now plans to fight for continuing the ban. The court has rightly advised the government to regulate the dance bars, a source of livelihood for tens of thousands of families, to guard against obscenity and exploitation — instead of prohibiting them. It has been a decade since dance performances in restaurants, bars and hotels below the three-star category were > banned by an amendment to the Mumbai Police Act. Even though the Bombay High Court invalidated the provision in 2006, and the Supreme Court confirmed that verdict in 2013, these dance bars were not reopened. It is believed that the ban affected 75,000 families, and that thousands of women lost their source of livelihood and took up sex work as an alternative. No fresh licences were issued even after the Supreme Court ruled that the ban was illegal as it discriminated against lower sections of society under the impression that such performances in star hotels were acceptable entertainment or amusement but led to depravity and corruption when they took place in other establishments.
While enacting a fresh provision to get around the court verdict, the State government failed to see that such a measure can be valid only when it removes the basis for the judgment, and not when it seeks to bring back the same clause. The amendment was largely similar to the invalidated section. The amendment, now stayed, may not survive judicial scrutiny as it suffers from the same illegality the Supreme Court had earlier pointed out: that it violated the right of the women to engage in a profession of their choice, and that it was not a reasonable restriction introduced in the interest of the public. Not many will agree with the government’s view that prohibiting dance bars is necessary to prevent the exploitation of the women; or that allowing them to function will encourage prostitution and lead to other crimes. There are other forms of exploitation of women and socio-economic reasons for crime and sex work to thrive. Merely closing down dance bars, thereby robbing vulnerable sections of society of their means of livelihood, is not the answer.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-needless-encore/article7777558.ece
19,10,2015,New chapter with Nepal,"By inviting Nepal’s Deputy Prime Minister Kamal Thapa to New Delhi, India has chosen wisely to begin a fresh chapter with its neighbour with a view to ending the mistrust that has marked the relationship in the past two months. By all accounts, the talks between Mr. Thapa and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, who is known for her diplomatic abilities in the neighbourhood, took off on the right note. Two short-term objectives — of ending the pile-up of trucks at the border in Bihar that Nepal terms an > unofficial blockade, and of bringing the new Prime Minister, K.P. Sharma Oli, to Delhi for talks — could soon be reached. In the longer term, the task for the government is to help Nepal build on its Constitution to assuage the anger of the people of the Terai, without India further antagonising the people of the hills. This is a balance the government seems not to have achieved in the past few months; it has come across instead as a bully to one side of the Nepali divide and a champion to the other. If India must have a role in the constitutional conflict, it must be that of uniting the political spectrum and encouraging talks — a role it has traditionally had since 1951. The >visit by Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar in the last minute to try and convince the Nepal leadership to postpone the promulgation of the Constitution, and conversations in New Delhi that seemed to favour Sushil Koirala over Mr. Oli as the new Prime Minister, didn’t help the situation. It was sad to see crowds in Kathmandu that only last year filled the roads to greet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, now burning effigies and the tricolor. While such anger was unjustified, as India’s wish has only been to push for a more inclusive foundational document for Nepal, it is necessary to undo the perception that New Delhi is interfering in the neighbour’s internal processes, and worse, ‘punishing’ Nepal for not acceding to its wishes.
In the past week, however, in both New Delhi and Kathmandu the tone has changed. > In an interview to this newspaper, Prime Minister Oli reached out with Vijaya Dasami wishes and a message of reconciliation, while officials in Delhi noted with satisfaction that the new government has a “willingness to address” the issue of the neglect of Madhesi groups. Above all, it is time to turn attention to the struggles of the ordinary citizen of Nepal, a country that has been battered by an > earthquake and ruptured by internal divisions and > brutal clashes. It is suffering without electricity, food and essential medicines. A small start at rebuilding trust may be achieved by moving swiftly on the 41-km-long > Raxaul-Amlekhgunj oil pipeline .

20,10,2015,All over a tattoo,"What is this Indian culture that feels threatened and slighted by a visiting >Australian man sporting a tattoo of a Hindu goddess? What is this Indian culture that is so intolerant of people from other faiths, especially Muslims and Christians, who do not worship the same gods and who do not have similar food habits and tastes? And who exactly are the self-styled proponents, upholders and protectors of Indian culture? The Australian’s >shocking account , >reported by this newspaper , described how a bunch of people in Bengaluru threatened him with dire consequences when they spotted on his shin the tattoo of goddess Yellamma — who is worshipped in parts of southern India, and who as the Mahabharata says was slain by her son on her husband’s orders for merely looking at the pleasing reflection in a river of a celestial flying overhead. A policeman, instead of protecting the young man from the group, corralled him to a police station and got him to write out an apology. That this happened in a modern Indian city in this age and time should worry everyone. Increasingly, cities are falling prey to vigilante groups whose views often represent everything that is reprehensible to real Indian culture. Couples are >yanked out of the privacy of their rooms by cops who hold the view that their being together is against the culture. Women are directed, by none other than an elected Chief Minister of a State that boasts the worst sex ratio in the country, to shed their clothes if they desire freedom. Such bizarre views and outcomes appear out of sync with the dominant political discourse of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, which repeats the development mantra while many among its cadres go about preaching the message of cultural exclusion.
In this sort of toxic air where a band of puritanical elements threaten to stamp out everything that goes against their own understanding of Indian culture, voices of sanity have to make themselves heard loud and clear. The ruling political class, if it seeks development, has to talk to its people on the values of Hinduism as opposed to the backward-looking forces to which it extends tacit support. Indian culture must accommodate the view that gods and goddesses have their own particular traits. Let them not be imprisoned behind concrete vaults and confined to rituals. Hinduism has thrived over the centuries because of its larger-than-life philosophy of accommodation and tolerance. Let not Indian culture be shackled — unless this country wishes to go down the path of Saudi Arabia where women have hardly any rights; unless it wishes to take the road travelled by the IS or the Taliban; and unless it wishes to shut off all discourse.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/all-over-a-tattoo/article7781044.ece
20,10,2015,A whiff of reform,"In its first >working committee meeting since Shashank Manohar’s >election as president , the Board of Control for Cricket in India offered an indication of how seriously it >views the >conflict of interest issue. It was during Mr. Manohar’s first term that the BCCI’s constitution was amended to allow office-bearers a stake in the Indian Premier League – a lot of the problems that have dented the Board’s image can be traced back to that moment. At the start of his second term, Mr. Manohar had spoken of the need to address >this crisis of credibility . The three-page document recommending stringent measures, circulated ahead of the working committee meeting, might not have raised as much public interest as news of the future of Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals. But its implications have greater significance. Mr. Manohar’s proposals seek to ensure that positions of power are not exploited. If the proposals are accepted at the annual general meeting in November, the way the Board operates could change at a fundamental level. Administrators or near-relatives, for instance, will not be allowed to have commercial interests in activities or tournaments, including the IPL. Selectors and coaches will not be associated with player management companies or player agents. Current cricketers cannot have business interests in player management agencies.
While there was never any doubt that the BCCI would discuss the issue at Sunday’s meeting, the firmness of intent surprised a few, not least some within the Board. Along anticipated lines, however, was the >decision to invite bids for two new teams to replace CSK and RR, suspended for two years as recommended by the Justice R.M. Lodha Committee tasked with investigating corruption in the IPL. Few expected the BCCI to take further action and terminate the franchise agreement: it was certainly more convenient for the Board to say it had done everything that was asked of it by the Lodha Committee than begin proceedings certain to turn complicated and costly. But strangely, the matter of CSK’s valuation at just Rs. 5 lakh when the franchise was demerged from India Cements Ltd. was not discussed. For, Mr. Manohar, then representing the Vidarbha Cricket Association, had raised questions about it at a meeting in April. There were other signs, however, that the BCCI was pressing ahead with reform. The proposed addition of independent members to the IPL’s governing council, and the appointment of an independent agency to examine the State associations’ utilisation of Board funds, to cite two, are moves in the right direction. The BCCI faces challenges, many from within, in its advertised quest to change; the increased public and judicial scrutiny means that it will be held to higher standards than in the past.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-whiff-of-reform/article7781045.ece
21,10,2015,Beyond the blackening,"Symbolic acts without immediate tangible consequences can sometimes hold long-term implications when appropriated as a signifier in a political struggle. By itself, >the ink-and-oil attack on Engineer Rashid , an independent member of the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, might appear to be little more than a copy-cat act by the Hindu Sena following last week’s >paint attack by the Shiv Sena in Mumbai on Sudheendra Kulkarni. Both were meant to appeal to the core Hindutva constituency that remains deeply suspicious of both India’s Muslims and Pakistan. For the Shiv Sena, it was an attempt to regain some of its hardline supporters who had moved over to its ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party. For the lesser-known Hindu Sena, this was its moment in the sun. However, in the context of the >unrest in J&K over the >ban on beef , and a >‘beef party’ organised by Mr. Rashid, the attack will doubtless be seen as an act of grave provocation in the Kashmir Valley. After the Jammu and Kashmir High Court upheld the validity of an old, hardly implemented law banning cattle slaughter, and protests broke out across Kashmir, Mr. Rashid, no doubt to provoke the Hindutva elements and make political capital, organised a ‘beef party’ to draw attention to the opposition to the ban in Muslim-majority Kashmir. The Hindu Sena seems to have obliged Mr. Rashid by feeding into the discontent in Kashmir over the issue. The result is the front-staging of the sense of political alienation among Kashmiris.
The J&K High Court, whose decision to uphold the beef ban law first led to pro-beef protests, did well to later refer the decision back to the executive; the issue is not one of any infirmity in the legislation, but of its need and practicality. What Mr. Rashid sought to achieve by hosting the ‘beef party’ was only helped along by the Hindu Sena when it threw ink at him. To treat this attack as another instance of the lunatic fringe makes no sense as it was the BJP that first targeted the independent MLA. Indeed, the attack must have seemed a minor irritant for Mr. Rashid, who had earlier been beaten up by BJP members in the State Assembly. Neither the Sena nor the BJP in J&K would qualify as the fringe; and without the acceptance of such violence by sections of the ruling establishment, many of the fringe groups would not have mustered the courage to carry out these brazen attacks. Clearly, Hindutva elements have a vested interest in fomenting unrest in the Kashmir Valley. In this, they are a mirror image of the jihadists in Pakistan, unsettling relations between India and Pakistan at every available opportunity. Unless such elements are put down with a heavy hand, the consequences would be far greater than ink and oil on someone’s face.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/beyond-the-blackening/article7785256.ece
21,10,2015,Resume the engagement,"The >latest escalation of >violence in East Jerusalem and parts of the West Bank has led to the question whether a third intifada is on the way. Over the past month, more than 30 Palestinians and at least eight Israelis have been killed. While the eruption of violence between Israelis and Palestinians is in itself not new, its pattern, and the increasing support among Palestinians for armed resistance against Israeli occupation, build into a familiar cycle. During the previous intifada rounds, the Palestinian leadership and security troops supported the uprising. But this time, President Mahmoud Abbas has been repeatedly calling for calm while young Palestinians carry out lone-wolf knife attacks and shootings. The underlying message of such attacks is triggering more violence in the occupied territories. Israel’s response has expectedly been lethal. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says there won’t be any peace talks until “terror is stopped”. He has deployed troops in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Meanwhile, the Israeli right is urging citizens, particularly the settlers in the West Bank, to carry weapons. These responses appear to be triggering even more violence.
While it is clear that violence will hardly help Palestinians take their cause of statehood forward, most of the youth taking up weapons are frustrated by the deteriorating situation in the occupied territories. There are no peace negotiations currently on. Israel has established checkpoints throughout the West Bank, severely hindering the movement of Palestinians across towns even in areas that are technically controlled by the Palestine National Authority. Jewish settlements in the West Bank are only expanding. The blockade of Gaza is continuing, practically isolating the strip. President Abbas’s bid to get UN recognition for the Palestine state has failed. In fact, as Mr. Abbas remains in office six years after his term expired, his inability to take the statehood cause forward has made him unpopular among Palestinians. It is against this background that the latest wave of violence broke. Anyone following the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would understand that a single spark could trigger a conflagration. The latest cycle of violence, given its context, could well be one such turning point. Both sides, aided by the international community, should act immediately to prevent any further escalation. The best way to do so is to re-engage in serious negotiations to find a way forward. Talks should be supplemented by meaningful and earnest moves by Israel to respect the fundamental rights of Palestinians in the occupied territories, and simultaneous efforts by the Palestinian leadership to resolve their own differences and make a united and peaceful bid for statehood. The current situation will only lead to a further cycle of violence, which will be in nobody’s interest in an already troubled West Asia.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/resume-the-engagement/article7785257.ece
22,10,2015,A shared responsibility,"Fears that the >landmark Supreme Court decision invalidating the government’s move to put in place a National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) may result in a confrontation between the executive and the judiciary are obviously exaggerated. Yet, it will not be out of place to caution those concerned that they should not give room for such speculation. >Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s reaction — arguing that “Indian democracy cannot be the tyranny of the unelected” — may have appeared to the Congress as indicating a brewing confrontation. In reality, such responses are useful in advancing the debate on the ideal mechanism to appoint members of the superior judiciary. When as vital a legislative effort as an amendment to the Constitution is invalidated, it is not surprising for elected representatives to wonder aloud whether parliamentary sovereignty had been violated. Chief Justice H.L. Dattu has not only ruled out the possibility of any friction between the two wings of the state, but has also made it clear that the >judiciary is open to ideas to improve the working of the collegium system of judicial appointments. The situation, therefore, is more conducive for introducing safeguards against unmerited appointments within the present collegium system. It is also a responsibility that should be shared by the executive, the judiciary and the political class at large.
The Congress has cautioned the government against embarking on a collision course. While it is understandable that as an opposition party it is using the judgment to underscore its criticism that the Narendra Modi regime is undermining institutions, its stand of ruling out support to any fresh legislation to establish a more acceptable NJAC is intriguing. After all, it had supported the establishment of the NJAC. It is another matter if the Congress takes a categorical stand that it respects the primacy of the judiciary in the matter of appointments and favours the collegium system. One cannot but notice that the political parties have not made any positive suggestion or spoken of any consultation on addressing the court’s concern that the NJAC’s intended composition threatened the judiciary’s independence. There has been no call for an all-party meeting or any political discussion on whether Parliament should opt for fresh legislation, or join the proceedings in the Supreme Court from November 3 to come up with ways to strengthen the collegium system. Having asserted its primacy, the court is expected to evolve new guidelines to introduce transparency in the appointments process and insulate it from undue influence from within the judicial fraternity. Such an outcome need not be the last word. Political parties should think in terms of coming up with appropriate legislation in line with the law laid down by the court. Ultimately, an ideal process is one that is rooted in law rather than its judicial interpretation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-shared-responsibility/article7790418.ece
22,10,2015,Capital task for Andhra Pradesh,"As Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu sets the State on a course of building a new capital, > Amaravati , failure is not an option for him. He has no alibis lined up. He has declared > a 2018 deadline for the completion of the first phase of the project. By that time he expects the State to have its own Secretariat, Legislature, High Court and other core administrative centres. It is notable that 2018 is the year before the next election. This is an implicit, but bold, declaration that the Chief Minister will seek a renewal of his mandate on the strength of his success in building the capital. If Amaravati fails, Mr. Naidu could well fade into history – albeit as an astute trier – because he has staked his all on it. But there is an important proviso to consider here: Amaravati will not be judged merely for the building of it; it will be judged a success only if it works for the people of Andhra Pradesh. It should bring jobs for its youth, power the economy of the entire State, and help the displaced farmers and workers find new livelihoods.
Indeed, that is Mr. Naidu’s vision. He has a nuanced understanding of the mandate given to him against all expectations in 2014 in an election in the throes of the bifurcation. He thinks he has been brought in to build a powerful urban economic hub that will pull the State out of its excessive dependence on agriculture. He thinks his task is to give the State a tall city that commands the eastern sea coast and speaks the language of commerce to the great capitals of East Asia and South-East Asia. He thinks he is the man for it, and that the people look to him because he has had experience in such endeavours. If the people wanted to keep residuary Andhra Pradesh as it is – pastoral and provincial – why would they have him? Some analysts think Mr. Naidu in his second stint as Chief Minister is a chastened man, having been humbled earlier by rural voters despite his success in building the Cyberabad quarter of Hyderabad. He is wiser, certainly, but not necessarily chastened. In fact, his commitment to Amaravati is even more fierce, but tempered by the realisation that a city is not just the sum of the economic operations within it but of the opportunities it transmits to all corners of the State. The >Amaravati foundation-laying ceremony on October 22 is Mr. Naidu’s first step into the waters. In the days ahead he will no doubt encounter challenges in the form of distressed farmers in drought-hit pockets, displaced workers in the capital region, and dissatisfied youth in Rayalaseema. But Mr. Naidu believes he can ford the river this time.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/capital-task-for-andhra-pradesh/article7790419.ece
23,10,2015,Dalits as easy targets,"The > murder of two children of a Dalit family in Faridabad is part of a disturbing pattern of violence against the Scheduled Castes in Haryana. National Crime Records Bureau data put the number of incidents of crimes against Dalits in Haryana in 2014 at 830. The corresponding figure for 2013 was 493; for 2012 it was 252. Haryana has often been in the news for all the wrong reasons so far as the question of caste-related incidents are concerned. It has witnessed many major atrocities on Dalits before — including the > Jhajjar killing of five Dalits in 2002, > the burning of Dalit houses in Gohana in 2005, and > the killing of two Dalits at Mirchpur in 2010. These atrocities apart, the State has been notorious for its > Khap (clan) panchayats that have hit out against marriages outside a given caste or within a clan. Successive State governments including the present one led by the Bharatiya Janata Party have been unable to show the resolve to confront such tendencies up front. Political leaders have generally shied away from questioning the regressive aspects of tradition in the State. However, Haryana isn’t the lone culprit where violence against Dalits is concerned. NCRB data show high incidence of such atrocities in States such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh, among others.
Despite two crucial laws to deal with crimes against Dalits – the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955, and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 – the high incidence of violence against them is disturbing. While this shows the social vulnerability of Dalits even decades after reservation and dedicated laws meant to uplift and empower them were put in place, the gradual improvement in their material status may in fact have led to a rise in atrocities. For, increased Dalit independence and assertion are not to the liking of the dominant castes, especially in the countryside. There is little doubt that the rise of a middle class among Dalits since Independence — thanks largely to the reservation policy — has made these issues politically sensitive. With Dalits emerging as a pressure group constituting about 16 per cent of India’s population, any such incident leads to a political outcry. One such was witnessed on October 21 when Congress leader Rahul Gandhi visited the village and political leaders in poll-bound Bihar tweeted about it. Their votes have made the voice of the Dalits matter to an extent. But all this is still primarily at the level of political discourse; more needs to happen on the ground. The answer would perhaps lie in sensitising the police to act with alacrity in cases in which people are denied their right to life with dignity, and in more effectively communicating egalitarian ideas vis-à-vis caste within society. Unless Indian society makes amends, such incidents will keep sullying the country’s name.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Dalits-as-easy-targets/article10170423.ece
23,10,2015,The message from Canada,"The > sweeping victory of the Liberals led by Justin Trudeau in Canada marks a significant political shift in the North American country which had been ruled by the Conservatives since 2006. Though the Liberals were > expected to lead the pack, the margin of the victory took many by surprise. They won 184 seats in the 338-member Parliament, while the Conservative Party secured 99 seats and the leftist New Democrats 44. The victory is particularly important for Mr. Trudeau, who was brought to the party’s leadership after the Liberals were routed in the > 2011 election. Since 2006, the Canadian political spectrum had lurched well to the right, helping Stephen Harper emerge as the strongest Conservative politician in years. While he drew legitimacy from his government’s economic record in his early years as Prime Minister, many of his decisions were controversial. There was discontent among a large number of Canadians against his divisive religious policies — the controversial ban on face-covering at citizenship ceremonies was an example — and growingly authoritarian tendencies. His act of cutting down on several government-funded programmes in the name of fiscal tightening was largely unpopular, particularly among the middle class. But surprisingly, Mr. Harper’s poll managers shied away from addressing such discontent, and instead sought to build a negative campaign focussed on the 43-year-old Mr. Trudeau’s lack of experience and the “dynastic politics”. Conservatives often described Mr. Trudeau as “not just ready” to become the Prime Minister. But the Canadian people have clearly repudiated such misgivings.
What Mr. Trudeau got right during the election campaign was his focus on optimism and positivity. Instead of returning the Conservative jibes, he vowed to reclaim Canada’s “core values” — a strong social security system, active participation in international organisations, and an inclusive nationhood. Laying down a clear policy alternative, Mr. Trudeau, who calls himself a “proud feminist”, pledged to revise Mr. Harper’s anti-terrorism laws and end the country’s combat role in the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. He also promised to legalise marijuana. Moreover, the Conservative attack on Mr. Trudeau’s political lineage proved to be a boon rather than a bane for him. He could easily connect with the voters as positive memories of his father Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who was Prime Minister for nearly a decade, are still fresh. But he has now won only the battle, and the real war lies ahead. Though the Conservative Party lost, the conservative politics is still strong and Mr. Trudeau will not have a cakewalk in implementing his campaign promises. He has to address the problem of growing inequalities while rejuvenating the stuttering economy. The Canadians have given the Liberals another chance. The task before Mr. Trudeau now is to live up to the formidable expectations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-message-from-canada/article7792979.ece
24,10,2015,A prescription for the IMF,"Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan, known for his forthright and plain-speaking manner, has once again > trained his guns on the International Monetary Fund — where he once served as Chief Economist. The world’s premier multilateral lending institution, he said, had failed to fulfil its role in ensuring that national monetary policies did not end up hurting the global economy as a whole. Speaking at a preparatory meeting of a think-tank contributing ideas for the G-20 meeting in Turkey next month, Dr. Rajan reiterated a charge he had laid against the Fund in a speech in May to the Economic Club of New York: the IMF, he said, had been sitting on the sidelines and applauding unconventional and extreme policies initiated by central banks in the industrialised countries. These policies of quantitative easing, combined with the exchange-rate interventions pursued by some emerging market economies in the early-2000s, had created problems for others with large negative spill-over effects by pushing capital from one shore to another. With national central banks unlikely to consider the impact of their policy actions beyond the respective domestic economies — at best they would consider the second-level consequences on major trading partners — the Fund ought to have evaluated the implications from a global perspective, according to Dr. Rajan. That talks at the IMF’s latest meeting in Lima have flagged a potential emerging market crisis is vindication enough for the Indian central bank chief that the policies to tackle the earlier situations including the sub-prime and European crises have only ended up moving the predicament from one country to another, or from one region to another. The way to get out of this regime of rolling crises, as he termed it, would lie in concerted global action.
For the economist-turned-central banker, widely credited with having predicted the 2008 financial crisis, the concern about the lack of a global policy consensus is born of a very real predicament. Having just > cut the benchmark interest rate by a higher-than-expected 50 basis points with the aim of providing a monetary fillip to domestic demand, Dr. Rajan is well aware that a resurgence of inflationary pressures amid distinct signs of a drought across several key States could leave the RBI facing the spectre of tepid economic growth and accelerating price gains. And with > persisting uncertainty over when the U.S. Federal Reserve would start normalisation of interest rates, the outlook for the global economy remains hazy. The world having strayed into competitive easing willy-nilly, the need of the hour, according to Dr. Rajan, is a political consensus to go beyond domestic mandates and evolve optimal policies that help create global economic growth. Whether the G-20 leaders would pursue Dr. Rajan’s call and push for more concerted and wider political action on this front, given the common imperatives, remains to be seen.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-prescription-for-the-imf/article7797367.ece
24,10,2015,A partnership in peril,"Maharashtra’s ruling allies, the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party, have for long shared a rocky relationship. But this month the Sena has taken the partnership to the brink as never before: in quick succession, its activists > forced the cancellation of a concert by Pakistani ghazal maestro Ghulam Ali in Mumbai, and > smeared black paint on ex-Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s former aide Sudheendra Kulkarni for > organising a release function for a book by former Pakistani Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri. Then they > stormed the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai where board president Shashank Manohar was to meet Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shahryar Khan. Not content with thus making things difficult for Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, Saamna, the Sena mouthpiece, attacked the BJP. While doing so, the Sena stressed that its “anti-Pakistan” stance was “not about politics but about national pride”. Hours later, party chief Uddhav Thackeray used his traditional > Vijaya Dasami address to the party faithful to lash out against the Central government. He attacked the BJP for the lynching outrage in Dadri, and then criticised Union Minister V.K. Singh’s insensitive comments on the murder of two Dalit children in Haryana. However, he concluded his diatribe by saying that his party would not break its ties with the BJP.
Long-time observers of the Sena say there is a method in Mr. Thackeray’s pattern of actions, which are calculated to keep his cadres united and in good humour while working on enlarging the party’s base. The Sena’s broadsides against Pakistan, its demands that > India be declared a Hindu Rashtra and that a Uniform Civil Code be enacted, were of course intended to claim the militant “nationalist” Hindutva space. The reasons for its frontal attack on the BJP on the beef issue and on Minister V.K. Singh for his ill-judged remarks are more complicated: as the Sena draws its support base largely from the backward castes, and its ambition is to eventually draw into its fold the entire OBC-Dalit constituency in Maharashtra, it is necessary for it to be seen as challenging brahminical notions of purity to make its brand of Hindutva more broad-based, one predicated on the notion of self-respect. But at the same time, the party does not wish to offend Brahmins; hence the demand that Veer Savarkar be awarded the Bharat Ratna. Mr. Thackeray, insiders say, has no intention at this stage to sever the alliance with the BJP, which has been trying to split his party: any imprudent moves now could leave him with a truncated Sena. However, in the run-up to the municipal elections scheduled for February 2017 in the major cities of Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nashik, Auranagabad and Nagpur, he might precipitate such a break if he feels that the party has gained sufficient strength by then to go it alone. The BJP, at the Centre and in the State, will just have to grin and bear that – unless it can crack the Sena.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-partnership-in-peril/article7797366.ece
26,10,2015,Factoring in Pakistan,"Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s visit to the United States has not led to any ‘diplomatic blockbuster’ as was being speculated in a section of the American media. But it has left enough for Indian strategic thinkers and policymakers to mull over. The >joint statement by Mr. Sharif and Mr. Obama indicates a broad continuity in U.S. policy in South Asia, especially compared with the 2013 joint statement by them. At the same time, it demonstrates a higher degree of U.S. sensitivity to Pakistani concerns, which has direct implications for India. The continuing volatility in the security situation in Afghanistan, Pakistan’s battles with the demons within, and its relations with India were broadly the three topics that dominated Mr. Sharif’s discussions with his U.S. interlocutors, with terrorism as a theme that spanned all three topics. Particular emphasis was laid on measures to prevent Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal from falling into terrorist hands. For the first time, Pakistan gave a commitment in specific terms to take action against the terror outfit >Lashkar-e-Taiba, a lingering worry for India. A matter of serious concern for India was clarified by the U.S. administration separately – that Pakistan and the U.S. were not negotiating a 123 agreement for >civil nuclear cooperation, and the U.S. would not seek exemption for Pakistan from Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines to facilitate nuclear commerce.
The visit and its stated outcomes undermine an increasingly fashionable strategic theory that an emerging polarisation is giving shape to two axes in South Asia – Pakistan and China on the one side and the U.S. and India on the other. As a U.S. official who briefed the Indian media put it candidly, the U.S. has global intentions that will not allow it to choose between Pakistan and India, or tilt towards either of them. He went on to clarify that relations with Pakistan and India stand on their individual merits. India should not misread the energy and intensity in its >relationship with the U.S., demonstrated most recently during the Strategic and Commercial Dialogue and the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Obama last month, as U.S. willingness to jettison Pakistan. Pakistan continues to leverage its strategic location at the frontier of Afghanistan and China, and to a lesser extent, India. The U.S. appears clear that its South Asia policy involves a composite approach involving India, Pakistan and Afghanistan in its search for stability and peace, as well as of the fact that Pakistan is an important partner in the fight against global terrorism. The joint statement and the anticipated decisions – which will possibly include the sale of new F-16 fighter aircraft to Pakistan and the continuation of the Coalition Support Fund beyond 2016 – make it clear that the U.S. cannot afford to, and will not, overlook Pakistan’s significance as a regional strategic player. It will be unwise and ill-advised for India to assume it would be so.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/on-nawaz-sharifs-visit-to-united-states-and-pakistanus-ties/article7802948.ece
26,10,2015,"Needed, a more credible mechanism","The recent findings of two inquiry commissions in Sri Lanka underscore the need for a formal process to investigate and prosecute those responsible for grave crimes during the armed conflict that spanned three decades. The submission of the reports in Parliament should be welcomed, although it could also be interpreted as a signal to the international community that the domestic mechanisms are strong enough. The >Maxwell Paranagama Commission, mandated to probe cases of missing persons and allegations of war crimes, has established that there were significant civilian casualties caused by Sri Lankan Army shelling in 2009 and that there may have been many individual acts of war crimes. The three-member Commission has, however, mainly blamed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) for the civilian deaths, noting that it used civilians as human shields, placed weaponry in their midst and prevented them from leaving war zones. At the same time, the panel has pointed to the need to probe the exact circumstances of each instance of shelling of civilian clusters to fix individual responsibility. It has recommended an investigation led by a judge into some cases – such as the killing of LTTE political leaders while they were surrendering to the army, the disappearance of over a hundred LTTE members after their surrender, and the death of >Balachandran, son of LTTE leader V. Prabakaran. Instituting presidential commissions of inquiry is quite common a practice in Sri Lanka. But the mechanism is inherently limited in scope as the proceedings do not amount to criminal prosecution. An earlier exercise by the >Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) was notable for its acknowledgment of violations of human rights and humanitarian law, and its recommendations for justice and reconciliation.
The Paranagama Commission has contributed immensely to the cause of truth-seeking and justice by flagging key instances and setting out the circumstances in which they took place. It has identified the legal framework in which actions on the battlefield ought to be assessed. On the other hand, the >N.K. Udalagama Commission, which probed certain grave crimes that took place in 2005-06, has some controversial findings. It has blamed the LTTE for the death of 51 schoolgirls in August 2006 in an air strike, failing to note that their being possible LTTE recruits was not sufficient ground to target them. Also, the claim that the LTTE could have killed 17 local workers attached to an international aid agency appears to be only conjecture. With Sri Lanka under pressure from the international community to probe the crimes, it has to come up with a mechanism that is more credible. A model rooted in international principles and drawing on translational legal and forensic expertise will have to be evolved so that an empowered domestic judicial process can address the issue. Transitional justice requires sustained action, not just sporadic inquiries.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sri-lanka-human-rights-violations-needed-a-more-credible-mechanism/article7802949.ece
27,10,2015,Barbaric indeed,"When judges assume messianic roles while seeking to act on perceived outrage, it may result in inventive remedies but not necessarily achieve complete justice. It is not unusual these days to find some of them traversing beyond the remit of the cases before them and seeking to find or suggest solutions to many of society’s crimes and ills. In the Madras High Court, one has seen recent instances of a >judge suggesting mediation between a victim and the perpetrator of a rape, another laying down that mere sexual relations amount to marriage, and one prescribing pre-marital potency tests to prevent divorces happening. The latest is the suggestion of Justice N. Kirubakaran that > castration be made an additional punishment for child rape. Significantly, he himself acknowledges that this would be criticised as being barbaric and retrograde, but yet goes on to say that barbaric acts require barbaric punishments. But this is out of character with Indian jurisprudence as well as known canons of modern criminal justice. For one thing, the principle of proportionality of punishment is a limiting norm that militates against excessive punishment, and is not an eye-for-an-eye rule. Secondly, civilised systems have moved away from retributive sentencing, especially from ideas such as torture, decapitation, mutilation and chopping off of parts of the body as forms of punishment. It may also be counter-productive if castration is added as a form of punishment as it may deter foreign courts from allowing the extradition of offenders to face trial in India.
The judge’s suggestion is not qualified as ‘chemical castration’ in the operative part of the judgment. To be fair, he has listed the countries and some States in the United States that do have provision for chemical castration, or the injection of drugs that reduce testosterone levels and control libido — and it is not a suggestion that has not been made in the past. Also, he has called for wider consultations involving experts before such a measure is introduced. The Justice J.S. Verma Committee, which in 2013 >recommended far-reaching changes to criminal law to protect women from sexual offences, also received suggestions to that effect. However, the committee had noted that the effects of chemical castration were temporary, and repeated monitored doses at regular intervals may be required. It will violate human rights treaties such as the International Covenant on Civil Political Rights, which bars cruel and unusual forms of punishment. In other jurisdictions it is done with the offender’s consent and is a form of psychiatric treatment and not a judicial penalty. None, least of all the courts, should assume that rapes occur because of uncontrollable sexual urge. There can be no ‘magical results’ in curbing crimes against women, unless there is transformation in society and its very thought process. The rising rate of sexual crimes against children in the country is indeed alarming, but that is not reason enough for courts of law to advocate medieval forms of punishment.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/on-judges-assuming-messianic-roles/article7806590.ece
27,10,2015,Crises in the Maldives,"The dramatic >arrest last week of Ahmed Adheeb, the Vice-President of the Maldives, has escalated the political crisis in this young democracy, already fragile. The government says Mr. Adheeb was involved in an explosion on board the presidential boat on September 28, and that it was aimed at assassinating President Abdulla Yameen, as rumours in Male had claimed. He has, therefore, been removed on charges of “high treason”. A day after the arrest, President Yameen said his ex-deputy was a “ >threat to national security”. Under the Maldivian Constitution, if the President dies, is incapacitated, or resigns, the Vice-President takes power. But Mr. Adheeb has strongly denied the charges. His lawyer says the government had asked him to stay put when he was in Singapore a day before his arrest, but he still chose to come back to the country “because he’s innocent”. While there is no doubt that Mr. Adheeb has to be put through due process if he indeed has had any role in the blast, given the power struggles that the Maldives has witnessed over the past three years, there is no telling what is actually happening in this South Asian archipelago that is best known for its luxury tourism.
To start with, >President Yameen’s election itself was controversial. In the 2013 election, held after the country’s first democratically elected President Mohamed Nasheed resigned amid protests, the Supreme Court annulled the first round of voting, in which Mr. Nasheed was leading. The re-vote was delayed by the authorities, allowing enough time for Mr. Yameen, a half-brother of former dictator Abdul Gayoom, to make his moves. The Yameen Presidency has been criticised widely for its intolerance of dissent and crackdown on the opposition. Mr. Nasheed was jailed for 13 years this year on terrorism charges. A United Nations panel had ruled the jailing illegal and called for his immediate release, a call the government rejected. Opposition protests demanding Mr. Nasheed’s release were tackled with a heavy hand. The arrest of Mr. Adheeb, who was picked by the President three months ago to replace his impeached running mate Mohamed Jameel, comes close on the heels of the sacking of Defence Minister Moosa Ali Jaleel. All these point to a growing sense of instability surrounding the Yameen regime. The obvious question that Mr. Adheeb’s arrest raises is whether it is part of a larger power game, or whether the government has credible evidence linking him to the blast. If the government’s claims are true, it should be ready to try Mr. Adheeb in a transparent and impartial process. Meanwhile, Mr. Yameen should be ready to change his authoritarian ways, respect the democratic rights of his people, allow the opposition to operate freely and thereby strengthen the foundations of the young democracy. Only then can he offer a stable government to his people and save the Maldives from this state of flux.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ahmed-adheeb-arrest-crises-in-the-maldives/article7806592.ece
28,10,2015,A daughter comes home,"Far from having a fairytale ending, the story of Geeta turned into a reality television show as >she returned to India after a decade in Pakistan. Since the time she was separated from her family and appeared in Lahore, she has had an extraordinary life, learning to live with her disabilities, at the Edhi Foundation in Karachi, before diplomats negotiated the labyrinth of strained India-Pakistan ties to ensure her comeback. But the kind of >homecoming that Geeta would have been praying for is hardly what she faces today; she will be handed over by the family that she knows and that took care of her well in Pakistan, to a welfare home in Indore. There she must now live until her real family is identified. The most difficult of it all is that her real-life agonies and the quest for her family are playing out in the glare of the arc-lights. Ever since the government decided to take up her case and have Geeta repatriated — she had made formal representations to come to India for at least five years — it has made a spectacle of its efforts. While External Affairs Minister >Sushma Swaraj, to her credit, took a humane and personal interest in her welfare, the question is whether the intense publicity this young, frail girl has faced was required at all. Would it not have been easier if, once the Indian High Commissioner had formally identified Geeta as an Indian citizen (the High Commission had been in touch with her for years), she could have been brought to India along with the Edhi family on a private trip, or if necessary, several trips, to try and get a positive identification of her family before every move of hers was publicised? That way, when Geeta was transferred back, it would not be to a set of strangers at a halfway house that she would be handed over to, but to her own family.
Instead of treating Geeta as a victim of the most tragic circumstances, not to mention her speech and hearing impairment, the government has made her a poster-girl for its commitment to Indians in need everywhere. She was paraded at a stiff media conference addressed by the Minister and the Foreign Secretary, while the media subjected her to some atrocious questions including on her age, what she ate, and whether she was converted while she lived in Pakistan. The hope is that from this point on the government will take its trusteeship of Geeta to a more private space, and ensure that she is reunited with her family at the earliest opportunity, be given an education, and made the master of her own future. Rather than being a time for flag-waving, this is a time for privacy, and sensitive and caring handling, away from the attentions of politicians and the media, for the young child who lost her way over the international border years ago, and has returned as Bharat ki beti.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/geetha-returns-to-india/article7810676.ece
28,10,2015,Dealing with a fugitive,"In the shadowy world where organised crime and intelligence agencies have their interplay all the time, nothing is what it might appear to be. The >arrest of Rajendra Sadashiv Nikalje, or Chhota Rajan, may not just be an important achievement for the Indian security establishment; it may be part of a larger narrative from a world where the activities of intelligence agencies, police organisations, and the criminal underworld all overlap. It is the latest twist in the bizarre story of the Mumbai underworld that started off in the realms of smuggling and black-marketing, moved on to controlling real estate and the world of movies with its financial clout, then wreaked havoc in the very city that was its playground, before dispersing globally. Those underworld gangs have hardly disappeared; in fact, they have grown in strength and stealth capabilities. Rajan’s arrest in Bali upon his arrival there from Australia, which had become his home for many years after his being in South East Asia and Africa, symbolises the global tentacles of the Mumbai underworld. His mentor-turned-archrival >Dawood Ibrahim reportedly lives in Karachi, and both have financial interests spanning different continents. While such criminal syndicates have operated on a global scale, Indian intelligence agencies and the police have had to remain mere onlookers, unable to do much to counter them. In the wake of the >1993 Mumbai serial blasts, while Dawood was blamed for it all, Rajan emerged as a ‘Hindu don’ and a hero to even some in the security establishment. Thanks largely to the official patronage extended to him, Rajan was able to survive, and flourish even while in alien territories.
Rajan may have been of use to both the Mumbai police and Indian intelligence to a limited extent in their efforts to deal with the Dawood Ibrahim gang. However, his entire career, especially his activities during the period since he split from the Dawood gang, raises serious questions not just about him but also about the official patronage he enjoyed. There have been murmurs about Rajan aiding the partisan agenda of sections of the security establishment. The February 2010 >killing of advocate Shahid Azmi, who represented Muslims who were allegedly framed in various terror cases, raised disturbing questions about the exact role that Rajan played in covering up certain unprofessional acts of the Mumbai police and the intelligence agencies while investigating terror cases. Dawood’s role in aiding anti-India terror has been proven in Indian courts and acknowledged by foreign governments and United Nations agencies. Rajan is no angel either. He is wanted for long in India for running an organised crime syndicate, conspiracy, murders and other serious criminal acts. He has been part of the criminal underground that challenged the Indian state for years, weakened its institutions and poisoned the body politic. The government must take every possible step to ensure that Chhota Rajan is brought back to India and tried under the laws of the land. He should be dealt with as a criminal and as a fugitive, no less.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/chhota-rajan-arrest-dealing-with-a-fugitive/article7810678.ece
29,10,2015,Easing business blues,"The finding made in the World Bank’s ‘Doing Business 2016’ report that improvements in the regulatory environment helped lift >India’s ranking four places higher will serve as a shot in the arm for the government, given Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s avowed focus on economic development. The overall ‘ease of doing business’ ranking has climbed to 130 from a recalculated 134 last year following a change in methodology. And the distance-to-frontier score – which measures the absolute level of regulatory performance in an economy and the extent of improvement over time – has also advanced by two percentage points. Significantly, the Bank has found that it is easier now to both start an enterprise and get an electricity connection in Mumbai and Delhi, the two cities chosen for the study. The observations by Augusto Lopez-Claros, director of the Bank’s Global Indicators Group, pointing to a concerted effort by authorities to improve the business environment, should also offer encouragement. And his comment that a continuation of the process is likely to yield substantial progress in the coming year serves as vindication that the government is on the right track. Still, a closer look at the areas that need further loosening of regulations shows that Mr. Modi’s government has its task cut out. For instance, access to credit for a business has become marginally more difficult over the past 12 months, resulting in the ranking dropping six places. More worrying for policymakers are the stubbornly low distance-to-frontier scores for the two measures of enforcing contracts and dealing with construction permits. Only Bangladesh fares worse than India among the eight South Asian countries in the 189 nations on the list in resolving commercial disputes. And the region’s largest economy, by a distance, ranks a lowly seventh above war-torn Afghanistan on the ease of obtaining the approvals necessary to build.
Indeed, a herculean task lies ahead to achieve the government’s goal of breaking into the top 50 rankings in order to make the country a favoured investment destination for foreign capital and spur domestic enterprise. The strife-torn Palestinian enclaves of the West Bank and Gaza still rank one place above India, with both registering property and paying taxes far easier in the combined territories than in Asia’s third-largest economy. Even the smaller Asian and South Asian economies of Indonesia and Sri Lanka significantly outscore India on several parameters, showing why businesses find it easier to invest in these countries. In this context, the Income Tax Department’s move to set up a >panel of experts to simplify direct tax laws has come not a day too early. With several key bills to broaden economic reforms — including the centrepiece Act to create a common market through the much-delayed Goods and Services Tax — stuck in a legislative logjam, Mr. Modi and his parliamentary managers will need all their political nous if the ‘Make in India’ campaign is to succeed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/indias-rank-in-world-bank-doing-business-2016/article7814878.ece
29,10,2015,An apology from Mr. Blair,"By offering an apology that side-stepped personal accountability for his role in leading the United Kingdom into the war against Iraq in 2003, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has once again sought to whitewash a history of lies, dissimulation and concealment that marked the lead-up to that most unjust of invasions by the United States-led Coalition of the Willing. In an interview to CNN host Fareed Zakaria, what Mr. Blair offered was an >apology with a dodge, followed by a no-apology. “I apologise for the fact that the intelligence we received was wrong… for some of the mistakes in planning and certainly our mistake in understanding what would happen once you remove the regime,” he said, adding, “But I find it hard for apologising for removing Saddam... It is better that he is not there than he is there.” His apology, such as it is, comes 12 years and over half a million tragic and unnecessary civilian deaths too late. His ‘sorry’ has been criticised as an attempt at spin, and to pre-empt the conclusions in the much-delayed report by the Iraq inquiry committee headed by Sir John Chilcot, to be submitted next year.
Mr. Blair’s personal zeal and urgency in pushing for the U.K. to sign up to the invasion of Iraq in contravention of international law and a clear United Nations mandate, is well-documented. The latest evidence of this is a secret White House memo contained in the secret e-mails that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was forced to disclose on the order of U.S. courts, and published by the Daily Mail on Sunday. Sent from Secretary of State Colin Powell to President George Bush, and written on March 28, 2002, just a week before the famous summit between Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair at the former’s Crawford ranch in Texas, the memo reveals that Mr. Blair had agreed to come on board a year before the invasion — well before receiving sanction for it from the British Parliament or Cabinet. This new evidence has prompted calls for the Chilcot committee to reopen proceedings to admit this vital piece of new evidence. Mr. Blair will also have to take the primary responsibility for the September Dossier, a document published on September 24, 2002 by his government, which contained allegations that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and was building a nuclear programme. Mr. Blair used the contents of the document to win support from Parliament to invade Iraq. Every allegation in it has since been proven to be false. The clock cannot be turned back on the devastation, dislocation and chaos that the western invasion wrought in Iraq and subsequently across the region. Today, the fallout of that conflict has reached Europe, where refugees seeking a safe haven from the war in West Asia are fleeing. Mr. Blair’s tepid apology has refocussed public attention on what became a turning point in contemporary geopolitics — including his own role in that historic injustice.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tony-blairs-apology-for-britains-military-intervention-in-iraq-in-2003/article7814882.ece
30,10,2015,A gathering interrogation,"As > leading historians, filmmakers and scientists join the ranks of writers, artists and students to protest against increasing “intolerance”, civil society’s interrogation of the Narendra Modi government is getting more sharp, and inescapable. Scientist >P.M. Bhargava and >filmmakers Dibakar Banerjee and Anand Patwardhan are among those to return their national honours. Eminent historians such as Irfan Habib and Romila Thapar lead a list of peers to sign a letter detailing the acts of omission of the government. Each one questions the government in an individual capacity, but together they frame a collective response to > incidents of lynching, >murder of rationalists and writers, and a general atmosphere of intolerance towards people belonging to minority communities. As their numbers grow, they draw into focus the unchecked activities of so-called fringe elements who draw sustenance from their association with the BJP. The questions they pose demand responsive engagement from the Union government. Civil society has started a conversation that Central Ministers and BJP spokespersons cannot dodge by questioning the individual record of protestors. They cannot get away by evasively blaming State governments for failing to maintain law and order. The questions civil society members are articulating and threading together challenge the discourse and activities of persons and organisations intimately invested in the BJP’s political project. The question they collectively convey is this: how should a democratically elected government respond to citizens who are openly saying they have lost faith in its sincerity to ensure liberty and justice? It is a vital question.
When students of the FTII in Pune >called off their 139-day old strike on Wednesday, their struggle may not, on the face of it, have yielded anything. Their demands for the removal of the head of the institute and three other NDA appointees remain unmet. Yet, the simultaneous act of return of national awards by a filmmaker like Dibakar Banerjee succeeded in connecting the students agitating against specific official appointments to a larger current of discomfort against a majoritarian politics and lumpen mobilisation. The response from the government and its Ministers has been dispiriting, and only exposes a refusal to engage with a widely-shared critique. For his part, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has remained resoundingly silent. In questioning the intent of the protestors rather than the substance of their protest, the government hardly distinguishes itself. But it must know that disengagement is not the answer. Neither is character assassination, or belittling of intellectuals and creative individuals. Each wave of protest refreshes and clarifies the questions posed of the government and its political intent. A response of name-calling and silence on the core issues too only reinforces those questions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/on-rising-intolerance-a-gathering-interrogation/article7819285.ece
30,10,2015,Ideology over science,"The Science and Technology Ministry has directed all laboratories under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to begin >“self-financing” their research. The ostensible purpose is to make financing for scientific research more accountable. But taken together with other developments, this must flag serious concerns about the priorities and the ideological agenda the government is bringing to bear on the scientific community. The decision on “self-financing” was announced at a “Chintan Shivir” in Dehradun this June, in consultation with the RSS. The fact that laboratories were also asked to be mindful of the government’s “social and economic agenda”, therefore, comes as confirmation of the creeping influence of Sangh Parivar affiliates in the science, health and research landscape. It raises questions about the intent behind a similar “self-financing” mandate to the Department of Health Research, which recently shut down the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau, India’s only agency collecting data on nutrition deficiency among marginalised populations. It is not only that the BJP-led government’s failures to support science and public health are being foregrounded. It is, just as menacingly, that the Sangh Parivar’s ideological assault on reason and scientific temper is being institutionalised. The results are showing. The Ministries of Science and Technology and Health are actively seeking private partnerships to keep research projects going. The international public health community is tracking the developments with alarm. Richard Horton, Editor-in-Chief of The Lancet, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had consistently and deliberately sidelined the health sector since coming to power. He warned of an impending “collapse”.
The Modi government’s inherent discomfort with “scientific” evidence that may run counter to views shaped largely by the Sangh’s leanings has grave public policy implications. For example, when data collection on nutrition is undermined, policy design can be disconnected from desired outcomes easily. So Madhya Pradesh’s BJP government has stopped serving eggs as part of the mid-day meal scheme, removing an important source of nutrition for schoolchildren. None of this is surprising. Whenever scientific data become inconvenient for the government, it has no qualms in suppressing the research. The CSIR is the backbone of scientific and technological research. Expecting researchers to fund themselves with help from industry and setting “deliverable targets” for them to further a socio-economic agenda too is a clear way of curbing dissent. India’s social sector is already strained for funds, and the increasing politicisation of science is an attempt by the government to force its objectives on research. No two disciplines are less compatible than politics and science. But then, the government and the Sangh personnel behind these decisions have anyway privileged ideology over science.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/on-selffunding-for-cisr-labs-research-projects/article7819286.ece
31,10,2015,Divisive innuendo,"Desperation on the campaign trail is a guaranteed test of character. Faced with a stiff electoral challenge, contestants tend to fall back on core political beliefs to spell out the essential choice to voters. Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah certainly left nothing to nuance on Friday at an >election rally in Raxaul in Bihar’s East Champaran district. Should a BJP government not be formed in the State, he said, crackers would be burst in Pakistan. To drum up the rhetoric, he asked the assembled crowd if they would want that to happen. On cue, Sushil Modi, the BJP’s seniormost State leader and till the 2013 BJP-Janata Dal (United) split Deputy Chief Minister to Nitish Kumar, reinforced the divisive innuendo. In the event of a BJP victory in Bihar, there would be Diwali in India, he posted on Twitter, and if the “UPA” won, there would be “celebration” in Pakistan. This is a spectacularly shameful attempt by a party that leads the national government to cast citizens of India who vote otherwise as unpatriotic. Sangh rabble-rousers have not exactly been subtle in using “Pakistan” as code for being untrue to India. In their invocation of the “Pakistan” reference point, Muslims’ patriotism is brought into question, as well as of others who question or disagree with the BJP. In fact, in the 2002 State election campaign, Narendra Modi, then the Gujarat Chief Minister, freely addressed “Mian Musharraf” as a representative of all those who disagreed with him, and by implication all that was not good for India.
In the years since, Mr. Modi has remade his image. In the Lok Sabha campaign of 2014, he privileged economic growth over Hindutva, though assorted BJP leaders kept drumming sectarian points, especially in post-Muzzafarnagar Uttar Pradesh. After becoming Prime Minister, the impression has been conveyed that even as Sangh affiliates and BJP members return to Hindutva messaging, 7 Race Course Road was disapproving, that there was concern that the development agenda may be compromised. It is a different matter that he never publicly voiced the disapproval. This is why the Bihar campaign marks a potential turning point. On the trail, the Prime Minister himself sought to reassure voters that he would not allow “ >a particular community” to cut into reservation quotas for the backward classes. The reference was obvious. Mr. Shah’s Raxaul warning does not come in a vacuum. It feeds into, and nourishes, the official intolerance of dissent. It comes amidst the takeover of cultural and educational institutions by Hindutva ideologues and fellow-travellers. It strengthens the anxiety that the men and women who currently rule India do not hold all citizens equal. These statements are not campaign-trail indiscretions uttered in the heat of electoral competition that can be simply referred to the Election Commission for a suitable reprimand. They reflect, and encapsulate, a deeper current of majoritarianism that must be confronted as such in all its dimensions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bihar-assembly-polls-divisive-innuendo/article7823806.ece
31,10,2015,Reaching out to Africa,"That 41 heads of state and government from 54 countries in Africa were present at the >India-Africa Forum Summit in New Delhi, itself demonstrates the importance both sides attach to mutual ties. The summit, which concluded on Thursday, was the largest gathering of foreign dignitaries in New Delhi since the 1983 Non-Aligned Summit. The message was not lost on anyone: India wants to energise its relations with the continent with which it had strong political ties in the first three decades after Independence. But India lost some momentum in building a stronger partnership with African countries since the 1990s as the country recalibrated its foreign and economic policies. The idea of the India-Africa summit was first mooted to arrest this slide and reboot the relationship. While the previous two gatherings — the 2008 New Delhi and 2011 Addis Ababa summits — were significant, this week’s meet takes relations to a higher level with a demonstrated resolve and a clearly laid-down road map. India has offered a new line of credit worth $10 billion to strengthen economic cooperation and called for a unified stance for the reform of the UN Security Council.
Africa is an important trade partner for India. Indian energy companies have assets in African countries, and New Delhi exports consumer and capital goods and medicines to the continent. India-Africa trade was worth almost $70 billion in 2014-15, and Indian companies invested some $30-35 billion in the continent over the past decade. While trade has improved in these ten years, it is still much less than Africa’s trade with China, which was $200 billion in 2014-15. Besides, China has invested more than $180 billion in Sub-Saharan Africa alone in areas ranging from energy to infrastructure during the period 2005-2015. India may not have the resources to beat the level of Chinese investments, but it can certainly do a lot more with proper policy approaches, faster project execution and improved bilateral relations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of the $10 billion concessional credit is a right step in this direction. Second, there’s a convergence of interest for reforming the Security Council. India’s claim is that as the second most populated country and the largest democracy in the world, it deserves a permanent seat in a reformed Security Council. The Prime Minister has also noted that Africa, with more than a quarter of the members of the UN, is not represented in the powerful UN body. Against this background, it is imperative for both sides to speak in “one voice” for Security Council reforms. Third, stronger ties with Africa fit into India’s traditional foreign policy milieu. The goodwill India enjoys in the continent is a result of the principled anti-colonial positions the country took in the post-Independence era. India should cash in on that goodwill to build a stronger economic and political partnership with Africa in the new century.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/indiaafrica-forum-summit-reaching-out-to-africa/article7823807.ece
