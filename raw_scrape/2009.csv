12,8,2009,Meeting a pandemic challenge,"It is four months since the gravity of the swine flu outbreak that started in Mexico became evident to the international community. India was not spared from the three flu pandemics of the last century. It ought to have been clear from the start of this one that the country must be prepared to face a new contingency. Yet for all the pandemic preparation that is supposed to have been completed, it is the Union Health Ministry’s lack of planning that has been on displa y in recent days. Even before the first swine death occurred in India recently, a large number of countries across the world were coping with massive outbreaks of pandemic flu. But the central government, which must provide leadership for the nation, appears to have drawn few lessons from the experience of those countries.
It has utterly failed to prepare the public for a rapid spread of the flu virus within the country. In stark contrast, the scientists of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), who led efforts to keep the American media and the public informed, have been at pains to emphasise both what was known and unknown about the virus and its behaviour. Thus from the very beginning, when the U.S. had only a handful of confirmed cases, the CDC has been driving home the point that the confirmed cases were only the “tip of the iceberg.” Far more transmission of the virus could actually be occurring among humans that was not being picked up. Thus towards the end of June, when the U.S. had over 27,000 confirmed cases, including 3,000 hospitalisations and more than 130 fatalities, a leading CDC scientist declared that there could have been “at least a million cases” in the country up to that time. Union Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, on the other hand, insisted that swine flu in the country was under control. He spoke about how the government had managed to “limit the cases of swine flu to a few individuals, considering the size of our population and country.” The result is that as swine flu cases and resultant deaths begin to mount, the government looks ineffective. The public gets the impression that the situation is out of control and starts to panic.
A flu pandemic occurs when a virus arises to which the vast majority of people in the world have no natural immunity. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that about two billion people worldwide — about 30 per cent of the global population — could be infected by the time this pandemic ends. But catching the swine flu is very far from being a grave illness, let alone a death sentence. In fact, data gathered by the WHO from various countries suggest that only up to 10 per cent of confirmed cases need to be hospitalised and fatalities occur in less than one per cent of confirmed cases. But such confirmed cases, it bears reiteration, are only the tip of the iceberg. A great many people who become infected could either be asymptomatic or suffer only mild symptoms. A U.S. document on pandemic planning indicates that only half of those who pick up the virus might even seek medical help. A recent WHO briefing note points out that the majority of patients infected with the pandemic virus worldwide continue to experience only mild symptoms and recover fully within a week, even in the absence of any medical treatment.
But the sad fact remains that when so many people catch swine flu, some of them will develop severe disease and die. The vast majority of severe cases have occurred in high-risk groups, such as pregnant women and those with asthma or other lung disorders, cardiovascular problems, diabetes, suppressed immune systems, or neurological disorders. Obesity appears to be another risk factor. But while the media spotlight is on every person who dies of swine flu in the country, the toll taken by seasonal flu, which people encounter year after year with no more than a shrug, gets overlooked. A large part of the problem is, of course, that India lacks a proper surveillance system to track seasonal flu and many other infectious diseases. The U.S., a much wealthier nation with less than a third of India’s population, sees some 36,000 deaths from seasonal flu each year. Published estimates suggest that India accounts for 20 per cent of the 1.9 million children who die annually of acute respiratory infections in developing countries.
Given the number of people who might seek medical help and need hospitalisation as the pandemic takes hold in India, a few designated hospitals will not suffice. Yet, even in its revised guidelines issued after the Pune schoolgirl died on August 3, the Union Health Ministry asked any person with flu-like symptoms to go to a designated government facility to be checked and, if required, to give a sample for testing. The chaos that ensued in cities like Pune was predictable. In order to prevent health care institutions from being swamped, the U.S. CDC recommends that those who get sick with the virus stay home unless they have signs of severe illness or fall in a high-risk group. The WHO too makes a similar suggestion. Better sense seems, however, to have dawned, with the Union Health Ministry now announcing that it would issue guidelines for private hospitals and laboratories that had the necessary facilities to treat and test patients for swine flu. Measures to mobilise the country’s health care infrastructure, in the public as well as private sectors, ought to have been part of the pandemic plan that the central government is supposed to have worked out and put in place. In all this, rural India and the poor must be given special attention. The swine flu could be at its worst when it affects those who are malnourished, many of whom suffer from chronic diseases and often have little access to health care. At a vulnerable juncture when a drought threatens, this pandemic could test the country’s ability to care for its people. We cannot afford to fail.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Meeting-a-pandemic-challenge/article16874697.ece
12,8,2009,Facing up to a bad monsoon,"This year, the rains were exceptionally bad in June and the monsoon has been unable to recover from such a big setback. Now with half the rainy season over, the chances are that the monsoon will end in a drought. The country as a whole received little more than half the rain it usually gets in June. Mercifully, rains in July were only a little below average. Even so there was a cumulative deficit of about 20 per cent in countrywide rainfall by the end of that month. Based on an analysis of rainfall data for 130 years, leading atmospheric scientists have pointed out in a journal paper that when the June-July rainfall for the entire country has more than a 12 per cent shortfall, there is a 67 per cent probability of the monsoon ending in a drought. (Atmospheric scientists typically define a drought as a deficit of more than 10 per cent in the nationwide rainfall for the entire season.) In short, as July came to an end, it was clear the monsoon was in trouble. Moreover, the El Nino that is brewing in the Pacific Ocean appears to be affecting the monsoon. This warming of the equatorial waters of the central and eastern Pacific leads to enhanced cloud formation in that region, thereby drawing away the moisture-laden winds needed to sustain the Indian monsoon. In 1997, favourable conditions in the equatorial Indian Ocean were able to counter a strong El Nino and the monsoon enjoyed slightly above-average rains. This year, unfortunately, the Indian Ocean has not helped out and could instead be adding to the monsoon’s woes.
August usually provides nearly 30 per cent of the monsoon rainfall. Poor rains in the opening days of this month have pushed the seasonal deficit for the country as a whole to 25 per cent. If the rains fail to pick up this month, a bad situation could become a whole lot worse. Northwestern India has already been badly hit, with the rainfall deficit now standing at 40 per cent. It is from this region that the monsoon starts its withdrawal, a process that often begins in early September and then extends gradually to the rest of the country. So the rains in August will have a huge impact on this region. A poor monsoon no longer brings with it the spectre of famine but droughts have been shown to significantly reduce foodgrain production and the GDP. There has been a sharp drop in paddy cultivation this monsoon. “In no case should we allow our citizens to go hungry,” Prime Minister Manmohan Singh proclaimed at the recent conference of State Chief Secretaries. At a time like this, with a crisis looming, it is imperative that the central and State governments set aside their differences and work in unison for the common good.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Facing-up-to-a-bad-monsoon/article16874696.ece
12,8,2009,Clearing the final hurdle,"The suspense over the eligible human embryonic stem cell lines for federal funding has been finally removed after the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced the rules recently. The draft guidelines issued earlier by the NIH, after President Barack Obama signed an executive order overturning the eight-year-old ban on federal funding of stem cell lines, had specific requirements of informed consent by individuals who wished to donate their embryos for research. The 70 0 or so stem cell lines derived after 2001, and the 21 cell lines already approved for federal funding, were developed from extra embryos created by in vitro clinics after obtaining informed consent. This conformed to the guidelines laid down in 2005 by the National Academies of Sciences (NAS) or derived according to the ethical protocols approved by institutional review boards. But the stringent condition of informed consent laid down by the NIH would have made most of these cell lines, including the ones already funded, ineligible for federal funding. That would have been a severe setback to embryonic stem cell research. Nearly all ongoing experiments using federally funded cell lines and those created after 2001 would have been stopped. They would have needed to start afresh, using new cell lines obtained in accordance with the new rules. Little wonder that most stem cell researchers were aghast at the NIH proposal. The national body had clearly acted without applying its mind on such a vital matter.
Biological sciences, especially stem cell science, have been progressing at an astonishing pace over the last few years. When science progresses faster than regulation, it is inconceivable that retroactivity, the cornerstone of science regulation, was overlooked while framing the guidelines. It became all the more unfathomable as the NAS guidelines, the gold standard for the conduct of stem cell research in the U.S., permit retroactivity on cell lines already approved by the NIH. In fact, all the 21 cell lines identified for federal funding by the NIH itself in 2001 would have become ineligible for continued funding had the NIH not corrected the anomaly. Scientists may now become eligible to receive financial support from the government if the NIH is convinced that the creation of the stem cell lines adhered to the spirit, if not the letter, of the new regulations. However, what criteria the national body will use to determine whether a cell line that has not been collected in accordance with the newly laid down ‘informed consent’ rules is eligible for funding is yet to become clear.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Clearing-the-final-hurdle/article16874695.ece
13,8,2009,Get to the truth on Shopian,"Ever since the bodies of two young women washed up on the banks of the Rambiara river in Shopian in south Kashmir ten weeks ago, the investigation into their death has been hit by crisis. On Tuesday, this newspaper broke the news that vaginal swabs purported to have been taken from the victims were, in fact, drawn from other women. Since the presence of semen in the swabs has been the keystone of the investigation into allegations that the women were raped and then murdere d, the fabrication could mean that the truth about Shopian would never be known. Opinion is divided on whether the fabrication was carried out to protect powerful perpetrators or, in the alternative, to defame security force personnel alleged to have carried out the rape. What is clear is that the investigation was messed up from the start. First, the district police failed to sanitise the crime scene, which raised the possibility of a loss of critical evidence. Then the doctors who conducted two sets of autopsies on the victims provided inconclusive findings on the cause of death and whether the two women had been sexually assaulted. Shockingly, the autopsies were carried out by non-specialists, without the aid of basic equipment such as microscope. The post-mortem was not videotaped. Despite allegations by Shopian residents that the women had been raped by police and paramilitary personnel, authorities delayed initiating a full criminal investigation. Matters were made worse by politicians, whose efforts to cash in on the tragedy set off street battles. All this has stretched the credibility of the Jammu and Kashmir government to breaking point.
Three possibilities now face investigators. Did the police personnel under investigation for their possible role in the deaths arrange for the slides to be switched? Or did the doctors and forensic experts who handled the swabs swap them with fakes, either to assist the suspects or those alleging that the women had been raped by security force personnel? Or was there a genuine mistake? The poor record of the J&K Police Special Investigation Team, which has been handling the case, gives little reason for confidence. It is yet to question several suspects who merited investigation in the eyes of the Justice Muzaffar Jan Commission of Inquiry. The SIT has failed to persuade the families of the victims to consent to the exhumation of the bodies for forensic tests. Bowing to demands from angry legislators, the State government has said it would seek to hand over the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation. This must be done immediately. The families of the two young women and the State’s people are entitled to the unvarnished truth about Shopian.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Get-to-the-truth-on-Shopian/article16875798.ece
13,8,2009,Defying the world,"The verdict handed down to Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi by a kangaroo court in Myanmar is outrageous and deserves to be condemned in the strongest of terms. Consider the farce enacted in the court. The presiding officer finds Ms Suu Kyi guilty of violating the rules of house arrest and sentences her to three more years of detention. Then the military junta’s Home Minister enters the courtroom through the backdoor and announces that the term of extended detention i s reduced to 18 months. She was alleged to have received a guest — an American who visited her uninvited by swimming across the lake abutting her residence — in defiance of the rule. This happened just when her incarceration was about to end, and obviously the military rulers needed another ruse to keep her in detention. The trial began promptly and the verdict was very much on expected lines, though the whole world knew it was a farce. Ms Suu Kyi has spent 14 years in detention, some of them in prison. Despite the continuing pressure from the international community, and more recently the personal message U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki moon to the generals, the junta has chosen to defy the world and doggedly pursue its mission to keep Burma, or what it calls Myanmar, under brutal repression and without development.
Obviously, at the back of the generals’ minds must have been the so-called general election they have scheduled for 2010. With this verdict, Ms Suu Kyi has been effectively kept out of the electoral process, and the junta would like to go through a sham election in an effort to gain political legitimacy as well. As British Prime Minister Gordon Brown says: “The international community must respond to this latest injustice with a clear message to the junta that its tyrannical actions will no longer be tolerated.” Experience has demonstrated clearly that sanctions by the Western powers alone cannot make much of a difference. The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has also tried to exert pressure on Myanmar to adopt the process of reform and go for an inclusive electoral process. The generals have once again displayed their resolve to continue with their repressive misrule. It is time the entire international community took concerted and effective action against the regime so that the country’s 50 million people were freed from repression and misrule. The Suu Kyi trial has shown that a soft approach to the military junta — in the hope that it will, in course of time, leave the task of governing the country to democratically elected representatives and step back into the barracks — is clearly not working.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Defying-the-world/article16874750.ece
14,8,2009,Learning from two poet-savants,"Symbolic acts can build great practical value. By installing the statue of Tamil poet-saint Thiruvalluvar in Bangalore on August 9 and that of Kannada savant Sarvajna in Chennai on August 13, the Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have gone beyond cultural symbolism. They have begun a process of good neighbourly engagement that can be helpful towards a resolution of inter-State issues, notably the Cauvery river waters dispute, on just and sustainable lines. For 18 long years, those who claimed to be partisans of Kannadiga interests erected roadblocks against the unveiling of the Thiruvalluvar statue in Bangalore — not because they had any dislike for his celebrated couplets on ethics and practical living, but because they saw him as a Tamil icon, and therefore as a symbol of the interests of Tamil Nadu. At a time when the Cauvery water dispute was raising political temperatures in both States, Thiruvalluvar, the beloved master of Tamil ethical poetry, became a subject of political contestation. Later, Kannada partisans linked the issue to the installation of a statue of Sarvajna, who was known for his pithy tripadis or three-line sayings on various aspects of human life. What links the two poetic voices is their open-mindedness, humanism, practical wisdom, and equanimity; their non-sectarianism; their opposition to obscurantism and the pursuit of unreason; their gentle humour; and the clear-glass felicitousness and accessibility of their ethical messages.
To the credit of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi and Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa, they showed the political will to break free from the trappings of the past and go for reciprocal installations at a congenial time. The step was proposed nine years ago but held up because the political atmosphere, which was dominated by the river water disputes, was not right. Now that the symbolic gestures are over, the time is ripe for addressing the inter-State issues with the fairness, balance, and good-natured give-and-take practicality that both Thiruvalluvar and Sarvajna favoured. The real significance of the statue installation functions in Bangalore and Chennai will lie in the success of such a conciliatory process, and not in the satiation of literary-cultural pride on both sides. As they did on the issue of the statues, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka should build seriously on the value of reciprocity and find common ground on more challenging issues. Whenever hurdles come in the way of sensible and sustainable solutions based on give-and-take, when ‘to-do-or-not-to-do’ vacillations arise, political leaders in the two States need look no further than the Kural and the Tripadis for sage ethical and practical guidance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Learning-from-two-poet-savants/article16874866.ece
15,8,2009,Bold attempt,"The new direct tax code is a bold attempt at consolidating the entire corpus of law relating to direct taxes — income tax, dividend distribution tax, fringe benefit tax, and wealth tax. Now open for public discussion, the code will be incorporated in a bill the government hopes to introduce in the winter session of Parliament. It represents a strategic shift in the government’s fiscal agenda relating to direct taxes. Its three main objectives are: to minimise t he number of tax exemptions even while maintaining moderate rates; remove ambiguities; and curb evasion. The Finance Minister hopes that the code — expected to become law by 2011 — will provide stability to the tax regime as it is based on widely accepted principles of taxation and best international practices. The proposal to reduce the tax liabilities of individuals and corporates has attracted a great deal of attention but more important is the principle that low tax rates combined with simpler tax laws and minimal exemptions will benefit both the tax payer and the exchequer. In that sense, the code’s proposal for lower marginal rates across all income slabs — for instance, total income between Rs.1.60 lakh and Rs.10 lakh will be taxed at 10 per cent — ought to be evaluated along with other rationalisation measures proposed.
The move to streamline the tax treatment on savings by applying the EET method (exempt savings, exempt interest on savings, and tax withdrawals) removes the existing anomalies, besides taxing expenditure. However, with the penetration of social security schemes being at low levels, the case for exempting retirement benefits from tax still remains strong. The trebling of the deductible savings to Rs.3 lakh is long overdue. The changes proposed in the taxation of capital gains and wealth tax ought to be welcomed although in the first instance they appear to cause hardships to some categories of assessees. The distinction between short-term and long-term capital gains is to be eliminated, and this might affect punters in the exchanges. On the other side, the abolition of the turnover tax on share transactions will increase trading volumes in the exchanges. Corporate tax rates are proposed to be brought down to 25 per cent. The move to introduce a minimum alternate tax on assets requires clarification as even loss-making companies might be dragged into it. One major area of concern is the extraordinary powers proposed to be given to the tax authorities who can, in extreme situations, bypass even tax treaties. In its entirety, the tax code is a major step forward and ought to be welcomed.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Bold-attempt/article16875069.ece
15,8,2009,Freer trade with ASEAN,"After six long years of tough bargaining, India and the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have clinched a Free Trade Agreement that will take effect on January 1, 2010. There has been a great deal of give and take and compromises in the format of the agreement, but negotiations on services and investments are still on. Only when they too come under the FTA umbrella can India derive full benefits. Any such agreement invariably comes under the scanner of domestic special interest groups, and sure enough, the FTA with ASEAN has met with some stiff resistance from industrial and agricultural constituencies in India as also in some of the South East Asian countries. As a result, the number of items under the ‘sensitive’ list remains large, with the deadline for scrapping them extending to 2019. India-ASEAN trade climbed to $40 billion last year, and it should grow significantly in the coming year. The balance of trade remains in ASEAN’s favour and it can be corrected only when the present agreement, which now covers goods, is enlarged to include services and investments also. The pact should have been inked at least two years ago, but the reservations on both sides and the general election in India delayed it.
In India, much of the opposition comes from Kerala, which had also resisted the FTA with Sri Lanka. Its concerns centre on the plantation sector, notably coconuts, coffee, pepper and rubber. These have been retained in the sensitive list for now. As a result, Indonesia and Malaysia succeeded in binding the tariff on crude palm oil at 37.5 per cent and the one on refined palm oil at 45 per cent. The other area of concern for Indian industry relates to auto components, but 52 of them figure in the sensitive list. At some stage, domestic producers will have to face up to international competition under the World Trade Organisation agreements. Free trade with ASEAN would be of great benefit to the economy as a whole, particularly consumers. Regional trade blocs such as this should be seen as building blocks for global free trade. The India-ASEAN trade bloc becomes the fourth largest in the world and should be welcomed in the setting of New Delhi’s ‘Look East’ policy, ushered in about 15 years ago. Coming close on the heels of a pact with South Korea, this advances that policy further. As the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) Secretary-General Amit Mitra says, India should work to secure 8 to 10 per cent of ASEAN’s $1 trillion import. After all, Indian goods and services too will have access to that market at 5 per cent duty initially and zero duty before long.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Freer-trade-with-ASEAN/article16875070.ece
17,8,2009,The stressed soldier,"The number of military personnel across different branches and ranks taking their own lives has spiked in India, raising questions of esprit de corps. Since 2006, there have been 495 cases of suicides and 25 cases of “fragging,” or killing of fellow-soldiers, in the Army alone. Several measures have been announced in recent years to address the crisis, but clearly, more are needed. Tellingly, a report prepared by the Defence Institute of Psychological Research, while putting the incidents in the context of the strain and stress of prolonged and repeated deployment in situations of civil conflict, often in counter-insurgency roles, has also emphasised the need for sensitising the intermediate-level leadership to the problems of the jawans and for improving interpersonal relations between officers and men. The “organisational environment in which the soldier lives and works,” has to be improved and “better integration of the individual in the group” facilitated. Providing adequate rest and recuperation opportunities, rationalising the grant of leave, improving manpower management, and enhancing awareness among troops regarding stress management are some of the other suggestions this internal study has come up with. The recommendations call for some rethinking on occupational issues and internal dynamics, and a qualitative change in person-management methods across the ranks.
The military leadership should move with greater seriousness to find ways of mitigating the stress levels of soldiers. The services have in recent times made available mental health-related assistance and counselling facilities. The shortage of properly trained personnel for the task of counselling also needs to be addressed by means of special selection and training procedures. Simultaneously, steps to eliminate any stigma that may be associated with accessing counselling and mental health services should be initiated. Also, the circumstances that led to suicide or killing should be gone into in every case and the data analysed systematically so that the problem could be better understood. The government has, of course, taken several steps to give armed forces personnel a better deal. Their pay and allowances, as also pension benefits, have been improved considerably in recent months. The creation of an Armed Forces Tribunal that would deal exclusively with pending cases relating to the services and welfare of the personnel is also a step in the right direction. Along with better pay and service conditions, it must also be ensured that the force is less stressed, and at peace with itself.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-stressed-soldier/article16875301.ece
17,8,2009,Bar-coding plants,"It may soon be possible to classify a majority of the more than 400,000 species of land plants in the world on the basis of genetic variability. The Plant Working Group of the Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL) recently reached a consensus on the portions of the genes that would be used as the plant DNA bar-code. This came after four years of work by 52 scientists from 10 countries. DNA bar-coding, a technique proposed by the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada, uses a short genetic sequence from a standard part of the genome to quickly identify different plant species. To become usable the chosen genetic sequences of the bar-code must vary with species but must also be conserved enough in plants for identifying most of them. Bar-coding has been used since 2003 to identify animal species, and a bar-code library of nearly 60,000 animal species has been created. But there was no agreement on which regions of the genome should be used for bar-coding plants. The short DNA sequence found in the mitochondrial gene used for bar-coding animals cannot be used in plants; this is because the gene does not vary much in plants and will not be reliable for species identification. Attention therefore turned on the chloroplast genome, which converts sunlight into chemicals. Of the seven candidates shortlisted, the Plant Working Group chose portions of two genes ( matK and rbcL) for the bar-code.
But the plant bar-code is some way short of the ideal. While it can group the plants to the correct genus, it can, on average, discriminate only 72 per cent of all plant species. Though identifying closely related species is problematic in many plants and fungi, it should be less of an issue when used within a restricted region or habitat. But there is no room for complacency as this tool is yet to be tested widely in biodiversity hotspots. The gene used in the animal bar-code has the power to correctly identify over 95 per cent of the species. The task then is to find a way to increase the discriminatory power of the plant bar-code. In the short-term, using supplementary bar-codes along with the standard one can increase this power. But the biggest challenge the initiative may have to face will be funding. Most biodiversity hotspots are in developing countries that will not be able to fund such initiatives on their own. The irony is that some projects in India are yet to get off the ground for want of funding even as several agencies wait for a bar-code system to be settled to fund such initiatives. The time for determined action in this scientifically important area is now.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Bar-coding-plants/article16875300.ece
18,8,2009,Drought and crisis management,"The South-West monsoon has proved to be unpredictable, variable, and uncertain this year — with the official announcement that 177 districts suffer from either drought or drought-like conditions indicating the magnitude of the crisis. Little or no rain, late rain, and heavy rain have all been features of monsoon behaviour so far in different parts of India. Officially, the monsoon ends on September 30, 2009 and it is possible that September will witness heavy rain at some places, leading to floods and damage to crops. For agriculture, what matters is not total rainfall but its distribution. In an era of climate change India, which is home to nearly 20 per cent of the world’s poor, must start planning for cyclical droughts and floods long before they occur. It is crucial to formulate these plans on the understanding that such crises hit the poor, especially agricultural labourers and land-poor peasants, the socially underprivileged sections, and women the hardest. Women are badly affected because they do not have equal access to non-farm employment opportunities and are forced to take up jobs involving high drudgery but low wages. The first priority for the National Crisis Management Committee chaired by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee will be to ensure that the drought relief and rehabilitation programmes are pro-poor, pro-socially-underprivileged, and pro-women.
There have already been symptoms of extreme distress and despair in the drought-affected areas. Suicides by farmers are increasing, leading to greater hardship to widows and children. The distress sale of cattle has begun in Andhra Pradesh and Vidharbha in Maharashtra. This is unfortunate since livestock and livelihoods are closely inter-related in most parts of the country, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. The burden of usury is one of the worst aspects of the life of a small and marginal farmer. Agriculture is a life-giving profession and it is tragic that those who help to feed the country are pushed into taking their own lives.
The Pranab Mukherjee committee will of course be looking at short-term, urgent solutions. Effective price control measures must be thought through and put in place. Access to the public distribution system must be made universal, with an enlarged food security basket being provided under the PDS. There must be large-scale provision of employment in the drought-hit areas, with the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme expanded to provide 100 days of work at minimum wages to every working member of a rural household (instead of 100 days of work for the household). But what the committee must also do is to convert the present challenge into an opportunity to fast-track institutional and policy changes that will help insulate the country from serious losses of crops and livelihoods under similar conditions in future. Some of the important steps that need to be taken immediately have been indicated in M. S. Swaminathan’s articles published in this newspaper. They include the launch of a ‘Pond in Every Farm’ movement with the help of NREGS workers; the organisation of Farm Animal Camps near sources of water; a ‘Beyond the Drought’ programme involving the planting of short-duration crops; and a compensatory production programme in areas with adequate soil moisture. The Crisis Management Committee must also plan for short- and medium-term programmes such as the organisation of a ‘Weather Information for All’ scheme based on village level agro-met stations.
Hereafter, the mode of tackling drought and flood must be proactive. This calls for the preparation of drought, flood, and good weather codes designed to reduce the adverse impact of unfavourable weather and maximise the benefits of a good monsoon. Such anticipatory measures will include the building of seed stocks for implementing contingency plans, and water and energy security systems. An important factor behind the relative stability of the prices of wheat and rice is the build-up of substantial grain reserves, which now exceed 50 million tonnes. The government has been wise not to export these grains despite pressure from traders. It is unfortunate that four decades after the beginning of the green revolution, the country has failed to develop modern grain storage structures on a large scale. Professor Swaminathan’s suggestion that the government set up ultra-modern grain storage facilities at 50 locations in the country, with each storage structure capable of handling one million tonnes of wheat or rice, must be implemented without further delay.
In the midst of drought-related crisis management, the challenge of dealing with the impact of climate change on Indian agriculture and rural livelihoods ought not to be ignored. Agreement was reached at the recent G8 Summit held at L’Aquila, Italy that a temperature rise of 2{+0} C over the pre-industrial period cannot be avoided. Even to contain the rise to 2{+0} C, greenhouse gas emissions will have to be reduced by about 40 per cent by 2020. But steps to achieve this goal are nowhere in sight. A 2{+0} C increase in mean temperature will have serious implications for India’s food security system, since the yield of crops like wheat and rice will be reduced. Here again proactive measures must be developed by breeding and selecting crops and crop varieties that can withstand higher temperatures. The initiative of the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation for building genetic resources for a warming India is timely and important. It is these kinds of short- and long-term changes that the Crisis Management Committee must initiate in the context of extreme destitution in rural India, which has serious social and political implications.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Drought-and-crisis-management/article16875462.ece
19,8,2009,Dealing with Vasundhara Raje,"The last thing the Bharatiya Janata Party needed, in the wake of bitter factional quarrels at party headquarters, was for a State satrap to raise the banner of revolt. In the event, Vasundhara Raje’s conciliatory message must come as a relief to the leadership. The former Rajasthan Chief Minister signalled she would fall in line just when the rebellion, triggered by the party’s decision to remove her from the post of leader of the BJP’s legislature wing, appeared to be gathering strength. Ms Raje had taken the central leadership head on, insisting that she had majority support in the party — a claim seemingly buttressed by the legislative hordes descending on Delhi. It did not help the BJP central leadership that the unedifying spectacle was captured live by television channels hungry for more delicious news of trouble within the Hindutva ‘party with a difference.’ The leadership’s logic rested on the fact that Ms Raje had led the Rajasthan unit to two successive defeats: in November 2008, the BJP narrowly lost the Assembly election to the Congress, and in the 15th general election, held six months later, it could win only four of 25 Lok Sabha seats. The leadership also cited the precedent of B.C. Khanduri who resigned as Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, accepting responsibility for the loss of all four Lok Sabha seats from the hill State.
Ms Raje’s counterpoint was that in a democracy the choice of who leads the legislature party must be left to the legislators themselves. So why did the former Chief Minister back off? The aggression she displayed over three days suggests that the retreat may well be a tactical ploy. She evidently calculates that before long she will be back in favour. In any event, there are far too many examples of BJP rebels coming to grief. Uma Bharti and Kalyan Singh were larger-than-life figures when they left the party to strike out on their own. Ms Bharti now runs a rag-tag outfit while Mr. Kalyan Singh is a shadow of his former self. Unfortunately for the BJP, there are too many fires raging in its backyard for it to draw any satisfaction from the seeming conclusion of this episode. Many saffronites, including Ms Raje’s supporters, have questioned the double standards of a party that punished her even as it rewarded those assigned key responsibilities in the general election. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has added to the pressure by continuing to meddle in the affairs of the party. To be fair, the BJP put up an impressive performance in the first budget session of the 15th Lok Sabha. However, with so much weighing on its mind, it is a worried party leadership that will head out to Shimla later this week for yet another Chintan Bhaitak. And Jaswant Singh’s Jinnah and Partition-revisionism may be waiting for it there.

A sentence in the first paragraph of “Dealing with Vasundhara Raje” (Editorial, August 19, 2009) was “The leadership also cited the precedent of B.C. Khanduri who resigned as Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, accepting responsibility for the loss of all four Lok Sabha seats from the hill State.” It should have been “five Lok Sabha seats” .",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Dealing-with-Vasundhara-Raje/article16881520.ece
19,8,2009,Still a mixed picture,"The data on industrial production released recently give room for optimism that the worst is over on the industrial front, though a cloud of uncertainty remains over the economy as a whole. The industrial production index (IIP) recorded an increase of 7.8 per cent in June, the highest in 16 months, and it has come on top of a 5.44 per cent rise in June 2008. It is no statistical illusion resulting from the “base effect,” and the impressive June performance has been reasonably consistent. In May, the IIP rose by 2.22 per cent on a year-on-year basis. The index touched its lowest level in December 2008, when it turned negative by 0.25 per cent. It remained very low for the next four months, dropping below one per cent in two of them. No less significant about the June data is that all three major components of the IIP contributed to the growth. The manufacturing index went up by 7.27 per cent, electricity by 7.97 per cent, and, above all, mining recorded 15.43 per cent growth. The IIP growth for the first quarter of the current year worked out to 3.74 per cent. This may not yet portend a robust recovery, but it seems likely that, having hit the rock bottom, industrial production is heading upward.
There are however certain contradictory trends that cloud the macroeconomic picture. An analysis of the “use-based” data of the June IIP figures shows that capital goods production was up 11.75 per cent, suggesting renewed investment activity. However, further corroboration is needed. Given the loss of business confidence during the low point of recession last year, it is likely that businessmen are now pushing the investment plans they had put on hold. The consumer goods segment, which has grown by 15.5 per cent, has no doubt benefited from the stimulus packages and the higher salary incomes in the hands of government servants. At a time when industrial activity looks upbeat, there are definite indications that the GDP growth target for 2009-10 will be scaled down to below 6 per cent. The drought in many parts of the country will result in substantially lower rural incomes, which in turn will have an adverse impact on consumer spending. Higher food prices will further strain household budgets and, at the macro level, aggravate food inflation. One needs to be cautious and desist from reading too much into the seemingly robust signs of industrial recovery as indicated by one month’s IIP figures.
Clarification
The formal expansion of IIP is Index of Industrial Production. Though not an error, “Still a mixed picture” (Editorial, August 19, 2009) gave it as industrial production index.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Still-a-mixed-picture/article16881521.ece
20,8,2009,"Caught Jaswant, bowled Jinnah","The Bharatiya Janata Party’s reputation for obscurantism and dogmatic intolerance received an unexpected boost in Shimla on Wednesday. The summary expulsion of the veteran Jaswant Singh for coming out with a positive re-appraisal of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, and what can at most be characterised as Partition-revisionism has not just upstaged the post-election ‘chintan baitak.’ It is a blow to the BJP’s moral credibility, an advertisement of its political desperation. What is plain is that the overwhelming majority of the parliamentary board that took the decision to expel Mr. Singh has not read his recently launched book, Jinnah: India-Partition-Independence (Rupa & Co., New Delhi, 2009, 669 pages) — or perhaps ever will. It is true that there is a considerable scholarly literature on Jinnah, with Ayesha Jalal’s The Sole Spokesman: Jinnah, the Muslim League and the Demand for Pakistan (Cambridge University Press, 1994) standing out as a particularly fine work of incisive historical scholarship. Mr. Singh does not claim to be a scholar, on the contrary. He begins his book by noting that, returning from a visit to the Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore in 1999, he was “struck by the thought there existed no biography of Jinnah written by a political figure from India.” It took him five years, beginning 2004, to fill that gap.
It is for historians to evaluate the scholarly merit of Mr. Singh’s work. But who is to say that a political figure, especially when he or she is out of power, ought not to dabble in such sensitive areas? Did not the redoubtable Lal Krishna Advani himself publicly commend, in 2005, the “secular” vision embedded in Jinnah’s presidential address of August 11, 1947 to the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan? Actually, Mr. Singh’s Jinnah is an impressive, personally attractive, intellectually brilliant, freedom-loving, politically iron-willed, tactically unstoppable figure. His flaws were major and incalculably tragic: Mr. Singh opines that both he and Mahatma Gandhi failed in the end to realise their ideals. But the flaws of the ‘sole spokesman’ arose out of the objective situation of pre-Partition India and others, especially Jawaharlal Nehru and the Congress, were complicit in the tragedy of Partition — which in the author’s view is “the defining event of the twentieth century for this entire subcontinent.” You may agree or disagree with Mr. Jaswant Singh’s Jinnah-appraisal and his allocation of responsibility for Partition — and indeed for what he sees as the challenge for millions of “alienated” Muslims in post-Partition India. But his book is certainly an interesting read — made more interesting and saleable surely by the BJP’s crude display of bigotry.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Caught-Jaswant-bowled-Jinnah/article16875773.ece
20,8,2009,How much faster can man run?,"The intriguing question has been around for a very long time. Last Sunday Jamaican Usain Bolt touched (according to an official biomechanical analysis) a peak speed of 44.172 km an hour at 65.03 metres in the 100 metres sprint at the World Athletics Championships in Berlin. Is this supremely gifted athlete the fastest human who ever walked the earth? Is he for real? Some believe Bolt’s 9.58 seconds might be 20 years ahead of scientific predictions in taking the biggest slice — a whopping 0.11s — off the 100m record since the advent of automatic timing in 1968. This has naturally led to questions and speculations about the ‘ultimate’ man can run. “I think it will stop at 9.4 but you never know,” said Bolt after his magical sprint. A 1998 study forecast an eventual men’s record of 9.37s; another done in July 2009 pegged it at 9.51s. If Bolt was guilty of relaxing through the last 20 metres of the Olympics 100m final in Beijing where he clocked 9.69s — forcing biomechanics experts to review their studies and projections — he ran through the line in Berlin.
It is now well established that Bolt’s deceleration rate is much lower than that of his peers. This helps him maintain his speed past 60m or 70m when sprinters normally start slowing down. Then there is the giant stride that gives him a decisive edge over shorter rivals. All sprinters know that height is a handicap at the start but Bolt has started defying even this bit of conventional wisdom. In Berlin, his 6’5” frame took only 0.146s to react to the gun in comparison with the 0.144s for Tyson Gay, the American who finished second, and 0.134s for his team-mate Asafa Powell, who took the bronze. Bolt took just 33 strides to hit the finish for the new world record against the 41 he needed in Beijing. His name might have been unfamiliar to a majority of sports fans before he first made the headlines in New York last year with a world record 9.72s. But the exciting potential was evident as early as 2002 when Bolt took the 200 metres gold in the world junior championships and then the silver in the 2007 world championships. Not until 2008 did this unspoilt genius make a serious foray into the 100 metres. Since then, he has turned sprinting theory on its head, winning an Olympic treble, all in world record times. He evokes awe, admiration, and envy from former greats and rivals alike. Lightning Bolt now owns three of the top four 100m timings in history, but he doesn’t know how fast he can run. The world perhaps is yet to see the best from this Jamaican grocer’s son who will turn 23 on August 21.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/How-much-faster-can-man-run/article16875774.ece
21,8,2009,VVIPs and security procedures,"How can a rigorous security procedure that is acceptable for Al Gore and Edward Kennedy qualify as an ‘insult’ for Shah Rukh Khan? The song and dance made in India over the Bollywood hero being held up for questioning at Newark airport in the United States is an insult to our collective intelligence. From fans of Shah Rukh Khan (who burnt American flags) to Union Ministers (one of whom declared it to be ‘unacceptable’ and promised to take it up with the U.S. government while another threatened tit-for-tat), the reaction has been irrational. After initially expressing anger and humiliation over having to go through a ‘secondary inspection’ for a little over an hour (which incidentally would have been shorter had his luggage not been misplaced), Mr. Khan has wisely brushed the incident off as “no big deal.” But the reactions at home do signal a mindset that is obsessed with VIP culture and the absurd notion that putting one of these worthies through a security procedure is a slight to our national honour. Recall the fuss made in India when ex-President Abdul Kalam was frisked before boarding an international flight? Following an uproar in Parliament that cut across party lines, the U.S. airline was coerced into issuing an ‘apology’ notwithstanding the fact it was following standard procedure applicable, incidentally, to American ex-heads of state. While Mr. Kalam, to his credit, refrained from making any complaint, he would have done even better had he firmly told his excitable compatriots that a routine security check was neither an ‘unpardonable act’ nor ‘a matter for national shame.’
Two years ago, a Minister of State for External Affairs had a spat with security personnel at Delhi’s international airport over a routine security check and for being denied access to the ceremonial lounge, which was available only to some categories of VIPs. The central government’s response? Dispense with security checks and extend the use of the lounge to Ministers of State. VIP privileges in India are increasingly becoming a way of flaunting status. Gradually, the police and the security system have become subordinate to a VIP culture that thrives on cutting corners. These Very Inconvenient Persons routinely jump queues, hold up plane departures, delay trains, skirt security measures, and drive rashly in proliferating red beacon cars. Fortunately, as several letters published in this newspaper indicate, the Indian public tends to apply robust common sense to disapprove of such VIP behaviour at home. So what is the sense of protesting when a foreign country or airline puts them through a security drill, as the law, rules, or standard procedure require them to do?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/VVIPs-and-security-procedures/article16875954.ece
21,8,2009,Changing profile of banking,"The recent data on deposits and credit of scheduled commercial banks published by the Reserve Bank of India provide valuable insights into the distribution of banking business across the country. As on March 31, 2009, the number of banked centres served by scheduled commercial banks stood at 34,636. A very large number of them — over 28,000 — were single office centres, mostly in rural and semi-urban areas. At the other extreme, there were 61 centres having 100 or more bank branches. The concentration of bank branches in a few urban and metro centres is by no means a new development. But for the unprecedented branch network expansion that followed the nationalisation of large banks in 1969, the concentration would have been even more pronounced. In the reform era beginning the early 1990s, the emphasis shifted in favour of consolidation. With considerations of profitability dictating the strategic plans, branch expansion, especially to rural areas, was no longer a priority. Instead, banks tended to converge on centres that had business potential. According to the RBI, the top hundred centres, arranged according to the size of deposits, accounted for 69.2 per cent of the total deposits, while the top hundred ranked according to the size of credit accounted for 78.5 per cent of total bank credit as on March 31 this year.
The skewed pattern of distribution obviously meant heightened competition in certain centres while in a much larger number of places, including those with no banks at all, the urgent task has been to extend the range of financial services. Among the banks, non-price competition has become the norm. Technology has been harnessed in a variety of ways to take on competition and, more importantly, to reduce transaction costs. It has enabled the opening of new delivery channels such as internet banking and mobile banking. But its role in extending financial services across the country has not been fully appreciated. Quite obviously the goal of inclusive banking has to be achieved in a context where the traditional model of branch banking cannot be entirely relied upon. Technological applications are already enabling business correspondents and others to deliver many types of services now offered by a bank. However, over the medium-term it is highly unlikely that the traditional bank model will lose its relevance, even in rural areas. In fact, these bank branches might be called upon to undertake newer services, including those having a development dimension such as delivery of subsidies and conditional cash transfers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Changing-profile-of-banking/article16875953.ece
22,8,2009,There’s always opposition space,"No matter who the opposition is, there is always space for it. Although the boycott by Tamil Nadu’s principal opposition party — the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam — made the by-election outcome in five Assembly constituencies a foregone conclusion, some of the vacated opposition space was taken up by the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam led by actor Vijayakanth. The DMDK candidates, including the independent, who was supported by the party, won 22 per cent of the total votes polled across the five constituencies. This is an increase of more than 13 percentage points over what the party bagged in the 2006 general election. While the DMDK will quite likely lose these votes to the AIADMK in a three-cornered fight, the by-elections have shown that the party is a serious player and perhaps even a game-changer. The ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam won three of the constituencies and its ally, the Congress, the remaining two. But from the start, the interest in these by-elections was not about who would win, but about what proportion of the vote the runner-up would get. While it has cause to cheer, there is little doubt that the DMDK gained more from the weaknesses of the ruling party than from its own strengths. While the DMK and the Congress can draw comfort from the verdict, there are some hard lessons for the AIADMK and its principal allies. Despite the boycott, 67 per cent of the voters turned up to vote. Quite clearly, the people did not think that boycott was a way of redressing the grievances against the Election Commission: the failure to check “abuse of power” by the ruling party and the use of Electronic Voting Machines that are allegedly not tamper-proof.
In Karnataka, which also saw by-elections to five Assembly constituencies, the contests were close. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the Janata Dal(Secular) won two seats each, and the Congress one. For the BJP, the seats lost were more important than the seats won. In Govindarajanagar and Channapatna the by-elections were caused by ‘Operation Kamala,’ which involved getting opposition MLAs to resign and then contest on the BJP ticket. And in both these constituencies, the party candidates lost. ‘Operation Kamala’ succeeded in the initial phase, when the BJP was short of a majority of its own and had to depend on the support of independents. However, continued efforts at engineering defections and fielding defectors in the same constituencies have evidently not gone down well with the people. Now that he enjoys a comfortable majority, Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa must concentrate on the tasks of development and governance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Therersquos-always-opposition-space/article16876111.ece
22,8,2009,The burden of injustice,"It is a shocking reflection on the flaws in our criminal justice system that less than one out of three people lodged in Indian jails is a convict. The vast majority of the prison population, as many as about 2.5 lakhs or 70 per cent, is made up of undertrials awaiting justice. As Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told the conference of Chief Ministers and Chief Justices, many of them have been in jail “for periods longer than they would have served had they been sentenced.” The Law Commission of India’s 78th report on the “Congestion of undertrial prisoners in jail,” submitted in 1979, also has a topical feel about it. The situation today is not unlike what it was then — people languish in jail for the want of resources to seek bail, for the lack of proper legal aid, and the hopelessly sluggish pace at which the judicial system moves. Coupled with this is the presence of a police force that seems less interested in securing convictions than in making summary arrests, effectively using custody as a form of preventive detention. If the problem of undertrials has proved so intractable, it is because it is a manifestation of fundamental and deep-rooted flaws in the criminal justice system.
The immediate task is to identify those who are eligible for bail and ensure their release. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act 2005, those accused of offences for which the death penalty is not prescribed are entitled to be released if they have been in detention for more than half the stipulated period of imprisonment. Also, the majority of the undertrial population is behind bars for petty offences and, by the Centre’s admission, “is under lock up in the absence of trial.” Chief judicial magistrates have been asked by Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan to identify such cases and it is imperative that this exercise is carried out expeditiously so that these undertrials can be released on personal bonds. A more serious look at plea bargaining, introduced by the 2005 amendment for cases where the sentence is less than seven years, is called for. This could benefit many undertrials languishing in jails. However, such immediate measures can address only a part of the problem. The fact that there is such a vast population of undertrials is closely linked to a larger issue — that of the lethargic pace of the criminal justice system, reflected in the world’s biggest backlog of pending cases. Dr. Manmohan Singh hit the nail on the head when he urged that “the expeditious elimination of this scourge… should constitute the highest priority for all of us.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-burden-of-injustice/article16876112.ece
24,8,2009,Gritty team effort,"England’s triumph in the Ashes is remarkable for how unremarkable it seems when stripped of the bells and whistles. In contrast to the series of 2005, which was a battle rich in quality between two formidable sides, this was a modest affair. What is clear is that Australia — deposed from the top spot for the first time since the current ICC rankings were introduced in 2003 — has descended from its lofty heights. England hasn’t had pretensions of being a world-beating team for a while now. What was expected to be a hard-fought contest between two good sides turned out to be just that. England won 2-1 because, as a team, it handled the defining passages of play better —traditionally an Aussie strength. The series statistics speak for themselves: six of the seven leading run-scorers and the three top wicket-takers were Australian, but England’s sum was greater than its parts. Crucially, the home team managed to do just enough when needed. Andrew Strauss, the England captain, put this felicitously: “When we were bad, we were very, very bad. When we were good, we were good enough.” The understated Strauss deserves high praise. England appeared fractured from within after the men in charge, Kevin Pietersen and Peter Moores, fell out. Strauss and Andy Flower, the new coach, began the process of resurrection, which, despite the victory over Australia, has been anything but straightforward.
Strauss has undergone a resurrection himself. He rediscovered his batting after a wretched 2007. It was his calm solidity at the top of the order that enabled England to set the agenda: in three out of five Tests, it gained the first-innings lead. Australian teams have a fondness for attacking the opposition’s leader, thus debilitating the side; Strauss not merely withstood Australia, he emboldened England with his grace under fire. His counterpart, Ricky Ponting, had a difficult series. Australia has been in transition since the retirements of Glenn McGrath, Shane Warne, Justin Langer, Adam Gilchrist and, more recently, Matthew Hayden. It has required all of Ponting’s considerable powers to handle the transition. While his batting has often stepped up, his leadership has been no more than adequate. A captain is believed to be only as good as his team. The great captains, however, get their sides to play above themselves, and Ponting hasn’t shown this quality. Acceptance that it is no longer alone at the top, but one among four or five closely matched teams, will help the transition. For Australia has appeared in denial at times. England, on the other hand, has much to be pleased with — not least the arrival of a genuine talent in Jonathan Trott. But the country bids farewell to the talismanic Andrew Flinotff. Perhaps the gifted all-rounder’s departure will introduce just the note of sobriety needed at a time when men are apt to lose their heads.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Gritty-team-effort/article16876490.ece
24,8,2009,Welcome developments,"The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, or North Korea, and the Republic of Korea, or South Korea, have recently taken significant steps towards the reduction of mutual tensions and differences. On August 17, North Korea announced it would relax border controls for South Korean business visitors and facilitate family reunions. The second move covers 10 million people affected by the partition of Korea, which in 1953 ended the Korean War. Reunions are to occur at the eastern coast site of Mount Kumgang during the three-day Harvest Festival, when Koreans traditionally visit their home towns; this year’s festival starts on October 3. Tourist groups, consisting mainly of South Koreans, are also to be allowed to visit the historic city of Kaesong on the western coast — starting, according to North Korea, as soon as possible. These developments end the embargo on cross-border visits, which began when a South Korean tourist visiting Kumgang was shot by a North Korean border guard in 2007, in an incident very differently described by the two sides.
All the recent moves indicate a mutual willingness to strengthen substantive links. They serve as reminders that what external observers tend to see as bellicose talk by North Korea is often an understandable response to events elsewhere. The North Korean government is said to have been bitterly hurt by President George W. Bush’s 2002 comment that it was part of an ‘axis of evil.’ As a result, the annual six-party talks hosted in Beijing and involving North Korea, the United States, China, Russia, Japan, and South Korea have produced little of substance. In addition, North Korea expelled all nuclear inspectors following the U.N. Security Council’s condemnation of its failed satellite launch in April 2009. It has also threatened to leave the six-party group permanently. Pyongyang came up with an angry response to the current round of the annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises, only this time a North Korean spokesperson has called the response a routine denunciation. Relations between the two Koreas have been inconsistent and variable for more than half a century. They are likely to remain unsettled until a permanent peace treaty replaces the armistice that concluded the war. The hope is that the positive steps taken recently by the two states will constitute a decisive advance towards such a treaty.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Welcome-developments/article16876491.ece
25,8,2009,BJP’s deepening crisis,"It was in deep crisis mode that the Bharatiya Janata Party went to Shimla last week. There were so many problems plaguing the party that the Chintan (thought) Baithak might have been more appropriately called a Chinta (worry) Baithak. Consider the line-up of miseries: Vasundhara Raje’s rebellion, the Jaswant Singh expulsion fiasco, and more vexingly, the virtual quit notice issued to the party’s leadership quartet — Lal Krishna Advani, Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, and Sushma Swaraj — by the Rashtriya Swayam Sevaksangh supremo, Mohan Bhagwat. Then came Arun Shourie’s ‘Alice in Blunderland’ literary fireworks, call for ‘bombard[ing] the headquarters,’ and appeal to the RSS to take over the party, which sounded very much like a cry for extreme unction. The BJP will no doubt adopt the posture that individuals are wholly dispensable, yet its leadership must ask itself whether its conduct has not been spectacularly akratic — especially after the 2009 general election debacle.
To the consternation of its cadre, the party rewarded central campaign managers with key posts while punishing defeated State leaders. Mr. Rajnath Singh refused to acknowledge that the Shimla meet discussed a critical internal report, which he claimed did not even exist. The needless obfuscation and the rumours it fuelled gave the Shimla proceedings a cloak-and-dagger air, causing further damage to a party that once boasted of openness and inner-party democracy in contrast to the dynastically led Congress. The RSS of course has acted in character: declining Mr. Shourie’s invitation to take over the BJP, and insisting it had no role to play in the party’s internal affairs. But who can forget that Mr. Jaswant Singh was ordered out of the 1998 Cabinet by a midnight decision of the Sangh, which later oversaw Mr. Advani’s resignation from the party chief’s post and his subsequent elevation as shadow Prime Minister? Mr. Bhagwat has gone further down this road, suggesting that the BJP’s leadership quartet should vacate its posts in favour of candidates made available by the Sangh. Lest the ideological overlord’s message should escape the party, Mr. Bhagwat let it be known that he has an army of 70 loyalists to choose from. Clearly, the day of reckoning cannot be far away: the BJP must either take the Sangh bull by the horn or drift along without hope of political advancement, making a Jhandewalan takeover a fait accompli. India needs a strong and credible opposition at the national level. As matters stand, unnerved by defeat, a mentally and morally confused BJP is caught between its ‘core’ and a hard, indefinable place — a trap from which escape seems way beyond the capabilities of its present leadership.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/BJPrsquos-deepening-crisis/article16876725.ece
25,8,2009,The path to recovery,"Since the current global recession is fundamentally different from run-of-the-mill recessions, the turnaround will not be simple. Nor will it be easy this time to fix supply and demand side problems of the global economy. Conventional approaches such as easy monetary policy and exchange rate depreciation will have to be used in conjunction with other policy measures for an extended period. In its latest report, the International Monetary Fund, which from the beginning has been less pessimistic than the World Bank and other global institutions, says that although the recovery has started, sustaining it will require “delicate rebalancing” acts both within and across countries. On the supply side, financial intermediation — the allocation of resources that is central to growth — will be impaired in many developed countries. Their financial systems have been rendered partly dysfunctional. In emerging economies, capital flows that have decreased sharply may not revive fully in the next few years. On the demand side, even though the global economy will very likely resume its trend growth rate, the growth will not be strong enough to reduce unemployment at least in the near-term. Besides, all recovery forecasts are predicated on a combination of fiscal stimulus and inventory restocking by firms rather than on strong private consumption and spending on fixed investments.
Sooner or later, fiscal stimulus will have to be phased out and inventory adjustment will come to an end. Global recovery can be sustained by two rebalancing acts. First, there has to be a shift from public to private spending. Secondly, aggregate demand across countries needs to be rebalanced, with a shift from domestic to foreign demand in the United States and a reverse shift from foreign to domestic demand in the rest of the world, especially Asia. In many countries, including India, there is a realisation that fiscal stimulus, and along with it high fiscal deficits, cannot continue indefinitely. The U.S. was not only at the centre of the crisis but is also central to world recovery. For recovery to take place, its net exports must increase, thereby reducing the current account deficit. That would automatically mean that several Asian countries led by China decrease their surpluses by, for instance, buying more from the U.S. However, the outlook, both economic and political, is beset with uncertainties. The rebalancing as visualised may not take place easily. Looking to the immediate future, there ought to be a reasonable degree of coordination among countries to sustain the nascent recovery.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-path-to-recovery/article16877169.ece
26,8,2009,Doing the right thing,"It is a matter of satisfaction that the pressure of democratic public opinion has made the highest court in the land do the right thing: decide, 'in principle,' to disclose the assets of Supreme Court judges on the court's official website. The opposition within sections of the higher judiciary to mandatory public disclosure of judges' assets – a measure to promote judicial transparency and check judicial corruption – threatened to weaken public confidence in the judicial system. Although Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan declared that High Court judges were free voluntarily to declare their assets and that a consensus on the issue was being evolved in the Supreme Court, his reservations about mandatory public disclosure were hardly a secret. Even something as innocuous as a Central Information Commission order asking whether Supreme Court and High Court judges were declaring their assets to their Chief Justices in accordance with the judicial code of conduct was stonewalled. The Supreme Court took the unprecedented step of challenging the CIC's order in the Delhi High Court. It was such resistance to assets disclosure that led the central government to introduce the Judges (Declaration of Assets and Liabilities) Bill in Parliament with a self-defeating clause. Fortunately, politicians cutting across party lines forced the Bill's withdrawal after objecting to Clause 6, which stated that any declaration by a judge to his or her Chief Justice would not be public and that no judge would be subject to “any query or inquiry” in relation to its contents. Is a Bill necessary now? The answer is yes because what the Supreme Court judges have decided on is voluntary public disclosure of assets. If some members of the higher judiciary hold out, what can be the remedy other than a uniform law?
Mandatory public disclosure of judges' assets is not a radical idea. In the United States, the Ethics in Government Act 1978 makes it mandatory for certain classes of federal officials — including federal judges — to make public financial disclosures. The Act reformed a disclosure system for federal officials that used to be based on internal reporting within each agency or department. Many other countries, including Sri Lanka, require judges to make periodic declarations of their assets. Two High Court judges have already made voluntary disclosures, one of them in response to a letter urging such disclosure by the Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Judicial Reform, a public-spirited organisation that has done sustained work on such issues. Many judges who have nothing to hide evidently feel inhibited by the absence of a framework that mandates the accurate and public disclosure of assets. The judiciary that endorsed the Election Commission's bid to introduce transparency and accountability and mandate the public declaration of assets of candidates to elected office cannot apply a different standard to its own functioning. Now that the Supreme Court judges have decided to do the wise thing, High Court judges must waste no time in following their lead.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Doing-the-right-thing/article16877078.ece
26,8,2009,The spectre of agricolonialism,"As global populations and food prices rise and environmental degradation intensifies, transnational corporations and some governments are buying up vast tracts of farmland where it is still available — in parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Investors, frightened by the financial catastrophes they themselves helped cause, see sure profits in this. According to the International Food Policy Research Institute, between 37 and 49 million acres in poor countries have been sold or have been under negotiation for foreign purchase since 2006. Often only the head of the selling state knows the actual extent. But it is public knowledge that Sudan has leased 1.5 million hectares of farmland to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States, Egypt, and South Korea for 99 years; that Egypt plans to use 840,000 hectares in Uganda for wheat and corn; and that the Democratic Republic of Congo has offered to lease 10 million hectares to South African firms.
Investors' claims that they will increase productivity in regions noted for mass hunger are undermined by the fact that much of the land leased or sold is used for biofuel crops, or for foodgrains that are directly exported to the leasing countries or to new owners. On Kenya's Yala River, successful farmers are at risk of being driven off their land because the American corporation, Dominion Farms, has built a dam upstream. Local farmers complain of flooding of their crops and worse and Dominion denies the allegations. Agricolonialism often gets a foothold where the leasing or selling state is weak or corrupt and has failed to implement land reform and improve agriculture. Some resistance is occurring, particularly in Asia. Protests have halted Chinese plans to use three million acres of Philippine land. In Madagascar a proposed 99-year deal with South Korea contributed to the overthrow of President Marc Ravalomanana earlier this year. Pakistan has announced that 100,000 of its own security forces will guard foreign-owned land. With the G-8 unable to agree on a code of practice over agricolonialism, the world could be watching the birth of a global version of the East India Company",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-spectre-of-agricolonialism/article16625453.ece
27,8,2009,Trade policy in difficult times,"The new Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) for the period 2009-14 unveiled by Commerce Minister Anand Sharma on Thursday aims at continuing the thrust of the previous FTP. The new policy is, however, realistic enough to admit that the goals set five years ago remain out of reach. The global recession has caused a sharp contraction in demand in India’s principal markets. The WTO and the IMF expect world trade in volume terms to contract by between 9 per cent and 11 per cent during 2009. In 2004, the FTP had set an ambitious target of doubling India’s share in world trade in five years. That has now been postponed to the year 2020. Given the continuing uncertainties in the world economy, the Commerce Minister has fixed short-term targets. He expects exports to touch $200 billion by 2011 when the five-year FTP will be reviewed. For 2009-10, the export target has been fixed at $168 billion, the level touched last year. The other major objective of generating economic growth and employment remains valid, although in the near term the key task is to arrest and reverse the declining trend in exports. While promising a special thrust to the employment-oriented sectors that have suffered job losses — especially textiles, leather, and handicrafts — the FTP is short on specific measures. Reducing transaction costs, improving infrastructure, and lowering the cost of export credit are key areas that depend on the performance of other ministries.
Exports have been contracting for 10 months in a row. Although the proportion of trade in India’s GDP is not large, the global recession has taken a toll on the external sector. One area of concern the FTP has not highlighted is the fall in imports in tandem with exports. In July, imports fell by about 36 per cent, continuing a decline that started six months ago. Lower non-oil imports indicate a slowdown in the domestic investment. Lower imports have narrowed the merchandise trade deficit in the balance of payments, an outcome that would be favourable had it been achieved through robust export performance. The FTP has extended the tax holiday for export units by one year and the duty refund scheme up to December 2010, besides enhancing the assistance for developing new markets. One other worry relates to growing protectionism abroad, especially in the developed countries. India which has recently concluded trade agreements with South Korea and Asean hopes to play a major role in restarting the Doha development round of talks. Some of India’s export promotion schemes such as the Duty Entitlement Pass Book Scheme are not compatible with the WTO rules and need to be taken up for review.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Trade-policy-in-difficult-times/article16877373.ece
27,8,2009,Responsible property investment,"The building sector has a big responsibility and role to play in combating global warming. In 2007, a United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report estimated that this sector, when it adopts suitable measures, can help reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 30 per cent to 40 per cent. In absolute terms, this amounts to a reduction of two billion tonnes of CO2 emissions during the Kyoto Protocol period. The UNEP has recently come with a tool kit to implement Responsible Property Investment (RPI), an innovative way to finance sustainable practices. The RPI urges corporate investors and fund and asset managers to factor in positive social and environmental attributes of a project in their decision to buy a property or finance construction. Financial performance alone is not adequate to assess a property. Existing regulatory practices and incentives, such as Certified Emission Reduction, focus on builders and the supply side of sustainable buildings, leaving out the buyers. The RPI initiative fills this crucial gap. Genuine changes in the way the multi-trillion-dollar global property industry invests will have a far-reaching environmental impact.
It also pays to be a responsible investor. Studies show that environmentally responsive buildings deliver ‘lower operating expenses and higher net operating incomes.’ A survey done in 2007 revealed that 80 per cent of corporate real estate professionals in the developed countries were willing to pay at least one per cent more rent for sustainable spaces. Against this background, what is clear is that the Indian property sector can do much more for the environment. Right now, it mostly responds to mandatory codes, which are weak and slow in coming. The delay in implementing the Energy Conservation Building Code is a case in point. A lackadaisical approach in adopting such good practices is not only detrimental to the environment; it also hurts a sector that attracts about Rs.20,000 crore (2008-09) in foreign direct investment. Much like the way consumers turn down products that exploit child labour and other unacceptable practices, the RPI initiative will soon compel investors to turn away from properties that are built to dubious environmental standards. In fact, this initiative goes beyond the environment to address issues such as fair labour practices and legal compliance. The Indian property sector must proactively adopt such progressive initiatives, voluntarily disclose its social and environmental performance, and stay in tune with changing investment norms and practices.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Responsible-property-investment/article16877522.ece
28,8,2009,Japan wants change,"Japan’s general election, to be held on August 30, a month earlier than the end of the parliamentary term, will take place amid unprecedented public interest. It is widely believed that Prime Minister Taro Aso called the election to forestall a leadership challenge in his own graft-prone Liberal Democrat Party (LDP), which has ruled for all but 11 months of the last 53 years. The Japanese economy, the world’s second largest, has been badly hit by low demand for its manufactured exports; the budget deficit has risen sharply; and scandals have surfaced over the pension system. What is more, Mr. Aso is regarded as indecisive. In late June, the Tokyo Prefecture elections brought the LDP a huge defeat; it lost the prefecture for the first time in 40 years. All the indicators point to a landslide win for the main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), led by Yukio Hatoyama. In the opinion polls, the DPJ leads 41 to 24 per cent and, despite its own funding scandals, is expected to win 300 out of 480 seats in the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of the Diet. The Japanese Communist Party could also gain significantly.
Sweeping changes are certainly portended. The DPJ says that it will abolish the practice of seshu, whereby political candidatures are handed down within families. It has promised to substantially devolve the highly centralised Constitution, elements of which date back to the Meiji restoration in 1868. Interestingly, Mr. Hatoyama has drawn upon the writings of the Austrian aristocrat and European integrationist, Count Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, who had a Japanese ancestor himself, to propose a single East Asian currency and greater regional integration among East Asian states. The internal devolution could enable citizens to participate much more meaningfully at local levels. The East Asian project, for its part, is founded on the idea of yuai or fraternity. But it could face problems as Japan and China are far from the kind of post-war Franco-German rapprochement that led to the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951. As to the DPJ’s economic policy, it is not clear how spending pledges, such as enhanced child-care for a declining younger fraction of the population, will be funded. Mr. Hatoyama’s political skills will be in for a stern test during recessionary times. But the public desire for significant change is undeniable, and one of the most encouraging things about this election is a surge of interest among younger voters. Japan seems to be on the point of creating a very different future for itself.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Japan-wants-change/article16877576.ece
28,8,2009,Challenge of food inflation,"The government’s concerns over high food prices are reflected in a number of recent policy announcements. Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, who heads the empowered group of ministers on drought, has reiterated that if need be the government will import commodities that are in short-supply. The ban on the export of certain essential items will continue. Although there are enough buffer stocks, the shortfall in kharif production might fuel food inflation. Urgent measures are needed to save the standing crops. Clearly, there is a sense of urgency in not only ensuring food availability but also in moderating inflationary expectations. Already, food prices are ruling high, as reflected in various consumer price indices — the headline inflation, however, remains in negative territory due to statistical aberration. The appropriateness of taking the wholesale prices-based inflation index as the sole reference point for policy formulation has once again been called into question. From a monetary perspective, it is clear that the traditional policy measures to combat inflation such as varying the interest rates will not be wholly effective in India. Food items that are assigned heavy weightage in consumer price indices are susceptible to supply side shocks due to the monsoon vagaries. That has been amply demonstrated this time.
High food prices have also weighed with the government in determining the minimum support prices (MSP) for paddy and a number of other crops. The MSP for paddy has been hiked by Rs.100 a quintal. However, the new rate at Rs.950 a quintal for “common paddy” — and at Rs.980 for finer varieties — is, in effect, only Rs.50 more than what was paid in 2008-09 if the bonus of Rs.50 is taken into reckoning. This is in contrast to the hefty Rs.125-155 increase sanctioned during the previous two seasons. The MSPs for other crops that are in short supply, except for a few varieties of cereals, have been frozen. The government’s efforts at balancing the interests of the consumers served through the public distribution system with those of the producers will be particularly challenging this season. A shortfall of 10 million tonnes is expected in the kharif rice output. Since market prices are bound to be higher than the floor set by the MSP, farmers are more likely to sell their produce to private trade than to the public distribution system. Adding to the government’s woes, the States that contributed most to its stockpile last year — Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh — have had significantly deficient rainfall so far.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Challenge-of-food-inflation/article16877577.ece
31,8,2009,"Adieu, Chandrayaan-1","India’s Chandrayaan-1 mission, the country’s first effort at deep space exploration, has come to a premature end. Radio contact with the lunar probe was lost 312 days after it travelled into space aboard the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle. According to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), data were received from the probe till shortly after midnight on August 29. About an hour later, all communications ceased abruptly. Without these radio links, controlling the spacecraft and getting data from it became impossible. Such an end was, in fact, expected. For much of the spacecraft’s operational life, ISRO chose to convey the impression of a mission that was proceeding smoothly and according to plan. In reality, the probe seems to have been beset virtually from the start by the failure of crucial onboard systems. Both star-sensors used to maintain the spacecraft’s orientation stopped working, as did one of two ‘Bus Management Units’ that performed vital control functions. In addition, thermal management to keep the spacecraft’s systems and instruments from being alternately baked and frozen was not easy. The radiation environment around the Moon turned out to be more hostile than expected. As a result of these problems, ISRO opted in May to move the spacecraft farther away from the Moon. But it was only in July that the space agency finally acknowledged the extent of the setbacks and admitted that the mission was in jeopardy.
Yet these problems make what has been achieved all the more remarkable. It is a tribute to ISRO’s mission management team that they could find ways to keep the spacecraft and its instruments operational for so long. Although the mission has fallen well short of the two years it was expected to last, a great deal of data has been gathered by the Indian and foreign instruments on the spacecraft. In the course of more than 3,400 orbits the probe made around the Moon, its instruments closely scrutinised the lunar surface using various wavelengths of light as well as x-rays and radar. Just 10 days ago, the crippled Chandrayaan-1 ably played its part in a complicated radar-based duet with the recently launched U.S. spacecraft, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. In the months and years ahead, data from the Indian probe will help scientists better understand the Moon’s origin and evolution, its mineral composition, and whether water might lie trapped in its permanently shadowed polar craters. Valuable lessons will no doubt be learnt from the Chandrayaan-1 experience. ISRO will now be better prepared to undertake the Chandrayaan-2 mission which, with Russian involvement, is expected to put a lander and robotic rover on the Moon in a few years’ time. But what India’s upstanding space agency needs to do better next time is square with the public that has given it its steadfast support.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Adieu-Chandrayaan-1/article16877963.ece
31,8,2009,Saudi Arabia’s brush with terror,"For those who had begun to suffer under the illusion that the Arabian Peninsula was on the threshold of liberating itself from the hydra-headed monster called Al Qaeda, the recent targeting by the terror outfit of a prominent Saudi royal has come as a real jolt. That a suicide bomber came close to assassinating Prince Muhammad bin Naf has shown that Al Qaeda, the organisation that has claimed responsibility for the attack, has not lost its ruthlessness in pursuit of an ideology that seeks to topple the House of Saud. By all accounts, the attack was bold in conception and audacious in execution. The high-value target was a Prince who has spearheaded Saudi Arabia’s drive against terrorism. A string of recent successes had made him a symbol of the Kingdom’s resolve to root out terrorism from its desert stronghold. Had the assassination attempt succeeded, it would have shaken the Saudi monarchy to its core. For Prince Muhammad is the son of the Interior Minister, Prince Naif bin Abdulaziz, who is number three in the Saudi royal hierarchy. On a global scale, success would have boosted the morale of Al Qaeda, whose self-styled Emir, Osama bin Laden, has publicly declared war on the Saudi royal household.
But it may not be all or nothing. Despite the failure of the assassination attempt, the masterminds must now be hoping to derail Prince Muhammad’s rather successful counter-terrorism campaign, which has combined proactive use of selective force with a policy that encourages militants to surrender. Saudi Arabia would do well to continue this policy because, despite Al Qaeda’s palpable activism, the militant outfit has suffered hefty blows. It is heartening that Prince Muhammad has stated that the Kingdom would continue to pursue extremists, without changing course significantly. An uphill task awaits the Saudi royal. In a globalised world, the negative images of America’s war on terror, increasingly symbolised by the horrors of Guantanamo Bay, the Predator drone strikes that indiscriminately target innocents along the Afghan-Pakistan border, and the gross injustice meted out to Palestinians, continue to draw Muslim youth from countries in the region towards Al Qaeda. The House of Saud would also do well to adopt a less ostentatious lifestyle and erase the perception, real or imaginary, of moral decadence and material corruption which continues to push the Kingdom’s youth towards nihilistic extremism, which is falsely touted as pristine Islam.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Saudi-Arabiarsquos-brush-with-terror/article16877962.ece
1,9,2009,Ghosting medical science,"Medical ghostwriting, according to a researcher, “occurs when someone makes substantial contributions to a manuscript without attribution or disclosure. It is considered bad publication practice in the medical sciences, and some argue it is scientific misconduct.” An extreme case is what the U.S.-based Wyeth Pharmaceuticals did, according to a cache of 1500 documents that is now in the public realm. Wyeth hired professional ghostwriters to make a major contribution to the production of 26 papers that were published in 18 medical journals between 1998 and 2005. The papers showed in good light Prempro — the corporation’s blockbuster hormone therapy drug prescribed to menopausal women — in the face of mounting evidence of increased breast cancer risk from taking the drug. Even after this particular ghostwriting scandal was brought to light by a U.S. Senator, the documents would have remained out of reach but for the public-spirited intervention of PLoS Medicine, an open access journal, and The New York Times. The two acted as intervenors in the litigation brought against the drug company by thousands of affected women.
It is scandalous that ghostwritten papers that mimic well-researched science manage to get published in reputed medical journals. The effect is to mislead doctors by playing down the harmful effects of the drug and encouraging them to prescribe it to more patients. What is shocking is the willingness of researchers of repute to lend their names to the ghostwritten papers. Since the number of newly discovered molecules is very small, pharmaceutical companies sometimes feel obliged to make the most out of commercially available drugs. This is believed to be a major factor behind medical ghostwriting. One way to counter this is to punish the researchers who collude in such sharp practices. Unlike in the case of data manipulation and science fraud, universities have not shown much inclination to crack the whip against academics who lend their names to the ghostwritten papers. Where even the U.S. government failed, a group of medical journal editors succeeded in bringing about more transparency and accountability in the way clinical trials are conducted — by obliging drug companies to register trials prior to enrolling the first volunteer. They have also achieved a measure of success in obliging authors to disclose any conflict of interest. Conscientious journal editors and publishers have a big responsibility to ensure that unscrupulous sections of the pharmaceutical industry do not use their journals to mislead the scientific community and cause injury to the public.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Ghosting-medical-science/article16878245.ece
2,9,2009,Expanding space club,"South Korea has become the latest aspirant to the space club. On August 25, the country made the first attempt to use its own rocket for putting a satellite into orbit. The Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1), also known as Naro-1, came close to achieving that objective. The two-stage launcher carried the 100-kg Science and Technology Satellite-2 to a height over 300 km. But the mission failed after the heat shield, which protects the satellite during the rocket’s rapid ascent, did not separate and fall away as planned. South Korea, which has already launched nearly a dozen satellites on foreign rockets, announced in 2002 its plans to create a domestic launch capability. After encountering problems with developing a suitable liquid propellant engine for the rocket, the country turned to Russia for help. The KSLV-1’s big first stage, which uses a powerful engine running on liquid oxygen and kerosene, is supplied by Russia. The domestically made second stage uses solid propellants. South Korea’s effort at launching a satellite comes just four months after neighbouring North Korea failed to do so at its third attempt. This year’s launch of North Korea’s Unha-2 too appears to have come close to success, with two of the rocket’s three stages functioning properly. If, as seems probable, the two Koreas sort out the problems with their launchers, they will join China, Japan, and India as Asian countries capable of independently accessing space. South Korea has even announced plans to send a probe to the Moon in the coming years.
Meanwhile, on the other side of the globe, the United States, the only country whose astronauts have walked on the Moon, seems uncertain about the course its manned space programme should take. In 2004, President George W. Bush announced his vision of humans returning to the Moon by 2020 and then going on to Mars. As part of this ambitious programme, the U.S. space agency NASA plans to complete the International Space Station and retire the Space Shuttle by the end of next year or in early 2011. It will then concentrate on a new generation of launch vehicles and spacecraft capable of carrying humans beyond Earth orbit. But a committee appointed by the space agency at the urging of the Obama administration to review the human spaceflight programme, is questioning the feasibility of such grandiose plans. Moon landings appear to be out of the question. Increasingly, economic power and, along with it, the appetite to take on the challenges of space seem to be shifting to Asia.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Expanding-space-club/article16878498.ece
3,9,2009,Celebrate Internet@forty,"When two adjacent computers began to exchange data on September 2, 1969 in a UCLA lab, no one saw it as a giant step for humankind. The Internet started as a university project and was nurtured by visionary professionals and enthusiastic amateurs as an open access network for exchanging information and knowledge. A tremendous combination of idealism, creativity, and hard work, along with game-changing inventions in computing, has made the Internet what it is today. The ability to connect easily and communicate extensively and ‘the rewards of unanticipated opportunities’ are some of the benefits hundreds of millions of people around the world reap from this revolution. According to internetworldstats.com, a handy data source, the estimated number of Net users worldwide is 1.67 billion or about 25 per cent of the global population; this represents a growth of 360 per cent over 2000. The Future of Internet III, a survey of internet leaders and analysts conducted by Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project (2008), shows that there is much more technological innovation to come. This will advance the architecture and use of the Internet, with the mobile device becoming the primary device for online access. While there is no reason to doubt the basis of this optimism, the Internet faces several challenges today.
Jonathan Zittrain, an Internet guru, sees the ‘counter-revolutionary’ drive from ‘generativity’ — the greatest gift of the Internet — to a centrally controlled ‘appliancized network’ and ‘tethered’ appliances as the greatest concern. He believes the generative Internet can be preserved for everybody through new technologies and changed behaviour. The lack of ‘net neutrality’ is a barrier to healthy growth. The increasing presence of proprietary networks, the unwillingness of service providers to allow the free flow of ‘various forms of data traffic,’ and stiff pricing tend to discourage both use and innovation. The other side of the coin is that the generative Internet has perpetuated the ‘cult of the amateur,’ which tends to undermine its credibility. The way forward is not to hand over the World Wide Web to `experts’ — but to foster the collaborative nature of the vast creative space. The Internet faces serious security threats with juvenile behaviour, unethical hacking, and spamming far from overcome. Technology can help make the Internet a safer place but it must not become the basis for authoritarian controls. Developing countries, including India, are a long way from empowering their people through the Internet. Improved and accessible bandwidth and cheaper hardware hold the key to bringing the benefits of the Internet to the unconnected millions. The next generation Internet Protocol, which will provide a wider base for creating web addresses and facilitate Internet growth, can make a real difference to this situation — provided bold and progressive policies are pursued.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Celebrate-Internetforty/article16878722.ece
3,9,2009,Uniform treatment of savings,"Among the key proposals of the new Direct Tax Code, now open for public debate, the one to replace the EEE (Exempt-Exempt-Exempt) method of taxing certain long-term savings, especially the employees provident fund (EPF) and the public provident fund (PPF), with the EET (Exempt- Exempt-Tax) method has invited a great deal of comment. The EET differs fundamentally from the EEE in that the proceeds on withdrawal — usually, but not always, at the time of superannuation of the taxpayer — are taxed. Under the EEE method, the initial investment, the interest earned, and the maturity amount are free from tax liability. Considered in isolation, there is no doubt that many categories of investors, including salaried employees, will be hurt badly in financial terms by the switchover to the EET regime. The EPF and the PPF have been considered better than other forms of long-term savings also because they assure a steady rate of return and are not subject to court attachments. Without the tax exemption on withdrawal, these schemes might lose much of their appeal particularly to the salaried classes,for whom they have practically been the only form of savings.
The case for the EET rests on the guiding principles of the Code which seek to do away with most of the exemptions while substantially lowering the tax rates. The EET regime will provide for uniformity in the tax treatment of various savings instruments.The Code has proposed a substantial increase in tax slabs and a significantly higher Rs.3 lakh deduction for investments. The substantially higher portion of incomes that will be left in the taxpayers’ hands initially, coupled with the higher limit for investments that would remain tax exempt, should, it is hoped, compensate for the outgo on account of tax on savings after maturity. Investors are unlikely to be guided by tax treatment alone; they would be able to appraise the risks and rewards in any savings scheme more objectively. It should be a matter of considerable relief for the existing investors that only contributions to the provident funds and the PPF made on or after the commencement of the Code will be taxed. However, this is an aspect that needs to be debated, and the overall balance of advantage or loss made clear to the taxpayers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Uniform-treatment-of-savings/article16878711.ece
4,9,2009,Death of a talented leader,"In the heart-rending tragedy of Yeduguri Sandinti Rajasekhara Reddy’s death in a helicopter crash, Andhra Pradesh has lost its most charismatic leader and the Congress its most politically talented and resourceful Chief Minister. A medical graduate, YSR, as he was widely known, was inducted into politics by his father, Y.S. Raja Reddy, a shrewd politician of Pulivendula in Kadapa district who was murdered by rivals. YSR proved a quick study. He became an MLA at the age of 29, a Minister two years later, and never lost an Assembly or Lok Sabha election thereafter. A devout Christian, he made pilgrimages to Bethlehem and Tirumala with equal piety, showing his broadmindedness. The real surprise was his metamorphosis from a factional leader whose detractors dismissed him as a rebel without a cause into a party unifier. The game-changing event was his 1500-km padayatra in 2003, which brilliantly tapped into mass unrest over the agrarian crisis and catapulted him to the seat of power a year later. For five years and three months, YSR strode the State stage as the Strong Leader. There was no effective challenge from the Opposition or, for that matter, from within what used to be a notoriously faction-ridden State Congress. Such was his self-assurance that when he made it back to power with a wafer thin majority, he did not perceive any real threat to his pre-eminence. He had accomplished something extraordinary in post-1971 Congress affairs: emerged from the long shadow of the high command without raising doubts about his loyalty.
YSR was a strategic risk-taker who looked around eclectically for ideas that would be useful to him and initiated a plethora of welfare schemes to alleviate extreme economic distress among the rural and urban masses. His most impressive political achievements were the confidence and can-do spirit he injected into his camp and the political credibility he won for his schemes through incessant mass contact. His tenure, however, was marked by controversy, with a number of allegations of corruption and misuse of power levelled against him and his regime. He also showed signs of intolerance of criticism, which was revealed in his government’s vendetta against the Eenadu group. YSR achieved the distinction of being the only Congress leader to serve a full five-year term as Chief Minister and was on course for a second full term. He tirelessly presented his mission as the transformation of agriculture and farmers’ lives and the ending of agrarian distress. His ‘Jalayagnam’ drive to irrigate ten million acres of land by 2014, his Agriculture Technology Mission, his vigorous implementation and expansion of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, and his schemes to supply rice at Rs. 2 a kg to the poor and provide free power to farmers won him enormous credibility on the ground. His death at the age of 60 is the kind of loss the Congress will find extremely difficult to recover from.
Correction
The second paragraph of “Death of a talented leader” (Editorial, September 4, 2009) said that YSR achieved the distinction of being the only Congress leader to serve a full five-year term as Chief Minister [in Andhra Pradesh] and was on course for a second full term. Kasu Brahmananda Reddy was the longest-serving Congress Chief Minister (February 29, 1964 – September 29, 1971) which is seven and a half years. YSR was at the helm for five years and three months. Brahmananda Reddy took over from Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy two years after the general elections in 1962. The general elections were held in 1967 and Brahmananda Reddy was at the helm for four years till 1971 when he was forced to step down in the wake of the Telangana agitation, without completing his full term. This means he served three years in one term and four in the other. YSR completed a full five-year term from May 2004 to May 2009 and became the only Congress leader to do so.
Clarification
A sentence in the second paragraph of “Death of a talented leader” (Editorial, September 4, 2009) was “YSR was a strategic risk-taker who looked around eclectically for ideas that would be useful to him and initiated a plethora of welfare schemes to alleviate extreme economic distress among the rural and urban masses.” “Plethora” could have been replaced with a “wide range”.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Death-of-a-talented-leader/article16881529.ece
4,9,2009,Uncertainty over drought’s impact,"The sense of optimism in the wake of the release of the GDP data for the first quarter of the current financial year (April-June 2009) is rooted in the belief that the worst might be over. The rate of growth at 6.1 per cent might not be significantly higher than the 5.8 per cent recorded in the two previous quarters. But viewed in conjunction with other recent economic data it does indicate recovery, albeit a muted one. The index of industrial production (IIP) for June had suggested industrial recovery. At 7.8 per cent, it was the highest in 16 months. The GDP estimates reinforce the view that the turnaround in the industrial sector has begun. The manufacturing sector grew by 3.4 per cent. Construction, a laggard in previous quarters, grew by an impressive 7.1 per cent. The biggest segment in the services sector— trade, hotels, transport and communications — recorded a reasonably robust growth of 8.1 per cent. The segment comprising finance, insurance, real estate, and business services has actually fared better than last year.
Since the Finance Minister has ruled out new stimulus packages, future growth prospects will depend on spending by the private sector rather than by the government. The biggest uncertainty is over the performance of agriculture and allied activities. During the first quarter, agriculture, forestry and fishing grew by 2.4 per cent. The impact of the drought will be felt only in the subsequent quarters. Despite the tentative growth signals emanating from other sectors, agricultural performance in a drought-hit year is bound to drag down the rate of GDP growth during 2009-10. The Planning Commission, in a report issued ahead of the mid-term appraisal of the 11th Plan, forecasts a GDP growth of 6.3 per cent in 2009-10, slightly lower than last year’s 6.7 per cent growth and way below the 9 per cent average rate clocked in the three preceding years. It is likely that the impact of the drought on agricultural growth will be worse than anticipated. The Planning Commission’s projection is based on the assumption that there will be a turnaround in the fourth quarter and that agricultural output will fall by only 2.5 per cent, which seems an optimistic estimate in the light of the reported crop losses. Growth prospects would still seem to be marked by a great deal of uncertainty.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Uncertainty-over-droughtrsquos-impact/article16879024.ece
5,9,2009,Political feudalism,"At a time of irreparable loss, the family of Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy needs sympathy and support from the Congress party and the people of Andhra Pradesh. But what middle-level State leaders of the party have put on display in the hours following confirmation of the death of YSR is not emotional support but political feudalism, an unseemly display of calculated and self-serving fealty to the First Family of the State. Even before YSR got his hero’s burial, pre-emptive efforts were on to have his son Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy accepted as the next Chief Minister, with more than 120 of the party’s 154 MLAs pressed into service as signatories to a petition backing this demand. India is no stranger to dynastic politics at the Centre and in several States, with the top jobs and privileges in certain parties reserved for family members, however inexperienced or unqualified they might be. YSR worked his way up the political ladder, first as an intrepid factional politician and then as a mass leader and strategist. His 36-year-old son, who until recently insisted that he was a businessman and not a politician, is a political novice with only the experience of managing a media organisation to back his case for heading the government. His formal entry into politics came during the 2009 Lok Sabha election, when he was elected from the Kadapa constituency. That however is of no concern to a support base that has prospered solely on the basis of allegiance to YSR and suddenly finds itself without its benefactor.
However, the campaign to anoint Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy as Chief Minister is not all about the feudal spirit. In the five years of YSR rule, some big business interests benefited hugely from concessions handed out in a corruption-ridden environment; these have figured in the documented allegations levelled by Opposition leader N. Chandrababu Naidu against the Congress government. What is clear is that vested interests that have wielded enormous influence in the State administration and have much to lose would like to see continuity in the ways of governance. In their eyes, Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy is the best bet to preserve the status quo; anyone else in the Chief Minister’s chair would mean taking a chance. The Congress high command cannot be oblivious to these facts on the ground. Ironically, a party that has long been criticised for imposing Chief Ministers from above, ignoring the views of the legislature party and undermining the democratic process, may need to do so once more — in the democratic and development interests of South India’s largest State and to set a no-nonsense example. The question is: will it do it?",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Political-feudalism/article13664798.ece
5,9,2009,Misplaced vaccine safety fears,"Since its outbreak in April, the influenza A(H1N1) virus has spread to many countries and become the dominant influenza strain round the world. According to the World Health Organisation, the pandemic virus is expected to persist in the coming months. Over 200,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection and above 2,200 deaths have been reported from across the globe. It is to halt this spread that pharmaceutical companies have embarked on a mission to find a preventive vaccine. The first of several vaccines for H1N1 is expected to be available by October. Although fast-tracking human clinical trials is appropriate in a pandemic situation, there is growing concern about the safety of the vaccines among the medical fraternity, which has been identified as an at-risk group eligible to receive the vaccine as a priority. A survey conducted recently in Hong Kong found that over half of the 8,500 healthcare workers were unwilling to be vaccinated against influenza A(H1N1) owing to fear of the vaccine’s side-effects and doubts about its effectiveness. A poll of nurses in the United Kingdom found that a third of them refused to be vaccinated for the same reasons. While Germany is awaiting the clinical trial results before deciding on its course of action, France is looking up to the European Medicines Agency for advice.
A complete clinical evaluation is the best option but it becomes difficult in the case of influenza because the virus keeps changing continuously. While the effectiveness of H1N1 vaccines is not fully known, there is some evidence of its safety from initial testing on a small scale in the United States and Britain. Reassurance comes from the European Commission, which has approved four mock-up vaccines for H5N1 (avian flu) based on safety and immune response data from trials on 8,000 people. According to the European Medicines Agency, decades of experience with seasonal influenza vaccines indicate that insertion of a new strain in a vaccine, as will apply with the change from H5N1 to H1N1 should not substantially affect the safety or level of protection offered. The U.S. regulatory authority essentially shares this view. The lessons learnt during the SARS outbreak ought not to be forgotten. At one point during the outbreak, 41 per cent of those affected in Singapore and 22 per cent in Hong Kong were healthcare workers. Apart from protecting themselves, vaccinated physicians are less likely to infect others patients. A healthcare breakdown during an epidemic owing to absentee doctors and healthcare workers is a horrifying prospect that should be averted at all costs.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Misplaced-vaccine-safety-fears/article16879244.ece
7,9,2009,Breaking the deadlock?,"The two-day mini-ministerial meeting in New Delhi of trade ministers and officials from 35 countries has broadly agreed to conclude the Doha round by 2010. Trade negotiations will resume in right earnest in Geneva soon. Chief negotiators and their officials will prepare an agenda for action. It might be premature to claim a “breakthrough” on the basis of these outcomes which essentially cover the process rather than the substance of the trade talks. The course of negotiations in the past suggests that substance guides procedures. Although there have been no high-level ministerial meetings since July 2008, trade officials working at the WTO Secretariat were refining the texts of the drafts on agriculture and non-agricultural market access (NAMA). These two have remained contentious and the new texts released in December will form the basis for the forthcoming meetings. For India, an important outstanding issue is to bring negotiations on services on a par with those on agriculture and NAMA. There is very little indication that services negotiations will move to the centre stage any time soon. There ought to be some satisfaction over India taking the initiative in restarting the talks. The mini-ministerial meeting of July last year ended abruptly following differences between India and the United States over the special safeguards mechanism for agricultural products.
Given the Doha round’s chequered history over almost eight years, it would be naïve to expect an early wrap up of the talks. Moreover, even the December texts on agriculture and NAMA have a number of highly divisive issues, and any one of those could be a deal-breaker. For instance, in agriculture the design of the special safeguard mechanism that will satisfy all is yet to be arrived at. A major area of discord in NAMA is the demand that India and China should be required to adhere to sector agreements for harmonisation or elimination of tariffs. Obviously, the negotiations in Geneva would have to focus on these contentious issues immediately. The revival of the Doha round talks is taking place at a time when the global economy is coming out of a severe recession. But with unemployment continuing to remain at very high levels, there has been a trend towards protectionism — though mostly within the parameters of the WTO rules — in many industrial countries. There is a realisation that a completed Doha round will strengthen the multilateral trading system and spur freer, orderly trade. While the efforts to revive the talks are to be welcomed, one needs to guard against raising expectations too high at this stage.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Breaking-the-deadlock/article16879818.ece
7,9,2009,The state of intolerance,"The Gujarat government does not seem to have learnt any lessons from its aborted misadventure. Its ban of expelled BJP leader Jaswant Singh’s book on Mohammad Ali Jinnah was summarily struck down by the Gujarat High Court. Yet, the Narendra Modi government persists with the idea of issuing a second ban notification. The reason for such obstinacy in the face of a chorus of scathing public criticism is not hard to seek. It has little to do, as some BJP leaders’ claim, with the book’s alleged eulogising of Jinnah or its alleged censure of Sardar Patel. The ban notification came a mere two days after the book was released and it is doubtful whether anyone of consequence in the Gujarat government had even so much as bothered to read it. The cynical calculation was that banning the book will go down well with its core constituency — one that nurtures a strong sense of historical grievance about a range of issues from the nature of rule in medieval India to Partition in 1947. In its unseemly haste to ban the book, the State government overlooked providing the ostensible grounds for the ban, thereby failing to explain why it was “against national interest” or how it could affect the “tranquillity of the public.” While striking down the ban because of this technical flaw, the Court sent a strong message, censuring the government for “non-application of mind” and the haste in proscribing the book.
Section 95 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers State governments to declare newspapers, books, and documents “forfeited” if they are seditious, obscene, promote disharmony between groups, disturb public tranquillity, or outrage religious feelings, thereby violating various sections of the Indian Penal Code. None of these conditions obtain in the Jinnah biography case. Preserving public tranquillity is routinely invoked to ban films and books, even though the courts — as reflected in the landmark Ore Oru Gramathile case — have generally refused to allow free speech to be restricted in the face of official claims that the law and order situation would be affected. Jaswant Singh’s book — a scholarly account of Jinnah’s life — had posed no law and order threats. The idea that books on history should reflect received opinion or fit into some ideological straightjacket springs from bigotry and intolerance. As the Bombay High Court astutely observed in a 1983 case, “It will be very difficult for the State to contend that a narration of history would promote violence, enmity or hatred.” If such material is prevented from being published or distributed, the “nation will have to forget its own history and, in due course, the nation will have no history at all.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-state-of-intolerance/article16879817.ece
7,9,2009,A blow for transparency,"In ruling that the office of the Supreme Court of India falls under the purview of the Right to Information Act 2005, the Delhi High Court has adopted a bold and legally unexceptionable position that has far-reaching implications for judicial accountability. All those who believe that greater transparency will not only improve the functioning of the judiciary but also strengthen public faith in it will welcome the broad features of the judgment. The verdict was a result of the Supreme Court’s peculiar decision to petition the Delhi High Court against an innocuous Central Information Commission order. In that, the CIC had asked the Supreme Court to disclose to an RTI applicant whether judges were declaring their assets to their respective Chief Justices in accordance with a 1997 court resolution. In his 72-page judgment, Justice Ravindra Bhat strongly controverts the Supreme Court’s contention that the Chief Justice of India holds information about judges’ assets in a “fiduciary” capacity and so this information is exempt from disclosure under the RTI Act. At the same time, he makes a distinction between the information that was sought by the RTI applicant (namely, whether judges were disclosing their assets pursuant to the 1997 resolution) and the actual content of the asset declarations. As far as the latter goes, it is not ordinarily subject to disclosure and may be accessed only under Section 8(1)(j), which applies to cases where the “larger public interest satisfies the disclosure of such information.”
In the recently changed circumstances in which Supreme Court judges and many High Court judges have agreed to publicly disclose assets, the impact of the Delhi High Court’s ruling is likely to be limited. The wider ramification of the judgment lies in its view that the office of the CJI is a public authority under the RTI Act. A section of the judiciary fears that this will open other information — for example, communications relating to appointments and promotions — pertaining to the functioning of the Court to public scrutiny. In most cases, holding back information from the public domain is not really justified and greater transparency will only boost the people’s confidence in the judiciary, while opposing it will only strengthen the impression there is something to hide. As Justice Bhat’s judgment persuasively asks, when the office of the President of India is covered by the RTI Act, is there really a case for keeping the higher judiciary insulated from it? The Supreme Court should accept the Delhi High Court judgment with grace and resist the temptation of appealing against it. If it does otherwise, it will weaken public confidence in the judicial system.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-blow-for-transparency/article16879587.ece
7,9,2009,Drift in Balochistan,"After coming to power in February 2008, the Pakistan People’s Party made promising moves for reconciliation with Balochistan. A military operation from 2002 had left the people of the province chafing against the federation of Pakistan. The alienation climbed new heights after the August 26, 2006 killing of Nawab Akbar Bugti, the face of the Baloch struggle for more provincial autonomy. Balochistan is the country’s largest province in geographical terms; it is richest in natural resources thanks to its gas and oil fields, but least developed and most poor. For decades, the Baloch have demanded greater control over provincial resources, a more generous share of the royalties from the federal government’s sales of the gas to other provinces, plus a larger slice of the national financial pie. The Musharraf regime’s heavy-handed military response to a low-level insurgency led to killings and disappearances of Baloch nationalist activists on an appalling scale. When the PPP took over, Asif Ali Zardari as the leader of the party sagaciously offered an “unconditional apology” and pledged to “embark on a new highway of healing and mutual respect.” But since then the government has done little to keep this pledge. Instead Baloch nationalists see the PPP government continuing with the Musharraf legacy — the killings and arrests have not stopped; political activists remain jailed; and, with the increase in the activities of Baloch militant outfits, a demand for the military’s withdrawal from the province has gone unheard.
A parliamentary committee recently made recommendations for improving Balochistan’s uneasy relationship with the federation. While Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani has approved this package, the government needs a road map for its implementation. It is evident that no package for Balochistan can be implemented without military approval. A further complication is the presence of a large ethnic Pashtun population with demands of its own, while the existence of Taliban safe havens in and around the provincial capital Quetta has compounded the security situation. Baloch nationalists allege that the government is not serious about going after the Taliban in the province as they serve to undermine the nationalist cause. For its part, Islamabad alleges an ‘Indian hand’ in the troubles. Pakistan is yet to come up with any concrete evidence on this but externalising a more than three-decade-old problem can bring only limited returns. With a government committed to democratic rule, Pakistan will be best served if it comes up with bold measures to address the grievances of the Baloch people.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Drift-in-Balochistan/article16879586.ece
9,9,2009,Going after secret foreign accounts,"Public interest in getting back the money stashed away illegally in Switzerland and certain other centres by Indians seeking to avoid taxes has never before been so high. While public perceptions have remained strong over the years, the issue continues to defy workable solutions. A major reason is that there is hardly any accurate information about the quantum of money salted away or the identity of the depositors. There are, as of now, vague estimates of the amount kept away — these range from Rs.30 lakh crore to Rs.70 lakh crore. The wide range is an indication of the complete absence of reliable official data. Banks in countries such as Switzerland have for long been wedded to secrecy as far as customer information is concerned. In fact, it is this secrecy along with some other positive features — notably, the extremely stable political and economic environment — that has made these countries most attractive for overseas investors. Adding to the complexity is that not all transactions by Indians with banks in these tax havens need be violative of Indian laws. Over the years, India’s foreign exchange rules have been liberalised substantially. It is possible for many categories of individuals and companies to maintain foreign exchange accounts abroad. Capital transfers are freely allowed up to $200,000 a year.
Indications are that the flow of money to tax havens has increased despite fewer exchange controls and the sharp cuts in personal tax rates. For India, like many other countries, tax evasion by the wealthy poses a threat to public finance. A growing international backlash against tax evasion has prompted many countries including India to take steps to pierce the veil of secrecy. G20 countries have declared their resolve to compel tax havens to adopt international codes of conduct and information-sharing. India will begin its first round of negotiations with the Swiss authorities in December but it is conceded by both sides that getting information from Swiss banks will not be easy. To begin with, the Government of India needs to have a proper bilateral treaty of the type the Swiss government has recently entered into with some 90 countries. In addition, it needs to buttress its case through hard facts and evidence. A recent deal struck between the United States and Switzerland allows the U.S authorities access to 4,450 secret accounts in a leading Swiss bank, UBS. The deal, which was hailed as a blow for fairness in taxation, was won after the U.S authorities could prove that the Swiss bank was complicit in wealthy Americans evading taxes.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Going-after-secret-foreign-accounts/article16880026.ece
9,9,2009,Blow to media freedom,"The August 31 verdict of a Colombo High Court sentencing the veteran journalist and columnist J.S. Tissainayagam to 20 years of rigorous imprisonment under the country’s draconian anti-terror law has raised concerns across the world on the state of freedoms in the country. The punishment is extremely disproportionate to the alleged crime of writing articles criticising the military in his North Eastern Monthly magazine. Tissainayagam, an ethnic Tamil who wrote in English and was a regular newspaper columnist, was arrested by an anti-terrorism division of police in March 2008. He was not formally charged or produced in court until August 2008, when he was indicted under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). The court made a determination that his column, which was a mere expression of opinion on the government strategy in the war against terror, was intended to cause racial or communal disharmony. His raising money to run his magazine was construed as raising funds for the promotion of terrorism. The shock over the judgment is understandable as it is the first case in which a journalist had been charged and convicted under the PTA of 1979 and has come in the post-Prabakaran Sri Lanka that eagerly awaits reconciliation, after the military defeat of the LTTE in May this year.
Even before the court pronouncement, the case of Tissa made international headlines. On the occasion of World Press Freedom Day on May 3, United States President Barack Obama referred to the lack of media freedom in many parts and to the case of Tissainayagam along with another as “emblematic examples of this distressing reality.” Reporters Without Borders, an organisation that has consultative status with the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), has called on the Council to intercede on behalf of the jailed Sri Lankan journalist. The incarceration and prosecution by the state and the court’s judgment have the effect of intimidating reporters and editors who may want to question the government’s anti-terror campaign and strategy. President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who has earned all-round praise for his successful military campaign against the LTTE, should heed democratic voices and intervene urgently in the matter to set Tissainayagam free. Even in difficult times, the Sri Lanka Parliament had in 2002, during the tenure of Ranil Wickramasinghe and Chandrika Kumaratunga, repealed law relating to criminal defamation. The core post-war theme espoused by the government is, “let’s forget the past and rebuild the battered nation.” The Tissa episode is an opportunity for the government to move towards reconciliation as well as to ensure that basic freedoms are protected.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Blow-to-media-freedom/article16880024.ece
10,9,2009,Damning indictment,"The report of the Ahmedabad Metropolitan Magistrate is a scathing indictment of the Gujarat government, no stranger to ugly controversies about summary executions dressed to look like police encounters. The 243-page report of S.P. Tamang on the killing of 19-year-old Mumbai student Ishrat Jehan and three others in 2004 contains a disturbing body of detail about how their lives were snuffed out. Relying mainly on evidence from a forensic laboratory and post-mortem reports, Mr. Tamang exposes the gaping holes in the State police version of events — namely, that the four, said to be involved in a plot to assassinate Chief Minister Narendra Modi, were killed on a highway near Ahmedabad following an exchange of gunfire. According to him, the forensic evidence establishes the victims were shot at very close range and had not fired a single shot; moreover, their post-mortem reports suggest they were killed the night before the police said the encounter took place. The Gujarat government’s response to the report has been far from satisfactory. Rather than take serious note of its contents, it has chosen to flatly deny that the encounter was fake and raise technical issues about whether Mr. Tamang had overstepped his jurisdiction. An honest and reassuring response would have been to register an FIR against the police officials involved. It is a chilling coincidence that the report implicates the so-called ‘encounter specialist’ of the Gujarat police, D.G. Vanzara — now in jail for the killing of the alleged gangster Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife in 2005 in a fake encounter.
The issue of killing people in cold blood should not be clouded or sidetracked by debates about whether Ishrat Jehan was a Lashkar-e-Taiba operative or not. Her family and many others have strongly affirmed her innocence — something that the Tamang report reflects. On the other hand, it is not only the Narendra Modi government but also the Centre — the latter in an affidavit in the Gujarat High Court — that has described her as belonging to the terrorist group. What is germane here is that extra-judicial killing is a brutal subversion of the rule of law, reflecting a total contempt for the basic principles on which the criminal justice system is founded. Alarmingly, the Tamang report suggests that such fake encounters in Gujarat are staged not merely to get rid of inconvenient people, but also to win appreciation and rewards from those who control political power. Rather than adopt a posture of hurt innocence, the Modi government should act on the findings of the probe and proceed against those who have been accused of murder.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Damning-indictment/article16880293.ece
10,9,2009,Latin American strategy on drugs,"Latin American states are dramatically changing their strategy on illegal drugs — by ceasing to make war on drug users. Earlier this year, former presidents of Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia published a report calling for more humane policies on drugs, and now Argentina’s Supreme Court, in a landmark decision, has ruled that it is unconstitutional to punish people for consuming marijuana. Mexico has already stopped prosecuting users for possessing small amounts of a range of drugs from marijuana to heroin, and is introducing treatment instead of punishment. The former Brazilian president Fernando Cardoso says the war on drugs has failed. The military-style crackdown on drugs in the Americas was started four decades ago by United States President Richard Nixon; as the U.S.-driven crackdowns have toughened, smugglers and gangs have grown progressively more inventive. Dutch customs officers have found cylinders of drugs welded to ships’ hulls below the waterline, and recently the Mexican navy found a tonne of cocaine in the frozen carcasses of sharks aboard a container ship. Drugs have also been transported in sealed beer cans, furniture, and religious statuary. Indian traffickers have even stuffed drugs into cricket pads for export.
There is no doubting the damage that illegal drugs and the trade in them do throughout the world. In Mexico alone, some very senior police officers and other officials work for different gangs and cartels; even a U.S. soldier has been charged with contract killing in the Mexican drugs trade. The border between Mexico and Texas in the U.S. is said to be a river of drugs in one direction and a river of iron, meaning weapons, in the other. The U.S. administration proposes to use herbicides to destroy dense cane along the Rio Grande — the border with Mexico — for better visibility. Critics have drawn parallels with the U.S. use of the defoliant Agent Orange in Vietnam. The new Latin American strategy does not as yet amount to decriminalisation; it is a humanitarian move which differentiates between personal use and trafficking; it may therefore help keep drug users out of the clutches of traffickers and dealers; and it could release resources for targeting traffickers. It also goes farther than some previous attempts at harm-reduction policies. In the United Kingdom in 1997, the Labour government initiated harm-reduction measures by way of treatment-type court orders, but dropped the policy following one adverse tabloid headline. The recent Latin American moves are much more robust, have received widespread approval among governments in the region, and will be watched with interest the world over.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Latin-American-strategy-on-drugs/article16880292.ece
11,9,2009,Turbulent times for Jet Airways,"The “mass sick leave” protest by the pilots of Jet Airways, well into its third day, has caused a massive disruption of air travel. It has come at a time when the aviation industry is going through a very difficult period and Jet Airways could hardly afford to ground so many aircraft and cancel, on an average, about 200 flights a day. The airline, which has won several national and international awards during its 15-year service, has hit a bad patch financially, like the other airlines. In the first quarter this year, it reported a loss of over Rs.200 crore. The Jet group, including the no-frills JetLite, accounts for a little over 26 per cent of the passenger traffic in the country and will be losing an estimated Rs.18 crore each day on account of the cancellations. Going by the agitating pilots’ version, it was a legitimate effort to form an association that led to the sacking of two pilots, which in turn triggered the ‘sick leave’ campaign. The pilots, who have floated a National Aviators Guild, have also claimed that the management has sacked three more of their colleagues since they launched the agitation.
Jet Airways, which has so much at stake, including its brand image, can hardly afford this turbulence. Its Chairman, Naresh Goyal, has taken a tough stance on the mass action by the pilots and expressed his willingness to talk to the pilots without giving in to their demand for setting up a union. The pilots, on the other hand, want their sacked colleagues to be reinstated, so that they could resume duty immediately. Though the dispute over the sacking is under conciliation with the Labour authorities and the Mumbai High Court has ruled a strike illegal, there appears to be a stalemate. Caught in this jam are the hapless passengers, who have either cancelled their trips or paid higher fares to switch to other airlines, some of whom have made a fast buck by raising their fares steeply. Both sides will need a face-saving formula. Unless there is a give-and-take approach, the stalemate will continue. If forming an association or union remains the only charge against the sacked pilots the management’s case becomes indefensible. The pilots need to look at the plight of passengers too, while fighting for their right to form a guild. While the other airlines are watching the developments anxiously, the Civil Aviation Ministry appears to be in no hurry to step in and take a stand on this sensitive issue. Both the Labour Commissioner and the Civil Aviation Ministry need to intervene without any further delay and end the impasse in the interests of air passengers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Turbulent-times-for-Jet-Airways/article16880548.ece
11,9,2009,Change in mindset required,"Women constitute about 35 per cent of all adult HIV infections in Asia, up from 17 per cent in 1990. Yet, 90 per cent of the 1.7 million women living with HIV have not indulged in any high-risk behaviour. According to a recent report of the UNAIDS, these women have been infected by their partners in long-term relationships or by husbands having a high-risk behaviour. It is predicted that 50 million women are at risk of becoming infected by the virus, and the transmission is most likely to be through their husbands. It is unfortunate that women in a monogamous relationship — considered one of the low-risk groups — are getting infected in large numbers. In India, women constitute about 37 per cent of the 2.3 million HIV positive adults. According to the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), a majority of these women have been infected by their husbands. It is a troubling fact that infected women in turn are quite likely to pass on the infection to their babies if timely testing and prevention strategies are not in place. The government healthcare system is working efficiently in some States such as Tamil Nadu to prevent vertical transmission from the mother to the newborn. But this cannot be said of many other States.
Despite years of awareness-building campaigns, men still indulge in risky behaviour and unprotected sex outside marriage. Though it is true such awareness campaigns have succeeded in keeping the incidence from skyrocketing, there is much more to be done. The most important change required is in the mindset of the nodal agency. Married women should no longer be considered as belonging to the low-risk group. In fact, remaining HIV negative has become a big challenge for many married women. Interventions targeted at men should, by default, include a component that reaches out to long-term intimate sexual partners. While much effort has gone into creating greater awareness and promoting the use of male condoms, a similar awareness does not exist in the case of female condoms. It is best illustrated by the fact that subsidised female condoms are made available to high-risk women only in the four States of Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal. Although some clinical trials were stopped midway due to adverse effects, more research has to be directed at developing safe and efficacious microbicides. The urgency to protect women stems from the fact that the patriarchal culture and physical and/or sexual violence faced by a large proportion of married women in India make them particularly vulnerable to the virus.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Change-in-mindset-required/article16880549.ece
12,9,2009,Safety imperatives in schools,"Panic situations are near-impossible to prevent, but not difficult to manage. No matter what causes the panic, some basic precautions and effective supervision can protect people from its consequences. The stampede at the Government Senior Secondary School at Khajuri Khas in Delhi, in which five girls died and 35 students were injured, could have been easily avoided had the school authorities put in place proper examination-time arrangements and ensured monitoring of the two batches of students. Initial reports suggest that the stampede happened when a large number of girl students rushed down a narrow staircase after some boys misbehaved with a few girls. Anything from a rumour to a natural disaster can trigger panic situations, and the circumstances that led to Thursday’s stampede will become clear only after a comprehensive investigation. But more than what caused the panic, what is of concern is that there was no teacher supervision of the students outside the classroom. In an emergency situation that arose out of real or imagined fears, the school authorities were not at hand to restore calm. Under the circumstances, the girls, who were on the first floor of the school building, and who sensed some immediate danger, must have felt that their only option was to rush out. As a large number of them took a narrow stairway in panic even as some others were making their way up, the stampede was only too likely to happen.
Safety issues in schools have not received adequate attention from regulatory authorities. Following the 2004 fire tragedy in a school in Kumbakonam (Tamil Nadu), some efforts have been made towards making school buildings fire-safe. But there is still inadequate awareness on the ways of handling emergencies. Although the Delhi school tragedy belongs to a different category, it should awaken the authorities to the need for introducing mock drills in disaster management and dealing with emergencies. At present, students in most schools have no idea about evacuation procedures during emergencies. Teachers, who are responsible for the minors under their charge, are not trained in ensuring orderly exit from classrooms in an emergency situation. As suggested by the Supreme Court, safety audits must be prescribed in schools for assessing the extent of adherence to the stipulated safety tasks. Such audits can be used to expose deficiencies in infrastructure and ensure high safety standards. Unless safety issues are considered in all their aspects, Indian schools will remain vulnerable to avoidable tragedies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Safety-imperatives-in-schools/article16880795.ece
12,9,2009,NATO loses more Afghan friends,"In the early hours of September 4, German troops, going by the United States aerial reconnaissance images, ordered an air attack by U.S. jets on two hijacked fuel tankers in the northern province of Kunduz. According to a NATO fact-finding team, 125 people were killed in the attack, of whom at least two dozen were not members of the Taliban; Afghan rights groups say 70 civilians died. The death toll would have been even greater had the U.S. air coordinator not rejected the German request for 2000-pound bombs, opting instead for 500-pound ones. The Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, has severely criticised the attack and asked why ground troops were not sent in, adding that General Stanley McChrystal, the new NATO commander in Afghanistan, had telephoned him to apologise and to confirm that he did not order the attack. The Kunduz governor, Mohammad Omar, has supported the attack but the episode has exacerbated tensions within NATO.
German criticism of other members’ combat operations in Afghanistan has not been welcomed by its allies, and now U.S. commanders are castigating their German counterparts for relying on the telephoned word of a single Afghan informant who insisted that all at the Kunduz site were insurgents. German commanders also failed to verify the facts on the ground by not sending troops to the site immediately after the air attack; instead, next morning they sent a pilotless aircraft to take photographs. Now they are angry that a Washington Post photographer was allowed to accompany the NATO team to the site, and see that as helping the U.S. press to criticise the German level of commitment. The consequences reach far abroad too, with the German domestic reaction now threatening the re-election prospects of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrat Union (CDU) party. Other NATO allies will also be affected, as support for the NATO presence in Afghanistan is declining in both the U.S., where a recent poll put it at 47 per cent, and the United Kingdom, where a poll shows 59 per cent in favour of a troop withdrawal by Christmas 2009. Even senior military officers in the U.S. and the U.K. have expressed concern about their situation in Afghanistan. Meanwhile the conduct of NATO troops there remains a serious problem. Neither the attack on the tankers nor the recent incident in which U.S. troops rampaged through a Swedish charitable hospital in Wardak province will do anything but turn ordinary Afghans against their purported NATO helpers. The main issues, however, have to do with what NATO is trying to achieve at all in Afghanistan; eight years after the NATO invasion, that question still awaits an answer.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/NATO-loses-more-Afghan-friends/article16880785.ece
13,9,2009,The Nithari verdict,"Although described in some quarters as a shocker, the Allahabad High Court’s acquittal of Moninder Singh Pandher is hardly surprising. When a special court in Ghaziabad sentenced in February the businessman and his domestic help Surinder Koli to death in one of the most gruesome Nithari killings cases, the verdict was greeted with a reflexive endorsement, even displays of public celebration. Lost in this unthinking eruption of joy was a simple question — was there enough evidence to establish Pandher’s guilt? The Central Bureau of Investigation, which probed the killings after the cases were transferred to it from the Uttar Pradesh police, was fairly clear on this question. Resisting public pressure and in the face of acute media scepticism, it did not chargesheet Pandher in the case, which relates to the murder and rape of 14-year-old Rimpa Haldar. The businessman was summoned as an accused by the special court, using its powers under Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the court eventually passed a judgment that seemed influenced more by public sentiment than by the dispassionate requirement of the law. In acquitting Pandher of murder and rape, the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court has drawn attention to obvious facts (for example, Pandher was not even present in the country when Haldar was killed) and refrained from extravagant hypotheses (such as the special court’s contention that his “hedonistic lifestyle” created the environment for Koli to commit murder).
What does the High Court ruling mean for the other Nithari cases? The Bench has made it clear that it will not affect decisions, at the trial court level, in other Nithari cases, of which Pandher is a co-accused in five. But it would be hard to ignore the reasoning of the High Court, which took into account facts such as Koli’s confession, which did not implicate Pandher at all. Or for that matter, the cell phone records in the possession of the CBI, which indicate that Pandher was not present in his Noida residence when 16 of the gruesome murders took place. Few crimes in this county have been marked by such inhumanity as the Nithari killings, a story of abduction, rape, murder, and necrophilia. That news of the killings was greeted with gross public revulsion and subject to acute media scrutiny is understandable. But the demands of criminal law require that cases be dealt with objectively and that guilt is determined not on the basis of public sentiment or inspired leaks but on the basis of proof beyond reasonable doubt. This applies to horrific Nithari killings as well.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-Nithari-verdict/article16881227.ece
13,9,2009,More preparation needed,"Scrapping of the Class X public examination of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has been under discussion for several years now, since the NCERT recommended it as part of a reform process and to reduce the stress on students. In recent times, academic performance has emerged as the almost exclusive determinant of one’s career and, as a consequence, the pressure on students, both at home and in school, to score very high marks and figure in the top bracket increased manifold. In extreme cases, failure to perform to the expected level drives students even to commit suicide and, ominously, the number of such suicides is on the rise. It was in this context that the NCERT came up with the suggestion that the public examination at the Class X level be dispensed with and a grading system of performance evaluation introduced. Such a reform will, however, be impracticable at the Plus Two level, which marks the take-off point for graduation courses, particularly because even a 0.25 per cent difference in the cut-off mark can make a huge difference to joining the professional stream.
It has been announced that, from 2011, taking public examination at the Class X level will be optional in the CBSE schools and it will be offered on-line and off-line. Strangely, more than the schools and teachers, students seem to resist this change. They would like their performance to be assessed at the State or national level through a public examination, rather than be evaluated at the school level. Internal assessment, tried out in the past, has thrown up questions of credibility, objectivity, and uniformity in standards. The grading system, as proposed now, recognises nine levels of performance — from ‘outstanding’ to ‘unsatisfactory.’ It is crucial that a system of evaluation which is viable and qualitatively exemplary is put in place. At the end of Class X, CBSE students in certain regions tend to switch to the State board system for the Plus Two course with the specific aim of scoring higher marks and they may need a record of performance in a public examination. Further, CBSE students do not generally terminate their studies at Class X level. Since Education is a concurrent subject under the Constitution, States are free to have their own system. Not many States appear inclined to fall in line with the CBSE initiative. It remains to be seen what proportion of Class X students end up skipping the examination. The Central government will do well to work for a national consensus on such far-reaching reforms, especially at a time when the country is preparing to open the doors to foreign universities.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/More-preparation-needed/article16881179.ece
14,9,2009,A great hunger-fighter,"Norman Borlaug, who died in Dallas, Texas on September 13 at the age of 95, remains the only recipient of the Nobel Prize for agriculture, specifically the Peace Prize of 1970. Possessed of insatiable curiosity about matters botanical and blessed with remarkable energy and scientific incisiveness, Dr. Borlaug (with Rockefeller Foundation funding) worked in Mexico in the 1950s, where he crossbred a ‘dwarf’ strain of wheat. This, when treated with chemical fertilizers and pesticides, produced far greater quantities of seeds than the earlier varieties had done. His discovery was commercially introduced in Mexico in 1956, and the 1963 harvest was six times greater than that of 1944. The obvious place for the further use of the new strain was South Asia, which in the 1960s faced runaway population growth, stagnating agriculture, repeated monsoon failures — and mass hunger. So desperate was the situation in India that Food Minister C. Subramaniam overrode scientists’ phytosanitary concerns and the Finance Ministry’s objections to gain parliamentary approval for importing the new wheat strain. The rest is the stuff of legend. In Pakistan, wheat yields doubled and by 1974 India was self-sufficient in cereal production.
Dr. Borlaug, who shrugged off the title of ‘Father of the Green Revolution,’ never ceased his research and teaching; neither did he disregard wider socio-political issues. While there were mixed reasons why African increases in yields did not lead to a Green Revolution, Dr. Borlaug is said to have regarded peace and security as prerequisites for agricultural success. He also came to see that certain concerns over the environmental impact of chemicals are justified. He advocated genetic engineering as an extension of conventional techniques. He was a severe critic of those he saw as elitist environmentalists and of western agricultural subsidies. Dr. Borlaug often said that if his critics had seen the effects of mass hunger, as he had done daily for 50 years, they too would want to use technology to feed people. The battle against hunger continues. The U.N. estimates that a billion people are currently malnourished, and by another estimate one third of the Indian population are eating a third less than they were in 1975. Dr. Borlaug, in sustained association with visionary scientists like M.S. Swaminathan — who has characterised him as “the greatest hunger-fighter for all time” — made a profound difference to the lives of hundreds of millions of people in the developing world. The game-changing science and humanistic spirit of this 20th century work need to be replicated, if the new challenges are to be met in the coming decade.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-great-hunger-fighter/article16881409.ece
14,9,2009,Welcome settlement,"The settlement reached between the Jet Airways management and pilots late on Saturday night has come as a relief to passengers. The strike, even if the pilots chose to call it ‘sick leave,’ paralysed operations for five days, forcing the leading private airline to cancel 200 to 250 flights per day. It also meant a revenue loss of Rs.200 crore over the strike period. In a bid to boost the bookings, Jet Airways has even offered a 50 per cent discount for passengers travelling from September 14 to 18. After last week’s disruption, the passengers may want to wait for normality to return in the airline’s operations. Though the protest by the pilots, who joined the National Aviators Guild seeking the right to form a trade union, left the stranded passengers complaining, the management was in no position to deny that right of association. Even after the settlement was reached, Executive Director Saroj Dutta kept speaking about a consultative group to address all the issues raised by the pilots. His argument was that a union was not necessary to deal with the problems of the staff, especially the pilots. But there was no word from the pilots, including those reinstated, about their giving up the membership of the guild.
Whatever the agreement, or the redoubled efforts to get back to normal operations, the image of Jet Airways has undoubtedly taken a hit. It is not merely the revenue loss that should be worrying. No airline can afford a disruption in service at this juncture when air travel is down and the carriers are facing huge losses. Some of the private airlines even tried to make a fast buck by doubling their fares, prompting the government to step in and ask them to stick to the fares prevailing earlier. It will take a while for Jet Airways to win back the trust and confidence of those who were put to hardship by the cancellation of flights, especially foreign operations. The Jet management must realise that the right to form unions is a fundamental right which cannot legitimately be denied. Be it in Britain or the European Union, the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of interests, have been guaranteed. Jet Airways will do well now to build on its brand image, continue to offer the kind of services — on ground and in the air — that it did earlier, run to a near 100 per cent punctuality in operations, and regain the endorsement of passengers that had won for it so many awards in the past. At a time when competition in the air is getting tough, good service can make a huge difference.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Welcome-settlement/article16881410.ece
15,9,2009,Some cheer for BJP in bad times,"In hard times, anything positive can serve as a morale booster. After coming under attack from both within and outside during the last few months, the Bharatiya Janata Party found cause for cheer in the results of the by-elections to some State Assemblies. The party won seven of 12 seats, most significantly five of the seven seats in Gujarat, a stronghold where it had turned in a below-par performance in the Lok Sabha election. It won one Assembly constituency in Uttarakhand, a State where it had lost all the five Lok Sabha seats. The seventh seat came from Madhya Pradesh, another BJP-ruled State, but here the score was tied 1-1 with the Congress. By themselves, the by-elections do not amount to a great deal. In both Gujarat and Uttarakhand, the party of the Hindu Right enjoys a majority in the Assembly, and the results of the by-elections do not alter political equations. But the principal opposition party — which is trumpeting its win in Gujarat’s Jasdan, a constituency it has not represented since Independence — would like to place these results in a larger context, both in terms of time and space. Clearly, the psychological value of the outcome of the by-elections outweighs everything else.
Which is to say that at the national level, the gains have lifted the spirits of the BJP leadership that is still struggling to cope with a second successive defeat in the 15th Lok Sabha election. Besieged by dissidents of all hues, it can now use these hopeful pointers to buy time and ward off challenges from the second rung. After the Jaswant Singh fiasco, and continued sniping from Arun Shourie and Yashwant Sinha, the leadership of L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh came under threat. Chief Minister Narendra Modi too was blamed for the national debacle and the lacklustre performance in Gujarat. All three were under some pressure to demonstrate that voters had not given up on them. Although it is difficult to see the results as a turn-around, the senior office-bearers in the BJP can now use the psychological boost to strengthen their position within the organisation, at least for now. Mr. Rajnath Singh has been able to claim, with some credibility, that the by-elections have shown that the party was not losing ground in States ruled by it. As for the Congress, the political cockiness, the ‘we-don’t-really-need-allies’ attitude, and smugness over the troubles in which opponents have found themselves will be hard to sustain as the realities of a fragmented polity and a changeable popular mood begin to assert themselves and the delicious scent of an unexpected triumph fades. The Maharashtra Assembly election will be the next, and more significant, test.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Some-cheer-for-BJP-in-bad-times/article16881641.ece
15,9,2009,Weathering the crisis,"The filing for bankruptcy by Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008 was a seminal point in global financial history, marking the start of a particularly virulent phase of the global financial crisis, which soon morphed into an unprecedented economic crisis. The sub-prime housing mortgage crisis that led to the collapse of the iconic investment bank was building up for more than a year. The securitised mortgage backed debt obligations and their related financial derivatives engineered by some of the world’s leading financial institutions turned into toxic assets. The irony is that the very institutions that created these with such complexity that tended to hide the real nature of the underlying risks ended up owning some of them. Almost all the top investment banks came under fire. While a few — notably Merrill Lynch and Bear Sterns — were rescued by the U.S. authorities, Lehman Brothers was allowed to go under, with catastrophic consequences. The entire global inter-bank lending mechanism froze and the flow of credit stopped due to extreme counter party risk aversion. Policy makers everywhere realised quickly that unless the financial sector was stabilised, the economic downturn could not be checked. The U.S. authorities adopted unconventional measures that basically involved the deployment of huge sums of public money to clean up the balance sheets and give support to the financial system and the economy.
The Indian economy has been relatively resilient. It was no doubt affected through the transmission of the contagion operating through the trade, capital flows, and confidence channels. Exports have been declining for 11 months in a row, reflecting the sharp demand contraction in the developed economies. Imports too have been falling due partly to lower domestic growth. Software exports and remittances by workers from abroad have remained steady. There has been no undue pressure on the balance of payments despite the sharp reversal of capital flows and contraction in total exports. Economic growth fell by three percentage points to 5.8 per cent during the quarter following the Lehman debacle. However, for the whole year (2008-09), the economy grew by 6.7 per cent, which is quite impressive when compared with the performance of most other countries. GDP growth climbed above 6 per cent during the first quarter of 2009-10. According to most forecasts, economic growth will be at least 6 per cent this year, despite the severe drought. Optimism may not have returned fully as yet to the markets, but the industrial sector is beginning to show some buoyancy and the capital flows are rising.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Weathering-the-crisis/article16881640.ece
16,9,2009,A wake up call,"Nearly six years after being allotted the 19th Commonwealth Games, Delhi is racing against time to meet the deadline of October 3, 2010. If the critical evaluation of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), coupled with that of the Commonwealth Games Co-ordination Commission, is to be believed, things could not have been worse than they are at this juncture. There is just over a year left for the agencies to deliver the biggest ever multi-discipline games India will have hosted. On the other hand, there is a quiet confidence in the approach of Union Sports Minister M.S. Gill and Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit to the huge challenge. At stake will be the country’s prestige and its ability to organise an event of this magnitude, with an eye on a possible Olympic bid, amidst the economic slowdown and mounting security concerns. Grappling as they are with construction delays in at least 13 of the 19 sports venues, the authorities could have been spared the embarrassment of a scathing complaint by Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) president Michael Fennell, who has sought the Prime Minister’s intervention in a “recovery plan.”
There is concern, of course, over the escalating costs. The projection of the organisational expenditure has jumped from less than Rs.70 crore in 2003 to Rs.1,600 crore and the estimated sports infrastructure costs have shot up from Rs.136 crore to Rs.3,934 crore. There is no clear estimate yet about what the city could end up spending on the civic infrastructure. Every rupee will be well spent if New Delhi manages to pull off a memorable Games, as it did 27 years ago, under Rajiv Gandhi’s helmsmanship, when it hosted the Asian Games. But this will require, first of all, an end to the bickering within the Organising Committee, which also needs to be strengthened by inducting a few senior administrators with proven track records, as was done in 1982. Secondly, it is clear that decentralisation will lead to quicker implementation. Thirdly, a way must be found to achieve better co-ordination among multiple authorities handling Games projects. Fourthly, revised targets must be set and trial events held to rectify defects and assess organisational capability. The CGF would do well not to intrude too much on the host’s prerogatives. Denied an opportunity to train at Games venues well in advance, India’s sportspersons need to be provided with the best of facilities as they prepare for the 17-sport Games. China not only set new benchmarks in infrastructure and organisation during the 2008 Beijing Olympics; it also won a record number of medals. That is the kind of perfection New Delhi should be aiming for.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-wake-up-call/article16881835.ece
16,9,2009,Japan’s impressive new team,"On August 30, the Democratic Party of Japan, ably led by Yukio Hatoyama, won a landslide election victory to end more than half a century of Liberal Democratic Party rule. Given the DPJ’s promise of sweeping reform, Mr. Hatoyama’s cabinet selection is significant. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, a former LDP member and bureaucrat, has the hard job of downsizing the current ¥15-trillion stimulus package in the midst of recession. Mr. Fujii must nevertheless fulfil manifesto promises on childcare and other social spending; Japan has the world’s highest proportion of citizens aged above 65 and the lowest of those under 15. Deputy Prime Minister Naoto Kan will head the new national strategy bureau, which, in response to public disenchantment with long-entrenched insider politics, is intended to curb policy-making by a hidebound bureaucracy. In keeping with the DPJ’s progressive world view, Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada will be expected to work for greater equality in Japan’s relationship with the United States. In particular, he will need to deal with tensions over the status of American bases in Japan and over Mr. Hatoyama’s plans for an EU-style East Asia with a single currency and regional political integration. In addition, the new government has committed itself to a 25 per cent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, in comparison with 1990 levels.
The Hatoyama administration faces other tough tasks. It must reconcile income guarantees for farmers, who voted handsomely for the DPJ, with the promised removal of cuts in rice production, which could depress farm-gate prices further. That challenge faces Hirotaka Akamatsu, Minister for Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries. Further, while the DPJ has won 308 seats in the 480-seat lower house of the Diet, it has no majority in the upper house. Therefore, two small parties — the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the People’s New Party (PNP) which hold five seats each in the upper house — have been given cabinet posts. PNP leader Shizuka Kamei is charged with reversing the privatisation of the postal service and persuading the banks to relax their current restrictions on business loans. SDP leader Mizuho Fukushima has a wide-ranging responsibility for consumer affairs, the declining birth rate, gender equality, and social affairs. Mr. Hatoyama’s team selection shows astute judgment and a forward-looking spirit. He must seize the moment and demonstrate strong leadership qualities to justify the faith of a people who have given him such an overpowering mandate that he can have no excuses for non-performance.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Japanrsquos-impressive-new-team/article16881836.ece
17,9,2009,The way forward with Iran,"The Iranian proposal for all-round dialogue with the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany may be couched in vague and flowery language but it represents the best shot yet for the international community to resolve its outstanding concerns on the nuclear issue. Thanks to regime change in Washington (although not in Tehran), the United States is now officially open to the idea of a dialogue with Iran, something it has avoided for more than three decades. The Iranians too, still recouping from a bruising, divisive election, appear to have recognised the merit of engagement and discussion as a means of resolving their differences with the P5+1 as well as the U.S. For the upcoming dialogue to make any headway, however, several things need to be recognised by all the players concerned. Iran must be open and flexible and not unreasonable in the way it links issues. On its part, the U.S. must suspend its hostile and counter-productive rhetoric towards Iran — even if much of it is intended to appease a nuclear-weaponised Israel that is growing increasingly restive about the prospect of a dialogue process that might well leave Iran with its capabilities in the civil nuclear arena intact. Washington’s threat to impose a petroleum embargo on Iran is not worth much. Iran may lack refining capacity but with Russia and China unlikely to favour such a tightening of sanctions at the U.N. Security Council, the U.S. can at best hope for a unilateral sales embargo. Even that will be of limited consequence with friends of Iran like Venezuela promising to supply the Islamic Republic with gasoline.
The idea that only the threat of tighter sanctions can guarantee the success of the proposed dialogue is based on the flawed premise that Iran is solely to blame for the current impasse over the nuclear issue. The plain truth is that the most serious concerns flagged by the International Atomic Energy Agency about the Iranian nuclear programme in 2005 and 2006 have been satisfactorily resolved — thanks to Tehran’s cooperation with the IAEA. The only issue preventing the agency from giving Tehran a clean bill of (nuclear) health is the status of the alleged studies on weaponisation supposed to have been conducted. The IAEA concedes it is unable to confirm the authenticity of the documents given to it by western intelligence agencies, which remain the sole source of information about the alleged studies. Iran has called the documents forgeries, pointing out discrepancies in them such as the absence of security markings and official seals. The absence of any evidence of diversion of nuclear material means there is no present or imminent danger of an Iranian weapons programme emerging. The U.S. wasted time in delaying the inevitable. Now that talks are to be held, sincere efforts must be made by all concerned to ensure their success.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-way-forward-with-Iran/article16882024.ece
17,9,2009,Complex dilemma,"In its annual report (2008-09), the Reserve Bank of India looks at the complexity in framing monetary policy in the face of certain daunting challenges — increasing fiscal deficits of the Central government and the consequent huge rise in public debt, which may push up interest rates. Food prices, already a cause for serious concern, will be further aggravated by the failure of monsoons and the resultant drought conditions. Given this context, the report points out, it will be difficult to persist with the accommodative stance of monetary policy. Although headline inflation continues to be in the negative territory, various consumer price indices that accord a higher weightage to food remain high. The sizable wheat stocks procured after the last winter crop may not be sufficient to counter inflationary expectations. Rice-growing regions have been badly hit by the drought. However, a retreat from the loose monetary policy stance may not be possible immediately. This is because, in a situation of supply side shocks from food and petroleum prices, a tighter monetary policy — increasing interest rates and reducing liquidity — will not be effective in lowering inflationary pressures. Moreover, drought will mean demand contraction which will have to be countered through increased fiscal spending.
Although the global economic crisis shows signs of abating, individual countries are undecided about their strategies of exiting from their path-breaking monetary and fiscal stimulus packages that have served them well. At the recent meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors, held ahead of the scheduled Pittsburg G20 summit, it was suggested that the stimuli should continue for a while. This is because global economic recovery will be both slow and gradual. For India, reverting to the high growth path at the earliest and ensuring an inclusive growth process remain the top priorities of the government. The macroeconomic environment has to respond to the policy objectives. A near-term challenge for the RBI is to deal with the “unpleasant combination of subdued growth and emerging risk of high inflation.” That poses a complex dilemma. Tighter monetary policy might weaken recovery impulses, but continuing accommodation and faster expansion of money supply can only increase inflation. Having successfully insulated the domestic financial sector from the contagion, the RBI says that sound macroeconomic policies saved the day for India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Complex-dilemma/article16882023.ece
18,9,2009,Reversing a provocation,"In diplomacy as with property, location is everything. President Barack Obama’s decision to scrap the proposed early warning radar and mid-course interceptors in Poland and the Czech Republic and seek, instead, a sea-based missile defence architecture in southern Europe represents a bold opening gambit in Washington’s attempt to ‘reset’ its relations with Moscow. Although the stated purpose for locating the missile defence system in central Europe was to protect Nato countries from long-range Iranian missile attacks, Russia saw the move as one aimed against it. After all, if American allies could be protected from Russian missile strikes, this would allow the U.S. to launch a pre-emptive attack on Russia without the fear of retaliation. The Bush administration dismissed these fears as groundless but was cool to a Kremlin proposal for using an early warning radar system in Azerbaijan that would have been far more effective in allowing for the early interception of Iranian missiles, further confirming Moscow’s fears. Thanks to the stand-off and the wider dissonance it set off in Georgia and elsewhere, relations between Russia and the U.S. deteriorated rather sharply.
Mr. Obama came to office acutely aware of the political cost the missile defence controversy was exacting. And this is where it is important to pay attention to the full set of motives behind his decision to relocate the missile defence paraphernalia. U.S. administration officials say their latest intelligence shows Iran’s long-range missiles do not as yet pose a threat to Europe though its short- and medium-range missiles like the Shahab-3 do. Since these missiles are capable of reaching targets in southern Europe, the U.S. will focus on locating the sea-based Aegis system there. Leaving aside the question of whether Iran really poses a military threat to Europe, it is obvious that Mr. Obama’s decision is aimed at securing Russian support for the tightening of sanctions against Iran over its nuclear issue. President Dmitry Medvedev should reject the suggestion that the two issues should be linked in this way and that Moscow has some reason to feel grateful that Washington has seen the folly of bringing missile defence into the heart of Europe. The surest way of ensuring that the forthcoming dialogue with Iran will fail is to create the impression that a hostile armada is being assembled over the horizon. Improving relations with Russia should be an important end in itself for the U.S., especially given the ambitious arms control and disarmament agenda the White House wishes to pursue.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Reversing-a-provocation/article16882262.ece
18,9,2009,Straws in the wind,"Conventional wisdom has it that elections held in close proximity will yield similar results. Yet only four months after the 15th Lok Sabha election, the trend seems to have been broken, judging from the outcomes of the recent series of Assembly by-elections. In Uttar Pradesh, the ruling Bahujan Samaj Party finished in the third spot — behind the Congress — in the general election. In Gujarat, the Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party fell way behind its claim that it would take all the 26 Lok Sabha seats. Both parties turned in superlative performances in the Assembly by-elections, forcing analysts to recognise the resilience of Chief Ministers Mayawati and Narendra Modi. In Bihar and Delhi too, the by-election results have taken a path diametrically opposed to what was witnessed in the Lok Sabha contest. The Janata Dal(United)-BJP alliance captured 32 of 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar while the Congress’s score in Delhi was a perfect seven. The victories added to the already considerable reputations of Chief Ministers Nitish Kumar and Sheila Dixit. By contrast, the JD(U)-BJP alliance could win only five of the 18 Assembly seats that figured in the by-elections. In Delhi, the Congress lost both Assembly seats for which by-elections were held. Undoubtedly, the results have dented the support bases of the two State satraps.
Mr. Kumar not only vanquished Lalu Prasad’s Rashtriya Janata Dal in the general election; he was also the undisputed driver of the JD(U)-BJP alliance. Both equations have gone for a toss following the by-elections. While the JD(U) could retain merely three of the 10 seats it held, the BJP retained two of the three seats it held. More worryingly for Mr. Kumar, the elections have revived arch enemy Lalu Prasad, who was blithely seen as a spent force following his crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha election. The RJD won six seats while alliance partner Lok Janshakti Party bagged three. Of course, Mr. Prasad typically overstated his case when he claimed that the results portended Mr. Kumar’s exit in the 2010 Assembly election. By-elections are often decided on local factors that do not necessarily have a bearing on a larger election. The BSP won an overwhelming majority of by-elections ahead of the Lok Sabha polls in Uttar Pradesh, yet crucially failed to consolidate its gains. That said, a warning must be sounded for the Congress, which has emerged the worst from the by-elections. It did not live up to the promise it showed in U.P; it squandered the advantage it had in Gujarat; and it has suffered a setback in Delhi, which it had begun to regard as an impregnable fortress. The party would do well to treat this as a wake-up call.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Straws-in-the-wind/article16882263.ece
20,9,2009,Pakistan and Hafiz Saeed,"Two interesting developments in Pakistan, possibly linked, offer some hope that sections of that country’s leadership understand India’s and the world’s concerns about Hafiz Saeed and may want to address them. He is the leader of the Jamat-ud-Dawa, a group that fronts for the Lashkar-e-Taiba. In the nationalist mythology of Pakistan, LeT is a defunct group that ceased to exist after it was banned in 2002; JuD is a charity organisation that educates children and offers free health services; and Hafiz Saeed is a harmless preacher-teacher-philanthropist. Much of this mythology was derived from the Pakistan security establishment’s patronage of Mr. Saeed and LeT for the jihad in Kashmir. Forced by the United States to act against LeT and other jihadi organisations after 9/11, General Pervez Musharraf reluctantly banned the group in 2002. But Hafiz Saeed’s re-emergence as the leader of JuD indicated that he continued to enjoy some state indulgence. In recent days, a few red lines around him have been breached. First, on September 16, police in the Punjab province registered two cases against him in Faisalabad for glorifying and soliciting funds for jihad, unconnected to the Mumbai attacks. Since 2002, he has been a veteran of house arrests, including after the Mumbai attacks. But this is the first time Pakistan’s Anti-Terrorism Act has been used against him. At the risk of being accused of bending to Indian pressure, Interior Minister Rehman Malik even announced that Mr. Saeed was under investigation for the 26/11 attacks.
From this there is no need to jump to the conclusion that justice is at last being done. Going by the reported contents of the two First Information Reports, the case against Mr. Saeed seems weak. He has not been arrested yet. The invoked section of the law is meant for organisations proscribed under the terrorism Act, and it is not clear if JuD has been banned at all. The question is whether the FIRs and the announcement that Mr. Saeed is under investigation also for his alleged role in the Mumbai attacks will go any further. Ahead of the Sharm-el-Sheikh summit, the Pakistan government went to the Supreme Court against the Lahore High Court’s order releasing the JuD leader from house arrest. But nothing came of it. Similarly, the recent actions against Mr. Saeed have come just before the foreign secretaries and foreign ministers of India and Pakistan are to meet on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. But despite the doubts, and given the known constraints on Pakistan’s elected leadership when it comes to touching some holy cows, it would be premature to dismiss these small steps as meaningless. New Delhi’s cautious welcome was the right response.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Pakistan-and-Hafiz-Saeed/article16882576.ece
20,9,2009,Beyond trade issues,"The simmering trade dispute between the United States and China, if allowed to escalate, might hinder ongoing efforts at promoting global cooperation, so vitally needed for the world economy to come out of recession. The rising tensions could, for instance, cloud the outlook for the forthcoming G20 Pittsburgh summit meeting and affect the progress of the Doha development round of negotiations that have just resumed at Geneva. The genesis of the latest dispute lies in the U.S. decision to slap a 35 per cent duty on tyre imports from China on top of the countervailing duties levied on steel pipe imports. China has responded by taking the first steps towards creating tariff barriers to importing automobile products and chicken from the U.S. These items form a very small portion of the total trade between the two countries. During the first seven months of this year, Chinese tyre exports to the U.S. amounted to just $1.3 billion. The U.S. exported $800 million in automobile products and $376 million in chicken last year. To put these in a proper perspective, the U.S had a whopping trade deficit of $268 billion with China in 2008. For every dollar of goods the U.S. exports to China, it buys nearly $4.46 worth of Chinese goods.
It is clear that the trade dispute is but a manifestation of more complex issues that have caused friction between the two countries. The U.S. and some other countries having an unfavourable trade balance with China have accused it of holding down the value of its currency, thereby boosting its export competitiveness. However, successive attempts by the U.S. government to persuade China to let the yuan rise have met with limited success. China has accumulated more than $2 trillion of forex reserves, an overwhelmingly large part of which is invested in U.S government paper and other dollar denominated assets. There have been genuine fears in the U.S. that China might start selling those assets or at least stop buying them. Obviously, a permanent solution to the global imbalance lies in the U.S. saving more and China increasing its consumption. For now, there is a recognition that domestic pressures are behind the trade dispute. The U.S. President is seen acting on his campaign promise to save manufacturing jobs. A very large number of them have already been shifted to China. Given the interdependence of the two countries that goes well beyond trade and the overall size of their economies, it will be in the interest of the global economy as a whole that the disputes are resolved without any delay.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Beyond-trade-issues/article16882575.ece
21,9,2009,Towards effective H1N1 vaccine,"Preliminary results from two 2009 influenza A(H1N1) vaccine trials in Britain and Australia have shown that the vaccines tested on adults are both safe and effective. Doctors and health workers in some countries had expressed concern over the safety of a fast-tracked vaccine and had reservations about being vaccinated. Although the two vaccines had different dosages, designs, and composition, they were well tolerated by all the volunteers. The most common adverse reaction was tenderness at the site of vaccination. Preliminary analyses of data from two vaccine trials involving 2,800 adult volunteers in the United States have also shown that vaccines are well tolerated. The European Medicines Agency and the U.S. regulatory authority note that the safety and level of protection offered by a vaccine will remain unchanged when a new strain is inserted in an influenza vaccine. In fact, the U.S. approved four vaccines against H1N1 recently on the basis that they were a strain change to each manufacturer’s seasonal influenza vaccine. An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, however, cautions that “any association of uncommon adverse events with the vaccine cannot be ascertained in studies of this size.” Since there are occasional instances of unusual reactions in the case of seasonal influenza, there is a compelling need to conduct post-marketing surveillance.
Contrary to earlier predictions that two doses would be required to produce the desired immune response, the trials have provided evidence that a single dose is capable of producing a robust immune response in a majority of the volunteers. Considering the limited vaccine production capacity in the world, achieving protection with one dose will mean a doubling in the number of beneficiaries. Another way of stretching the vaccine supply will be by using an adjuvant -- a substance added to a vaccine to improve the body’s response. The World Health Organisation recommends the use of an adjuvant as it reduces the amount of vaccine to be used in every dose. The trial in the U.K using an adjuvant vaccine at half the standard dose was able to achieve a level of immune response comparable to a 15 microgram vaccine after three weeks. The trials have been able to measure the level of immune response. The next vital step will be to assess the duration of antibody response after vaccination. One caveat needs to be entered, although it is unlikely to have made any major difference to the results. Only volunteers uninfected by the virus were enrolled for the trials, which were conducted when the virus was widespread in the community, but the possibility of H1N1 virus infection prior to enrolment and its role in priming the immune system cannot be ruled out.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Towards-effective-H1N1-vaccine/article16882792.ece
21,9,2009,From bad to worse,"The yet to be settled Afghan presidential election exemplifies the problems the United States and NATO have caused since their forces invaded Afghanistan on October 7, 2001 in the name of a ‘global war on terror.’ The election was conducted by the Afghan Independent Election Commission (IEC) under the oversight of a U.N. Election Complaints Commission (ECC). The final results will not be known for several weeks but evidence has emerged of widespread fraud -- eclipsing what happened in Iran. Problems have even been caused by the IEC’s placement of polling stations in remote villages to facilitate voting. In such areas, leaders organised block-voting and field coordinators went unsupervised. In Kunar, voting occurred only because the U.S. military paid a local warlord to defend positions against possible Taliban attacks. In 14 out of 34 provinces, insurgent activity made election monitoring impossible. The ECC, riven by disagreements between its senior-most members, has quarantined the votes from nearly 10 per cent of the 26,300 polling stations. What is clear is that President Hamid Karzai has failed to win 50 per cent of the vote and the question is whether the contest will be allowed to go into a second round. Assuming it will be, the Afghan winter will be a virtually insurmountable obstacle to polling.
Electoral fraud and all-pervasive corruption are not the only problems. The civilian death toll is estimated to exceed 31,000 since the 2001 invasion. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reckons that over 60 per cent of the 33-million population has been directly affected by the conflict. NATO troops have even called on local warlords to pacify angry locals following civilian deaths. U.S. commanders have recently tried using ground troops more; but this has not brought down civilian deaths or the brutality of the occupation. It also means increasing unrest in the U.S.; poorer rural recruits -- among the hardest hit by the recession -- enrol to get a job but are more exposed in Afghanistan, where their death rate is 60 per cent higher than that of their urban counterparts. Meanwhile the Taliban, by every credible account, have expanded their strength and influence. Attempts by NATO to train the Afghan National Army appear to have had no more success than attempts to build Afghan political institutions. The country that has defied invaders through history has once again proved to be a trap of calamitous proportions.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/From-bad-to-worse/article16882791.ece
22,9,2009,Get back to work,"Andhra Pradesh is in need of a government that works not a dysfunctional arrangement where Ministers, scheming overtime to make their overlord Chief Minister, have no time or mind for governance. Shockingly, from day one 76-year-old Konijeti Rosaiah, sworn in as Chief Minister following the death of Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy in a tragic helicopter crash, was faced with non-cooperation from his Cabinet colleagues. It is not just that Ministers owing allegiance to YSR’s son, Jaganmohan Reddy, showed no interest in work; they were brazen about undermining the Chief Minister’s authority and leadership. Only when the Congress high command adopted a no-nonsense attitude and made it clear that the leadership issue was not a matter for political bargaining did many of the YSR loyalists agree to carry out their constitutional obligations. Even so, Ministers continue to spend more time discussing the leadership issue with YSR’s close aide, K.V.P. Ramachandra Rao, than in doing government work.
Quite understandably, the Congress high command is in no mood to give in to such pressure tactics and crown Mr. Reddy whose formal political experience is all of four months as a Member of Parliament. At the same time, the party leadership does not want any sort of rebellion on its hands in the weeks leading up to crucial Assembly elections in Maharashtra, Haryana, and Arunachal Pradesh. Chief Minister Rosaiah thus finds himself suspended in Trisanku swarga. Without the full backing of the high command, he is in no position to discipline the mutinous Ministers. A YSR loyalist himself, he does not want to be seen as standing between Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy and the Chief Minister’s gaddi. He is consequently tentative in decision-making, and reluctant even to relocate himself to the official chambers of the Chief Minister in the Secretariat. Despite his vast experience in governance, he is unable to get things moving in this politically supercharged atmosphere. Mr. Rosaiah does not have the mass base of YSR but with firm support from the party high command, he should be able to tackle the most pressing issues of South India’s largest State: drought, the price rise, naxalite activities, and the swine flu challenge. The State Assembly is still in the first half-year of its term, and 36-year-old Mr. Reddy’s vaulting ambitions can wait. Andhra Pradesh needs steady, clean hands to steer it towards development. Mr. Rosaiah certainly looks like the man for the moment. Meanwhile, Mr. Reddy, as an elected M.P., can be given an opportunity at the Centre, perhaps as a Minister of State, to develop his political and governance skills and to show his mettle. He must realise that time is on his side.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Get-back-to-work/article16882942.ece
22,9,2009,A sharp dip,"The World Investment Report (WIR) of UNCTAD finds the prospects for global foreign direct investment (FDI) gloomy during this year — it is expected to drop below $1.2 trillion from $1.7 trillion in 2008. A modest recovery is forecast in 2010 when the aggregate inflows are expected to be around $1.4 trillion. FDI flows are likely to gain momentum only during 2011 and touch $1.8 trillion. Since capital flows correlate with economic activity, the WIR’s estimates of cross-country capital flows are broadly in line with the growth forecasts of international organisations. Recovery, expected to start later this year, will initially be feeble and gain traction only towards the end of 2010. Developed countries as a bloc are expected to fare worse than the fast-developing emerging economies, especially China and India. The WIR says that FDI to the developing countries has held out better, while the flows to the developed countries have slipped. In the last quarter of 2007, the developed countries received 80 per cent of the world’s FDI, but their share fell to less than two-thirds of the total by the first quarter of this year. FDI inflows to developed countries were lower by 29 per cent in 2008, compared to 2007. Despite this, the U.S. remained the world’s largest recipient followed by France, China, the United Kingdom, and the Russian Federation.
The FDI outflows from developed countries fell less sharply in 2008. The U.S. retained its top place as the largest exporter of capital. In the case of developing countries, they continued to grow although the trend was uneven across regions. Transnational companies from China embarked on a significant outward expansion while capital outflows from West Asia were relatively muted. The WIR attributes the decline in global FDIs to growing divestment by transnational companies world wide. Taking the form of repatriated investments, reverse inter-company loans and so on , they exceeded the gross FDI inflows in several countries. Cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) which have traditionally contributed to the FDI growth fell sharply in 2008 as the financial markets collapsed during the second half of the year. Private equity firms had a relatively lean year. Only sovereign wealth funds bucked the trend and recorded a rise in FDI in 2008. Despite the financial turmoil and massive government interventions, there has no been no significant trend towards investment protectionism. As the crisis recedes, the exit of government from ailing industries could provide a significant opportunity for mergers and acquisitions and the concomitant FDI flows.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-sharp-dip/article16882941.ece
23,9,2009,Break the climate deadlock,"President Barack Obama has correctly differentiated some developing countries as those that must pull their weight to mitigate climate change. Although he did not, in his speech at the New York summit convened by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, get into specifics, he evidently had China and India in mind as heading the list of rising powers that must curb carbon emissions. Mr. Obama’s own task of creating a road map for U.S. emissions cuts ahead of the Copenhagen climate talks is far from easy, but time is running out for India in the climate debate. The official stance that the country’s per capita emissions will always be lower than those of the developed countries cannot form the basis for serious climate talks, when the goal is to reduce the rate at which greenhouse gases are being added to the Earth’s atmosphere. There is much to learn from the Chinese response, which first materialised in the National Climate Change Programme 2007. Beijing has deservedly been praised for the big steps it has promised to take. The first will be a reduction, by the year 2020, of the energy intensity of its GDP growth by a notable margin from 2005 levels. In parallel, China is engaging the United States on climate change with potentially beneficial outcomes for both sides in terms of technology development and preferential assistance. All this should persuade India to abandon its defensive stance.
If India assumes a more pro-active position on climate change, it can lend a strong voice to the calls to compensate developing nations for mitigation and adaptation costs. In terms of priorities, the global effort must focus on sequestering carbon in all coal-fired power stations, as emissions from this source are growing. In the Indian context, the poor efficiency of thermal power plants also needs to be addressed. The solar mission, which forms part of the National Action Plan on Climate Change, needs a major push. It is revealing that in 2006, a not-so-sunny Germany produced 2,220 gigawatt-hours of power from solar energy while India’s tally was 19, equalling tiny Luxembourg. To make a credible case at Copenhagen, therefore, a lot of detail needs to go into the eight missions that make up the national plan. The States need to vigorously pursue the green agenda in areas such as sustainable agriculture, water protection, urban planning, and forestry. Here again, China’s policy is on firm ground. President Hu Jintao has spelt out clear actions on renewable energy, greater reliance of non-fossil fuels, and increase in forest cover. In the weeks ahead, New Delhi must come up with a strong climate agenda for 2020 — rather than approach the UNFCCC talks with a set of defensive arguments.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Break-the-climate-deadlock/article16883121.ece
23,9,2009,Moving forward with the GST,"An important milestone in the path towards the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has been reached, with the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers deciding on a three-tier duty structure for the goods component. There will be a low rate for goods of mass consumption, a standard rate for most other items, and a premium rate for a small category of items. It can be argued that a multiple duty structure is not the best way to go forward, since it can raise problems of classification and revenue leakages, for instance. Besides, the States may find it difficult to resist pressures from interested groups either for exemption or for levy at a lower rate. However, although a single tax rate is theoretically preferable, it may not be practicable at this juncture. Ever since Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee announced that the GST would be introduced on April 1, 2010, the accent has been on developing a structure that would be economically viable and politically acceptable, besides satisfying administrative canons of efficiency and compliance. In the budget it was announced that, in effect, there would be two sets of GST — one for the goods, and the other for the services, levied at two levels. These two would be mutually exclusive and operate across the value chain.
Now that the structure of the GST for the States has been determined, attention should shift to overcoming the practical problems of implementing it. It is at the level of the States that the introduction of the new tax, which will replace the State-level Value Added Tax (VAT) that came into being in 2005, is expected to be particularly daunting. Among others, a system of capturing input tax credits must be worked out urgently. The two big challenges are in the areas of compensating the States for possible revenue losses and revamping the legal architecture. In addition to the government, the 13th Finance Commission will address the issue of compensating the States. There must be a far greater urgency than what has been in evidence so far in taking the necessary legal steps, including a constitutional amendment to enable the States to levy a service tax and the Centre to tax goods beyond the factory gate. Certain existing laws such as the Central Excise Act 1944 and the Finance Act, 1994 need to be repealed. Existing VAT laws must also be modified or partially repealed. A more realistic timetable for the GST can be drawn up after taking into account the progress in fulfilling the legal and administrative requirements.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Moving-forward-with-the-GST/article16883120.ece
24,9,2009,Keeping watch over the oceans,"India’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) has once again done its job perfectly, placing the country’s Oceansat-2 satellite as well as six European nano-satellites in orbit around the earth. Originally conceived as a rocket to carry India’s earth-viewing satellites, the PSLV has evolved into a versatile and reliable launch vehicle. Apart from successfully launching a dozen remote-sensing satellites, it has taken the Kalpana weather satellite and the Chandrayaan-1 lunar probe into space. The PSLV has also shown it can put multiple satellites in orbit. For a polar launch from Sriharikota, such as the one carried out on Wednesday, the PSLV first travels in a south-easterly direction in order to avoid dropping its spent stages on Sri Lanka. Only after the rocket is well clear of the island does it turn south. If the PSLV flew a southward trajectory right from lift-off, the rocket would be able to carry a heavier payload. But since India is liable under international law for any damage caused by spent stages falling on another country, the Indian Space Research Organisation took the decision early on not to overfly Sri Lanka. In the course of 15 consecutive successful flights in as many years, the PSLV has launched a total of 39 spacecraft.
The Oceansat-1 satellite, launched 10 years ago, was the first Indian earth-viewing satellite configured for watching over the oceans. Data from the satellite have allowed the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services based in Hyderabad to produce advisories for fishermen on where they are most likely to find large shoals of fish. Studies show that such advisories have proved most beneficial. Instruments on the spacecraft have also aided studies on coastal water pollution and sedimentation. The Ocean Colour Monitor on Oceansat-2 will allow such work to continue. In addition, Oceansat-2’s scatterometer, which sends out a radio signal in a narrow beam and detects the echo that comes back, can measure the speed and direction of surface winds over the ocean. Such information can help weather models generate more accurate forecasts. The scatterometer will aid the long-term monitoring of polar sea ice; the melting of the ice as a result of global warming will raise sea levels and inundate low-lying coastal areas. In addition, Oceansat-2 is carrying a GPS-based instrument supplied by the Italian Space Agency, which can provide temperature and humidity profiles of the atmosphere. This information will be invaluable for weather forecasters and atmospheric scientists. At a time of growing concern over climate change, ISRO’s ability to develop advanced satellites to monitor our imperilled planet must be put to good use.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Keeping-watch-over-the-oceans/article16883311.ece
24,9,2009,Doubly abhorrent,"According to the jurisprudential principle of double jeopardy, no one shall be punished for the same offence more than once. But in a way, those who spend long years on death row suffer a kind of double jeopardy. They undergo two separate forms of punishment — the death sentence itself, which looms terrifyingly over their heads, and an extended period behind bars, usually in solitary confinement. In stressing that all convicts sentenced to death have a right to an early decision on their mercy petitions, the Supreme Court has highlighted the callous attitude of the political executive to those on death row. Pointing out that 26 mercy petitions were pending with the President of India, many of which related to cases where death sentences were handed out more than a decade ago, the Court pulled up the Centre for keeping those on death row in a limbo by not deciding on their mercy petitions for commuting their death sentences. In suggesting that those on death row for a long period of time could seek their sentences to be commuted to life, the Court was reinforcing the principle laid down in a series of judgments on this issue — that it is gross injustice to keep people hanging interminably between death and life. This newspaper has consistently held that capital punishment has no place in a civilised society. The innate cruelty of this form of punishment is only magnified many times over in an environment where convicts are made to live endlessly in the shadow of death, a condition that promotes delusions and severe emotional distress, known as the Death Row Syndrome.
India is not the only country where prisoners wait out many years on death row. In the United States, for instance, the complicated appeals procedure that is mandatory before executions are carried out is long drawn. It is estimated that nearly one-quarter of those who await execution in the country die of natural causes. In India, the uncertainty is due to inaction on mercy petitions which, in the Supreme Court’s view, is a result of the desire to further “some larger political or government policy.” Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution, which deal broadly with clemency, empower the Central and State governments to commute death sentences, a power they are expected to exercise fairly and expeditiously. The political executive should take quick decisions on the mercy petitions, exercising its discretion in favour of the prisoner in cases where there has been inordinate delay, thereby keeping in line with the spirit of the Supreme Court’s observations. The judiciary is often told that delay defeats justice. This applies to governments as well.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Doubly-abhorrent/article16883312.ece
25,9,2009,"Yes, there’s water on the moon","A new chapter has been added to the decades-long scientific quest for water on the moon. An instrument on the Chandrayaan-1, known as the Moon Mineralogy Mapper, has detected unmistakeable signs of water molecules at many places on the surface of our celestial neighbour. Years before humans set foot on the moon, scientists conjectured that there might be water there. But when samples of lunar rock and soil brought back by the Apollo astronauts were analysed, the results dampened such hopes. The moon appeared to be, in the words of one scientific paper, “an exceedingly dry place.” The search for water on the moon, however, revived in the 1990s when two U.S. spacecraft, the Clementine and the Lunar Prospector, found evidence for what was said to be water in the form of ice in permanently shadowed craters at the poles. But this evidence has been hotly contested. So much so that last year Japanese researchers declared that careful analysis of images taken by the Kaguya/SELENE spacecraft did not throw up any sign of ice inside a key crater at the south pole. But it was also last year that U.S. scientists published a study that used new techniques to examine beads of volcanic glass collected by two Apollo missions. They found minute traces of water. That suggested that water had been a part of the moon since its formation and could be found deep inside it.
Against this background, the discovery of traces of water by the Chandrayaan-1, supported by findings from two U.S. deep space missions that gazed at the moon as they passed by, is of huge scientific interest. Scientists have long speculated that solar wind, carrying charged particles from the sun, could interact with the lunar soil to produce water. Now evidence from Chandrayaan-1 and the other two spacecraft indicates that such a process is likely to be at play on the moon. Water, it would seem, is being constantly generated all over the lunar surface. Much of it may well boil off into space; some of it may percolate deeper down into the soil. Some of the water could end up at the bottom of deep polar craters, which have recently been described as some of the coldest places in the entire solar system. Such water, it is said, will benefit any future efforts to establish a manned outpost on the moon, supplying drinking water and rocket fuel. The day when such a need might arise seems very far off indeed. It is not even clear when humans might next go to the moon, let alone set up bases there. For the present, it is science that profits most from the Chandrayaan-1’s discovery of water. Missions of space exploration should not be judged by any immediate returns they produce. The excitement over such voyages is a testament to our desire to better understand the world around us and the universe beyond.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Yes-therersquos-water-on-the-moon/article16883475.ece
25,9,2009,Torture without trace,"The Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) have turned the spotlight on the complicity of medical professionals in the Central Investigation Agency’s recourse to abusive and unlawful interrogation methods during the post-9/11 ‘war on terror.’ The latest evidence, documented earlier as part of the horrors visited upon detainees at Guantánamo Bay, Abu Ghraib, and Bagram airbase, underlines the imperative need to further codify such methods as illegal under international human rights law. The PHR findings focus on the psychological abuses recorded in the CIA Inspector-General’s 2004 report, but made public only recently following a law suit by the American Civil Liberties Union. There was resort to mock executions and the threat of imminent death and assault on family members, including sexual assaults — betraying the intent to terrorise and intimidate detainees. The forcible shaving of heads and beards was clearly designed to inflict personal and religious humiliation and trauma. If the intended effect of the infamous ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ such as water-boarding, stripping, sensory deprivation, and solitary confinement was the infliction of long-term bodily pain and injury, methods such as hooding gave interrogators anonymity and consequently impunity for their lawless actions.
While these means of mental torture were employed by the CIA, medical professionals, and psychologists actively colluded in the cruel and inhuman interrogations in cynical contempt for ethical and professional norms. Of particular concern are the extensive data they gathered on the basis of the reactions of detainees so as to determine the effectiveness of the interrogation techniques. The PHR rightly views this as amounting to unlawful human experimentation. The approach of the Obama administration to this dark chapter in contemporary American history has been to look ahead, rather than back, causing some consternation among civil rights groups and within the Democratic Party. President Obama’s more recent expression of a readiness to prosecute the architects of the torture laws, rather than those who merely enforced their criminal provisions, is perhaps an indication that the issue could become a political hot potato at home. What is absolutely clear is that how the people of the United States come to terms — or fail to come to terms — with the horrors inflicted on humanity in the name of the global war on terror will have a strong bearing on counter-terror strategies elsewhere.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Torture-without-trace/article16883474.ece
29,9,2009,Pittsburgh and beyond,"The Pittsburgh summit of the G20 has been hailed for announcing that the Group of 20 will henceforth take on the role and mantle of the G8 but is it possible to tame the forces of instability that brought the world to the brink of financial and economic disaster last year merely by issuing edicts, fiat, and a check list of dos and don’ts? This is the question every country in the world needs to ask, especially those like India, China and Brazil, which bear little responsibility for the meltdown but which, nevertheless, are suffering from the aftershocks of the global crisis it caused. Broadly speaking, the Pittsburgh communiqué has what is needed to revive the global economy and insulate it from financial instability. Like every good primer, it emphasises three ‘Rs’ — reflation, regulation and risk management, and representation. Fortunately, the single measure most crucial for recovery in the short term is also the one which finds the most tangible mention: there will be no premature withdrawal of the stimulus package. India and China went in to the G20 apprehensive about the European and also the U.S. commitment to the ongoing reflation of the world economy and have every reason to feel satisfied at the outcome.
The stimulus package is truly win-win, because it allows for the recovery of Western economies and for developing country exports. Unfortunately, not all countries and players have a shared interest in the implementation of the Pittsburgh line in other areas. Take regulation and risk. If national governments do not implement the excellent recommendations made by the G20 on bankers’ pay, transparent accounting procedures and prudential banking norms, financial markets will once again start indulging in risky behaviour. As for representation, the G20 have made genuine headway by agreeing to a 5 per cent shift in quota share in favour of the developing and emerging economies. This was also a major demand of the BRIC countries, Alongside this, the IMF has also been asked to help the G20 conduct a regular ‘peer review’ of the macroeconomic and regulatory policies of individual countries, a mechanism that, theoretically, will allow the world to get an early warning of negative practices, especially in the Anglo-Saxon financial universe. But if this oversight task is performed perfunctorily, or not at all, all the fine words at Pittsburgh will get negated. And the BRIC and Asian countries will have even more of an incentive to develop their own institutions to insulate themselves from the next occidental financial contagion.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Pittsburgh-and-beyond/article16883871.ece
29,9,2009,Corporate lobbying and democracy,"The economic stimulus packages initiated in several countries have given fresh momentum to corporate lobbying, in which powerful companies spend tens of millions of dollars ensuring that legislation and policy are drafted to favour their area of business. Enormous sums are spent on this and on contributions to campaign funds. In the U.S., the major banks spent $56 million in the 2007-08 financial year; the mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac spent $180 million over a period of eight years. Figures for 2009 show that the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America have lobbied to the tune of over $6 million; Monsanto have paid out over $2 million, while the U.S. defence manufacturers have spent over $17 million. Also in the U.S., Political Action Committees (PACs) have become the biggest sources of campaign funding for candidates; corporate PAC spending increased from $15 million in 1974 to over $220 million in 2005. In India, corporate lobbying, in the form of intensive briefings and presentations to ministers and senior civil servants, is expanding; the current political climate also makes ministers, officials, and legislators more receptive to it.
For big business, lobbying works. Published research shows a significant positive correlation between lobbying and financial performance, and lobbying by firms or by lobbying agencies often produces policies tailored to their own requirements. In 2005, U.S. Senator Dick Durbin’s attempt to tighten the law on mortgages failed after intensive lobbying by lenders. Almost no major countries require oversight, transparency, or accountability in lobbying. It has even been said that in India the paucity of high-quality research centres makes officials vulnerable to slick lobbying and instant publicity countering allegations by, for example, environmental and other activists. There are, however, signs of concern about lobbying. On March 20, President Obama signed an executive order requiring government agencies involved in the stimulus package to report all contact with lobbies. But the response has been poor, and businesses have evaded the rules by delegating the work to staff who are not registered as lobbyists. Although some major corporations are coming under shareholder pressure to provide detailed information on their lobbying, an early change in the lobbying culture is unlikely. Critics say that what is called lobbying in the west is called corruption in developing countries; and one Indian campaigner says corruption stinks but it is at least a stink that everyone knows. There can be no doubt that lobbying will continue to pose a serious threat to democratic processes around the world.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Corporate-lobbying-and-democracy/article16883872.ece
30,9,2009,Taking the employees along,"Though well after the deadline, Air India’s executive pilots have called off their agitation and resumed work. What did the trick was Union Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel’s announcement that the contentious order cutting down the incentives for executive pilots had been kept in abeyance by the Air India management. So, when Capt. V.K. Bhalla came out with the pilots’ decision to withdraw the stir, he had reason for some cheer, and he thanked the Prime Minister for his intervention. A couple of days ago, a senior Air India management official told the media that a lock out was imminent. That was when the Prime Minister’s Office intervened, ruling out any such move and asking the Civil Aviation Ministry to end the strike. Now that the ‘sick leave’ protest is over, the committee set up by Air India to hold consultations with the executive pilots should get going. It is imperative that the airline put in place a turn-around plan that will persuade banks, financial institutions, and the Government of India, to provide the financial support so necessary for reviving its fortunes.
Cutting down costs and enhancing revenue seem to be the twin planks of any restructuring plan that Air India has to draw up. With a dynamic team in the Aviation Ministry to back it, the airline’s management must swiftly initiate the negotiation process. Whatever is firmed up without consultations invariably runs into problems at the implementation stage, as the proposed change in the allowance package for executive pilots has shown. The management must take all sections of employees into confidence and evolve an agreed plan of action to fly Air India out of the present turbulence within the next two or three years. The Ministry must also utilise this opportunity to lay down a basic framework for all the airlines. First of all, a full fledged regulator must be created to deal with the ground rules and disputes. The Directorate-General of Civil Aviation cannot handle all aviation-related issues. The airlines must be encouraged to file their operational plans and the fare structure for every quarter or half-year, and made to stick to it. The peak season has begun. Now is the time for them to maximise revenue and operate to capacity. But having attracted more passengers to travel by air with affordable fares and off-season discounts, the airlines need to resist the temptation of raising the fares to abnormal levels and making a fast buck when one of them is hit by a strike and forced to cut services. Even in an industry that is so strapped for revenue, such moves will be short-sighted and will only erode goodwill and turn away passengers. The interests of the travelling public need to be protected.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Taking-the-employees-along/article16884126.ece
30,9,2009,Enhanced role for IMF,"The International Monetary Fund is set to play a significantly enhanced role in promoting global economic growth and stability. In one of the important decisions taken at the Pittsburgh G20 summit, the IMF has been given the mandate to assist in a new mechanism for a peer review of every country’s economic policy framework and performance. Policies of many countries including India are already being reviewed by the IMF and after the G20 summit the policies of the richer countries’ policies will be subject to scrutiny. Of course, much will depend on how the IMF goes about fulfilling the mandate. But the decision at the summit is in itself a big step towards ensuring that the policies pursued by the G20 countries “are collectively consistent with more sustainable and balanced trajectories for the global economy.” In a related development, the IMF itself will be restructured and made more democratic so as to reflect the current global economic order rather than what prevailed in 1945 when it was set up. Its executive board will become more broad-based. The IMF’s system of quotas — from which the voting power of individual members is derived — will be realigned in such a way that developing countries including India and China, now having a 43 per cent share, get five per cent more. That, however, falls short of the 50 per cent share the developing countries have been asking for. But the G20 ought to be complimented for finally moving forward on a long-pending agenda of internal reform of the IMF and the World Bank.
The key question is whether the IMF will be able to alter the economic policies of countries that have directly or indirectly contributed to the global economic crisis. At Pittsburgh, there were few concrete suggestions for an orderly unwinding of “global imbalances” — the huge current account deficit of the United States matched by the current account surplus of China. It is not clear whether the IMF will be in a position to influence China’s exchange rate policy (leading to a revaluation of the yuan) or the U.S.’s inclination to consume. Obviously, continued global cooperation will be necessary even as the world economy climbs out of the recession. The IMF, which has forecast a gradual recovery, has gained in reputation by its generally deft handling of the crisis. For instance, it mobilised resources swiftly and stepped up lending to the countries in need, thereby containing the crisis. Even more significantly all the loans came without the onerous conditions and advice of the kind that showed a disregard for national sensibilities as it happened during the Asian crisis over a decade ago.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Enhanced-role-for-IMF/article16884125.ece
30,9,2009,Air India grounded,"Close on the heels of Jet Airways pilots’ mass sick leave, a section of the executive pilots of national carrier, Air India, has reported sick since September 26. In addition to cancellation of flights, disruption in traffic, and huge inconvenience to passengers during the festival season, this agitation has raised serious questions about the future of Air India itself. Ever since the process of merger of Indian Airlines and Air India began, the national carrier has been moving from one crisis to another. At a time when the entire aviation industry is going through tumultuous times, strikes or agitations by the staff are the last thing any airline would like to face. Air India has accumulated a loss of over Rs.7,000 crore and has run up a huge working capital overdraft. It has been looking up to the government for a bailout package for months now. Though the government has promised support, it wants Air India to put in place a restructuring plan that cuts cost all round, before the funds are released. The Centre has already underwritten the loans that the national carrier has taken to acquire a new fleet of aircraft. Air India began to cut costs — streamlining its operations and effecting a 25 to 50 per cent cut in productivity-linked incentives and other allowances to its top management, which includes executive pilots, whose total package ranged from Rs.2 lakh to Rs.8 lakh a month. That provoked the pilots to go on sick leave.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Air-India-grounded/article16883986.ece
30,9,2009,Political change in Germany,"The German general election has resulted in a clear win for the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union bloc (CDU/CSU), led by the incumbent Chancellor, Angela Merkel. The partly-proportional Additional Member electoral system has produced a vote-share of 33.8 per cent for the bloc, far above the 23 per cent won by their main rivals, the Social Democrat Party (SPD), led by Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Ms Merkel will now be able to head a coalition with Guido Westerwelle, leader of the right-wing, pro-market Free Democrat Party (FDP), which won 14.6 per cent and is the biggest single gainer from the election. There will be a categorical change of political climate with the ending of the Grand Coalition between the centre-right CDU/CSU and the centre-left SPD. Initial assessments are that taxes will probably be cut, that Germany’s 17 nuclear plants will not be decommissioned, and that the increasingly controversial German military presence in Afghanistan will be maintained for the foreseeable future. It is also likely that the post-war social consensus between labour, capital, and government will be progressively brought under more critical scrutiny, but that may not happen immediately; Germany, which with France is the strongest exponent of the consensus, is said to be leading the West towards economic recovery, and Ms Merkel will probably not allow Mr. Westerwelle to rock any boat yet.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Political-change-in-Germany/article16883985.ece
2,10,2009,No end to boat tragedies,"In the course of this week, two major boat tragedies — the first in Bihar and now in Kerala — have claimed over 100 lives. In Bihar, at least 60 persons, including 34 children drowned when a boat sank in the swollen Bagmati river. In the tourist resort of Thekkady on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border, more than 40 people died in an accident that involved a State Tourism Corporation’s new double-decker boat. Evidently, both the tragedies could have been averted if only the established safety norms had been followed. Such tragedies, however, are not new to the subcontinent, or even to the South East Asian region. Several Commissions of Inquiry and expert committees have time and again pinpointed the basic norms to be observed when boats carry passengers. This applied equally to a ferry service across a river and tourist rides on lakes. Some of the fundamental norms of safety relate to and include the number of passengers taken on board, the safety gadgets and trained rescue personnel to be ready at hand in the vessel, the dos and don’ts for the passengers, and the imperative of ensuring that they indeed adhered to the rules. Unfortunately, these are honoured more in the breach.
In the Thekkady tragedy — the Kerala government has ordered a judicial inquiry into the accident — groups of tourists from other States including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and West Bengal were involved. Preliminary reports indicate that when a sizable section of the tourists on board moved to one side to catch a glimpse of the elephants moving around the lake, the boat capsized. As it happened to be a Kerala Tourism Corporation boat, lifeguards and safety gadgets were available. But the tourists were not wearing the life jackets on board — apparently, nobody had insisted on their doing so. Since the accident took place at least seven kilometres away from the boathouse, it took time for the rescue boats to get into the act. Bad weather compounded the problem; some passengers could still be rescued. It does not require an enquiry commission or committee to pronounce what went wrong and what should be done to avert such disasters. It is a simple question of implementing the safety norms that have already been worked out and circulated. Just as it requires the enforcement agencies to implement the rules, passengers must also take the prescribed safety precautions seriously, and cooperate with the authorities as well as the ferry operators. Non-government organisations could pitch in and launch an awareness campaign which should go some way in securing better compliance of the safety norms by the boat operators and users alike.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/No-end-to-boat-tragedies/article16884295.ece
2,10,2009,Dangers of complacency,"It was inevitable that regulatory reform of the financial sector should figure high on the agenda of the Pittsburgh G20 summit. The financial sector crisis emanating primarily from the United States that turned into a global economic crisis was basically a systemic failure that the regulators failed to foresee. When Lehman Brothers was allowed to collapse, its implications across the global financial system were not fully clear to the regulators or the Wall Street. Aggressive intervention by governments and central banks saved the day but it was obvious that the financial sector regulatory apparatus in the U.S. and other developed countries needed to be urgently revamped. The G20 decided on a set of reforms that will discourage excessive risk-taking by banks and compel them to hold substantially more capital than at present. Although the thrust of the revamp initiative is directed at the U.S., countries such as India have more than an indirect stake in the outcomes, given the global ramifications of the move. The crisis had frozen inter-bank lines of credit, leading to an unprecedented squeeze in the credit markets. Trade finance has been severely curtailed, resulting in a dramatic fall in global trade volumes. In any case, given the high degree of integration among financial markets, almost all regulations, though framed by national regulators, have a global impact.
The G20 agreed to back new standards for remuneration to the executives in banks. In a move meant to curb incentives for risky behaviour by bankers, a significant proportion of bonuses is to be paid in the form of deferred compensation. Regulators will be empowered to limit the share of profits paid out in bonuses and dividends. Larger banks will be subjected to stricter standards. Rules such as these are overdue, but surprisingly even in the U.S., where these are needed most, there is no sense of urgency to adopt them immediately. One reason could be that the worst of the economic crisis has ended and this has led to complacency. In the U.S., banks that survived the crisis with very generous support from the government are declaring huge profits. Fortunately, the U.S administration is alive to the need for enhanced regulation, including the setting up of a new consumer financial protection agency. Banks in India are better regulated than their counterparts in the developed countries and state-ownership of a large segment of the financial sector has helped. Regulation should ensure a smooth transition by all banks to the adoption of the Basel II capital adequacy norms.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Dangers-of-complacency/article16884294.ece
3,10,2009,Next steps on Pakistan,"After the politically damaging controversy triggered by the Sharm-el-Sheikh joint declaration in July, it was perhaps too much to expect any real movement forward when the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan met in New York last week. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s instincts may be to keep finding ways of engagement with Islamabad but he also knows the only way this can happen is for Pakistan to demonstrate it has started seriously addressing Indian concerns. In the run up to New York, the Pakistani side made some attempt to improve the optics. Yet another dossier was handed over and two criminal cases were filed against the Lashkar-e-Taiba chief, Hafiz Saeed, though the refusal or failure of the police to arrest him or even place him under “protective custody” robbed the move of any real significance as far as New Delhi was concerned. By all accounts, the Indian delegation in New York received a comprehensive briefing from the Pakistanis on the progress made in the Mumbai terror attack case. In turn, they told their Pakistani interlocutors that India needs to wait and see how the cases that have been filed against key Lashkar operatives like Zaki-ur Rahman Lakhvi and Zarrar Shah play out once their trials formally begin next week.
Given the ups and downs in the bilateral relationship, the trust deficit, and the need to prepare the ground for confidence-building over the long-haul, India is entirely justified in reserving judgment until the trial actually commences and makes visible headway. As and when a certain comfort level is achieved, the threads of dialogue are likely to be picked up. But the problem of Lashkar’s terrorism is not simply legal. Sooner or later, Pakistan has to realise that these kinds of terrorist groups have to be confronted politically. Islamabad’s insistence on “evidence” and other legal niceties is all very well but those are not the tools it is using to deal with the threat the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and al-Qaeda are posing to it. The Inter Services Intelligence directorate may think it can manage the LeT and kindred groups for all time to come and that they will never pose an existential threat to Pakistan in the way the TTP does. Such a belief is seriously misplaced. The threat posed by such terrorist groups may be uneven but its impact on the future of Pakistan is uniformly destructive. There are already indications that the extremist menace has firmly taken root in southern Punjab. If left unattended, there is no telling where bomb blasts and sectarian massacres will take place next. Unfortunately, the ISI has not yet taken a decision to make the course correction that Pakistan so desperately needs. Until then, India should work out a viable strategy of engagement while taking all the internal measures needed to protect itself from terrorists based across the border.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Next-steps-on-Pakistan/article16884441.ece
3,10,2009,Glimmer of hope,"After more than two decades of relentless effort and several failures, there is a glimmer of hope, from the results of the Phase III HIV/AIDS vaccine clinical trial conducted in Thailand. The vaccine candidates used in the prime-boost trial that started six years ago and involved more than 16,000 volunteers in the 18-30 age group have been found to be safe and 31 per cent effective in preventing HIV infection. Compared to vaccines against other diseases, the efficacy of this vaccine is just modest. Yet, this is the first time that a vaccine to prevent HIV infection has reached this level of effectiveness. The two vaccine candidates — ALVAC-HIV and AIDSVAX — used in this trial had earlier failed in their objectives when tested individually on humans. That led to the idea of using two different candidates in a prime-boost vaccine strategy in fighting the virus. The Phase I AIDS vaccine trial under way at the Tuberculosis Research Centre, Chennai, and National AIDS Research Institute, Pune, is using such an approach. But unlike in the Thailand trial, the booster used in the trial in the two cities evoked very good immune response during the Phase-I trial last year at TRC.
While showing modest effectiveness in preventing HIV infection, the vaccines tested in Thailand failed in their second objective of reducing the viral load in those who had become infected. The reason for this is not known. There are several other important parameters that are not known as, for instance, the duration of immune response and the mechanisms by which the two vaccines together prevented the virus from infecting the volunteers. While the duration of protection will become known when the full results are presented next month at an Aids conference in Paris, it will take some time to know how exactly the vaccines work to protect against infection. The information will help researchers in designing prime-boost vaccine combinations that will be more effective and also the type of vaccines that will work in Africa, where the strain is different and the need is the greatest. Despite the modest protection offered, the vaccine will go a long way in bringing down the number of people who get infected every year. Since it is only partially effective, and drugs to clear the infection are currently not available, those who have been administered the vaccine should continue to use the time-tested preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Glimmer-of-hope/article16884437.ece
4,10,2009,Bravo Brazil,"In a bow towards global inclusiveness, the International Olympic Committee voted for Rio de Janeiro to host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games. The decision deserves to be celebrated not just by Brazilians: it marks the end of a longstanding script that, for whatever reason, shut South America out of the list of Games’ hosts. That the IOC session in Copenhagen overwhelmingly picked Rio ahead of Chicago and Tokyo, not to speak of Madrid, which lost 32-66 in a direct contest in the final round of voting, is significant. The Brazilian triumph is of course a reflection of the growing economic stature of the world’s fifth most populous nation (the ‘B’ in BRIC, the four-member grouping of fast-growing developing economies). As important is the consideration that the Games might leave an all-round sports legacy for a nation that has an iconic status in football, samba, and the Carnival. Unfortunately, the city of more than six million is also known for its crime and violence, which is why it scored poorly in safety and security when an IOC expert group analysed the bids of each of the seven original contestants against 11 criteria. As against this, Rio top-scored in government support and public opinion. The Brazilians have expressed the hope that the Games would help curb crime and solve transport, traffic, and accommodation problems in addition to providing employment opportunities over the next seven years. But in the final analysis, it was probably the emotional appeal of spreading the Games to South America, coupled with Rio’s inspired slogan, “live your passion,” that settled the issue.
The first-round elimination of Chicago — the one contest lost by master campaigner Barack Obama, who sportingly took time off his busy presidential schedule to lobby for his adopted hometown — was seen as a legacy of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal of 1998. The proposal of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) to create an exclusive Olympic television network may also have hastened the exit of Chicago, which was the bookmakers’ favourite. The IOC gets the bulk of its revenue, running into billions of dollars, from television rights every four years. The ever-spiralling cost of holding the Olympics has remained a matter of concern for the IOC with Beijing reportedly running up a bill of $40 billion for a Perfect 10 edition of the 29th Olympiad. Notwithstanding claims to the contrary, host cities have run up huge deficits in the past, Montreal in 1976 and Athens in 2004 being prime examples. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who along with the great Pele shed tears when IOC President Jacques Rogge made the announcement in Copenhagen, has plenty of hard work ahead of him.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Bravo-Brazil/article16884762.ece
4,10,2009,Unprecedented havoc,"North Karnataka and the districts along the Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers in Andhra Pradesh have been under water for a few days now. Heavy and persistent rains in some districts of northern Karnataka led to waterflows into the Krishna and its tributaries reaching unprecedented levels. The discharge from the Karnataka reservoirs touched a historic high of over 20 lakh cusecs on Friday-Saturday affecting Andhra Pradesh downstream. At one stage, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister K. Rosaiah had to appeal to his Karnataka counterpart B.S. Yediyurappa to stop releasing water from the Almati and Narayanpur dams, as the levels at Nagarjunasagar and Srisailam dams in Andhra had reached alarming levels. Gulbarga, Bijapur, Bellary, and Belgaum in Karnataka, as also Kurnool and Mehboobnagar in Andhra Pradesh were perhaps the worst-affected by last week’s flood fury. The temple town of Mantralayam was also submerged. At least 150 people have died in the floods and several lakhs have been rendered homeless. The Army, the Air Force, and the Navy have been called in to assist the two State governments, but people in many places hit by floods are yet to get relief.
The number of houses destroyed and the extent of damage to infrastructure such as highways, and railway tracks need to be properly assessed. Aside from carrying out immediate relief work, the Centre and the State governments must draw up medium- and long-term plans to mitigate the hardship and havoc caused by such calamities. There is need for a mechanism to coordinate actions such as releasing of surplus water from dams, issuing early warnings, and evacuating people from the vulnerable areas downstream. The Central Water Commission officials in Andhra Pradesh have complained that the State government and the district administration do not heed their early warnings. Given that the country has to contend against drought and floods at the same time, the need for galvanising the inter-State and Centre-State consultation mechanisms can hardly be over-emphasised. During the non-monsoon months, the State governments must make it a point to desilt the network of tributaries and canals and ensure that the dams are fully strengthened to withstand the stress of heavy inflows or discharge. While the State administrations rush to show their concern through high profile visits and promising relief measures on a “war-footing” after a calamity strikes, they have been lackadaisical when it came to taking preventive steps and this has proved very expensive in terms of the human cost.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Unprecedented-havoc/article16884761.ece
5,10,2009,Coping with natural disasters,"It has been a terrible period for countries in the Asia-Pacific region, with natural calamities of one kind or another bringing death and destruction to their lands. On September 26, Typhoon Ketsana ploughed through the Philippines before tearing into Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. The storm produced the worst flooding in decades across the northern Philippines, caused extensive damage in the countries it swept through, and killed several hundred people. Before the Filipinos could catch their breath, Typhoon Parma hurtled through the less populated north-eastern part of their island nation before heading towards Taiwan. On September 29, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake set off a lethal tsunami that levelled the idyllic Pacific islands of Samoa, American Samoa, and Tonga. The towering walls of water claimed many lives and wiped out whole villages. Less than a day later, a quake of magnitude 7.6 shook southern Sumatra in Indonesia. Some 1,000 people have been killed in the coastal city of Padang and it is feared thousands more lie trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings. The temblor has torn up roads, making it difficult to reach aid to devastated villages in the interior.
Natural disasters are, of course, beyond human control. But human action and inaction can profoundly affect their outcome, exacerbating or mitigating their effects on people. This point was forcefully made in the United Nations 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction. Although natural calamities strike the wealthier nations too, the risk of death and economic loss from such events is heavily concentrated in developing countries and within these countries, it is the poor who disproportionately suffer. As U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon observed: “Pre-emptive risk reduction is the key. Sound response mechanisms after the event, however effective, are never enough.” With just such foresight, Japan has been able to build one of the world’s most prosperous economies on densely populated islands that face the ever-present threat of earthquakes and tsunamis. India too is vulnerable to natural calamities. A report produced by the Central government a few years ago noted that about 60 per cent of the country is prone to earthquakes of various intensities; over 40 million hectares can be flooded; about eight per cent of the land can be hit by cyclones; and 68 per cent of its area is susceptible to drought. Governments in India and other developing countries must find practical ways to reduce their vulnerability to a variety of natural hazards that extract such a cruel toll from their people and economies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Coping-with-natural-disasters/article16884990.ece
5,10,2009,Land grab in god’s name,"The 2001 Census of India threw up the astonishing statistic that there were 2.4 million places of worship in the country (exceeding the number of schools, at 2.1 million). What it did not divulge of course was that a large number of them were unauthorised, built by encroaching on public land. On the face of it, the Supreme Court’s interim order banning the construction of any temple, church, gurudwara, or mosque on any roadside or other public space may seem like a mere reiteration of the law. But it must be seen in a larger context. It comes in the wake of a controversy over a sensitive issue that has resulted in a recent consensus between the Centre and the States that there would be no fresh construction of places of worship in public spaces. A directive by the Gujarat High Court in 2006 that all illegal structures, including places of worship, should be demolished resulted in violence following the demolition of a dargah in Vadodara. The approach of the Supreme Court, which stayed this directive following an appeal by the Centre, seems to strike a balance between opposing illegal religious structures and being responsive to the law and order problems that could result from their demolition.
Banning fresh construction of unauthorised places of worship is the easy part. The real challenge is to deal with existing illegal places of worship, of which there are an estimated more than 60,000 in Delhi alone. With respect to religious structures obstructing roads and public places, the court has adopted a cautious view — asking State governments and Union Territories to review them on a “case by case” basis and take appropriate steps expeditiously. These places of worship have been constructed through land grabbing in the name of God, usually by anti-social elements out to make a quick buck by exploiting the religious sentiments of the people. The mushrooming of these structures, encouraged by collusive politicians, has taken place under the nose of governmental authorities. They have often chosen to turn a blind eye to the encroachments, which in many places cause traffic snarls and occupy pavement space. The motive behind the defiance of law in such cases is no different from the rampant illegal construction of residential and office spaces; and the enabling factor, weak-kneed law enforcement, is more or less the same. In the case of illegal places of worship, the court is being asked to do what successive governments have failed to do over the years. One hopes that judicial resolve will jolt governments into intervening, without fear or favour, to prevent further construction of illegal religious structures and to find a way of tackling the problem of those that exist.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Land-grab-in-godrsquos-name/article16884991.ece
6,10,2009,The right steps towards Cuba,"In a clear expression of the United States President Barack Obama’s intentions, a senior State Department official held talks with Cuban officials in Havana last month. A wide range of issues was discussed under the ostensible topic of a resumption of direct U.S.-Cuban mail services, which the U.S. had suspended in August 1963. The recent exchanges, amounting to the two states’ closest dealings for 27 years, took six days in all. The U.S. envoy, Bisa Williams, an acting deputy assistant secretary of state, met the Cuban deputy foreign minister, Dagoberto Rodriguez, and other officials. In talks described by Josefina Vidal Ferreira, leader of the Cuban delegation, as “wide-ranging and useful,” topics covered included migration, drug-trafficking, and diplomatic practicalities. Ms Williams also met 15 prominent dissidents and attended a huge pop concert dedicated to peace. While this is the highest-level encounter between the two countries since President George W. Bush suspended contact in 2003, the hostile language used particularly by Republican U.S. presidents conceals the fact that U.S.-Cuban contacts have never ceased completely. Since 1963, the Swiss embassies in Havana and Washington have respectively hosted a U.S. and a Cuban Interests Section, and the Ford and Reagan administrations both met Cuban officials, including Fidel Castro on one occasion.
President Obama is keeping the tone subdued, so as to minimise opposition in the U.S. Three Cuban-born members of the House of Representatives have already criticised the talks. In fact Mr. Obama has signed a one-year extension of the Trading with the Enemy Act 1917, to maintain sanctions on Cuba. However, on a visit to Trinidad and Tobago in April, Mr. Obama said that the U.S. seeks “a new beginning” with Cuba, and he has ended the Bush administration’s block on travel and remittances by Cuban-Americans. The U.S. stands to gain from a normalisation of U.S.-Cuban links, which could mark a new beginning in its foreign relations, particularly in its attitude towards the developing world. Cuba has maintained extensive contact with almost all other states; it has aided other developing countries in their liberation struggles militarily and with its own highly-trained medical staff, and is rich in natural resources like nickel, cobalt, and oil. There is no doubt that Mr. Obama initiated the recent contact because he thinks it is the right thing to do. It is to be hoped that this laudable move will lead to the re-establishment of full relations between the U.S. and Cuba.
A correction: (A sentence in the first paragraph of the above editorial reads: “While this is the highest-level encounter between the two countries since President George W. Bush suspended contact in 2003, the hostile language used particularly by Republican U.S. presidents conceals the fact that U.S.-Cuban contacts have never ceased completely.” President Bush’s administration ended the twice-a-year migration talks with Havana in 2004, and not in 2003.)",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-right-steps-towards-Cuba/article16886526.ece
6,10,2009,Richly deserved,"The award of this year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Elizabeth H. Blackburn, Carol W. Greider, and Jack W. Szostak certainly came as no surprise. It was more a question of when, rather than whether, these three American scientists would win the coveted prize as their seminal collaborative research solved one of the greatest mysteries of our time — how chromosomes are protected from degradation as they divide continuously. The trio discovered that telomeres, the protective caps found at both ends of the chromosome, prevent it from degradation. While Dr. Blackburn and Dr. Szostak discovered that a unique DNA sequence in the telomeres, found in all organisms from amoeba to humans, protects the chromosomes, Dr. Blackburn and Dr. Greider found that the enzyme telomerase is responsible for restoring the length of the telomeres as they get worn out. But as humans grow older, the activity of the enzyme decreases, and hence its ability to maintain the length of the telomeres is compromised. This leads to a shortening of the telomeres, and ultimately to cellular senescence. While enzyme activity is high in the cells of newborns and stem cells, and is at a detectable level in many normal adult cell types, it is highly active in nearly 90 per cent of human tumours. Ironically, the higher activity in many malignancies seems responsible for maintaining the telomeres’ length and for delaying cellular senescence.
Apart from providing a powerful insight into the cellular mechanism, this scientific breakthrough has opened up a vast field of research aimed at finding ways to fight cancer. Several studies are in progress to find therapies and vaccines that would reduce the enzyme activity of cancer cells. Contrary to the earlier assumption that maintaining the level of telomerase activity in normal cells would delay the cellular aging process, and by extension, the aging of an organism, research has shown that the aging process is far more complex. One of Dr. Blackburn areas of collaborative research with interdisciplinary features reveals the effects of an external factor in telomere shortening. A landmark study found otherwise perfectly healthy pre-menopausal mothers of critically ill children who were more stressed, objectively and subjectively, than a control group had shorter telomeres. As a reviewer points out, the finding that prolonged and major stress, in and of itself, predicts worsening of some key cellular biomarkers of aging is of tremendous significance. Can meditation and other lifestyle interventions turn the clock back on telomere shortening of a morbid kind? We don’t know yet but there is an obvious advantage in exploring such interventions as they cost little in terms of money and time.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Richly-deserved/article16885212.ece
8,10,2009,How cells make proteins,"This year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry recognises the achievements of three scientists, one of them an Indian-born American, in painstakingly piecing together a detailed atomic model of the ribosome, a key component of living cells. All living organisms, from the simplest microbes to plants and animals, rely on ribosomes to turn the blueprints stored in their genes into the myriad proteins needed to produce and sustain life. The ribosome is an intricate molecular machine made up of hundreds of thousands of atoms. Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, Thomas A. Steitz, and Ada E. Yonath have successfully mapped the position of each of those atoms. By laying out the detailed structure of the ribosome, their work provides a window into the complex process by which ribosomes assemble proteins. It reveals too how that machinery could be targeted by antibiotics. Mapping the atoms of such a complicated structure using intense beams of x-rays has been a daunting task. Indeed, at one time, many scientists doubted it could be done. Credit must go to Dr. Yonath of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel for her pioneering contributions. In 1980, she made crystals of the ribosome’s large subunit, an essential first step for taking x-ray snapshots. But another 20 years would pass before she could generate images that allowed her to determine the location of each atom. Her work encouraged other scientists to enter the field.
Venki Ramakrishnan, who is now at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge, U.K., began working on ribosomes as a postdoctoral fellow at the Yale University in the U.S. Subsequently, he and his colleagues published the detailed structure of the ribosome’s smaller subunit. Every protein is made up of combinations of just 20 different amino acids. If the genetic code was misread and the wrong amino acid incorporated, the resulting protein might not function at all or, worse, perhaps work in a different fashion. Dr. Ramakrishnan’s work with the smaller subunit revealed a proofreading mechanism that is active during protein assembly in the ribosome. As a result, errors were limited to about one per 100,000 amino acids. Dr. Steitz cracked a key problem in how to go about interpreting the x-ray images. In addition, he and his collaborators showed how the chemical link between two amino acids was forged in the ribosome. Figuring out the details of the ribosomal structure has shed light on how many antibiotics work. But above all else this is a Nobel for outstanding science carried out by competing groups that has cleared up one more of Nature’s countless mysteries.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/How-cells-make-proteins/article16885534.ece
8,10,2009,No Afghan solutions for NATO,"The request by the United States and NATO commander in Afghanistan, General Stanley McChrystal, for an additional 40,000 troops sharply highlights NATO’s rapidly worsening problems. If President Barack Obama concedes Gen. McChrystal’s demand, the number of foreign troops in Afghanistan will rise to 140,000, including 110,000 Americans. There is, however, a void at the centre of NATO policy on Afghanistan. The original plans were to find Osama bin Laden, destroy Al Qaeda, and overthrow the Taliban regime, which harboured bin Laden. All those plans have failed disastrously, recoiling on the occupation forces. The Taliban were driven out of Kabul in five weeks. But they have never relinquished Helmand province in the southwest, and are now resurgent in the north and east. They control Kunduz and have just taken Nuristan, inflicting serious casualties on U.S. forces. Politically, NATO has had to collaborate with non-Taliban warlords, whose attitudes and ways are often not very different from those of the Taliban. In addition, the civilian government of Hamid Karzai is corrupt, bereft of legitimacy, and in any case barely exists outside Kabul. Independent observers regard at least a third of the votes for him in the yet-to-be-settled presidential election as fraudulent. Meanwhile, more than 31,000 Afghan civilians have died as a result of the NATO invasion, which occurred in October 2001. If the very recent suicide bombing near the Indian Embassy in Kabul is a guide, the Taliban may be re-establishing a presence in the capital. As to Osama bin Laden, he has never been found.
The issue of Afghanistan is now causing serious problems in several NATO countries, particularly the U.S., the United Kingdom, and Germany. The Obama administration has reproved Gen. McChrystal for making public his troop request. But it is not long since Mr. Obama himself castigated his predecessor George W. Bush for not listening to the military over Afghanistan and Iraq. Public support for the war is falling, and requests for substantial increases in troops and matriel are being likened to the huge and ineffectual U.S. troop increases in Vietnam in the 1960s. Al Qaeda continues to be a global threat but the Taliban are clearly not. At most they are a regional threat and it is surely significant that it is Pakistan’s armed forces that have dealt most effectively with that country’s Taliban elements when they have been set that task. NATO, confused about what this global war on terror is all about, cannot solve anything in Afghanistan. It is time for the world to move towards an enforceable U.N. agreement that ends the U.S.-led occupation and restores Afghanistan’s tradition of strict neutrality, so that the region can find some semblance of stability and peace.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/No-Afghan-solutions-for-NATO/article16885535.ece
8,10,2009,Harnessing light,"“The masters of light” is how the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences described Charles Kuen Kao, Willard Sterling Boyle, and George Elwood Smith to whom it awarded this year’s Nobel Prize in Physics. Dr. Kao wins half the prize for his role in the development of optical fibres that have revolutionised communications across the world. Drs. Boyle and Smith share the other half for their invention of an imaging sensor known as the CCD (or charge-coupled device). Working at the Standard Telecommunication Laboratories in the U.K. in the 1960s, Shanghai-born Dr. Kao began studying how light could be harnessed for long-distance communications. It was known that glass fibres could carry light. But the problem was that 99 per cent of the light put in at one end of a fibre was dissipated by the time it travelled just 20 metres. Dr. Kao and his small team set themselves the goal of extending that distance to at least one kilometre. The bottleneck was not imperfections in the fibre, as was thought to be the case, but impurities in the glass. Dr. Kao and his co-workers showed that glass fibres made from fused silica had the purity needed for optical communications. These days, more than 95 per cent of the light is left even after being carried one kilometre in a modern optical fibre. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic at the famed Bell Labs in the U.S., Drs. Boyle and Smith were trying to come up with a better electronic memory. The device they produced — the CCD — became instead a way of electronically capturing images.
Optical fibres, carrying once unimaginable amounts of information, have made the world a far smaller place. Cables that contain thousands of glass fibres, each thinner than a hair, straddle the globe. The worldwide fibre optical network already has a total length of over one billion kilometres, sufficient to encircle the globe 25,000 times — and is growing every hour. These fibres link continents, countries, and communities, carrying valuable data and telephone conversations. The optical fibre is the backbone of the Internet, taking web pages, emails, chats, Skype calls, YouTube videos, and much else instantly across the globe. The video and images that are being transmitted in this fashion are likely to come from cameras equipped with a CCD or a similar device. Photographic film has vanished; instead there are mobile phone cameras that work using a CCD. The magnificent pictures taken by the space-orbiting telescopes like the Hubble and powerful ground-based ones too rely on such sensors. So do cameras on spacecraft that orbit Earth and go out into space. In his will, Alfred Nobel declared that the prizes in his name should go to those who “shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind.” This year’s Nobel Prize in Physics certainly meets that criterion.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Harnessing-light/article16885356.ece
8,10,2009,Wait for sustained recovery,"In its most recent update, the International Monetary Fund has confirmed that global economic outlook has turned positive after a deep recession, which is by far the most categorical assertion by any major institution. Other forecasts including an earlier one by the IMF had pointed to the recession ending. But all those have been less clear about global economic growth setting in. For instance, in mid-September U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke had said that even the U.S. — among the most affected countries — was coming out of recession, but stopped short of putting out figures for a recovery. Mr. Bernanke’s statement made on the eve of G20 Summit at Pittsburgh had hinted at a tapering off of the monetary and fiscal stimulus packages. However, the consensus at the G20 meeting was on the stimulus continuing until signs of recovery are more clearly discernible across the globe. In what was seen as the biggest challenge to their domestic public finances, it was agreed that individual countries, despite their soaring deficits, spiralling debt, and the threat of inflation, would not do anything to stop the recovery in its tracks. Even the latest IMF forecast does not recommend a reversal of policies that have helped them prevent a much deeper crisis on a global scale.
The IMF, which has generally been less pessimistic than its peers — notably the World Bank — has forecast global activity to expand by about 3.1 per cent in 2010 after contracting by about one per cent in 2009. Advanced economies which are estimated to contract by 3.5 per cent this year will post a modest growth of 1.25 per cent in 2010. Economic rebound is driven by China, India and a number of emerging Asian economies, notably Indonesia. For both China and India, the IMF has revised its earlier estimates upwards to 9 per cent and 6.4 per cent respectively. Countries in West Asia are predicted to grow by 4.2 per cent in 2010, more than double the projected rate for 2009. The IMF has admitted that the pace of recovery is slow and economic activity remains far below the pre-crisis levels. For recovery to be sustained and more broad-based, there has to be a rebalancing of the global economy. The broad principles for reforming financial regulation agreed upon must be implemented vigorously. Despite the slight improvement in the global outlook, there is no room for complacency, for there is no guarantee that the large financial players will not revert to their old ways.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Wait-for-sustained-recovery/article16885354.ece
9,10,2009,Keep out the armed forces,"An intelligent response by the Indian state to Naxalite violence must necessarily be multi-dimensional, dealing with the problem in all its aspects. Long-term strategies to address the socioeconomic roots of the problem must be combined with short-term tactics of firmly combating kidnapping, murder, and targeted violence. However, the suggestion to use the Air Force to counter the threat holds disturbing implications. For a start, it sends out a signal of desperation. The Indian Air Force chief, Air Chief Marshal P.V. Naik, did well to clarify that the IAF did not intend to carry out any Rambo-style operations against the Maoists. The IAF had only asked the Defence Ministry for permission to open fire in self-defence following the downing of a helicopter during the Chhattisgarh Assembly election last year. The request was to ensure that the IAF could quell fire aimed at its helicopters on relief missions. According to the IAF chief, the Garud Special Forces unit would be present in the helicopters involved in rescue work in areas under the influence of Naxalites, and would defend personnel and equipment against any attack. But there will be no bombing or indiscriminate firing against targets, real or imagined, in the countryside. As a rule, the armed forces ought not to be involved in dealing with internal security issues; and bombing of civilian areas cannot be contemplated by any civilised society.
True, the state is constitutionally and legally empowered to use instruments of violence. But the rules and norms governing such use have to be placed on a higher plane than the standards adopted by extremist forces, which do not hesitate to target innocents. There are times when the state needs to use its inherent powers to intervene quickly and effectively to protect citizens. But every instance of unjust use of violence, including sponsored vigilantism of the Salwa Judum kind, erodes the state’s credibility, legitimacy, and authority. It is a betrayal of the trust reposed in it by the people. Naxalites, and indeed armed extremists of all hues, thrive by provoking state violence and inviting repression not just on themselves but on the civilian population as a whole. The Indian state must not lose sight of the long-term goals of addressing social and economic inequities, and achieving development targets. Providing social opportunity, tackling unemployment, and ensuring sustainable livelihoods are the ways to deal with extremist organisations that seek to alienate the people from the state by taking up these very same issues. The last thing democratic India needs is a spiral of violence, counter-violence, repression, and further extremist provocations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Keep-out-the-armed-forces/article16885758.ece
9,10,2009,Greece turns left,"On October 4, Greek voters gave the Panhellenic Socialist Party (PASOK), led by George Papandreou, a resounding mandate for change. In the mainly-proportional electoral system, PASOK won an outright majority with 160 seats out of 300, on a vote share of 43.9 per cent. This marks a huge defeat for the incumbent New Democracy party and its leader Kostas Karamanlis. He had called a mid-term election in face of the perceived challenges such as the economic crisis, high-level corruption scandals, and widespread rioting over the police killing of a 15-year-old boy in Athens in December 2008. The incoming government inherits a situation in which the national debt is greater than the GDP, a budget deficit at about 6 per cent of economic output, extensive tax evasion, and public institutions noted for wasteful spending. Mr. Papandreou’s political inheritance — he is the third in his family to become prime minister — will be one of his assets. But in the present context, he has other and probably stronger ones. Born in the United States and educated at the London School of Economics and Harvard, Mr. Papandreou prefers to work for a consensus on most issues, and in general has a manner and style closer to that of Northern European or Scandinavian social democrats. He also has a record of political achievement; as foreign minister in the 1990s, he brought about major improvements in Greece’s long-troubled relations with Turkey and Albania. In addition, his position within PASOK has been greatly strengthened by his victory in a fierce leadership dispute that followed a second successive election defeat in 2007.
The new prime minister promises to clean up and reform government, to crack down on tax fraud, and to deal with illegal immigration. Mr. Papandreou also has the larger task of restoring trust in public life and institutions, and much will depend on the success or otherwise of his €3 billion stimulus package. He will, however, be under pressure. The European Union may grant the two-year extension he seeks in order to reduce the budget deficit by 50 per cent, but will demand pension reforms which will need assent from powerful public-service unions. Secondly, corruption and waste are endemic in Greek political life irrespective of the party in government. But other recent developments may well help PASOK. The party has regained votes on its left; and, in September, the centre-left Portuguese prime minister, José Socrates, held on to win the general election. Mr. Papandreou can draw strength from the fact that Southern European voters are looking left for stability, probity, and leadership.

11,10,2009,The burden of expectations,"The decision to award the highly prestigious Nobel Peace Prize to United States President Barack Obama has clearly taken the world by surprise even as Mr. Obama himself seems a bit overwhelmed by the extraordinary gesture. It reflects the tremendous hope that has underlined the emergence of Mr. Obama as a world figure on whom is placed the burden of enormous expectations. The Nobel committee’s logic appears to be a proactive one. The peace prize is not just about recognising achievement. It is also meant to be a catalyst for positive change. The entire world knows that Mr. Obama has triggered strong opposition from the American establishment for his bold ideas on nuclear disarmament, his advocacy of dialogue with Iran, North Korea, and even Myanmar, and his emphasis on the need for a just resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli dispute based on mutual recognition of the inalienable rights of both peoples to security and sovereignty. If the President has so far managed to take only baby steps in the direction of all these goals, one reason could be the extent to which his ideas are being opposed by entrenched interests and lobbies in the U.S.
This said, the conferring of the Nobel award on a leader young in office and still relatively untested has evoked criticism. The decision has been seen in some quarters as premature, going against the tradition which has indeed boosted the Nobel Peace Prize’s prestige, that the award is given in recognition of actual achievements in bringing about peace. Like every politician with a feel for global politics and power, Mr. Obama must long have nurtured the ambition of achieving that recognition. He might have preferred winning the award when the fruits of his promised diplomatic exertions become a little more apparent. The gestation period for the birth of peace in West Asia is obviously longer than the nine months Mr. Obama has been in the White House for. The promised abolition of nuclear weapons would not happen in his lifetime, the U.S. President has famously said in Prague earlier this year. But intermediate arms control can be accomplished in a matter of months and it would seem that the Norwegians could have waited at least until 2010 when his selection would have looked less arbitrary and premature. Perhaps the Nobel committee hopes the peace prize will increase Mr. Obama’s domestic bargaining power while simultaneously making it harder for him to abandon the course he has set should the political pressure get unbearable. Yet this high level assertion of faith in Mr. Obama’s sincerity and capability should make it easier for him to take bold strides in diplomatic initiatives in West Asia and on the disarmament front.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-burden-of-expectations/article16886102.ece
11,10,2009,Call for restraint,"Corporate Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid’s exhortation to the corporate sector to eschew large compensation packages to the chief executives and other members of the top management has to be seen in perspective. The appeal is certainly not the first by a minister, nor will it be the last asking companies to exercise restraint in an area that has come under international scrutiny. The Prime Minister had made a similar appeal two years ago. Perceptions, though not necessarily hard facts, have from time to time driven many observers to ask for a check on “lavish” salaries and perquisites in the top echelons of the corporate sector. In an earlier era when the Indian private sector depended heavily on the government, the practice was to dictate norms on matters that are elsewhere left to the domain of the shareholders. The legacy has however continued in the post-reform era. There are provisions in the Companies Act that subject executive compensation to legislative guidelines: the objective is to link it to the net profits of the company. The managing director’s compensation cannot exceed five per cent of the net profits and for directors including non-executive directors the limit is 11 per cent. Loss-making companies too are subject to specific guidelines. Besides, companies will have to disclose in their balance sheets full details of compensation packages above a certain level.
In the financial sector internationally, large compensation and bonus packages tied with short-term results led to excessive risk taking and an inordinate focus on short-term performance. Mr. Khurshid’s appeal has less to do with extra-large compensation packages endangering long-term corporate health and more with the flaunting of wealth by a few of the beneficiaries. The issue is not really whether the CEOs and other top managers deserve them or whether they would leave if they are not so compensated. In the context of mass poverty and at a time when the government has embarked on an austerity drive, compensation packages that seem so totally lopsided in relation to the average level of wages and the vulgar flaunting of wealth by a few at the top of the corporate pyramid do seem invidious. The corporate sector as a whole needs to be sensitive to these concerns. Some of the highest compensation packages are paid to the CEOs who are also promoters of the company. For the promoter-CEOs, dividend income is a bigger source of wealth creation. They, more than the professional executives, must heed the call to exercise restraint.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Call-for-restraint/article16886101.ece
13,10,2009,Dismantle terror infrastructure,"The deadly attack on the Pakistan military headquarters at Rawalpindi has shown a new level of boldness and tactical daring among militant groups in that country. The increasingly sinister character of the militant designs was apparent in this strike wherein commandos of the all-powerful Pakistani Army were locked in an 18 to 20 hour stand-off with the militants who came close to taking over a military building and took several hostages. Sure enough, the security forces were swift to respond, freeing 39 hostages in a fairly clean operation. Three hostages were killed along with four militants, indicating that the operation had been a difficult one. The result of a costly intelligence and security lapse, the attack exposed the extreme vulnerability of the Pakistani state to the militant threat. Further, despite the gravity of the challenge these groups pose, Pakistan has held on to a distinction between “good” and “bad” jihadists — the “good” being the Taliban in Afghanistan and the Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Jaish-e-Mohmmed waging a jihad against India and the “bad” of course being those who directly challenge the Pakistani state. But Saturday’s attack on the heart of Pakistan’s military establishment has proved beyond doubt that such distinctions do not exist. The militant captured alive at GHQ, identified as Aqeel alias Dr. Usman, has links to several anti-India jihadist groups such as the Harkat-ul-Jihad-i-Islami and the Jaish-e-Mohammed, and also to the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, the Sipah-e-Sahaba, the Taliban and the al-Qaeda.
This incident underlines afresh that even though some of these groups were banned after 9/11, they have continued to exist and operate freely. It also demonstrates to the world and the United States in particular that India’s contention as regards Pakistan’s continuing links with jihadi terrorist groups is based on the ground reality. Pakistan has opposed a condition in the controversial Kerry-Lugar legislation passed recently by the U.S. Congress that Pakistan must cease support to the LeT and the Jaish, besides the al-Qaeda and the Taliban, in order to qualify for security aid. It is now clear that these groups pose as big a threat to Pakistan’s stability as to India or Afghanistan. The Pakistan Army and government have indicated that they are preparing for an all-out assault on the Taliban headquarters in South Waziristan. But it is clearly more important for Pakistan to dismantle the entire infrastructure of terror and militancy — irrespective of whether it is Pakhtun or Punjabi — as it exists within the country’s boundaries today. There is no other option for Pakistan’s leaders but to shed their ambivalence about the role of the jihadi groups and confront them head-on.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Dismantle-terror-infrastructure/article16886288.ece
13,10,2009,Migration benefits,"The 2009 Human Development Report on migration marks a paradigm shift in attitude with its call for easing barriers to human movement within and across borders. In the process, the report shatters many myths, including the belief that it is largely international and towards Northern America. Between 2000 and 2002, 72 per cent of Indian emigrants moved to a country within Asia. In a significant contribution to our understanding of the phenomenon, it establishes that migrants enrich individual, family, and community life — at the exit as well as the entry points. This finding ought to help break the stereotyping of migrants as a people who adversely affect the surroundings. In the conventional wisdom, international migrants cause a ‘brain drain’ in origin countries and, except for a minuscule percentage at the higher end, take away jobs and strain precious resources. The HDR argues the opposite. Immigrants do not crowd out locals from the job market. Rather they boost economic output by encouraging investment in new businesses and initiatives. The report points to “a massive 15 per cent” per capita increase in the patents issued in the United States as a consequence of a mere 1.3 per cent rise in the share of migrant university graduates.
While cautioning against migration becoming a substitute for development in the countries of origin, the report acknowledges its many benefits to parent communities: new ideas, jobs, social dividends in the form of higher school enrolment, and empowerment of women. In many countries, including India, remittances exceed foreign aid and Foreign Direct Investment. The HDR’s single most important finding is the strong positive correlation between migration and poverty reduction. Although the poorest people are the least mobile, and face the most barriers to movement, they gain the maximum from emigrating by way of an increase in income, higher enrolment in schools, and a reduction in child mortality. Internal migration leads to upward mobility and financial rewards, though life in the city often means crowding into slums. In a small number of cases, migration is forced by conflict, displacement, and other negative factors. But on the whole, the HDR makes an overwhelming case for enabling migration. Internationally, this is a time of hardening attitudes towards immigration and outsourcing. Internally, it is a warning to all those proponents of ‘sons of soil’ chauvinism who have made a career out of slandering and mistreating migrants.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Migration-benefits/article16886291.ece
14,10,2009,More signs of recovery,"There is little room for ambiguity in interpreting the recently released data on the index of industrial production (IIP). Industrial output recorded a 10.4 per cent year-on-year jump in August on top of a 7.2 per cent increase in July. It can be argued that the double-digit growth, the highest in 22 months, was partly due to the base effect: last year the IIP increased by just 1.69 per cent. However, a great deal of corroborative evidence is emerging that points to a consolidation of the recovery phase that began in June. There has been a sequential growth since May when the IIP grew by just 2.1 per cent. The rate shot up to 8.21 per cent in June. It is noteworthy that both in July and August manufacturing, which accounts for 80 per cent of the index, grew at almost the same rate as the overall index. Mining and electricity output, both growing in double digits, were significantly higher than last year. All these suggest that the recovery is more evenly spread than what was previously thought. Further corroboration of that is seen from the fact that 14 out of the 17 segments of the manufacturing sector saw growth in August, seven of them by at least 10 per cent. Altogether during the three-month period, June-August, the increase in the IIP has been at a healthy 8.6 per cent, sharply higher than the 4.5 per cent last year.
There is also sectoral evidence confirming the consolidation of industrial recovery. For instance, the two important segments of manufacturing — transportation equipment, and machinery and equipment — grew by 13.8 per cent and 14.2 per cent respectively. There is a big spurt in passenger car sales, with many popular models available only after a waiting period. Textile products clocked an impressive 16.4 per cent growth mainly due to a surge in domestic demand ahead of the festival season. It is also noteworthy that exports of garments are recovering, albeit slightly. Textiles have been among the worst affected by the sharp contraction in exports. Consumer durables have continued their remarkable run, growing by over 22 per cent. The implementation of the Pay Commission award is said to be the main reason. For policy makers, however, the strong rebound in the IIP numbers notwithstanding, the time is not opportune to phase out the stimulus packages or to move towards monetary tightening. The economy grew by 6.1 per cent during the first three months and the expectations are that until it moves into a higher trajectory the stimulus measures will continue.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/More-signs-of-recovery/article16886718.ece
14,10,2009,End Lashkar’s impunity,"It has been apparent from last December that the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, the Lashkar-e-Taiba’s parent organisation remains defiant and unfazed by the sanctions imposed upon it by the United Nations Security Council, with its leaders brushing aside the international condemnation, asserting that it would have little effect on their activities. It is becoming evident that the defiance was well-founded. On Monday, a Lahore court dismissed the First Information Reports filed reluctantly by the Pakistani authorities against JuD chief Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, holding that the organisation was legal and his pursuits were therefore legitimate. Just in August, the Pakistan government had told the National Assembly that the JuD was among the 25 organisations it had proscribed. It is now clear that the assertion was untrue. Global pressure had mounted on Pakistan to act against the JuD after the November carnage in Mumbai. On December 10, the UNSC imposed sanctions against the JuD, as well as four of its key leaders. Pakistan’s ambassador to the United Nations, Abdullah Hussain Haroon, promised his country would comply by proscribing the JuD and freezing its assets. Nothing was done. Pakistan’s investigation of the Mumbai November attack has been half-hearted. Key Lashkar operatives — among them Muzammil Bhat, the military commander who organised it — remain at large. More important, the group’s training camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Punjab are still functional.
Pakistan’s reluctance to act against the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, as well as other anti-India jihadist groups like the Jaish-e-Mohammad, appears made up of two distinct elements. First, the jihadist organisations reared by Pakistan’s covert services to wage war against India have developed formidable patronage networks that include schools, seminaries, and hospitals. Few in Pakistan’s strategic establishment see reason to take on organisations which many in Pakistan see as pious patriots. Secondly, Pakistan’s military continues to believe that anti-India jihadist groups — unlike the Tehreek-e-Taliban or Lashkar-e-Jhangvi — are assets, not enemies. Neither argument is, on point of fact, sustainable. The charitable operations of jihadist groups have an unacceptable price-tag: a climate of hate and violence that has driven Pakistan to the edge of the abyss. Nor has the jihadist campaign against India delivered security to Pakistan; quite the contrary, it has further endangered internal security. Islamabad clearly needs to engage in some serious introspection. Given the Lashkar’s global reach, the world has an interest in pushing that process along — and in ensuring that the impunity the feared terrorist group enjoys in Pakistan comes to an early end.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/End-Lashkarrsquos-impunity/article16886478.ece
14,10,2009,A welcome move,"The lack of credible information makes property transactions difficult, hazardous, and at times traumatic for the buyers. To remove the information asymmetry, protect consumer interests, and make real estate transactions easier, the government has proposed to make registration of all real estate projects (meant for sale) mandatory. It has published a draft legislation — Model Real Estate (Regulation of Development) Act — that provides for a Regulatory Authority for the purpose. The registration process will require disclosure of information of a project and this in turn will be made accessible through the Authority’s website. The developers may view the creation of one more authority and more procedures as time-consuming and cost-escalating. But when market fails to self-regulate and exploitative practices abound, the state has a responsibility to intervene and put in place a regulatory system. The urgent need for bringing about greater accountability in this area is highlighted by the fact that a recent survey of 82 real estate markets in the world placed India at as low a rank as 50 in respect of Tier 1 cities.
The draft law also represents a significant step forward in safeguarding the interests of buyers. Under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, buyers can seek redress for defective delivery of apartments, deficiency of services and such other lapses. But this relief is available only towards the end of the life cycle of the property transaction. Nor does it significantly enhance transparency in the real estate sector as a whole. On the other hand, the proposed legislation not only provides for a system of compensation and penalty where buyers are victims of unscrupulous builders. It also stipulates that the buyers be given property information packets early enough so that they could take an informed decision before the costs are incurred. In this, it has taken the cue from the practices adopted in countries like the United Kingdom and the emirate of Dubai. For the attempt to regulate the real estate market to succeed, however, a whole lot of related systems — land records management, property registration processes, and so on – have to be rationalised and improved. Ideally, a system of the kind in vogue in the United Kingdom — where the National House-Building Council, an independent body comprising consumer and industry representatives, offers a 10-year warranty to buyers of apartments in projects registered with it — is what one should aim at. Till such a system is evolved, state-initiated regulations are necessary to protect consumer interests.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-welcome-move/article16886479.ece
15,10,2009,The dollar’s fall,"The dollar, which has been under pressure in the global foreign exchange markets recently, fell to a 14-month low against the euro. Over the past six months, the American currency has depreciated in trade-weighted terms by as much as 11.5 per cent in relation to currencies such as the yen, the euro, as well as the Canadian, New Zealand, and Australian dollars. The weakening dollar has made exports from the U.S. more competitive. By the same token, exports from countries whose currencies have strengthened are losing their edge in the all-important American market. While global imbalances are being corrected, a precipitous fall in the exports of other countries will certainly not be good news for the global economy that is slowly coming out of the recession. The U.S. economy continues to suffer from structural deficiencies. For instance, its level of external debt is very high and the fiscal deficit is almost 13.5 per cent of its GDP. However, partly aided by the currency depreciation, the U.S. has made impressive strides in trimming its current account deficit to nearly a half of what it was at the start of the financial crisis. On the domestic front, the falling dollar has become a political issue, with the Obama administration coming under pressure to intervene and stem its fall. That would involve, among others, pushing up the interest rates, a course of action unlikely to be accepted as it will imperil recovery in the U.S., and given also the broad agreement among leading countries to keep the stimulus measures in place for some more time.
The decline in the dollar has revived the debate over its role as the world’s principal currency. It is the currency of choice in trade transactions and the undisputed benchmark in currency trading around the world. This is not the first time that a terminal decline of the dollar has been predicted. Yet no real alternative has emerged as a safe haven currency. At present, 65 per cent of the world’s reserves are in dollars and 25 per cent in euro. There would be some shift over the next few years, but the dollar’s supremacy is unlikely to be challenged for a long time to come. Even its current fall is viewed by Paul Krugman and others as a symbol of success of the measures to revive the world economies including the U.S. economy, not as a sign of weakness. Simply stated, at the height of the crisis, investors flocked to the dollar, the traditional refuge currency. The dollar is merely climbing down from the inflated values to which it was pushed up. In India, the sharp appreciation of the rupee caused also by the surging portfolio inflows is posing major policy challenges.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-dollarrsquos-fall/article16886952.ece
15,10,2009,Improving public housing,"A survey of cityscapes would testify that urban development polices and programmes have not been sufficiently inclusive. The Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation concedes that even the City Development Plans funded through the flagship programme Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) have not adequately addressed the concerns of the urban poor, especially the slum dwellers. This, the Ministry believes, has more to do with the lack of reliable data than anything else. As a corrective, it has gone in for an extensive enumeration of the slums in various cities and set up a committee to take another look at the numbers relating to affordable housing. Efforts to improve and update the data are undoubtedly necessary, but to frame the issue entirely as a matter of inaccurate statistics will be to miss the point and deflect responsibility. The Ministry’s progress report shows that of the 14.5 lakh dwelling units sanctioned under JNNURM that are expected to be completed by 2012 only about 1.3 lakh units have been built so far. The Eleventh Five-Year Plan estimates too show the supply of housing units for the poor is inadequate. Such delays cause cost overruns and affect affordability.
Countries such as the United Kingdom that faced similar problems have put in place a range of construction improvement initiatives and process innovations. Since 2005, public sector construction agencies in the U.K. are expected to reduce the pre-construction time leading up to the award of contract by 25 per cent. These measures are estimated to increase the delivery of units four-fold and bring in savings of the order of 10 per cent of the annual construction capital costs. It is time the government agencies in India opted for radically improved construction standards, enhanced technologies, and efficient management practices. Much remains to be done on the policy front too. The government assumes that its directive to reserve 20-25 per cent of developed land in private and public housing project for economically weaker sections would deliver results. However, this provision has been so diluted that it has contributed very little to affordable housing, as evidenced by the ground reality in several cities. The experience in quite a few countries shows that unless such a stipulation is applied to smaller development projects also — not just to the larger ones — the supply of affordable housing will not increase in any significant degree. Without a total overhaul of the housing agencies and their mechanisms of supply at the level of the States, affordable housing will remain a mirage.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Improving-public-housing/article16886951.ece
15,10,2009,A step forward on Iran,"The recent meeting in Geneva between Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany (P5+1) is proof that a rational dialogue conducted without preconditions is a far better way of resolving a dispute than the issuing of threats and diktats. It is too early to say whether the corner has been turned. But Iran’s willingness to send a major part of its accumulated stocks of low-enriched uranium (LEU) to Russia for further enrichment and ultimate use for medical purposes within the country is a major confidence-building measure. The Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) needs LEU enriched to 19.75 per cent for the production of molybdenum 99 (99Mo), a key isotope used in medical imaging procedures for cancer diagnostics. The fact that Iran has decided not to exercise its right to enrich uranium beyond the 3.5 per cent level currently being produced by its Natanz facility ought to help allay Washington’s suspicions about the true nature of the Iranian nuclear programme. More than that, by agreeing to use its existing LEU as the feedstock for Russia’s eventual supply of enriched uranium for the TRR, Iran is telling the west that its fears about some future diversion of Natanz throughput for weapons purposes are unfounded.
For those sections of the U.S. and Israeli establishments that were trying to build a case that the Iranian civil nuclear programme posed a clear and present danger to the region and the world, Tehran’s willingness to send its LEU stocks out of the country should be an eye-opener. Iran has also agreed to the International Atomic Energy Agency’s request for a speedy preliminary visit to the new enrichment facility being built near Qom. In exchange for these Iranian gestures, the U.S. has decided not to press ahead with fresh coercive moves for the time being, though its ability to get the UNSC, let alone the P5+1, to agree to more sanctions, is itself questionable. The Geneva meeting was also significant because it represented the first proper political contact between the Obama administration and Iran. A second meeting to tie up the arrangements for the TRR deal will take place later this month. Once that happens and the contrived urgency with which Washington was dealing with the Iranian issue abates, one hopes President Obama will come good on his campaign promise to engage Tehran across the full range of issues that have kept the two sides estranged for three decades now. The Nobel peace prize was awarded to him, in part, because of the welcome change his administration represents over that of his predecessors. Resolving 30 years of mistrust will not be easy for either side but a sincere start must be made, and made soon.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-step-forward-on-Iran/article16886717.ece
17,10,2009,Looking ahead,"It is reassuring that a positive and statesmanlike initiative by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi has been matched by a like response from Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa. There can be little doubt that the five-day visit by a group of ten parliamentarians of the State’s ruling combine to Sri Lanka, for a first-hand assessment of the conditions of the nearly 250,000 war-displaced Tamils housed in government-run camps in the north, has contributed to a better understanding of the prevailing situation in the island nation. After months of confusion and misperceptions, influential sections of the Tamil Nadu polity have had a rare opportunity to come to terms with the realities of post-Prabakaran Sri Lanka. There appears to be a readiness to look ahead towards practical solutions rather than behind to a benighted past dominated by calamitous violence, terrorism, and illfare in the cause of a secessionist struggle that never had a chance of achieving its proclaimed goal. By enabling the delegation freely to visit the refugee camps in Vavuniya district, Jaffna town, and plantation areas where Indian-origin Tamils are settled, Sri Lanka demonstrated a far-sighted willingness to accommodate the sensitivities of political parties in Tamil Nadu. In concrete terms, the mission can be commended for obtaining an assurance from President Rajapaksa that 58,000 displaced Tamils in the camps would be returned to their homes in a fortnight’s time, and that the remaining Tamils would be resettled gradually, as soon as de-mining operations permitted a safe return to their areas.
President Rajapaksa clearly has his priorities right — the first priority being the duty of the state to take care of the immediate basic needs and the safety of its Tamil citizens displaced during the fierce endgame of a three-decade-long civil war. To send the displaced people home in the absence of conditions assuring their safety from landmines and the minimum infrastructure needed to carry on life and work would have been an abdication of the government’s responsibility to its own citizens. The victims of the civil war need all the help they can get from their government, aided generously by India, other foreign governments, and genuine international aid agencies, to rebuild their lives and future. The Sri Lankan government must be encouraged to be more open and liberal in its policy towards people who were once in thrall to the LTTE; this would imply that only those who had organisational links with the extremist outfit need to be retained in the camps after the de-mining exercise is completed. The search for a just and enduring political solution acceptable to the Tamils, the Muslims, and the majority Sinhalese needs to be speeded up but the reality is that this can come only after the displaced Tamils are returned, in substantial measure, to their areas and after the presidential and parliamentary elections are completed by the first half of 2010.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Looking-ahead/article16887145.ece
17,10,2009,Klaus tries to scratch the EU,"The Czech President, Václav Klaus, is causing considerable irritation among his fellow heads of state and government in the European Union by not signing the Treaty of Lisbon. The Czech Republic is the only one of the 27 EU states yet to ratify the Treaty, which all member-states signed on December 13, 2007. Both chambers of the country’s parliament have approved the Treaty, and the constitutional court has ruled it does not violate the constitution. Mr. Klaus nevertheless has raised objections at this very late stage. He demands exemptions from the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is a part of the Treaty, and new provisions to protect the Czech Republic against claims arising from the expulsion of Carpathian Germans after the Second World War. He seeks to bolster his case by pointing out that Poland and the United Kingdom specifically obtained exemptions from the Treaty (although this happened before the ratification process began). Mr. Klaus’s demands, if conceded, would require a repetition of the ratification process in all 27 EU states. As the process has taken eight years and is still incomplete, that is something no member-government wants.
Not surprisingly, even the Czech parliament is growing restive and there is talk of impeachment if Mr. Klaus does not heed the constitutional court’s ruling. One solution would be for the other 26 states to issue a declaration accepting his demands; Irish concerns were thus accommodated after Ireland rejected the Treaty in June 2008. The Treaty, which contains some genuine improvements, including a substantial foreign policy role, over previous EU arrangements, has been criticised for being an EU constitution smuggled in by the back door after the French and Dutch voters rejected it; the EU’s reaction to the Irish rejection was close to casuistry; and the Treaty has not allayed the remoteness the people of the member-states feel from its institutions. Mr. Klaus, however, may only be trying to keep his own political career afloat. He cannot be President again after his term expires in 2013, and his Civic Democratic Party is cool towards him. So he may be attempting to cast himself as a Eurosceptic on a pan-European stage, unmindful of the damage he does. It is important to ensure that this political adventurer is not allowed that opportunity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Klaus-tries-to-scratch-the-EU/article16887548.ece
18,10,2009,How to end this discordance,"The tone, although not the substance, of India-China relations has recently been through a problematical phase, with misperceptions and motivated media campaigns creating the impression of some kind of crisis. That this is not so has been made clear by the governments of both countries; in their own ways, they have made the point that the positive overall trend of the “China-India Strategic and Cooperative Partnership for Peace and Prosperity” remains unaffected. What then is the problem? The answer needs to be explored in historical perspective, against the background of the post-1962 bilateral relationship. The reality of the past two decades is that the parallel rise of the two giant neighbours, economically and politically, on the world stage and the various specific bilateral steps taken have helped mature, diversify, and deepen the relationship. China is India’s largest trading partner, high-level political visits and exchanges have now become the norm, people-to-people ties have grown, and common interests and positions have been identified on key international issues — notably trade, climate change, and the need to counter protectionism. But above all, the long and complicated boundary between India and China has remained peaceful and tranquil, free from any destabilising incidents.
It is worth recalling that the breakthrough that made all this possible was a high-level political accord forged with helmsman Deng Xiaoping by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi during his December 1988 visit to China. The historic accord, which was elaborated and firmed up in bilateral agreements and vision documents concluded in 1993, 1996, 2003, 2005, and 2008, and in a number of practical arrangements developed over the two decades, was this. While the two sides would do their best to arrive at a fair, reasonable, and mutually acceptable settlement of the boundary dispute, they would strictly maintain “peace and tranquillity” along the Line of Actual Control (LoAC) pending a settlement. Meanwhile, the differences would not be allowed to obstruct the all-round development of bilateral relations. Not surprisingly given the political sensitivities of both sides, the Special Representative talks on the boundary question have made only slow progress. The real problem is not the slow pace but the periodic public reiteration of maximal territorial claims, which guarantee tit-for-tat and have unintended negative effects for the bilateral relationship by stoking nationalistic sentiment in both countries. This practice goes against the spirit of Article VII of the April 2005 Agreement between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on the Political Parameters and Guiding Principles for the Settlement of the India-China Boundary Question. That Article stipulates that “in reaching a boundary settlement, the two sides shall safeguard due interests of their settled populations in the border areas.” Thus China needs to avoid airing public protests over the happenings, including prime ministerial visits, in the State of Arunachal Pradesh just as India needs to do more to restrain the anti-China political activities of the so-called ‘Tibetan-government-in-exile’ on Indian soil. The best way to do this is to forge a high-level political agreement — on the model of the Deng-Rajiv accord of December 1988 — that ensures that a sense of balance, sobriety, and tranquillity are maintained in the public posturing on boundary claims in keeping with the maturation and potential of the bilateral relationship. This Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and Wen Jiabao should certainly do when they meet on the sidelines of the October 23 Asean Summit in Thailand.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/How-to-end-this-discordance/article16887336.ece
18,10,2009,Disquieting fallout,"Under the shadow of the global crisis, the latest New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) bidding round has evoked a disappointing response, despite the official claim that the performance compares favourably with the experience of other countries. Only 36 of the 70 blocks on offer received bids. The response was slightly better for the auction for Coal Bed Methane (CBM IV) round. The numbers however tell only part of the story. The bidding was partly salvaged by the public sector oil giant Oil and Natural Gas Commission, which bagged 17 bids, was the star of the show. The ONGC might have felt obliged to underwrite a major part of NELP-VIII but in the absence of serious competition it could have also made commercial sense to pick up acreages at very attractive prices.
India’s biggest private sector petroleum company, Reliance Industries (RIL) was conspicuously absent in the oil and gas bids. The company has just commenced production of natural gas from a block in the KG basin it was awarded earlier this decade. RIL’s gas venture and the successful exploitation of an on-land oil field in Rajasthan are the two success stories of the exploration policies. Yet, far from being a showpiece, the gas sector has in the recent period shown up the official policy in a bad light. The major lacunae in the ways NELP is interpreted have been exposed. As it is, large multinationals such as Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Chevron have kept away from the bidding. Recent developments, including the reinforced perceptions of flawed governance in the sector, will dampen the interest of international oil companies further.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Disquieting-fallout/article16887335.ece
19,10,2009,Pakistan’s big battle,"Pakistan has finally begun a long overdue military offensive against the Taliban in the South Waziristan tribal region. The decision to take the battle into the Pakistan Taliban heartland came after the militants made clear they are now in a full-scale war against the state. The Army has hesitated to go into South Waziristan, evidently apprehensive of getting bogged down in what has sometimes been described as an ‘unwinnable’ war. Previous offensives in the tribal region ended with the military making peace deals with the militants, abandoning the area to the Taliban, and allowing them to entrench themselves there. It was also that the military did not seem entirely convinced of the threat posed to Pakistan by the Taliban. In 2008, the Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt. Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha, famously referred to the Taliban leader, Beithullah Mehsud, who was killed two months ago in a U.S. missile strike, as a “patriotic” Pakistani. But the recent attacks on the Pakistan Army headquarters and in Lahore left the military with little choice but to act against a wellspring of unrelenting terrorism within Pakistan. From the time the Taliban virtually took over Swat earlier this year, public opinion has favoured an all-out military operation. The United States too was eager to see the Pakistan Army launch the operation. The violent agenda of the South Waziristan militants is aimed more at Pakistan, but it is clear that the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan does the bidding of the al-Qaeda — providing it and the Afghan Taliban important back office support from its stronghold while receiving arms and money from them.
Can the military offensive succeed? The Pakistan Army declared victory in Swat, but it is widely believed that the militants simply melted away into the mountains. Very few of the Swat Taliban leaders were caught. South Waziristan is a larger area with an estimated 10,000 battle-hardened militants and a terrain more treacherous. The other question is whether an operation in South Waziristan is sufficient in itself. In the last few terror attacks, the Taliban’s alliances with a number of militant groups based in South Punjab, including anti-India groups such as the Jaish-e-Mohammed, have emerged in clear light. Predictably, the Army has downplayed the significance of these linkages, emphasising that South Waziristan alone is the ‘centre of gravity of terrorism.’ It is quite conceivable that the country’s security establishment remains reluctant to root out the jihadist militants who have served as its allies against India. What it needs to realise is that it can no longer afford to overlook this threat to state and society.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Pakistanrsquos-big-battle/article16887521.ece
19,10,2009,Planning for better cities,"Urbanisation is a positive phenomenon provided the cities are able to harness its potential. A recently published UN-Habitat global report on human settlements shows that not many cities in developing countries such as India have managed to do this. Indian cities struggle to manage the swelling numbers: they tend to have inadequate infrastructure, poor mobility, and a lack of affordable housing. The challenge they face is twofold — efforts to distribute growth across urban centres have been inadequate and the urban planning practices are outdated. Much attention is paid to mega cities, leaving the smaller cities largely unattended. Of the 5,161 urban centres, as the Eleventh Five Year Plan points out, only 1,500 have some form of a plan to manage their growth. With quality of life suffering in the smaller cities, more people tend to move to the metros, burdening them further. Although the need for developing small and medium-size towns was highlighted as early as 1988 by the first National Commission on Urbanisation, not much has happened on that front. As for the bigger cities, the additional attention and the presence of a master plan have not necessarily meant improvement.
Managing a city through a single unified master plan has failed to deliver. The reason for this, aside from poor implementation, is that the plans are conceptually flawed. Indian cities are complex composites. Alongside the formal city exists a large and an equally important informal city inhabited by the poor. Even the formal city is composed of many parts such as the historical core, the colonial enclave, and new areas of post-Independence growth. Notwithstanding these differences, the master plan tends to paint the city with a single brush, favouring the new formal areas and ignoring the informal. This has fragmented cities further and skewed development in favour of new areas. The recommendations in the UN-Habitat report do offer a way forward. The suggestion to implement the strategic spatial planning system should be immediately adopted. Unlike the master plan, such innovations recognise the intra-city differences better and help focus on priority aspects or areas. They should help eventually to mitigate spatial inequalities, integrate infrastructure, and evolve compact city forms that will optimise travelling within the city. Simultaneously, the institutional framework for planning should be strengthened with an emphasis on people’s participation and regional networking. Earnest implementation and regular monitoring of the plans are equally vital for reaping the benefits of planning.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Planning-for-better-cities/article16887520.ece
20,10,2009,Brinjal and beyond,"The Genetic Engineering Approval Committee’s recommendation that Bt brinjal be commercialised is a significant marker in the country’s slow and somewhat hesitant embrace of agri-biotechnology. The nod has come a full seven years after approval for the country’s first transgenic crop — Bt cotton. But Bt brinjal is the country’s first approved genetically modified (GM) food crop and the decision of the GEAC, the high-level committee under the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests, may be read as an affirmation of a key principle. It is that transgenic seeds will be approved for commercialisation as long as they adhere to the bio safety and other requirements demanded by the regulatory process. This may well spur the process for clearance of other transgenic food crops at different stages of the regulatory and approval process. It is imperative that Union Minister for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh, who says he will study the GEAC’s recommendation in depth before giving a final stamp of approval, bases his decision solely on the body of scientific data culled from Bt brinjal trials. He should ignore the huge pressure from organisations that have no time for the scientific evidence while claiming to speak for the environment and the public. It is not just the ‘organic’ movement but also the pesticide industry lobby that is viscerally opposed to Bt crops, which acquire a pest-resistant character with the introduction of a gene derived from a common soil bacterium ( bacillus thuringiensis).
Introduced commercially in the United States in the mid-1990s, genetically modified crops have expanded substantially in recent years. An estimated 125 million hectares were under such cover in 2008 in 25 countries, including China, Brazil, Egypt, and Australia. Even in GM-phobic Europe, seven countries, including Germany and Portugal, grow genetically modified maize commercially. It is nobody’s case that the massive spread of agro-biotechnology is proof of its safety. India’s regulatory process must continue to put transgenic plants through a battery of rigorous tests — for toxicity, allergenicity, bio safety, agronomic worth, and so forth — before recommending commercial release. It is also important that the country addresses issues such as labelling GM products through an independent regulatory process that commands public confidence. Legislation must be speedily introduced to set up a National Biotechnology Regulatory Authority, as recommended in 2004 by a task force led by eminent agricultural scientist M.S. Swaminathan. In a country where agricultural productivity and food security are vital issues, agri-biotechnology holds great promise. We need to regulate its application, not allow it to be strangled by misconceived or motivated campaigns.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Brinjal-and-beyond/article16888153.ece
20,10,2009,End of a system?,"Life insurance and mutual funds have been two large segments of the financial sector that have depended on agents and independent distributors for developing their business. Traditionally, the ubiquitous agent has been the first, and often the only, point of contact for the customer with the Life Insurance Corporation. Most often, a policyholder has very little interaction with the insurer beyond the periodic payment of premium. The LIC’s marketing strategy of relying heavily on its agents has served it well. Private companies, which re-entered the field, have designated their agents as investment advisers, consultants, and so on without altering their job profiles substantially. However, the number of advisers that the private companies deploy is small compared to the LIC. Development of alternative distribution channels has not diminished the importance of the agent. In return for mobilising business, these intermediaries are compensated through commission payments.
This traditional business model will come in for change if one of the key recommendations of the Committee on Investor Awareness and Protection headed by D. Swarup is accepted. In essence, it says insurance companies should stop paying commissions. The agents should charge their clients a fee for the advice given. Apart from pruning down the costs for the companies by saving on commissions, the idea behind the suggestion is to develop a higher degree of professionalism among the intermediaries. But it is doubtful whether a customer can be persuaded to pay for advice especially in a business where the agent generally passes on a part of the commission. The practice of rebating is both unethical and illegal but insurance companies and the regulators will need some more time to stamp it out. Doing away with commission payments has major livelihood implications for a large number of LIC agents. Most of them earn meagre sums for their work. The developments in life insurance follow those in the mutual funds industry. In June, SEBI decided that there will be no entry load — the commission investors paid — for all the schemes. The distributors shall be paid directly by the investors and not by the mutual funds. The insurance industry can take stock of developments in the mutual funds industry before implementing the Swarup Committee’s recommendation. Early indications are that the mutual funds are finding it difficult to distribute their products without the active support of the distributors.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/End-of-a-system/article16887722.ece
21,10,2009,Towards Kashmir talks,"“There is no place,” Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day, “for separatist thought in Jammu and Kashmir.” Less than three months later, persuaded that this summer’s street protests demonstrated that Kashmiri secessionists have both reach and influence, the central government has changed tack. During his visit to Srinagar last week, Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram announced that New Delhi would be seeking to renew the long-stalled dialogue process. He correctly acknowledged that there is a political problem in Kashmir and it has to be solved. Jammu and Kashmir’s unique history necessitated a unique solution, he urged, using language that was different from New Delhi’s standard official rhetoric. Mr. Chidambaram made the case for quiet, behind-the-scenes talks: a constructive dialogue, as he put it, rather than a photo opportunity. That dialogue, highly-placed government sources have told The Hindu, is already under way: separatist leaders, including All Parties Hurriyat Conference chief Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front leader, Yasin Malik, have met with high-level functionaries in the Union Home Ministry. The effort is to work out a framework both sides can live with -- and ensure that the talks are built on foundations strong enough to endure political storms.
Will the effort succeed? There is of course no guarantee it will. In January 2004, Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani met with the Hurriyat leadership for the first time. The ground was prepared and Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee announced that the only precondition for negotiations was humanism. This was followed up by a second meeting that March. Prime Minister Singh held two more rounds of talks in May and September 2005. Fearful of the jihadist wrath, the Hurriyat never brought a serious agenda to the table. In March 2006, APHC leaders promised to attend Dr. Singh’s all-party Roundtable Conference on Jammu and Kashmir only to back off in the face of terrorist threats. Two challenges now lie ahead. First, J&K’s fractious secessionist groups must agree on a road map for progress. Mirwaiz Farooq has set up a committee to engage his archrival, Islamist hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani; it can only be hoped the talks are fruitful. Secondly, Islamabad’s support for the dialogue process must be secured. Pakistan would do well to appoint an envoy to continue the secret dialogue held by Satinder Lambah and Tariq Aziz, which yielded a set of agreed principles for a resolution of the Kashmir conflict in 2006. Mr. Chidambaram meanwhile must be applauded for taking a significant step forward in the knowledge that the journey to peace will be a long, hard trudge, littered with political minefields.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Towards-Kashmir-talks/article16840142.ece
21,10,2009,Dealing with human failure,"Over 20 passengers were killed and 22 injured -- most of them women and children -- when the Goa Express rammed into a stationary Mewar express near Mathura early on Wednesday morning. The engine of the Goa express hit the rear of the Mewar express, causing severe damage to the last coach and derailing several others. Preliminary reports point to human failure, though the last word on the signalling system has not been said yet. In such cases of collision between two trains, there can be two possible causes -- either signal failure or human failure by way of ignoring the signal. The inquiry by the Commissioner of Railway Safety will fix the responsibility, but what assumes importance is the follow-up action. Accidents such as this are not uncommon in the massive Railway network in the country. Every one of them has been followed by an inquiry and every such exercise has yielded a host of suggestions on measures to be adopted for averting the mishaps. While mechanical or electrical failure can be dealt with, the railway authorities have not yet been able to come to terms with human failure.
When the crew of a train see a red signal, they are supposed to stop for two minutes if it is night, and one minute during day time, and then proceed with caution. They are provided with walkie-talkie sets to get in touch with the nearest railway station, ascertain the situation, and act as it warrants. Given this, it is surprising that such a communication had not taken place in the high-density Mathura-Delhi route. Did the communication equipment fail, or were the crew oblivious to these basic safety requirements? It is up to the Commissioner of Railway Safety and the Railway Board to get to the bottom of what went wrong and where, and fix responsibility. The Konkan Railway designed an anti-collision device, which has reportedly gone through trials and been fitted on trains operating in certain high-risk sectors. There was supposed to be a time-bound programme for fitting these devices on all trains. Millions of people who travel by trains will look to Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee for ensuring that safety concerns are addressed with a sense of urgency. The Railways must wrap up the investigation quickly and come out with the whole truth. A systematic programme of retraining and re-orientation of the railway staff is imperative to keep them alert and safety-conscious.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Dealing-with-human-failure/article16887898.ece
22,10,2009,Hat-trick of triumphs,"The weaknesses of the opposition are sometimes as important as the strengths of an ally. In Maharashtra, the Congress made the most of both, a disunited opposition and a formidable alliance, and is set to form the government for a third consecutive term. To the credit of the Congress, despite discomforts and irritants, the party nurtured its alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party through good times and bad. But the latest win would not have been possible without the fragmentation of the opposition. The Shiv Sena, after the breaking away of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena led by Raj Thackeray, is no longer the same battle-hardened party. The Bharatiya Janata Party, still unable to grow out of the shadow of the Shiv Sena, and yet to recover fully from the debacle in the Lok Sabha election, remains dispirited and uninspiring. Thus, from the very beginning, it was a battle for the Congress-NCP to lose. The Shiv Sena was hoping that the supporters of the MNS would return to its fold on sensing that Raj Thackeray was no front-runner. But the MNS put up another impressive performance, this time picking up a few seats too. Whether Raj Thackeray’s party, with its politics mimicking that of the Shiv Sena, will have a future is difficult to say, but in the present election the MNS did spoil whatever chances its parent party had. While the Congress-NCP cannot boast of a blot-free record in governance, the combine at least managed to blunt any anti-incumbency sentiment. With Sushil Kumar Shinde, Vilasrao Deshmukh and Ashok Chavan taking turns as Chief Minister, the government also managed to keep on a fresh sheen.
In Haryana, Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda did just well enough to keep the Congress afloat. But, as expected, the vote share and the number of seats came down. Retaining power is always more difficult than regaining it, and Mr. Hooda could not have been expected to deliver much more than he did. In voter perception, the ruling coalition certainly seemed to have had more on the credit side of the governance ledger. The Indian National Lok Dal of Om Prakash Chautala did narrow the gap, without any help from its former ally, the BJP, but the Congress, with some support from others, has managed to get another term in office. In the smallest of the three States that went to the polls, Arunachal Pradesh, the Congress won decisively with a majority of its own. In all the three, however, the real challenge will be in meeting the rising expectations of the people. The Congress in the flush of its Lok Sabha victory appeared to have taken the States for granted and while there is reason for satisfaction, there is no ground for euphoria.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Hat-trick-of-triumphs/article16888083.ece
22,10,2009,Runoff not a panacea,"The Afghan President, Hamid Karzai, has agreed to a second round of voting in the presidential election, and has therefore accepted that he did not win outright in the first poll, which took place on August 20. The runoff -- between Mr. Karzai and the runner-up Abdullah Abdullah -- will he held on November 7. The extent of fraud in the first poll was enormous. The U.N. Election Complaints Commission (ECC) found that, in its sample of 92 polling stations, all the votes went to one candidate in 30 stations; at one booth, all 600 votes went to one candidate but were awarded to another; some boxes contained ballot papers all signed in one hand and with the same pen, with all the votes going to one single candidate. In socially-conservative southern Afghanistan, men had registered long lists of women, saying the women could not register in person. Even the ink mark on voters’ fingers was easily removed with a toilet cleaner. The Independent Election Commission (IEC), packed with Karzai supporters, delayed preparing a new electoral roll until it was too late. The ECC has concluded that one-third of Mr. Karzai’s votes were fraudulent.
The ECC head Kai Eide, western diplomats in Kabul, and the Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, John Kerry, did pressure Mr. Karzai to accept a runoff, but although they welcomed his decision they have said nothing about the previous fraud. The runoff, however, will face problems in addition to those posed by the deepening winter. To start with, voters with strong tribal loyalties, offended by the annulling of their votes, may well stay away en masse. Secondly, the ECC has been damaged by the U.N. sacking, during the campaign, of its deputy head Peter Galbraith, who had predicted serious fraud in 1,500 polling stations. A further problem is the NATO countries’ complicity by omission. To make the election look an Afghan affair, they let the IEC run it; now Afghan law also requires the ECC to drop the majority of its international observers. But any problems over the credibility of the runoff will undermine the legitimacy of the winner, and may boost the support for the Taliban as well as for tribal warlords. It appears that lessons from the elections rigged by the U.S. in Vietnam have not been learnt. Above all, the fraud perpetrated on August 20 was a betrayal of millions of Afghan voters who turned out to vote, often defying threats from the Taliban and other groups. The runoff is legally necessary, but it is far from clear what problems it will solve.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Runoff-not-a-panacea/article16888082.ece
24,10,2009,A dose of optimism,"The Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council (EAC) headed by C. Rangarajan has been cautiously optimistic in its assessment of the economy for the current year. In its report, Economic Outlook 2009-10, released on Wednesday, the Council projects a GDP growth rate of 6.5 per cent, which is higher than all the other official forecasts. The Reserve Bank of India in its July review of the monetary and credit policy had projected a rate of six per cent but with an upward bias. It is noteworthy that since then every GDP forecast has been an improvement over the previous one. The IMF, for instance, is now more upbeat in its assessment of global economic growth than it was a few months ago. Developing countries including India and China are in the forefront of the global recovery. It is more than likely that the RBI will mark up its growth projection in its review scheduled for next week. The EAC’s optimism is based on the fact that an uptrend in the growth momentum is clearly discernible now. The revival in industrial output — the index of industrial production for August was 10.4 higher than what it was in 2008 — is expected to be consolidated further. The EAC expects both the industry and the services sectors to grow by 8.2 per cent. But agriculture will most likely decline by two per cent because of the failure of the monsoons.
A successful rabi crop holds the key not only to higher economic growth but also to containing inflationary expectations. The EAC expects the WPI inflation to go up to six per cent by March-end from its current artificially low levels of just above one per cent. Food inflation poses the biggest challenge to policy makers in the short-term and can only be tackled through a multi-pronged strategy. The rabi crop must be protected right through the season and the public distribution system strengthened. Rice imports, where necessary, will provide a cushion. Global petroleum prices are firming up and the government will be faced with the difficult choice of having to either hike retail prices or bear a higher subsidy burden. Continuing the stimulus packages is both economically justifiable and politically expedient at this juncture but before long a roll back will be in order. High fiscal deficits — expected to touch 6.8 per cent of the GDP this year — while being unavoidable are clearly unsustainable for long. It will be good if the RBI continued with its accommodative monetary policy but the high level of government borrowing is exercising an upward pressure on the interest rates. There are no clear-cut pathways yet for an exit strategy but attainment of higher growth rates will surely open them up.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-dose-of-optimism/article16888276.ece
24,10,2009,Prediction gets tougher,"Despite years of unrelenting efforts, predicting earthquakes — the holy grail of seismology — has only got tougher. A series of high magnitude earthquakes that struck different parts of the globe in recent years has made scientists realise that rocks respond to strain and seismic waves in a far more dynamic manner than was originally assumed. They are now compelled to revisit the well-accepted process used for explaining earthquake occurrences. According to the elastic rebound theory, proposed in 1910 by geologist Henry Fielding Reid of Johns Hopkins University, rocks along the faults are like twigs that bend under stress but snap when stress crosses the threshold. The rocks along faults tend to accumulate strain as plates collide against one another and finally give way when it becomes unbearable. Sudden snapping of the rocks and release of strain causes earthquakes. Since the theory is based on strain accumulation, high magnitude earthquakes should occur only after a long interval. But the occurrence of many high magnitude quakes before strain can accumulate and cross the threshold shows that the elastic rebound theory alone cannot explain the triggering mechanism.
In fact, many high magnitude quakes have occurred within a relatively short period of time. For instance, the three quakes of more than 7 magnitude that struck Vanuatu, an island nation in the South Pacific Ocean, on October 7 is a classic example of clustering. Sumatra has also been witnessing similar clustering in the last few years. A series of quakes of magnitude greater than 8 have occurred off the coast of Sumatra following the 9.1 magnitude quake of December 26, 2004. In fact, it may be wrong to assume that fault systems lying thousands of kilometres away are behaving independently. While it has been known that high magnitude earthquakes tend to set off tremors by altering the strength of faults lying several hundreds of kilometres away, scientists studying the San Andreas Fault at Parkfield, California, have for the first time been able to monitor this recently. Parkfield, one of the closely monitored earthquake zones in the world, provided the much-needed evidence that the 1992 Landers earthquake in California and 2004 Sumatra earthquake altered its fault strength and triggered tremors. While the 2008 Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast 2 had found that the association of earthquake cycle with the elastic rebound theory can be highly irregular, the latest evidence from San Andreas Fault will further dilute the universality of the elastic rebound theory in explaining earthquake occurrence.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Prediction-gets-tougher/article16888275.ece
25,10,2009,Looming war,"Last week, Maoist insurgents in West Bengal paraded police officer Atindranath Dutta before the massed media, a prisoner-of-war logo draped around his neck. Mr. Dutta’s release marked the end of the ugly hostage drama in Lalgarh — but illustrated in stark relief the crisis in which India’s insurgency-ravaged heartland is mired. Later this year, the Union government plans to push in an estimated 75,000 Central Reserve Police Force personnel in an effort to restore the state’s authority. Just two days before Mr. Dutta’s release, Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram made what has been interpreted as a last-ditch effort to ward off the inevitable bloodshed. In a letter to former Lok Sabha speaker Rabi Ray, he said the Union government was willing to hold talks with the Communist Party of India (Maoist) “on any issue that concerns them and the people they claim to represent.” The problem, Mr. Chidambaram argued, was that the Maoists themselves had no apparent wish to enter into a dialogue. He suggested that an end to insurgent violence would have to precede meaningful talks.
What now lies ahead? Maoist leaders, many analysts believe, have little immediate reason to come to the table, given that a cessation of violence would mean losing control of the substantial territories they now dominate. The Union government’s police-surge is more likely to prove no more than a holding operation. External forces, India’s counter-insurgency experience shows, can take years to acquire local intelligence and tactical knowledge. The CRPF, moreover, suffers from crippling officer shortages and lacks an organic intelligence organisation. Successful counter-insurgency operations — among them Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Tripura, and Andhra Pradesh — were built on an overall enhancement of police capabilities. Andhra Pradesh, which defeated a powerful Maoist insurgency, invested not just in its much-vaunted Greyhounds jungle-warfare unit, but in training its personnel, developing intelligence capabilities, and building a network of well-equipped police stations. Andhra Pradesh has 1,579 police stations to serve its 2,75,045 square kilometre territory. By way of contrast, Chhattisgarh has just a fifth as many police stations — 350 — although it, at 1,35,191 square kilometres, is half as large. The situation is no different in other insurgency-hit States such as Orissa. What the Union Ministry hopes is that the central forces it is now pumping in will be able to restore some semblance of order, if not law, while police modernisation programmes it is funding kick in over the next few years. The strategy is less than optimal — but better than no action at all. India’s Maoist movement needs to consider if the war it is precipitating will in fact serve the interests of the desperately poor it claims to speak for.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Looming-war/article16888533.ece
25,10,2009,Conflict of interest in research,"With research being funded more and more by the pharmaceutical industry and incentives in the form of shares or cash for rendering various services becoming the order of the day, there is a compelling need for physician-researchers to disclose any conflict of interest when submitting papers to journals. While clash of interest by itself may not necessarily mean any wrongdoing, revealing it would help editors and those involved in the publication process take an informed decision, and the readers view the results of a study in the proper perspective. The requirement to declare conflict of interest covers the entire spectrum — authors of papers, editorial writers, peer reviewers and so on — to alert readers of any potential bias. Yet, medical journals have been struggling to find a way to make the self-declaration comprehensive. Ambiguity and lack of uniformity in self-declaration policies by different journals have been the main reasons why authors fail to reveal competing interests while submitting their work to different journals. Whatever the reason, the non-declaration affects scientific enterprise and erodes the credibility of peer-reviewed literature. It is to remove these deficiencies that the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) has recently come out with a uniform format for disclosing competing interests.
The format, to be adopted in April next year after taking into account the concerns of the users, requires a declaration that covers a wide range of issues. Apart from the standard declaration of association with commercial establishments, the users are required to disclose non-financial benefits — political, religious and personal, to name a few. Though the requirement to declare religious conflicts may appear an overzealous attempt, certain areas of medical research do evoke religious conflicts. That many scientists are opposed to embryonic stem cell research on ethical and religious grounds is well known. In fact, opposition to infertility research in general on religious grounds is a historical fact. The users would also be required to declare any financial association involving their spouse or children under 18 years. Much like its success in bringing about more accountability and transparency in the way clinical trials are conducted by forcing the industry to fall in line and register trials prior to the recruitment of the first volunteer, the ICMJE’s latest initiative will go some way to cleanse the system.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Conflict-of-interest-in-research/article16888532.ece
27,10,2009,Treading cautiously in Asia,"The East Asia Summit at Hua Hin in Thailand brought into focus the much-discussed proposal to convert the loose grouping into an East Asian Community (EAC) over the next two or three years. Both Japan and Australia have put forward their vision of this community, with some basic differences in perception. The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which is the core of the East Asian gathering, has over the past four decades grown, matured, and created new vehicles to spread its sphere of influence. The grouping, which now encompasses all the 10 countries in South East Asia, has set up a dialogue partnership with all the major powers. It went on to create a platform for ASEAN+3, an annual dialogue with China, Japan, and South Korea. Out of that came the East Asia Summit that brought in three more partners — India, Australia, and New Zealand. The proposal to form an EAC has obviously been inspired by the European Union, which has taken so much longer to evolve and consolidate, and is perhaps yet to iron out some basic differences. The ASEAN, which operates on the basis of consensus, naturally wants to be in the driver’s seat of the proposed EAC. Two fundamental questions need to be addressed before the proposal could take shape — whom should it include, and should the United States have a role in it.
From the beginning, there appear to be major differences on both these points. One approach seems to be to start with the ASEAN+3 platform and then expand, when the stage is set. India naturally feels that there can be no Asian community without it. New Delhi may have ASEAN’s full support in this. As Australia has come out with a proposal, it will not want to be left out of any major regional initiative that will account for half of the world’s population and a bulk of its trade. The U.S., which is out of the East Asia Summit, surely wants to be a part of the EAC. But the problem is that it is not part of the region. There may be many opponents to Washington integrating itself with an Asian community, although the U.S. does have some supporters within ASEAN. Possibly, it may have little opposition to its getting the status of an invitee or a dialogue partner. Without rushing into another EU-like experiment, the Asian countries will do well to deliberate extensively and build a consensus before taking the plunge. Issues such as a common currency are bound to crop up in this search for a common identity or platform. Without getting confused with the concept of the Asia-Pacific forum (APEC), the EAC must build its own regional architecture and framework, looking at economic, social, and security issues.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Treading-cautiously-in-Asia/article16888724.ece
27,10,2009,Thatcher’s failed crusade,"The fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the subsequent reunification of Germany were hailed by many as triumphs of western ideals of democracy and the free market over communism or state socialism. The then leaders of the western world, especially British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, were widely seen as leading the ideologically-driven attitudes and policies which purportedly caused the collapse of communism. There is only one snag to the story. Mrs. Thatcher was deeply suspicious of German reunification and did all she could to prevent it. In effect, she would rather have let the citizens of the then German Democratic Republic remain under communism than have a reunified Germany. According to the former West German chancellor Helmut Kohl’s recently-published memoirs, Mrs. Thatcher attacked Mr. Kohl — at a dinner hosted by the French president François Mitterrand — for considering reunification. Further detail has also emerged; documents released by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) show that Mrs. Thatcher even claimed to speak for Western Europe and the United States when she bluntly told Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev, the only person who might have prevented German reunification, that the west did not want that. Mrs. Thatcher was trying to mislead Mr. Gorbachev about the U.S. position, as the then president George Bush Sr. fully backed Mr. Kohl.
The Thatcher crusade failed completely. Mr. Gorbachev soon came to support reunification, as did Mr. Mitterrand. Secondly, Mrs. Thatcher was opposed by her own foreign minister, Douglas Hurd, and by eminent British historians. Thirdly, none of Mrs. Thatcher’s fears has materialised. The reunified Germany, which did not find the aftermath of reunification easy, has neither dominated the European Union nor looked at all likely to revive Nazism and aggressive nationalism. Indeed, German laws and policies against Nazism are implemented much more thoroughly than comparable laws and policies in many other EU countries. Neither has the general German political culture been affected. Germany has maintained the post-war consensus between government, labour, and capital and is said even by conservative analysts to be leading the west out of the recession. Moreover, the re-elected Chancellor Angela Merkel has not allowed her major coalition partner, the right-wing Free Democrat Party, any significant influence. The point is not just that Mrs. Thatcher was totally wrong about German reunification but that those who are beguiled by so-called conviction politicians would do well to remember that such figures are rarely what they seem to be.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Thatcherrsquos-failed-crusade/article16888723.ece
28,10,2009,An acute dilemma,"Making the trade-off between supporting growth and reining in inflation expectations, a perennial dilemma of monetary policy, was particularly pronounced as the Reserve Bank of India unveiled its second quarterly review. The central bank’s action in keeping its policy rates — the repo and the reverse repo rates as well its key reserve ratio, the CRR — unchanged is above all a reflection of that intense dilemma. Economic growth, though picking up, is still far from robust. Professional forecasters surveyed by the RBI had lowered their GDP forecast for 2009-10 to 6 per cent from 6.5 per cent, estimated three months ago. The RBI too has not changed its July forecast of 6 per cent with an upward bias. That was more pessimistic than some other recent official forecasts. For instance, the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council had projected a rate of 6.5 per cent just a few days ago. The RBI notes certain trends that are not so positive. Agriculture is expected to register a decline due to poor monsoons. While the industrial sector has shown clear signs of revival in recent months, the two major demand components of the GDP — private final consumption expenditure and gross fixed capital formation — have continued to decelerate, following a trend that began last year. Despite abundant liquidity in the system, non-food credit has dropped significantly, with its growth rate falling to 11.2 per cent from 29.4 per cent recorded last year.
The RBI expects headline inflation to climb to 6.5 per cent by the end of the year. This is sharply higher than the five per cent it forecast three months ago. Food inflation is a big challenge to policy makers. The consumer price index (CPI) remains stubbornly in double digits. Moreover, the base effect that artificially depressed the headline inflation figures will soon start working in the opposite direction. The precise challenge for the RBI is to support the recovery process without compromising on price stability. A related challenge is to manage the exit strategy from easy money. Pointing out that India is among the few large emerging economies with such large fiscal and current account deficits, the RBI has once again urged fiscal consolidation. The exit debate here will have to be quantitatively and qualitatively different from that in many other countries because of the unique macroeconomic features. Growth drivers warrant a delayed exit, while inflation concerns call for an early exit. The RBI has already taken some steps towards the exit: it has tightened bank provisioning norms and made lending to commercial real estate more expensive. More than ever before, monetary policy will have to strike a deft balance among several conflicting objectives.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/An-acute-dilemma/article16888920.ece
28,10,2009,Informal sector and inequity,"The mismatch between the impressive growth rates of the recent past and the abysmally low living standards of the majority in the developing world is again in the spotlight, this time by a joint report of the World Trade Organisation and the International Labour Organisation focussing on conditions outside the formal economy. With estimates suggesting that states with above average-sized informal economies are three times more likely to suffer the adverse effects of economic shocks than those with lower rates, the all-important need to reduce labour market vulnerabilities in the context of global slowdown should be self-evident to policy makers and industry. In addition, low export diversification is a characteristic of large informal economies, a situation that advocates of greater integration of global trade would do well to bear in mind. Although the share of global trade, at 60 per cent of the gross domestic product in 2007, was more than twice the figure for the 1980s, there has not been a corresponding improvement in several indices of human development, says the study. About 60 per cent of employment in developing countries is concentrated in the informal sector of the economy, characterised by the absence of job security, meagre incomes, and the persistent lack of access to social benefits, education, and training opportunities. Conversely, there has been a noticeable increase in the premium on skills even in emerging economies because international investment from big corporations is strongly linked to the demand for highly skilled manpower. Moreover, the bias in favour of high calibre skilled personnel, driven by technological change, has marginalised the need for low-skilled labour and accentuated the adverse impact on living standards.
Leveraging the gains of globalisation is an imperative for developing countries that have to contend with chronic poverty, rising expectations and social inequity, not to mention the need to factor in the challenges posed by climate change, even as they strive to raise growth rates. The answers lie in addressing the prerequisites to absorb the effects from exposure to external economic shocks, especially vulnerabilities in the labour market. A greater impetus to enhance the quality of education at all levels is no less a priority. Governments should respond to these challenges without prevarication and foot-dragging. More of the requisite political will has to be displayed to create structures that will enhance the incomes of the workforce and provide social security.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Informal-sector-and-inequity/article16888919.ece
29,10,2009,NREGS under the scanner,"The National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (2005) differs from the other poverty alleviation measures in two significant respects. Where most welfare programmes cast the state in the role of benefactor offering handouts to the poor, the NREGS is built around notions of citizenship and entitlement. Secondly, the NREGS also facilitates disclosure by means of regular social audits. These audits, mandated to be done by the Gram Sabhas, are intended to identify and plug pilferage and corruption, which in turn, helps build awareness and confidence in beneficiaries who learn, over time, to become vigilant and assertive. Institutionalised social audits are vital if a programme of the dimensions of the NREGS is to succeed, and as much was the objective of a sample 10-day social audit conducted recently in Bhilwara by the Aruna Roy-led Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sanghatan in close collaboration with the Rajasthan government. Over a fortnight, social auditors, fully backed by government machinery, minutely examined NREGS documents like job cards, muster rolls, and technical and financial sanctions and interacted with thousands of beneficiaries.
The Bhilwara social audit exposed irregularities; indeed it underscored the NREGS’s susceptibility to corruption. Yet significantly, it also provided the answer to the problem. There can be no better certificate for the audit than the resistance it faced from the panchayat staff who obviously feared being held to account. The sarpanchs (village heads) sat in dharna, made their displeasure public at the ‘jan sunwais’ (public hearings), and demanded that they be spared punishment for wrongdoings. That the demand was backed by a Minister from the Rajasthan government points to the difficulties involved in breaching local power structures, now doubly more influential for the huge funds made available by the NREGS. Bhilwara alone got Rs.330 crore this financial year from the State’s budget allocation of Rs.9,500 crore. The monitoring mechanism under the NREGS must function robustly, not only to silence critics who argue that influx of funds on this scale can only lead to more corruption, but more importantly to reach the programme’s numerous benefits, both financial and social, to the target group. Among other things, the Bhilwara audit team found that guaranteed employment had reduced distress migration by the Bhil tribal community, and raised wage levels across the private sector. With so much going for it, the NREGS is also a potential election winner — which ought to make it an article of faith with every politician.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/NREGS-under-the-scanner/article16889087.ece
29,10,2009,The state of occupied Iraq,"The suicide bombings in Baghdad on October 25 were the worst in the city for over two years. They reveal serious holes in Iraqi security as well as the continuing political problems posed by the United States-led military occupation of Iraq. The facts are that a van and a minibus, each carrying a tonne or more of explosives, passed through several checkpoints before being detonated near the Justice Ministry and several provincial council buildings. Trucks are banned from Baghdad during daylight hours without military permits, which are to be examined at every checkpoint. The terror vehicles got through in what looks like an expert attack. The Defence and Interior Ministries are investigating possible collusion or negligence by Iraqi security forces. The estimated death toll is 155, including several children at two day-care centres in the Justice Ministry building. Over 500 people were injured and an unknown number are missing. The buildings of the Justice Ministry and the Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works, both seven storeys high, were destroyed in the blasts, as was a third government building.
Responsibility for the attacks has been claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq, an al-Qaida affiliate. The political consequences are far-reaching. Immediately after the attacks, Iraqi party leaders reached agreement on a law for the general election, which is due in January; the politicians had been haggling for weeks. Agreement over the counting system for votes in Kirkuk is still awaited, and there is no sign of a deal between Baghdad and the Kurdish regional administration over oil revenues. Secondly, the work of the devastated Ministries will be severely affected. This will hurt the official Iraqi posture that the state is functioning. In fact, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki’s Islamic Dawa Party has been flaunting its security record in the election campaign. Thirdly, Iraq’s regional relations have suffered. Mr. al-Maliki has accused Syria of harbouring Saddamist Ba’athists, whom he blames for the bombings; and the relevant ambassadors have been withdrawn. President Obama’s plan to reduce troop strength from the current 120,000, starting two months after the election, could stall, making it harder for the U.S. to send reinforcements to Afghanistan. Furthermore, a return of U.S. troops to Iraqi cities would signify political failure, showing Iraq’s continuing dependence on the U.S. presence; many Iraqis as well as groups in other countries would see that as further reason to carry out attacks. Above all, the bombings have exposed the fact that the U.S. and its western allies are exacerbating as many problems in Iraq as they are in Afghanistan.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-state-of-occupied-Iraq/article16889086.ece
30,10,2009,Journalism for sale,"India’s elections, which in mid-2009 brought 415 million voters to the 1.18 million ballot units in 834,944 polling stations and were mostly peaceful, may be one of the wonders of the world. But it is widely understood that in 2009 the free, fair, and democratic attributes of these elections have been compromised as never before by the large-scale, illegal, and scandalous use of money power — which, to a considerable extent, involved recycled dirty money garnered through corruption in executive and legislative office. The role of the Election Commission of India in curbing booth capturing, intimidation of voters, and some other kinds of electoral fraud has won public appreciation. But as P. Sainath points out in his article, “The medium, message and the money,” published in The Hindu on October 26, 2009, “it is hard to find a single instance of rigorous or deterrent action” by the ECI in the face of such a serious danger to the democratic process. That is a large question that needs to be addressed in depth and in all its complexity by the various players in the political system.
The new shame is the extensive and brazen participation of not insignificant sections of the news media, notably large-circulation Indian language newspapers in two of India’s largest States, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, in this genre of corruption -- which a politician speaking at a Hyderabad media seminar memorably characterised as a “Cash Transfer Scheme” from politicians to journalists. Sainath’s article exposes the phenomenon of “coverage packages” exploding across India’s most industrialised State during the recent Assembly election. Candidates paid newspapers different rates for well-differentiated and streamlined packages of news coverage. Those who could not or would not pay for the packages tended to be blacked out. The Andhra Pradesh Union of Working Journalists has, on the basis of a sample survey conducted in West Godavari district, estimated that newspapers across the State netted Rs. 350 crore to Rs. 400 crore through editorial coverage sold to candidates during the 2009 Lok Sabha and Assembly elections. Some candidates even recorded the expenditure incurred in purchasing editorial coverage in their official accounts submitted to the ECI. With some senior journalists drawing its attention to this new-fangled cash transfer scheme in Andhra Pradesh, the Press Council of India has constituted a two-member committee to inquire into the matter. What to do about such a shocking breach of readers’ trust (which is unlikely to be confined to Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra) by the so-called Fourth Estate will form the subject of a follow-up editorial.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Journalism-for-sale/article13666072.ece
30,10,2009,U.S. economy breathes again,"Government stimulus packages have virtually the same effect on the economy as a mechanical ventilator has on a patient with breathing difficulty. They get a slumping economy ticking again, but as in medicine the difficulty is in determining when and how to coax the economy to run along unaided. A year after sinking into its worst spell of recession since the Great Depression, the U.S. economy has begun to grow again, surprisingly faster than what most experts predicted. President Barack Obama, of course, has taken the initial credit saying the steps taken have made a difference, yet he readily acknowledges that there is a long way to go before the economy can be fully restored. There is no doubt that the huge stimulus package delivered by his government propelled demand over the past few months. With the “cash for clunkers” scheme and the offer of tax credit for first-time home-buyers thrusting government money in the hands of consumers, there was a substantial jump in car and home sales, the effect of which has been to magnify what might have been a 1.9 per cent economic growth in the June-September quarter to 3.5 per cent. The question is what might happen when the effect of the stimulus wears off. Are U.S. consumers and industry ready to pick up the baton? The answer is no. Sales of cars and light trucks dropped sharply in September, the scheme having ended in August. Unemployment is still hovering uncomfortably close to 10 per cent, and consumer credit continues to fall.
It is not just the U.S. that is hoping that the recovery is for real. Most emerging economies, especially India, have a considerable stake in the process. Their growth momentum was rudely halted by the downturn in the U.S. last year; normalisation in the U.S. will, as the International Monetary Fund says in its latest regional economic outlook report, generate “an outsized Asian upturn.” India’s software industry has always relied substantially on the U.S. engine for its growth; its ability to hire the nation’s engineering graduates in their hundreds of thousands has remained compromised this past year as the U.S. market convulsed and software exports stagnated. Another large employer, the textile industry too had to downsize as U.S. demand fell sharply. While in recent weeks both sectors have scented recovery in their largest overseas market, the question whether this could be a false dawn still nags. Having run up a monstrous $1.3 trillion deficit, the Obama Administration does not have much money left for a follow-up thrust should the economy be found wanting. That is a predicament none would want the U.S. to get into.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/U.S.-economy-breathes-again/article16889506.ece
30,10,2009,Terror unlimited,"Even by terror’s gory standards, the bomb attack in Peshawar city that killed 105 people was of an order of savagery that surpassed anything Pakistan had seen before. It targeted the most vulnerable among civilians — women and children — and capped a month-long orgy of violence unleashed by extremist militants across the country. The timing of the attack with the arrival in Pakistan of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton might have been a coincidence. Even so, it was a horrific demonstration of the challenges to the U.S.-Pakistan partnership in the “war on terror.” The terror attacks are clearly aimed at sapping the nation’s morale as its army, under pressure from the U.S., battles the Taliban in its South Waziristan stronghold. The thinking seems to be that a terrorised nation will lose the stomach for military operations against the militants — but the attacks are having the opposite effect. Pakistanis are asking what kind of beasts are these who deliberately set out to target young students, women, and children. The suicide bombings at the International Islamic University earlier this month was an indication that the militants would stop at nothing. The realisation that the national mood has hardened against the militants and that Pakistanis own the war against the Taliban more than before will strengthen the army in its ongoing operation in South Waziristan. But if the idea is to root out terrorism and extremism, the time for selective operations is long past. The security establishment needs to stop making distinctions between militant groups that have turned against the Pakistani state and those that can still be viewed as ‘assets’ against India. Some of the recent attacks have shown that al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and the so-called jihadi groups are acting in concert.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Terror-unlimited/article16889306.ece
30,10,2009,Agassi’s redemption song,"In a long, cathartic journey of personal redemption, bravely enacted in the full public gaze, Andre Agassi may have arrived at a defining moral point. In admitting to taking crystal methamphetamine — a highly addictive stimulant that causes numerous neurotransmitters to be released in the brain — the eight-time Grand Slam champion may be sending out a simple message to his fans and the tennis community worldwide. Image doesn’t matter to him; truth does; and he can’t live any longer with a “central lie.” The irony that underpins Agassi’s mea culpa is the fact that it might not have been a big shock had it happened in 1997, when he consumed the hard drug. That was a year when the flashy anti-hero from Las Vegas went through a time of troubles on and off the tennis court. His marriage with actress Brooke Shields was collapsing and with that his world ranking plummeted to No.141. He was emotionally at his most vulnerable and susceptible to all kinds of influence, as the former world champion points out in his forthcoming autobiography, Open, excerpts from which were published in The Times (London). From that low point, Agassi authored one of the most stirring comebacks in sport — to pole-vault back into the Top Ten in 1998. The following year, he won the French Open title to become only the fifth man in tennis history to complete a Career Grand Slam.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Agassirsquos-redemption-song/article16889305.ece
1,11,2009,Hooda crosses first hurdle,"The first hurdle, they say in hurdling, is not the most difficult one. All the same Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda must be pleased to have the confidence vote in the State Assembly out of his way. With the Congress strength at 40, six short of the majority mark in the 90-member house, Mr. Hooda would have backed himself to win the support of the seven Independents. After all, his party has decades-long experience in this game of wooing outsiders to its fold. He got his seven, plus the support of the lone Bahujan Samaj Party member. Although the Congress was no clear winner in the Assembly contest, it was the only party within striking distance of power, so quite naturally the Independents gravitated towards the Hooda camp. The walkout and abstention by the Haryana Janhit Congress (BL) made things easier for the ruling party, which won 47 trust votes as against the immediate requirement of 42. Given the political dynamics in Haryana, the opposition parties — the Indian National Lok Dal, which bagged 31 seats in the election, the Bharatiya Janata Party, which took four, and the HJC (BL), which won six — are unlikely to come together as a coherent unit. With a non-Congress alternative in the current Assembly seeming only a hazy theoretical possibility, Mr. Hooda was able to get off to a flying start.
But then the Chief Minister can forget only to his peril that this is Haryana, the State that enriched the vocabulary of political India by giving it the celebrated phrase ‘Aya Ram, Gaya Ram,’ after an MLA changed parties thrice in the course of a day in 1967. This means that while Mr. Hooda was able, with relatively little effort, to play the current situation to his advantage, he might not be able to do so consistently over a period of five years. Free-floating Independents are traditionally difficult to manage. Mr. Hooda will have to watch his back, and balance different sectional interests as he goes through his term. He will need to bear in mind that ultimately the stability of the government will depend less on accommodation and appeasement of the Independents than on his addressing the concerns and livelihood issues of the people. It can be safely predicted that at the first hint of the government’s unpopularity, the supporting blocs will threaten to move away; after all, what bind Independents to the ruling camp are the fishes and loaves of office. With the veteran INLD leader Om Prakash Chautala breathing down his neck, Chief Minister Hooda, unlike in the first term when he had a comfortable majority, must deliver on the governance front quickly. He will learn soon enough that the remaining hurdles present a much stiffer challenge than the first one.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Hooda-crosses-first-hurdle/article16889789.ece
1,11,2009,Taxing foreign inflows,"Brazil’s recent decision to impose a two per cent tax on portfolio inflows has wide ranging implications for global finance and for countries such as India. The move is aimed at arresting the sharp appreciation of its currency, the real, which since the beginning of the year has gained 36 per cent against the dollar, undermining Brazil’s export competitiveness. This is not the first time that a major developing country has imposed restrictions on foreign inflows. In 1998, during the Asian currency crisis, Malaysia defied financial orthodoxy and imposed controls in a successful attempt to curb currency speculation, which devastated many of its neighbours. Until recently, Chile, the most successful of the Latin American economies, had required a portion of the foreign investment flows to be kept in an interest-free account with its central bank for a fixed period. The intention behind such controls is to keep a check on footloose global capital that, given both its large volumes and propensity to move in and out of a country in a matter of seconds, threatens macroeconomic management. It also signals a desire to be less dependent on certain types of foreign capital that is less stable. Over the medium-term, if properly implemented, these curbs could add to the repertoire of weapons that governments deploy to prevent asset bubbles.
The intellectual basis for the tax is found in the work of the influential U.S. economist and Nobel prize winner, James Tobin who in the early 1970s proposed a small tax — even as low as 0.1 per cent — on foreign exchange transactions to reduce volatility in the markets. Until the Asian crisis, the idea was not popular and even after that it had only sporadic political support. Recently, however, the G20 has asked the IMF to examine such proposals. Well endowed with natural resources, Brazil is having a commodity boom and is among the first countries to come out of the recession. Prudent macroeconomic management over the years has delivered low inflation and created a large middle class. As with India, Brazil’s attractiveness to foreign portfolio investors has not been an unmixed blessing. The rupee, like the Brazilian real, has gone up significantly against the dollar. The very large dependence of the stock market on these portfolio flows has been a major cause for concern. The RBI has been assessing the various flows on the basis of their liquidity profiles and risks. The time for a Tobin tax in India may not have come but its underlying principle can no longer be dismissed as being retrograde and impractical.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Taxing-foreign-inflows/article16889790.ece
2,11,2009,Taking due credit,"The Indian financial system in general and banks in particular have acquitted themselves creditably in the face of the serious global crisis. The reasons why the domestic financial institutions have remained robust and resilient when many of the world’s top banks and institutions collapsed and had to be rescued with public money are fairly well known by now. The Reserve Bank of India‘s report on trend and progress of banking for 2008-09 provides an incisive analysis of the developments that made last year a valuable learning period for the banks and regulators everywhere. The exposure of Indian banks to the toxic assets was minimal. More importantly, the RBI’s counter-cyclical prudential measures, during both the credit boom and the downturn, have played a significant role in minimising the deleterious consequences of the crisis. The second point, not fully appreciated initially, has since been given its due in policy discussions even at the global level. The initiatives taken by the RBI were mainly aimed at strengthening the banking system and financial markets while ensuring uninterrupted flow of credit to different sectors of the economy. The monetary policy shifted its focus from monetary tightening during the first half of 2008-09 to “aggressive easing” in the second half, using both conventional and unconventional tools.
If Indian banks and their regulators can take credit for coping well with the crisis, the outlook for the global banking sector remains weak on both sides of the Atlantic over the medium- and long-term, despite the critical rescue programmes. Although the financial regulatory system in the U.S. was shown up as a major lacuna during the crisis, no comprehensive overhaul has taken place. As the global economy improves by next year, the level of complacency might increase. There is an urgent need for achieving a greater degree of coordination in regulatory policies across the world. Almost all the factors that were behind the crisis have global implications. For instance, financial innovation and integration have increased the speed and extent to which shocks are transmitted across asset classes and countries, blurring the distinction between banks and other institutions. The nascent stage of development of the credit derivatives market in India and the perseverance of prudential policy that discourages excessive risk taking are some of the factors that helped banks and markets insulate themselves. Obviously, these policies will have to be reviewed in order to reinforce financial stability, financial sector governance, and risk management practices.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Taking-due-credit/article16889938.ece
2,11,2009,Double standards on Iraq and Iran,"Occupied Iraq’s approach to the French nuclear industry for help with the reconstruction of at least one of its reactors, and its opening of discussions with the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA), reveal the inconsistencies in western attitudes to the region. Iraq used to have three nuclear facilities, all purportedly for research, although Saddam’s scientists were reportedly ordered to replicate the French uranium enrichment process. All three Iraqi nuclear facilities were destroyed between 1982 and 1991, one by Israeli bombing and the others by U.S. and British bombing in the first Gulf War. Now, with an infrastructure devastated by U.S.-led troops during the 2003 invasion, and a clear need for reliable energy sources, Iraq is attempting to revive its nuclear programme. The political environment for this, however, is complex and uncertain. The U.N. Security Council Resolution 707, adopted in 1991, prohibits Iraq from nuclear activities of any kind, except for the use of isotopes for medical, agricultural, or industrial purposes, until the Security Council deems that Iraq has fulfilled the conditions of Resolution 687. That resolution forbids Iraq from acquiring any equipment or materials related to nuclear weapons, and gives the IAEA comprehensive supervisory powers over the country’s nuclear activities. Moreover, given the overall security situation underlined by the October 25 suicide bombing in Baghdad, Iraq’s capacity to render nuclear facilities safe is in doubt. One of its sites was looted after the invasion in 2003.
The recent Iraqi moves have provoked remarkably little reaction in the western world, which is intensely suspicious of anything neighbouring Iran says or does in nuclear-related matters. Even the potentially constructive draft deal reached in Vienna on October 21 has been received with much caution. If the draft is finalised, Iran will ship 1,200 kg of low-enriched uranium (LEU), amounting to 75 per cent of its enriched uranium stocks, to Russia to be turned into fuel suitable only for use in civilian reactors. U.N. inspectors also carried out their first inspection at Qom on October 25, at a site voluntarily disclosed by Tehran. Many western analysts, however, continue to be pessimistic, saying Iran can produce another 1,200 kg of LEU in a year, that the deal does not stop the country from enriching uranium, and that it is not known how much LEU Iran actually has. Such negativity could well jeopardise the deal, and it reveals the west’s continuing double standards over Iran and Iraq.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Double-standards-on-Iraq-and-Iran/article16889937.ece
4,11,2009,Towards full disclosure,"The promise made in August that financial assets of Supreme Court judges will be in public domain has been more or less fulfilled with 21 judges, including the Chief Justice of India, posting the information on the Court’s official website. While it is a matter of great satisfaction that the highest court in the land has gone public with details of the assets — a decision that was preceded by an intense debate about the need for greater judicial accountability — it has not gone far enough. The fact that this is a voluntary declaration — something that is emphasised in the website — makes it possible for some members of the judiciary to hold out, thereby defeating the main purposes of such disclosures, which are to promote judicial transparency and ipso facto to check judicial corruption. Also, the twin aims can be met only by regular and updated disclosures and not via one-time declarations. In this context, greater judicial accountability is best achieved through a mechanism for the mandatory public disclosure of judges’ assets. Regrettably, Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan and some sections of the higher judiciary continue to strongly oppose this.
The voluntary declaration should not deter attempts to introduce legislation that mandates an accurate and full public declaration of assets. In August, the Centre was forced to withdraw the Judges (Declaration of Assets and Liabilities) Bill in Parliament, after protests cutting across party lines against a weak and self-defeating clause that disallowed declarations of assets and liabilities from being made public or questioned by any citizen, court or authority. The Centre would do well to reintroduce the legislation after making the necessary changes in the offending clause. It is important to note that the current debate about making the judiciary more transparent takes place against the backdrop of the Supreme Court’s ill-advised decision to appeal against the Delhi High Court’s ruling that the nation’s highest court falls within the purview of the Right to Information Act. Public faith in the judicial system will improve only if the functioning of the higher courts is open to public scrutiny. Where is the case for keeping the higher judiciary insulated from the RTI when the office of the President of India comes under its ambit? How can a judiciary that endorses the Election Commission’s bid to make the declaration of assets of candidates to elected office mandatory sing a different tune when it comes to its own functioning? The higher judiciary must be open to supporting any move that enhances judicial transparency and, at the same time, safeguards judicial independence.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Towards-full-disclosure/article16890133.ece
4,11,2009,All’s not well in Andhra Pradesh,"By initiating and then calling off an alliance with film star K. Chiranjeevi’s Praja Rajyam for the upcoming polls to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, the Congress party has sent out some confusing signals. In revoking the seat-sharing deal within a day of settling it with a party that fared poorly in the State capital during the 2009 Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, the State and central leadership of the ruling party clearly succumbed to pressure tactics from loyalists of Jaganmohan Reddy, Kadappa MP and son of Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy. The proposed tie-up, orchestrated by Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee chief D. Srinivas, had the blessings of Chief Minister K. Rosaiah and at least the tacit approval of the party high command. The State leadership was evidently looking for a charismatic campaigner in the Greater Hyderabad region. Following threats issued by Jagan loyalists, the contracted marriage of convenience was cancelled. It is understandable that a bereaved party does not want to lose a prestigious contest just five months after a strong leader led it to a famous victory in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections. But that is history.
Although the succession was handled soberly enough and Mr. Rosaiah’s continuance as Chief Minister may not be in question right now, many Congress leaders launched a vitriolic campaign against what they believed was a short-sighted alliance with the film star’s party, which had polled a mere seven per cent in Hyderabad and a little over 16 per cent of the vote in the State. The Jagan camp insists that the Congress cannot possibly benefit from a tie-up with the Praja Rajyam, which they say is free to merge with the Congress. At the heart of the continuing feud are the present role and the future of Jagan. By not involving him in the campaign and thus giving the impression that he was being marginalised, the State leadership only succeeded in complicating the situation. The fact that the Congress Legislature Party has not met even once after Mr. Rosaiah was sworn in as Chief Minister speaks volumes about his wobbly position. After party president Sonia Gandhi met Jagan and he formally agreed to abide by her decision, the high command might have thought it had resolved the crisis in the party’s southern stronghold. The policy of drift has taken a toll on both party and government, with the unassuming Chief Minister unable to rely on many of his Ministers despite repeatedly committing himself to the schemes and legacy of his predecessor. Perhaps, the high command wants to wait for the outcome of the November-end civic poll before taking a final decision. But the damage seems to have been done.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Allrsquos-not-well-in-Andhra-Pradesh/article16890132.ece
5,11,2009,Afghanistan’s election fiasco,"On November 1, Abdullah Abdullah, the opposition candidate in the runoff round of the Afghan presidential election scheduled for November 7, withdrew his candidature. The Independent Election Commission (IEC) then declared the incumbent president, Hamid Karzai, the winner, though the constitutional validity of cancelling the runoff, even with only one candidate standing, is not clear. Dr. Abdullah apparently plans a Supreme Court challenge, but there is little appetite for a fresh poll, and a challenge will probably fail. The runoff was needed because the original election, held on August 20, was so fraudulent that the U.N.-supported Election Complaint Commission (ECC) reduced Mr. Karzai’s share of the vote from 54 per cent to 48.6 per cent, leaving him without an absolute majority. Dr. Abdullah’s demand for changes in the personnel of the IEC, which ran the election, was entirely reasonable, as the Karzai-appointed IEC was itself responsible for much of the fraud. The United States and the United Kingdom, which led the NATO invasion of Afghanistan in November 2001, are frantically trying to spin the legitimacy of Mr. Karzai’s new presidency. The election, however, has been widely called a fiasco and a shocking failure by the west to create a credible democracy in Afghanistan.
So Afghanistan now has a president of dubious legitimacy and an unquestionably corrupt administration; when making his inaugural speech, Mr. Karzai was flanked by two vice-presidents who are respectively said to be a drug baron and a war criminal. It is also unclear if the government will be an interim one lasting until another election can be held in the spring. Interim status would undermine Mr. Karzai’s standing yet further; in any case the perception throughout Afghanistan is that the new government is a NATO creation and cannot survive without NATO. Even if, under western pressure, Mr. Karzai gives Dr. Abdullah a post in government, the Afghan state could lose control over northern areas, where Dr. Abdullah’s support is concentrated. It is now even harder for the U.S. to gain support among ordinary Afghans for the 40,000 more troops President Obama plans to send to Afghanistan, and NATO has totally lost its way. It is a tragedy for the Afghan people that Mr. Karzai would probably have won without rigging the election. The Taliban could make huge political gains from the present shambles. There is an obvious parallel with the U.S.-rigged election which put Nguyen Van Thieu into power in South Vietnam in 1967, and there is a bitter contrast with the fate of the Palestinians, who are suffering Israel’s brutal displeasure for having chosen Hamas in a free and fair election.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Afghanistanrsquos-election-fiasco/article16890338.ece
5,11,2009,The shine is back,"The purchase of a sizable quantity of gold by the Reserve Bank of India from the International Monetary Fund is significant not just for India but for the IMF, and the global financial system as well. The RBI has paid approximately $6.7 billion to buy 200 tonnes, almost half the quantity put up for sale in September. For the RBI, the transaction is much more than a strategy of diversifying the risks in the management of reserves, although that is an obvious outcome. During the third week of October, the foreign exchange reserves with the RBI amounted to $285 billion and they were held in foreign currency assets, gold, and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) with the IMF. Like most other central banks, the RBI has kept the bulk of its reserves in U.S. government securities. Gold has so far accounted for just $10 billion or less than four per cent of the reserves — it will now constitute six per cent. The RBI is set to become one of the largest holders of gold reserves among central banks. The IMF, which plans to use the sale proceeds to buttress its concessional lending programmes to poor countries, has succeeded in broad-basing its long-term sources of funds. It has won appreciation for the way it struck the deal with a central bank buyer rather than with a number of market players. Several other central banks are expected to follow suit.
It might be too early to say conclusively; but it is very likely that India’s trend-setting purchase from the IMF will strengthen gold’s claim to be the preferred asset of diversification. Gold prices, already ruling high, received a further boost after the details of the deal were made public. To a large extent, the yellow metal’s recent strength mirrors the weakness of the dollar. Since March, the dollar has declined by 15 per cent against major currencies while gold has gained by an identical margin. The RBI’s action might spur other central banks to rebalance their dollar assets portfolio and move into gold in a bigger way. Indeed many of them, including those of China, Russia, and Mexico, have reportedly been accumulating gold.Yet the dollar — currently under stress because of the large fiscal deficits of the U.S. Government — is unlikely to be dethroned from its position of supremacy in global trade, foreign exchange transactions or even as the predominant reserve currency. For India, as much as diversifying its reserves, the deal with the IMF tellingly demonstrates the distance the country has travelled since 1991. Down to its lowest level of reserves, the country then had to pledge some 70 tonnes of gold to meet its immediate import bill.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-shine-is-back/article16890337.ece
6,11,2009,Enforcing the rule strictly,"It is a well-settled principle of law that the presence of a conflict of interest — actual or potential — is sufficient to disqualify judges from participating in legal proceedings. The rule against bias emerges from the maxim ‘ Nemo judex in causa sua’, which means no man should be a judge in his own cause. The withdrawal of two Supreme Court judges on a single day is a reminder of the principles of judicial recusal and the importance of satisfying a fundamental tenet in the administration of justice — that justice should not only be done but also be manifestly seen to be done. The recusal of Justice R.V. Raveendran in a high profile gas dispute case involving the Ambani brothers on learning that his daughter was associated with a solicitor’s firm advising one of the two parties underlines a basic point about the applicability of the rule of bias. It is nobody’s case that Justice Raveendran’s judgment would have been influenced or impaired by his daughter’s link with the firm; conflicts of interest in the judicial realm are rarely about real bias. Rather, they relate to what is described as apparent or unconscious bias, concepts founded on the principle that there should not be even a smidgeon of doubt about external factors interfering in the course of justice.
Justice Raveendran, who had offered to pull out of the case earlier on the ground that he had shares in companies promoted by both the Ambani brothers, was persuaded to stay by the opposing lawyers. Strictly, the principles governing pecuniary bias demand that any financial interest, however small, disqualify a person from adjudicating. Justice Markandeya Katju was right in informing the two sides that he could not participate in another case involving Reliance Industries since his wife owned shares in the company. That even the slightest appearance of bias is enough to ruin a case is reflected in one relating to Chile’s General Augusto Pinochet, who challenged an adverse order by Britain’s House of Lords on the ground that one of the law lords, Lord Hoffman, was a Director of a registered charity connected with Amnesty International, a party to the case. Pinochet’s lawyers did not allege actual bias, but a challenge on appearance of bias was sufficient to have the order set aside (see www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ ld199899/ldjudgmt/jd990115/pino01.htm). It is not uncommon for judges to withdraw from cases in India. The present system of a judge merely declaring his interest and leaving it to the lawyers to object to, or accept, his hearing a case is clearly unsatisfactory. The rule against bias needs to be applied strictly and the recusal of a judge who has any kind of interest should be automatic and be done at the earliest.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Enforcing-the-rule-strictly/article16890502.ece
6,11,2009,Hyping science,"When a two-decade-long search for an effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection has been a failure, the pressure to hype and provide spin to make results of a trial look successful increases. More so as only two trials have managed to reach Phase III, the final step in testing a vaccine. Aidsvax, the first Phase III vaccine trial done on more than 5,000 volunteers in Thailand, was found to be a failure in November 2003. The Phase II Merck trial in 2007 not merely failed; it increased the risk of HIV infection in those vaccinated. Unsurprisingly, the pressure to make the latest Phase III trial, conducted in Thailand on more than 16,000 volunteers, seem successful became overpowering. How else to explain the compulsions behind the positive portrayal of the Thai trial (RV144) results on September 24? It was announced that the trial using two different vaccines in a prime-boost regimen produced a modest preventive effect of 31 per cent in those who received the vaccine. What followed was euphoria among those working in the HIV vaccine field; this was the first time a vaccine was found to have the long-sought-after preventive effect.
The euphoria gave way to disappointment when the full results were announced in Paris on October 20 and published simultaneously in The New England Journal of Medicine. The paper contained other data (intention to treat, and per protocol) not mentioned in the initial announcement; and they failed to show a statistically significant protective effect. Why did the sponsors who were aware of these data in September not disclose them? The modified intention-to-treat analysis, which was not part of the original protocol design, was added six months before the data were analysed. This design helped remove seven volunteers who tested positive, thereby increasing the odds of a successful outcome. Unlike other HIV vaccine trials, this one had 76 per cent of individuals at low- and moderate-risk. The trials’ claim to success was based on moderate protection seen in those at low- and moderate-risk and not in those at high-risk of infection. This vital information was withheld initially. By cherry-picking the positive results, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), one of the sponsors of the trial, has laid itself open to the charge of breaching the ethical norms for reporting clinical trial results. Hyping results and imparting spin to the interpretation of trial data is clearly detrimental to science, and is not something expected from a nodal agency responsible for oversight.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Hyping-science/article16890489.ece
7,11,2009,Congress blinks first,"In political, as in most forms of bargaining, the party with the higher stakes will blink first. With each day that was added to the delay in government formation in Maharashtra, the Congress began to realise it was losing much and gaining little by prolonging the discussions over sharing ministerial berths with its partner, the Nationalist Congress Party. Thus two weeks after the Assembly election results were announced, the senior partner concluded an agreement without being able to wrest any of the major portfolios from the NCP, which was clearly in no hurry to end the stalemate. The accord came after a lot of pressure from the main Opposition, the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party, and some prodding from Governor S.C. Jamir. For his part, NCP legislature party leader Chhagan Bhujbal talked of lending “outside support” to the new government, a ploy often used by junior partners in a coalition. External support without participation in the government is, after all, uncertain support, and the statement was clearly intended as a threat. Pressured and nudged from different sides, the Congress had no real choice but to give in. Any further delay could have created constitutional awkwardness, quite apart from political embarrassment.
This is not the first time these allies have tested each other’s time and patience before reaching an agreement. In 1999, when they first came together, they took two weeks to decide the shape and size of government. In 2004, when the NCP won more seats than the Congress, 12 days were spent in hard bargaining. In 2009, although the Congress, with 82 seats, won 20 seats more than the NCP, it was not able to leverage this in the bargaining for ministries. The NCP negotiators had a clever argument. The Congress contested 174 of the 288 seats but won fewer than half that number. The NCP, bagging 62 from the 114 seats it contested, had a better strike rate (54.4 per cent) than the senior partner (47.1 per cent). The Congress was allowed to field candidates in a larger number of constituencies on the strength of its good showing in the Lok Sabha election. By contrast, the NCP, which did not fare all that well in the 15th general election, recovered some of the lost ground in the Assembly election. Now that the political negotiations are over, the Congress and the NCP must get to work seriously on the tasks of governance. The 2009 mandate is not an unqualified endorsement of what they did over the last ten years and the coalition regime must set its mind on doing much better. As a first priority, it must deal with the agrarian crisis in all its aspects — drought, power cuts, and farm suicides.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Congress-blinks-first/article16890681.ece
7,11,2009,Broadening conservation,"Heritage conservation practices improved worldwide after the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (Iccrom) was established with Unesco’s assistance in 1959. The inter-governmental organisation with 126 member states has done a commendable job by training more than 4,000 professionals, providing practice standards, and sharing technical expertise. In this golden jubilee year, as we acknowledge its key role in global conservation, an assessment of international practices would be meaningful to the Indian conservation movement. Consistent investment, rigorous attention, and dedicated research and dissemination are some of the positive lessons to imbibe. Countries such as Italy have demonstrated that prioritising heritage with significant budget provision pays. On the other hand, India, which is no less endowed in terms of cultural capital, has a long way to go. Surveys indicate that in addition to the 6,600 protected monuments, there are over 60,000 equally valuable heritage structures that await attention. Besides the small group in the service of Archaeological Survey of India, there are only about 150 trained conservation professionals. In order to overcome this severe shortage, the emphasis has been on setting up dedicated labs and training institutions. It would make much better sense for conservation to be made part of mainstream research and engineering institutes, as has been done in Europe.
Increasing funding and building institutions are the relatively easy part. The real challenge is to redefine international approaches to address local contexts. Conservation cannot limit itself to enhancing the art-historical value of the heritage structures, which international charters perhaps overemphasise. The effort has to be broad-based: it must also serve as a means to improving the quality of life in the area where the heritage structures are located. The first task therefore is to integrate conservation efforts with sound development plans that take care of people living in the heritage vicinity. Unlike in western countries, many traditional building crafts survive in India, and conservation practices offer an avenue to support them. This has been acknowledged by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage charter for conservation but is yet to receive substantial state support. More strength for heritage conservation can be mobilised by aligning it with the green building movement.

8,11,2009,Dishonourable to the core,"An inglorious capitulation by the central leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party to political blackmail by a mining lobby spearheaded by the Reddy brothers has paved the way for a resolution of the Karnataka crisis – for now. The brothers, G. Janardhana Reddy and G. Karunakara Reddy, who are Ministers in the BJP government and claim to have the support of about 50 Members of the Legislative Assembly, made common cause with political discontents having their own ambitions. They got all they wanted – except the removal of Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa, who despite being denuded of his constitutional authority and thoroughly humiliated has been obliged to participate in the farce of a triumphant denouement in New Delhi. Some of the terms of capitulation: upright officials, including the Chief Minister’s Principal Secretary V.P. Baligar, have been transferred; Rural Development Minister Shobha Karandlaje, one of the more dynamic faces in the Cabinet against whom no wrongdoing has been established, is to be dropped; the transfer of officials in Bellary and Gadag districts believed to be close to the Reddy brothers will be partially rolled back; the proposal for a tax of Rs. 1,000 per truck-load of iron ore or other minerals will be abandoned; and a core committee headed by Sushma Swaraj and including the Chief Minister as well as the elder Reddy brother, will be constituted. Having used the financial muscle of the brothers to win over independents and engineer defections from other parties last year, and to fight the Lok Sabha election this year, the BJP was in no position to take the moral high ground. On the other side, whatever the shortcomings of the Yeddyurappa government, most recently spotlighted by its handling of the flood crisis, the fact is that it took some steps to check the unrestrained ways and greed of the mining lobby.
What was the honourable course open to the BJP? The party that summarily expelled Jaswant Singh for writing a book on Jinnah should have taken swift, no-nonsense disciplinary action against the Reddy brothers, first by backing their dismissal as Ministers. It should have done a quick appraisal of the views, motivations, and real intent of the MLAs in the rebel camp. It should have made it clear to them that while it was willing to take up the genuine complaints and grievances of those who were unhappy with the style of functioning of the Yeddyurappa government, there was no question of surrendering to political blackmail. Above all, the BJP central leadership should have strengthened the Chief Minister’s hand by making it clear to the rebels that the party was not afraid of going to the people, if need be, by opting for dissolution of the State Assembly. Since most MLAs do not want to face an election at mid-point of the five-year term, a firm, principled stand and swift action would probably have quelled the rebellion. But given a compromised central leadership, there was no question of the ‘party with a difference’ taking anything but the moral low ground.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Dishonourable-to-the-core/article16891004.ece
8,11,2009,Setback to science,"The career of the disgraced South Korean stem cell researcher, Hwang Woo Suk, came to an intriguing end when a court handed down a two-year sentence (suspended for three years) for embezzling government money ($700,000) and buying human eggs for research in violation of bioethics law but cleared him of the fraud charges. In South Korea, science fraud becomes illegal only if the fraudulent data are used to gain funds. Dr. Hwang admitted fraud in January 2006 and his government promptly withdrew his licence to conduct stem cell research. This was for conducting fraudulent research and also for bioethical transgressions — paying women to donate eggs and using eggs donated by two junior scientists working in his laboratory. It became clear by the end of 2005 that the two ‘landmark’ papers published in Science that catapulted Dr. Hwang to fame contained nothing but fabricated data and manipulated images. The ‘breakthrough’ paper, published in March 2004, reported the first stem cell line produced from a cloned human embryo. It was followed by a ‘seminal’ paper in May 2005 where the researcher reported the creation of 11 stem cell lines that genetically matched nine patients with spinal cord injury, diabetes, and an immune system disorder. The journal retracted both papers in January 2006.
An unintended but positive consequence of Dr. Hwang’s notoriety has been a tightening of the rules and closer scrutiny of images submitted by researchers for publication. The committee that examined the two papers at the behest of Science suggested that it would no longer do to work on the assumption that there would be no misrepresentation by the authors, and proposed some changes in the verification process. There is also a greater understanding among young researchers of what constitutes misconduct in science and its costs. Seoul National University, where Dr. Hwang worked until he was dismissed, even started an undergraduate course on misconduct. But science fraud and misconduct are likely to occur as long as the following conditions persist — a pressure cooker situation of having to publish in high-impact journals, ready access to simple tools to falsify data, and the race by science journals to publish path-breaking results, at times in fast-track mode.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Setback-to-science/article16890952.ece
9,11,2009,The Heisei Reformation,"Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama’s first speech to a plenary session of both houses of the Diet delivered recently was a clear statement of bold intentions. He noted that decades of cronyism, corruption, and secretive policy-making have created widespread distrust of politics in Japan. In response, he announced plans for greater transparency, with ministerial decision-making under collective cabinet responsibility as well as the involvement of citizens in making policy proposals. A new and more equal relationship between central and regional governments is to be created, and senior civil servants will be banned from taking post-retirement posts in private sector bodies with which they have had official dealings. In economic policy, the Prime Minister intends to legislate against lenders’ practice of denying or foreclosing loans to small and medium-sized businesses, which he called the real strength of the Japanese economy. He has also pledged Japan to reaching a 25 per cent cut in its 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.
Above all, his speech signalled a desire for the Japanese state to reconnect with voters and for the Japanese people to reconnect with one another. The government will provide indirect support to the growing number of local voluntary bodies and non-profit organisations to enhance community building. It will end age discrimination in health care for the elderly. There will be additional state benefits for single-mother households, and a child allowance. Public high school education will be free of charge. And gender equality is to be promoted actively. Much, of course, will depend on the state of the economy. Mr. Hatoyama argues that his policies will provide stable growth led by domestic demand. Inevitably, criticism has focussed on the costs of the social aims and the lack of specifics on economic policy. Unsurprisingly, the opposition Liberal Democratic Party called Mr. Hatoyama’s speech “sentimental,” presumably for his espousal of yuai or fraternity. On the foreign policy front, the new government will face tough challenges. Mr. Hatoyama wants to end Japan’s post-war subservience to the United States, and the U.S. military presence on Okinawa is a sensitive issue. Nevertheless, given the widespread public disillusionment with the old ways, he has a fine opportunity to transform Japanese politics. If he achieves the Heisei Reformation (which he mentioned in his speech, referring to the era of the current Emperor), Prime Minister Hatoyama will be seen as one of the defining figures of modern Japan.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-Heisei-Reformation/article16891114.ece
10,11,2009,A revenue raising exercise,"The government’s decision to ask all profit-making public sector units to list their shares in the stock exchanges to the extent of 10 per cent is to be seen largely as a revenue raising measure. Apart from providing resources, it will subject the PSUs to the discipline, including the push to maintain profits, that listing in the market would entail but will not fundamentally alter the way they function. In his budget speech, the Finance Minister emphasised the importance of disinvestment more from the viewpoint of ushering in widespread shareholder participation and less from the revenue angle. The budgetary target was just Rs.1,120 crore. The latest decision paves the way for a substantially larger mobilisation of resources through the sale of a small portion of its equity stake in select undertakings. Each undertaking will have to offer at least 10 per cent of its paid up capital to comply with the current stock exchange listing norms. Only 48 of the estimated 248 central government enterprises are listed on the stock exchanges. Since profitable companies can collect substantial sums by way of premium on the shares offered, the government can expect a sizable mop up. To make the disinvestment process more acceptable, the government has undertaken to deploy the proceeds in approved social sector schemes, possibly including flagship programmes such as the Bharat Nirman and the NREGS.
A successful disinvestment exercise of the magnitude contemplated will help in reining in the fiscal deficit, now estimated at around 6.8 per cent of the GDP. It might allow the government a greater leeway in continuing the stimulus packages that have so far delivered good results. Yet it is both early and unwise to bet on the outcomes of such a major policy decision. The disinvestment programme has always been controversial. Apart from building a political consensus, the government should preferably co-opt the employees of the undertakings listing the shares. Besides the government, several others will benefit from the exercise. The retail investors stand to gain by way of access to quality stocks. Individual undertakings will benefit through wider exposure that a listing confers. They will also be subject to the accountability norms enforced by public shareholders. Ahead of the public offer, certain critical steps — notably the “corporatisation” of the PSUs recommended by the erstwhile disinvestment commission — will help in achieving a higher market capitalisation. Finally, the programme contemplated ought not to be evaluated over the short-term. Lessons from the recent past reinforce the view that the process of disinvestment is as important as any particular transaction.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-revenue-raising-exercise/article16891115.ece
11,11,2009,Mainstreaming chauvinism,"In the three years it has been in existence, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena led by Raj Thackeray has demonstrated that it is in no way inferior to the parent party, the Shiv Sena, in mainstreaming ‘rada’ or the streetfighting culture in the name of Maratha pride. On Monday, the MNS raised the stakes by taking its trademark violence inside the Maharashtra Assembly. The assault on Samajwadi Party MLA Abu Azmi for taking his oath in Hindi in defiance of Raj Thackeray’s diktat to all members to take their oath only in Marathi was by no means the most violent in the long list of outrageous acts perpetrated by the MNS since its formation. But the choice of venue and actors this time was significant. The occasion was a solemn constitutional ceremony, the swearing in of newly elected legislators, not a selection test for recruitment to the railways or public sector enterprises. And the assailants were MLAs, not hooded hooligans wielding hockey sticks and clubs. Clearly, the MNS sees political advantage in escalating its challenge to the Constitution and the rule of law and winning massive publicity for it. The great pity is that this provocative act of linguistic chauvinism seems to have won the approval of significant sections of the Marathi-speaking population, especially young people, across the State.
The assault on Mr. Azmi was the result not of any wounded Maratha pride but of the MNS’s single-minded determination to cannibalise the base of the Shiv Sena. Rediscovering the Sena’s original raison d’etre is, after all, its own raison d’etre. At a time when the parent party is pursuing hardcore Hindutva in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party and apparently diluting its ‘sons-of-the-soil’ policy, the MNS sees socio-political space opening up for it to muscle into. Unfortunately, instead of seeing the long-term danger in this, the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party alliance seems to have adopted a benevolent attitude towards the enemy’s enemy. If the MNS has felt emboldened by every act of thuggishness and defiance of the law, it is essentially because the State administration has handled it with kid gloves. That Raj Thackeray’s cadres are capable of going ballistic the moment he or other senior leaders are arrested is well-known. But this cannot be a justification for tolerating their methods. The real danger from such opportunistic short-sightedness is that this experiment in mainstreaming linguistic chauvinism may succeed. The four-year suspension from the Assembly imposed on the four MNS MLAs who attacked Mr. Azmi is fully merited. But the government must go further and initiate criminal proceedings against them, and against the leader who put them up to it.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Mainstreaming-chauvinism/article16891329.ece
11,11,2009,Militant sanctuaries,"Militancy with trans-border linkages has been the bane of northeastern India. Bangladesh’s seemingly assertive moves against the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), whose operatives have been using its soil as safe havens and bases for their depredations in Assam, is a welcome step. This may well mark a decisive turn in the fight against the region’s separatists, akin to the military operation that Bhutan carried out in 2003 to flush out militant groups from its territory. Ever since the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League government came into being in December 2008, there have been expectations of quick steps to cut the trans-border lifelines of these outfits. Things, however, moved rather slowly. Hopefully, the tough line will be more in evidence at least from now on. Raids over the past few days have resulted in the flushing out of several important leaders of ULFA. Two were arrested from the Tripura border by the Border Security Force — evidently, with some aid from Dhaka. Yet, ULFA’s general secretary Anup Chetia, who was arrested in 1997 in Dhaka and released in 2005, is yet to be handed over to India. The whereabouts of ULFA chairman Arabindo Rajkhowa, “commander-in-chief” Paresh Barua, and his deputy Raju Barua, who were known to be in the country, remain unclear.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s visit to New Delhi next month has the potential to be a bilateral watershed. There is much to be done. In the absence of an extradition treaty between India and Bangladesh, handing over each other’s wanted criminals has been a challenge. A mutual legal assistance treaty on criminal matters, a legal framework for seeking deportation on a case-by-case basis, and an agreement on transfer of convicts are among the proposals that found favour with the two countries during Foreign Minister Dipu Moni’s visit to New Delhi four months ago. It is to be hoped that these agreements will be concluded soon. Dhaka should also crack down on the bases and leaders of the other militant groups — the NDFB, the NLFT, and the ATTF — who are known to be ensconced in Bangladesh. For India, equally important will be to get Myanmar stop providing sustenance to the several militant groups operating along the 1,630-km eastern border. India and Myanmar agreed in 2007 to launch coordinated operations against militants along the border, but that agreement remains on paper. Back on the Bangladesh border, the ongoing fencing work needs to be completed and the system of border patrolling and security should be stepped up.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Militant-sanctuaries/article16891328.ece
12,11,2009,A game changing scheme,"The importance accorded to the Unique Identification (UID) project is reflected in the constitution of a special group of Union Ministers headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to oversee its implementation. Some details about this audaciously ambitious project are yet to be finalised, but the broad plan is to cover some 1.2 billion people in the country by allotting each a unique number and creating a data base containing their photographs, biometric information (such as fingerprints), and a few details such as name, sex, and age. The idea of a unique identification system goes back to the National Democratic Alliance government, when Home Minister L.K. Advani proposed the issue of Multipurpose National Identity Cards (MNICs) in 2001. While the MNIC project suffered from the image of being principally a doubtful internal security measure — inspired by such motives as distinguishing illegal Bangladeshi immigrants from Indian citizens — the UID project has been packaged and promoted as primarily a mechanism to improve the delivery of government schemes for the poor and the marginalised. Unlike the MNIC scheme, the UID will comprise a number and not a card; will be available to all residents and not only citizens; and will be demand-driven as opposed to mandatory (although this does not preclude government agencies at the Central and State level from mandating enrolment).
With proper implementation, the transformative potential of the UID scheme in enhancing access to government services should not be underestimated. In becoming a single source of identity verification, it could enable the easier roll-out of wide number of services such as bank accounts, passports, driving licences, and LPG connections. Proof of identity and greater financial inclusion could lay the basis for checking fraud and corruption, avoiding duplication and targeting intended beneficiaries in a range of programmes such as the NREGS and the PDS. The attendant risks of such a potentially game-changing scheme — which include risks or hacking, privacy invasion, and the possible misuse of information by a future ‘Orwellian’ government — are real. The UID project should be open to wide public debate and Nandan Nilekani, the former co-chairman of Infosys who heads the Unique Identification Authority of India, has made a good start by seeking opinions, allaying apprehensions, and discussing details of the project with a wide section of people in government and civil society. He has the ability to draw the best IT talent required to implement a project that could set a new paradigm for government service delivery. What it needs is a legal framework that enables the creation of a unique identity system with adequate safeguards to protect privacy and confidentiality.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-game-changing-scheme/article16891727.ece
12,11,2009,Preparing the ground for GST,"The first discussion paper on the goods and services tax (GST) released by the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers incorporates some key decisions announced earlier while adding a few new ones. In July, it was announced that there will be a dual structure, with the Centre levying and administering its own GST and the States having their own laws and rates. In effect, there will be two sets of GST, one for the goods and the other for the services, levied at two levels of the Centre and the State on a uniform basis across the country. There would be minimal rate variations and as few exemptions as possible. It has now been decided that there would be two rates for goods and a single rate for services. The rate structure is yet to be decided but, for the tax on goods, the rate is expected to be between eight per cent and 10 per cent for the lower slab and 16 per cent to 18 per cent for the higher slab. There would be a lower rate for items of mass consumption and a standard rate for other goods. The threshold for the State GST covering both goods and services has been fixed at Rs.10 lakh, while that for the Centre’s levy is expected to be around Rs.1.5 crore for goods and higher for the tax on services. In a significant decision, imports of goods and services will be subjected to the GST, both by the Centre and the States. The Centre will levy an integrated GST on inter-State transactions. Transfer of revenue between States will be on a net basis at fixed intervals.
The discussion paper, which will form the basis for further discussions with trade and industry and consumer organisations, is a major step forward but is not quite the road map it should ideally be. While there is a consensus that the GST should be as exhaustive as possible, certain items such as alcoholic beverages have been left out and will continue to be taxed by the States. In a concession that is sure to distort the new indirect tax structure, octroi and other purely local levies have been allowed to remain. The much-needed technical support for infrastructure is expected to be in place only by mid-January. There has been no firm indication as to when the preparatory legal measures, including amendments to the Constitution, will be carried out. More basically, some States are reportedly sceptical and have not come on board. As indicated by the Union Finance Minister, it seems certain that the GST cannot be introduced, as scheduled, by April 1, 2010.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Preparing-the-ground-for-GST/article16891726.ece
12,11,2009,By-elections as pointers,"Step back and the picture becomes clearer. The results of the recent by-elections to 31 Assembly seats spread across seven States confirm some of the key trends that emerged in the 15th Lok Sabha election. The Congress is gaining strength in Uttar Pradesh, the Left is losing its hold in West Bengal and Kerala, and the Bharatiya Janata Party is struggling in most places. But step closer and the details reveal other, smaller trends, different from those seen in the Lok Sabha election. Most notably, in Uttar Pradesh the Bahujan Samaj Party, which fared poorly in the 2009 Lok Sabha election compared to its performance in the 2007 Assembly contest, is recovering lost ground. (An alternative explanation: an Assembly election is not a parliamentary election.) The Congress is eating into the vote share of the Samajwadi Party, which got the largest number of seats, 23 of 80, in the Lok Sabha election. The BSP has gained at the expense of not only the SP but also the Congress. In the Firozabad Lok Sabha constituency, the Congress came out on top. The SP lost all the five Assembly seats it held, besides Firozabad. The BJP surrendered two seats, and the Janata Dal (United) one. The interesting question now is whether U.P., one of India’s most politically fragmented States, will see a polarisation between the BSP with Mayawati at the head and the Congress with Rahul Gandhi as the star campaigner.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/By-elections-as-pointers/article16891515.ece
12,11,2009,ICC and Kenya,"The International Criminal Court’s decision to investigate the 2007 post-poll violence in the Republic of Kenya marks the first instance where a case unrelated to conflicts among armed rebel groups and national governments will be heard at the world court. The case concerns a scramble for political dominance among the country’s pre-eminent tribal communities that is at odds with the democratic institutions and the rule of law. More than 1,100 people were reported to have been killed and thousands internally displaced in bloody ethnic clashes that broke out in the wake of the disputed Kenyan elections of 2007. The bloodbath was the handiwork of senior politicians with the connivance of the police, a judicial commission of enquiry concluded. ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampohas argued that there was a reasonable basis to believe that the incidents amounted to crimes against humanity which fell within the court’s jurisdiction under the Statute of Rome. With over 40 per cent of Members of Parliament occupying positions in the government, the current coalition, which is an outcome of the peace deal brokered by the former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, echoes the scramble for power between President Mwai Kibaki’s Party of National Unity and Prime Minister Raila Odinga’s Orange Democratic Movement of the opposition. The coalition’s failure to meet internationally stipulated deadlines to set up a tribunal to investigate the atrocities reflects the obstacles encountered within the establishment to bringing the perpetrators to justice.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ICC-and-Kenya/article16891514.ece
14,11,2009,Slip sliding away,"In two days of rain, the Nilgiris, the hill district of Tamil Nadu, experienced more than 100 landslips and 43 rain-related deaths — more than half the death toll taken in the State by the North-East monsoon. Houses and communication infrastructure came down, and roads and rail lines fell apart. The extent of damage caused to infrastructure is without precedent. True, the Nilgiris got more than its share of the rain: Ketti, for instance, received 82 cm in 24 hours, a record. However, this does not wholly explain the scale of the damage. While torrential rain was the trigger for the two-day havoc, the Nilgiris was laid low by the cumulative effect of years of deforestation and stone quarrying. Plantations and seasonal crops have replaced forests, resulting in loosening of the soil and increased risk of landslides. Urbanisation and mindless promotion of tourism have injured the fragile ecology of the hills. In Udhagamandalam, the headquarters of the district, conservation efforts have failed in the face of the push towards rapid development. A principal villain is the cartel created for illegal stone quarrying, which has enjoyed support from influential officials of the revenue, transport, and geology and mines departments. Just a few days ago, the CB CID (Crime Branch Criminal Investigation Department) of the State Police informed the Madras High Court that there were “glaring lapses” on the part of government officials, but that the investigating agency did not have evidence to inculpate them in a criminal case. The CB CID called for departmental action against more than 30 such officials in the district. All quarrying licences expired by 2003, but quarrying was done in some areas by those who earlier held a licence and, in other areas, by those who had never had a licence. The hills are being chipped or blasted away, with nothing to stop the depredations.
It is well established that hill areas are more susceptible to rain ravage than the plains and require extra protection. Although planning rules take into consideration the special nature of the hills, implementation is weak. Population pressures have resulted in houses being built on steep slopes, and large-scale agriculture being taken up in forest areas. The Nilgiris hill district is therefore highly vulnerable during the monsoon. Some of the damage to the eco-system is irreversible, and no matter what action is taken, landslides will be impossible to prevent. But alternative accommodation for people living in inhospitable slopes can at least ensure there is no loss of life during the next monsoon. Strict implementation of existing rules and an end to all quarrying must be the first steps in making the hills a safe place.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Slip-sliding-away/article16892169.ece
14,11,2009,Obama treats U.S. healthcare,"The United States House of Representatives recently passed the Affordable Health Care for America Act by 220 votes to 215. The bill, which is expected to cost $1.1 trillion over ten years, constitutes the greatest reform of U.S. health care since 1965 — when Medicare, a tax-funded single-payer system for those aged 65 or over and those with particular medical conditions, was created as part of the Johnson administration’s ‘Great Society’ programme. If passed into law, the new bill will extend health cover to 96 per cent of legally resident Americans. This it will do by widening the federally funded Medicaid system to include the 36 million Americans who currently cannot afford health insurance or whose employers do not provide it. The low-paid will be able to buy subsidised insurance or get cover from a government plan. Employers will have to provide insurance or pay a payroll tax of up to eight per cent. Significantly, insurers will be banned from rejecting those with pre-existing conditions and from dropping those whose needs increase; age limits will also be abolished.
The House vote is testimony to determined work by the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and to President Barack Obama’s intensive liaison with Democrat Representatives, including the doubters. The President made serious concessions, for example by accepting that insurers who provide abortion services will not receive federal funding. This could affect a large number of women who are currently uninsured. Fierce controversy continues, with ferocious lobbying and television advertising by corporate insurers and others against the bill. Even mainstream Republicans make claims that the Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman calls paranoid. Fears about the likely costs are outweighed by evidence that administration and screening account for 30 per cent of private insurance costs (as against 17 per cent in neighbouring Canada’s single-payer system). The Congressional Budget Office also estimates that the bill’s procedures will reduce costs. For example, financial relationships between medical manufacturers and doctors will be monitored by the federal government. The bill’s prospects in the Senate are uncertain. But after all the qualifications are made, President Obama deserves applause at this stage for winning where several Presidents — Theodore Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton — lost. Independent of the discord, the vigour of the U.S. health policy debate is a signal example for all countries where health coverage is less than universal.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Obama-treats-U.S.-healthcare/article16891977.ece
15,11,2009,A deal Iran can work with,"International diplomatic efforts to resolve the Iranian nuclear question took a promising turn last month when the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany joined the International Atomic Energy Agency in underwriting a complex deal for providing enriched fuel to the Tehran Research Reactor. In essence, the deal involves Iran temporarily exporting up to 1,200 kg of low enriched uranium already produced by its Natanz facility to Russia, where it would be enriched to just under 20 per cent. This fuel would then be sent to France for fabrication into rods, whereupon it would be inserted into the TRR under IAEA supervision and used for the eventual production of medical isotopes. The Iranian side initially welcomed the broad proposal but the draft agreement has since run into trouble in Tehran. Some influential members of the Majlis have denounced it as a western plot to ensure that Iran loses control of its LEU stockpile. Other analysts and officials have questioned specific elements, such as the involvement of the French, a party the Islamic Republic is reluctant to trust. As a result, the Iranian government has yet to formally come back to the IAEA or the P5+1 with its response.
The TRR fuel deal is a classic win-win arrangement. It vindicates the emphasis Iran has placed on developing indigenous enrichment facilities. It provides time to the United States and its allies to work out the contours of an eventual diplomatic settlement without having to worry about Iran using its accumulated LEU stockpile to ‘break out’ of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and build a weapon. From the Iranian point of view, the most attractive part of the proposal is that it represents a climbdown of sorts from the untenable western insistence on suspending enrichment at Natanz altogether. Although all or a part of the existing Natanz output will be exported, there is no requirement that Iran undertake not to replenish its stockpile. Unfortunately, the TRR deal runs the risk of getting embroiled in President Mahmoud Ahmadinijad’s domestic political troubles. Some of the details can be modified if Iran is wary of exporting all 1,200 kg in one shot: it could insist on part-purchase of enriched fuel or the prior shipment of a portion of the latter as a confidence-building measure. But Tehran would be unwise to reject the main thrust of the deal, not least because it represents the first serious effort by the Obama administration to diplomatically engage with the Islamic Republic. On its part, Washington must be flexible on the final shape the TRR package takes. It must resist the temptation to muddy the waters by constantly talking about the need for fresh sanctions. Productive dialogue cannot go hand in hand with the threat of coercion.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-deal-Iran-can-work-with/article16892302.ece
15,11,2009,Widening capital market access,"Two recent decisions of the the Securities and Exchange Board of India will have far-reaching consequences for investors and issuers of capital. To make the process of capital-raising easier and cost-efficient for the small and medium enterprises (SMEs), those listing on a specially created platform or exchange will be exempted from the eligibility norms applicable for initial public offers. Only companies with less than Rs.25 crore of paid up capital will qualify for this concession. That the special requirements of SMEs need to be addressed has long been recognised. In fact, in 1990, the OTC Exchange of India (OTCEI) was set up with the twin objectives of helping the smaller companies raise capital in a cost-effective manner and providing the investors with an efficient and transparent method of trade. But it failed to take off, despite its innovative features such as screen-based trading; it was probably ahead of its time. It remains to be seen whether the institution now proposed, almost two decades after the OTCEI, will fare better. SEBI is banking on financially sound and better-informed investors giving stability to this niche segment. The minimum application-size of Rs.1 lakh will however shut out many smaller investors.
The other important decision of SEBI is to permit auction as an additional method of book-building in “follow on” issues —the issues by companies that are already listed on the exchanges. The market price will be the benchmark. Bidders would be free to bid at any price above the floor price, and the allotment will be on the basis of the bid price and at differential prices. Retail investors will be allotted shares at the floor price. The auctioning a portion of shares, it is hoped, will help the issuers in better price discovery. Shares can be bid up to levels that may not be possible in the existing book-building process. However, for all the transparency it promises, auction has not been popular in almost all the countries where it was tried out. In the U.S., the spectacular success of Google Inc. in 2004 in auctioning its shares did not lead to a general revival of interest in the method. Various academic studies have shown that auction might trigger “winners’ curse,” a situation where the winners overbid. Secondly, it is possible that uninformed investors will be among the winners, shutting out the more knowledgeable ones. SEBI’s gradual approach is to be commended.

16,11,2009,Coming clean at Copenhagen,"With less than a month to go for the Copenhagen climate conference, there is great expectation that India, the fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gases, will come up with a clear plan to stem the growth of its carbon emissions. After a long phase of denial, there are some signs that national policy is beginning to acknowledge global concerns on this all-important issue. The signing of a memorandum of agreement with China on climate change is a welcome initiative that promises long-term benefits for both nations. The Chinese experience in substantially reducing carbon emissions per unit of GDP — by an impressive 49.5 per cent between 1990 and 2004 — is worth studying and emulating. It now appears virtually certain that the United States will not commit itself to binding emissions cuts at Copenhagen because a domestic consensus is yet to emerge. That need not stop India, however, from shaking off its ‘do-little’ image and strengthening international efforts for a political agreement. Indeed, if the U. S., China, and India can agree to differentiated cuts and joint development of green technologies, a strong protocol under the United Nations framework in 2010 may be more feasible. India needs to get its national action plan on climate change off the ground quickly. State governments need to get their act together. Aggressive measures are necessary to reduce emissions and raise efficiency in areas such as power generation, transmission, lighting, building practices, transport, forestry, water and waste management.
The Copenhagen conference may end with only a ‘political’ agreement on reduction of carbon emissions beyond the Kyoto Protocol period. Yet it offers India an opportunity to formulate a green development policy that leapfrogs the dirty carbon legacy of the industrial revolution. Wind, water and solar energy (derived using available technologies) have the least impact on global warming. They can help taper off fossil fuel use and meet the bulk of energy demand in the future. There are challenges, however, as rare earths and other materials needed to manufacture the tens of thousands of wind turbines, motors, fuel cells, batteries, and solar cells that form the backbone of this vision are finite and difficult to access. If new materials are developed, these hurdles can be crossed. The resulting clean energy can transform the residential, commercial, industrial, and transport sectors. This is the green growth that India should aspire for. With political commitment, it is possible to develop a research and production base for cutting-edge technologies and fast-paced innovation. It will also lay the foundation for a new wave of green jobs.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Coming-clean-at-Copenhagen/article16892514.ece
16,11,2009,Stimulus-driven recovery,"As the United States economy continues to battle recessionary conditions, recent months have seen developments that some have hailed as indicators of economic recovery. First, stock markets witnessed an unexpected rally from early March, with the Dow Jones industrial average jumping 57 per cent — however volatility has soared since the crisis began, with $6.9 trillion of U.S. shareholder value wiped out in 2008 alone. Secondly, banks that accepted taxpayer money under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, including Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and U.S. Bancorp, repaid their debt to the federal government. Subsequently, some of them went on to make record trading profits even as commercial banking languished, most notably Goldman Sachs which made $3.44 billion in profits for the second quarter. Thirdly, the U.S. economy posted growth results that heralded, technically, the end of the recession. Supported by massive stimulus packages to banks and automobiles, the third-quarter growth rate of 3.5 per cent marked the first quarter of positive growth in more than a year.
But juxtapose these indicators of recovery with the looming symptoms of recession that remain, and optimism about a full-fledged return to pre-crisis conditions seems hollow. Unemployment in the U.S. recently climbed to 10.2 per cent and, by some predictions, will remain above 8 per cent even two years from now. After the end of the ‘cash for clunkers’ scheme aimed at boosting automobile sales, many of the large car manufacturers reported a sharp fall in sales in September. Quantitative easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve has made little difference to bank lending to customers — total consumer credit decreased at an annual rate of 6 per cent in the third quarter of 2009, according to the Fed. The International Monetary Fund predicts that economic growth in the near-term will be “sluggish, credit constrained, and, for quite some time, jobless.” There is general agreement that the signs of what looks like a recovery are driven by the massive fiscal stimuli supplied. There is even a risk that these signs will encourage conservative lobbies to press for rolling back fiscal deficits. Such misguided efforts must be resisted if the current low ebb of economic activity is to revive. A premature 1930s-style rollback runs contrary to the need for even higher levels of spending on public infrastructure and social services, vital to individuals and households who will remain in the vice-like grip of housing foreclosures and job losses for years to come. President Obama cannot afford to be fearful of deficits.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Stimulus-driven-recovery/article16892513.ece
18,11,2009,Legitimising the other,"The decision of the Election Commission of India to allow eunuchs and transsexuals the choice of registering under a separate sexual identity is a significant step towards mainstreaming an ostracised people who have been treated heartlessly by society. By giving them the choice of registering as “Others,” thereby dropping the requirement that they declare themselves male or female, the ECI has freed sexual identity from the trappings of obscurantism and bigotry. This should open the doors to other kinds of official identification and speed up the process of social inclusion. As things stand, official recognition for the third sex is contained in a few government documents — in passport application forms and on ration cards issued in some States, notably Tamil Nadu. The ECI’s decision, which will enable the transgendered to contest elections as ‘Others,’ will give this marginalised community a stronger political voice. The Indian discourse on human rights has largely neglected the transgendered. The law in India does not recognise a third sex, or sex change operations. Nor does it allow transsexuals to choose their own gendered role.
This presents a contrast to liberal and progressive trends elsewhere, where the rights of the transgendered to choose their sexual identities are becoming more and more entrenched. In 2002, the European Court of Human Rights held in a landmark case ( Christine Goodwin v/s the United Kingdom) that disallowing transsexuals to change their birth certificates or from marrying in their self-assigned gender roles was a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. The campaign for transgender rights received a big boost when Barack Obama was elected President of the United States. Commendably, his administration is committed to providing the transsexual community, along with gays, lesbians, and bi-sexuals, the full spectrum of equal rights in civil union and at the workplace. The International Bill of Gender Rights, which was drafted and adopted at a conference in 1993 and subsequently modified, lays down a constructive framework for the right to define and freely express one’s sexual identity. It has served as a working model for progressive reform in many countries. It is heartening that the ECI has taken the bold step in favour of the transgendered at a time when the central government’s commitment to LGTB rights is wobbly — reflected in its vacillations on the repeal or suitable amendment of Article 377 of the Indian Penal Code, a colonial-era provision that criminalises “unnatural sex” even if it is between consenting adults.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Legitimising-the-other/article16892700.ece
18,11,2009,The price of upholding the law,"The Obama administration’s honourable decision to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed — the self-confessed mastermind behind the attacks in the United States on September 11 — 2001 and terrorist attacks on U.S. buildings and citizens overseas, in a civilian federal court has created nearly as many problems as the Bush administration’s notorious creation of the Guantánamo Bay detention centre in which Mohammed and 239 others have been held for several years. Some of the problems are practical ones; for example, the Bush administration’s incompetence means that many of the case documents are scattered around the world. There are political problems too, as Mr. Obama’s decision to close the Guantánamo centre is unpopular with those who do not want the detainees held in their neighbourhoods; the term NIMBY, meaning ‘Not in my back yard,’ describes them accurately. That problem might be soluble, as plans are afoot to move the detainees to a high-security prison near Thomson, Illinois. Other political difficulties, like Republican opposition in Congress to the $80 million that it will cost to close Guantánamo and move the detainees to the U.S., may be more troublesome, because large numbers in the U.S. regard the detainees as guilty and dangerous irrespective of any legal process.
The main problems, however, are legal ones. U.S. military commissions have lower standards of proof than civilian courts, and Mr. Obama’s attempts to modify them have been abandoned. Secondly, the plan to try Mohammed and four of his alleged accomplices in New York City, the scene of the main attacks on 9/11, is procedurally sound, but questions arise whether a fair trial would be possible there. Thirdly, Mohammed himself has been waterboarded no fewer than183 times. U.S. attorney general Eric Holder has publicly declared that waterboarding is torture. In advance of a trial, it is difficult to tell if enough evidence has been lawfully obtained against the detainees to convict them. As to a trial itself, Mohammed and his associates have refused to cooperate with their military defence lawyers and may refuse to be represented in a civilian court. It will be for the trial judge to decide if they can represent themselves. A guilty plea will mean there is no trial, but a plea of not guilty could give Mohammed and his associates the opportunity to showcase their ideology to the watching world and give the al-Qaeda a propaganda coup — especially considering that Mr. Holder’s stated intention to seek the death penalty could enable Mohammed to claim that he is being martyred. President Obama is no doubt finding that upholding the law can be fraught with difficulty.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-price-of-upholding-the-law/article16892699.ece
19,11,2009,Shaking hands with clenched fist,"“You cannot shake hands,” Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said famously in a 1982 interview, “with a clenched fist.” Ever since he took office, Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram has been quietly working to un-clench the hands of Jammu Kashmiri secessionists and secure the support of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference for a peace deal. The Hindu recently broke news of a second round of secret meetings with key Hurriyat leaders, a sign that Mr. Chidambaram’s initiative is making some headway. Secret diplomacy is a key weapon, sometimes an effective one, in the arsenal of states seeking to solve intractable conflicts. However, New Delhi’s covert search for peace in Jammu and Kashmir has a less than luminous record. Despite two decades of sustained contact with various groups of secessionists, the results have been disappointing. As People’s Democratic Party leader Mehbooba Mufti has pointed out, a purely covert engagement involves the risk that any agreement arrived at will be perceived to be a ‘sell-out.’
The secret talks are intended to prepare the ground for a public engagement. But there is a major problem. The Hurriyat wants Kashmir’s Islamist patriarch, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, as well as Pakistan and its jihadist allies, to endorse the dialogue. Islamabad, beset by internal crises, is in no position to agree to anything domestic Islamists can attack as capitulation to India. Mr. Geelani has rejected talks on ideological grounds. Past peace efforts floundered on the same rock. Little came, for example, of Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani’s 2004 meeting with the Hurriyat. Pakistan rejected the process because it would have undermined its leverage in J&K. For his part, Mr. Geelani walked out of the Hurriyat before the talks. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh sought to address the problem by authorising secret talks with Islamabad even as he met with Hurriyat leaders in September 2005. Diplomats Satinder Lambah and Tariq Aziz agreed on the broad contours of a solution. By 2006, however, it became clear that a beleaguered Pervez Musharraf was in no position to deliver on the five agreed principles. The Hurriyat, for its part, failed to come up with an agenda for talks. Dr. Singh then changed tack: he called a conference, involving all major parties in J&K, in an effort to build consensus on the way forward. The secessionists, unsurprisingly, resiled from promises to participate. Mr. Chidambaram evidently hopes his renewed engagement will break the impasse. Some influential voices in the policy establishment are believed to be sceptical about the chances of success. Both Mr. Chidambaram and Hurriyat president Mirwaiz Umar Farooq must be applauded for giving peace a chance. Given the complexities of the endeavour, there can be no guarantee of success — nor should one be sought. But the time has come to conduct the dialogue in the clear light of day.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Shaking-hands-with-clenched-fist/article16892882.ece
19,11,2009,Make pictures speak,"If the objective is to persuade tobacco users to quit the self-destructive habit and to deter new users, emotive pictorial warnings alongside printed text on all tobacco products can be highly effective. The World Health Organisation recommends the deployment of “shocking” pictures that bring out the harsh realities of tobacco use. Evidence from several countries indicates that pictures that graphically depict the adverse health effects have the greatest impact. For instance, 67 per cent of smokers in Brazil and New Zealand and 44 per cent in Canada and Thailand wanted to give up the habit after pictorial warnings were introduced. In fact, a greater percentage of smokers wanted to see more information about the harmful effects of tobacco on the products, as a 2006 survey of ten countries revealed. Some countries are using innovative methods to enhance the effectiveness of the warnings. Brazil, for instance, is drawing from research on emotion to maximise negative emotional arousal; and Chile is using testimonial warnings from people who have suffered from tobacco use. The Indian government might not share the same enthusiasm, but it should do something radical about the set of pictorial warnings that will come out in 2010.
Consider the three pictorial warnings in current use: a scorpion, diseased lungs, and an X-ray of the lungs! This might be used in a case study of how not to communicate. The images confuse; they also mislead. Further, reducing the warning size to 20 per cent in principal display areas of cigarette packets is inexplicable. Pictures break linguistic barriers and can effectively communicate key messages to people deprived of education. The current month-long campaign on television and radio by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare shows how shocking pictures and tales of people suffering from oral cancer can effectively convey the vital message on the dangers of tobacco chewing. This intelligent campaign costs the exchequer a mere Rs.5 crore but spreading the same message through pictorial warnings will cost virtually nothing. Given the constant and intrusive impact on users, pictorial warnings on all tobacco products are the key to spreading the message. The government must put the public interest first and not succumb to industry pressure on a life-or-death matter.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Make-pictures-speak/article16892881.ece
20,11,2009,Batting for India,"Nobody expects professional cricketers to be heroic outside the playing field. They have too much of a job coping with the demands and stresses of the game, including the ever-present risk of injury, to be asked to handle the challenges and complications of politics. Thirty-six-year-old Sachin Tendulkar, who is widely regarded as cricket’s greatest batsman after Don Bradman and has had to handle greater pressure than any other player under the sun, must be commended for making a stand against linguistic and ethnic chauvinism, and for the idea of India, in volatile Mumbai. The occasion was an interaction with the media to mark his 20 years in international cricket, and Tendulkar had this to say in response to a question: “Mumbai belongs to India, that’s how I look at it. And I am a Maharashtrian and I am extremely proud of that. But I am an Indian.” A motherhood-and-apple-pie kind of statement, you would think. But this is Mumbai, where Bal Thackeray’s Shiv Sena, and now its offshoot, nephew Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, have been menacing anyone dissenting from their brand of linguistic chauvinism. So in an open letter published in the Sena’s mouthpiece, Saamna, the ageing, cricket-loving founder of the Sena rebuked the cricket icon for taking “a cheeky single” and getting “run-out” on “the pitch of the Marathi psyche.” Anyone mistaking this for banter needs to be reminded of the vicious track record of the Sena and the MNS, of their anti-constitutional intolerance, of their toughs unleashing violence against all manner of targets.
At one level, the Sena supremo’s response spotlights his party’s undiminished linguistic parochialism, which manifests itself in assailing the very idea of India. But there is also a more calculating side to Mr. Thackeray’s broadside. Having performed poorly in the recent Maharashtra Assembly elections (so poorly, in fact, that he felt moved to criticise his Marathi manoos for betraying his party), he has been in search of opportunities to go on the offensive. The MNS’s cannibalisation of the Sena’s electoral base has only made matters worse. With Mr. Raj Thackeray’s political agenda modelled closely on the Shiv Sena’s anti-‘outsider’ campaign of the 1960s, the two regional parties are locked in chauvinist competition to stoke the economic and socio-cultural anxieties of the Marathi electorate, especially in Mumbai. The MNS recently stole the show for the most outrageous behaviour by physically attacking, in the Assembly chamber, a Samajwadi Party MLA for taking his oath in Hindi rather than Marathi. Sachin Tendulkar, by making his stand, unwittingly offered himself as a target in this battle for political space. The bright side of this affair is the manner in which public opinion everywhere has come out batting for India.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Batting-for-India/article16893076.ece
20,11,2009,Making sense of inflation figures,"The decision of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs to change the periodicity of releasing the inflation data has been implemented from this month. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI)-based inflation figures are made available monthly, instead of weekly. However, the data on the prices of primary articles and commodities are to be released every week. It might be too early to evaluate the new arrangement fully but the first set of data does provide for greater transparency in one area of great common interest. The official agencies found it very difficult to reconcile the very low official WPI figures released at weekly intervals with the soaring prices of food and articles of mass consumption. The explanation that this is a statistical aberration arising out of the base effect — that the figures represent the price trends over the corresponding period last year — has not allayed the widespread scepticism over official statistics. The release of the weekly figures on November 5 showing inflation in the wholesale prices of primary articles at 8.94 per cent and food items up by 13.94 per cent has given a measure of credibility to the government statistics. For policy makers too there has been a further confirmation that the present rise in prices is driven largely by supply side factors that may not be amenable to standard monetary responses such as a hike in interest rate.
The decision to switch to a monthly release of WPI data is clearly prompted by a desire to move towards the international practice of relying on a representative consumer price index for policy purposes. Secondly, it is more practical to capture the changes in the prices of manufactured goods over a month than over a week. Thirdly, the weekly release leads to volatility in the financial markets. However, while the RBI has for long argued for developing a harmonious inflation index, the weekly release of the WPI index, in vogue since 1942, has had certain merits. It could give a true picture of the economy at short intervals, a significant pointer in a situation where several lead indicators such as unemployment rate and capacity utilisation are absent. It should be clear in a few months whether the new system would be of greater help in guiding policy, market sentiment, and public perception. If it is not, the government needs to be open to re-launching improved weekly WPI figures.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Making-sense-of-inflation-figures/article16893074.ece
21,11,2009,Food summit let-down,"The recent World Food Summit in Rome clearly failed to do its job. It did well to focus attention on the risk of food price shocks of the magnitude experienced in mid-2008, which led to civil unrest in over 30 countries. Yet it abjured its responsibility to the vision of a world free from chronic hunger and malnutrition, especially child malnutrition. Behind-the-scenes wrangling over the wording of the summit declaration ensured that no tangible commitments were made by rich countries to put the first Millennium Development Goal, MDG 1 — to halve global hunger and poverty by 2015 and eliminate it altogether by 2025 — on high priority. Instead, the 2025 deadline was jettisoned. With one child dying of hunger and malnutrition every six seconds and over 20 million children at risk, such negligence may cost all nations, and perhaps even the world order as it stands, dearly. The summit also chose to put price shocks ahead of a sustainable vision for agriculture through investments in technology and projects for developing countries. The FAO failed to convince G8 countries to increase the three-year, $20 billion investment in agriculture they promised at L’Aquila in July. Despite the FAO’s efforts, the G8 declined to raise that investment to $44 billion annually — though even that would have meant only a return to 1980 levels as a percentage of official aid spent on this sector. Among the G8 leaders, only Silvio Berlusconi bothered to attend the Rome summit, something an Italian Prime Minister could hardly avoid doing.
Yet the signs that the world has run out of time to address food shortage and inaccessibility could not be more ominous. Private companies supplying ‘breakfast cereals’ have, out of desperation to avoid 2008-type price spirals, started investing in agriculture in poorer countries. This has raised, for example in the case of South Korea’s Daewoo Logistics investing in Madagascar, the spectre of land grabs and political conflicts. In developing countries such as India, the supply of rice has dwindled owing to one of the worst monsoons in 30 years, prompting cuts in import duty and expectations of a global price surge. As scientist M.S. Swaminathan has pointed out, unless agriculture is viewed not as a food-producing machine, but as the backbone of the livelihood of the majority of the people, MDG 1 is likely to turn into a pipe dream. Only pro-poor policy interventions on an unprecedented scale integrated with increased investments in agricultural technology and projects can deliver the world from endemic hunger. Meeting at a time when the economic scenario is still grim, the summit has failed to instil confidence that this is likely to happen.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Food-summit-let-down/article16893267.ece
21,11,2009,Bangladesh’s moment,"It has been a long and agonising wait for Bangladesh. The judicial confirmation of the 1998 conviction of the killers of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s founding father, signifies a historic turn, though one would have wished the court had stopped short of the death penalty and opted for life imprisonment. The bloodbath of August 15, 1971, when the ‘Bangabandhu’ was shot during a putsch, has haunted the country since then. It has taken no less than 25 years for the legal barriers — including the infamous Indemnity Ordinance promulgated first in 1975 — erected by successive military and civilian governments to shield the killers, to be removed. The breaking away of East Pakistan had represented a political and social revolution, and the operation sought to oppose the dominant role of the military in politics and discard the culture of communalism. The assassination was clearly a setback for the new nation. For Mujib signified the vision of a secular and progressive Bangladesh. A large section of the people considered the coup and the assassination as part of a sinister and determined plot to turn the nation away from the path of socialism, democracy, nationalism, and secularism. If Bengali nationalism was the guiding spirit of the liberation struggle, a form of Bangladeshi nationalism, with stress on religious identity, was being sought to be established. The most significant outcome of the Supreme Court’s verdict should therefore be a reaffirmation of the dream of 1971.
If Sheikh Mujib’s death ended the first spell of democracy in the fledgling nation and set the stage for a series of foiled coups, his daughter’s comeback to power in the December 2008 elections, after many a twist and turn in the nation’s fortunes, was a triumph for democracy. But many tasks remain for the current leadership. In the immediate context these are two-fold: tracking down and bringing to justice the killers who are at large — at least seven of them may still be alive — and attaining a closure of the whole sordid issue. The fabric of civil society needs to be repaired. It is time for Bangladesh to turn the tragic and traumatic page and move on. The country owes it to Mujib, who was a unifying leader. It needs the salve of reconciliation and cooperation and has to come to terms with the imperatives of development. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the latest winner of the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, needs to keep in mind the legacy she represents and take Bangladesh forward in tune with the founding spirit.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Bangladeshrsquos-moment/article16893266.ece
22,11,2009,Stop illegal mining,"The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) of the Supreme Court could not have used clearer language than it has done in recommending that illegal mining must be stopped in six mines in two villages of Andhra Pradesh’s Anantapur district that border Karnataka. In a report submitted to the Supreme Court in connection with a writ petition, the CEC has made it clear that mining activities in this reserve forest area must be suspended until the boundaries of the iron ore mines are demarcated afresh. The committee has found the State government’s report to be “shockingly lacking in objectivity, fairness and impartiality.” The demarcation of boundaries has therefore to be undertaken by a team consisting of senior representatives of the Survey of India, and the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests, in addition to the State agencies in Andhra Pradesh. The controversy relates to mining companies in Obulapuram and H. Siddapuram villages, in which the BJP’s Tourism Minister of Karnataka, G. Janardhana Reddy (of Bellary), and Congress MP Jaganmohan Reddy, the son of the late Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, have interests. The entire opposition in A.P. has been demanding a probe into the alleged illegal mining in the region, and Chief Minister K. Rosaiah has responded positively by asking for a CBI investigation into the complaints.
The CEC’s report nails the falsehoods resorted to by the YSR administration on previous complaints. Chief Minister Rosaiah, who has played it by the book so far, must heed the CEC’s advice and crack down on illegal mining, in the interest of the rule of law as well as the environment. The committee has suggested that for the mining done outside the approved leases an “exemplary cost, equivalent to the normative market value of the iron ore extracted from the area” must be imposed on the leaseholder. The power and influence wielded by an unsavoury business partnership, which makes light of State and political boundaries and resorts to extra-constitutionalism to satisfy its greed, has been felt in both States. The Bellary Brothers, flexing their financial muscle, succeeded in bringing Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa to his knees as the price for being allowed to continue in office. Their power springs directly from politically facilitated access to these iron ore mines. As Union Labour and Employment Minister Mallikarjun Kharge has suggested, the CBI investigation requested by the Andhra Pradesh government must be extended to cover possible illegal mining in neighbouring Karnataka. Taking on this unholy nexus of business and politics will be a stern test for both State governments -- and for the country’s two leading political parties.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Stop-illegal-mining/article16893611.ece
22,11,2009,A strategic retreat,"The Centre has been forced by the groundswell of protest from farmers and opposition parties to agree to amend a controversial section of a recent ordinance on sugarcane pricing. Pricing issues in the sugar industry involving the cane growers, the sugar mills, the State governments, and the Centre are complex and have, on many previous occasions, generated acrimony. The latest controversy was set off by the Centre’s decision last month to amend the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and the Sugarcane Control Order, 1966 through two ordinances that appear to have been issued in haste and without consulting all the parties. Starting with the premise that the levy price of sugar must be fixed on “a fair and remunerative basis,” the Centre went on to fix a uniform price for sugarcane across the country that would give farmers a fair deal. Levy sugar is the portion of production sugar mills offer the government for its public distribution system at below market prices. The two ordinances effectively aimed at overhauling the pricing mechanism for sugarcane. The practice hitherto was for the Centre to announce a statutory minimum price (SMP) for sugarcane but the sugar mills had to pay a much higher price because the State governments invariably fixed a higher floor price, known as the ‘State advised price.’(SAP)
The Centre’s decision to announce ‘a fair and remunerative price’ (FRP) in lieu of the SMP has been contentious, especially because it seemed to set a cap. If State governments fixed higher SAPs, they would have had to bear the additional cost of levy sugar resulting from the higher sugarcane price. The major implication is that the sugar mills would not have paid anything more than the centrally advised FRP. Apart from the additional fiscal burden it might have entailed, the States faced an erosion in the powers they have enjoyed in administering sugarcane prices. With most of the major political parties, including the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, opposing the new policy, the Centre thought it expedient to virtually restore the status quo ante. The FRP will be merely a new name for the SMP. The sugar mills that stood to gain under the new policy have also been asked to write off the Rs.15,000 crore due to them on account of levy sugar supplied at prices based on the SMP of sugarcane rather than on the higher SAPs they had actually paid. While sugar pricing still remains unsatisfactory, the Centre’s latest attempt suggests that any change will run into opposition from one or the other of the stakeholders that will be difficult to surmount.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-strategic-retreat/article16893610.ece
24,11,2009,Bringing the Sena to justice,"It is no secret that the Shiv Sena has regularly attempted to stifle free expression by carrying out violent attacks on journalists and media establishments — and has got away with it thanks to a policy of appeasement pursued by successive governments in Maharashtra, mostly Congress or Congress-led regimes. But the regional party may have gone too far this time. The recent assault on the offices of the IBN television network, captured blow-by-blow by CCTV cameras, featured a mob of Sainiks armed with rods and baseball bats punching and kicking male and female journalists and trashing furniture, fittings, and electronic equipment. The Sena leadership would have us believe the attack was a “spontaneous” reaction to strong remarks made on the channel against supremo Bal Thackeray. This is demonstrably false. That it was a planned attack is evidenced by the fact that the mobs carried out simultaneous attacks on the TV network in Mumbai and Pune, and by information gathered by the police investigation that, among others, Sunil Raut, the brother of Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, was involved. A special target of the Sena’s wrath was its intrepid critic, Nikhil Wagle, Editor-in-Chief of the Marathi channel IBN-Lokmat and former Editor of the Marathi daily Mahanagar who has been assaulted repeatedly by Sena goons.
At one level, the brazen assault reveals the ugly face of competitive chauvinism, and the continued existence of a goon political culture, in India’s ‘maximum’ city. At another level, it reflects the Sena’s sense of insecurity during a phase of political decline — when it has been challenged by the copycat methods of a youthful Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, and has fared poorly in elections. It is no accident that Bal Thackeray’s, and Saamna’s, broadsides against Sachin Tendulkar for implicitly making a stand against linguistic chauvinism by affirming his Indianness alongside his Maharastrian identity have been followed up by targeting a channel that has aired opposition to the chauvinism. Such acts of vandalism have gone virtually unpunished in the past. This time, under pressure from an aggressive media, Chief Minister Ashok Chavan has pledged no-nonsense action and the Mumbai police have arrested close to 20 of the perpetrators and registered cases of attempted murder. The investigation, however, has not so far led to anyone more significant than Sunil Raut, who has just been arrested. The widely shared suspicion is that the State government’s response will return to the traditional policy of appeasement once the feelings of shock and anger subside. This is decidedly a case to be handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Bringing-the-Sena-to-justice/article16894030.ece
24,11,2009,American healthcare drama,"The U.S. healthcare reform drama is moving towards a resolution. The House of Representatives narrowly passed a version of the reform bill that scaled down the public option while retaining some landmark elements of the original Obama reform. Most importantly, the bill extends healthcare cover to 36 million uninsured Americans, bringing 96 per cent of the eligible population under the insurance umbrella. With the Senate voting last week to take up the debate in December, the risk of delaying tactics, especially a filibuster by Senate Republicans, has diminished. Now all that stands between President Barack Obama and unprecedented success in reforming a bloated and fundamentally inequitable healthcare system is a Senate vote on and for the bill and, after that, a final vote on a House-reconciled version of it.
The real threat to the U.S. President’s Senate support comes not from three vacillating Democratic Senators but from a potentially ruinous failure to convince the American public that his reform proposals will create a system that is more equitable in its delivery and deficit-neutral in its cost. The recent fall in Mr. Obama’s approval ratings to below 50 per cent for the first time reflects a failure to come with a bold political initiative to engage with, and enthuse, the American public. To put this in perspective, one needs only to recall how his brilliant campaign for the presidency was powered by broad-based and innovative grassroots appeal — among other things, through the use of the social media, rousing speeches that somehow managed to strike the right social balances, and genuinely democratic internet-based fundraising. Candidate Obama had charisma but, more importantly, demonstrated a gift for inspiring ordinary people with his inclusive promise of leadership. This left the Republican campaign floundering amidst confused and bitter sound bytes. But given the highly polarised nature of American politics and with the White House team performing below par, the Republicans, and especially their right wing, have recovered some ground. Specifically on healthcare reform, until the recent upturn in its fortunes, the administration seemed to be retreating into a cocoon of policy analytics. President Obama may well be banking on regaining his touch, and the political advantage, on the strength of his adroit technical manoeuvres and Congressional victories. Paradoxically, the prospects of his most ambitious reform project hinge on whether he has the capability to persuade millions of ordinary Americans — many of whom suffer from poor healthcare by developed country standards and debilitating unemployment — of its vital necessity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/American-healthcare-drama/article16894029.ece
24,11,2009,Table the Liberhan report,"Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram has declined to confirm or deny the authenticity of the “purported” contents of the Liberhan Commission report leaked to a newspaper and a television channel. From what has been reported, variously and even contradictorily in respect of some key details, Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan’s main findings are as follows. The destruction of the Babri Masjid, far from being “spontaneous,” as bigwigs of the Bharatiya Janata Party have claimed, was systematically planned, “tailor-made” — as revealed by the mode of assault, the small number of kar sevaks (with faces hidden) assigned to the job of demolition, the easy availability of the instruments of destruction, and other preparations onsite. A whole range of sangh parivar organisations under the hegemony of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as well as the Shiv Sena were involved. All this is well known and it is only the detail, the nuances, and the specifics of the evidence presented on the actual perpetrators and the enablers of the vile and barbaric act that will be of fresh interest. Several second-rung BJP leaders have reportedly been indicted by the Liberhan Commission. But what about the role of the top-rung BJP leaders, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Lal Krishna Advani, and Murli Manohar Joshi? This part of the Commission’s report probably has the most political punch. The judge has reportedly held them culpable in the matter of creating communal discord, for being party to the fateful decisions, and for lacking the capacity to stand up to the RSS, which used them as pliable “tools.” It is not clear what the Commission’s verdict is on the role of the P.V. Narasimha Rao government, under whose watch the demolition took place. At the very least, it was a dishonourable and tragic role.
The BJP’s petulant allegation that the government “selectively” leaked the report will find few takers, especially when one considers the question of motivation. Why would the government leak the report to the news media at a time when that would pose a real risk of upstaging a high-stake visit by the Prime Minister to Washington? But then the leak occurred because the government sat on the findings of an exercise that took more than 16 years to discover and establish “the sequence of events leading, and all facts and circumstances relating” to the demolition of the Babri Masjid by communal vandals on December 6, 1992. The habit of withholding from Parliament and the public the findings of expensive Commissions of Inquiry, which lack teeth in any case, until ‘action taken’ reports are readied by a slow-moving bureaucracy is indefensible. It devalues the whole exercise, aggravates the already indefensible delays, and serves up plenty of opportunity for motivated campaigns, speculation, and leaks. The news media in the present case, The Indian Express and NDTV 24x7, certainly cannot be faulted for doing their best to penetrate the veil of secrecy and get the essential findings out. This role is demonstrably in the cause of truth-discovery, and serious journalists and editors are not going to be deterred by sanctimonious cries of ‘breach of parliamentary privilege.’ The crime, which resulted in communal violence on a large scale, may have taken place close to 17 years ago but truth-discovery is a pre-requisite for the process of healing wounds and social reconciliation. Learning the right lesson from this episode, the Congress-led government owes it to the nation to table the Liberhan Commission report immediately.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Table-the-Liberhan-report/article16893966.ece
24,11,2009,EU’s political incoherence,"After weeks of wrangling, the European Union has appointed Belgian Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy as its first permanent President of the European Council, and a former British junior Minister, Baroness Ashton, as its first High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Both are little known outside their countries and the run-up to their appointments was nothing if not ill-tempered. When German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy backed Mr. Van Rompuy above Tony Blair, Polish Prime Minster Donald Tusk accused them of doing a deal over the heads of other EU members. Other disagreements were equally unedifying. Eastern European states were against Western European ones, smaller states against bigger ones, and nationalists against EU federalists. Somehow, a decision was finally reached at a dinner the holder of the current rotating EU presidency, Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, hosted in Brussels on November 19.
Both the process and the outcome reveal unaddressed internal EU problems. The secrecy, as one British newspaper notes, makes the Vatican look transparent. Secondly, the only elected EU body, the European Parliament, has been excluded. Thirdly, few member countries want heavyweights for the EU’s non-rotating presidency and the foreign affairs job. The whole episode suggests that on major issues the member states still see the Union in intergovernmental and not supranational terms. The EU’s undoubted weight in trade and economic matters cannot compensate for its lack of a single and clear voice in the world’s main international spaces.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/EUrsquos-political-incoherence/article16893860.ece
25,11,2009,The challenges of maximum terror,"“I have been warning Pakistan,” Home Minister P. Chidambaram said in a speech early this month, “not to play games with us. The last game should be the Mumbai attacks. Stop it there…If terrorists from Pakistan try to carry out any attacks in India, they will not only be defeated but will be retaliated against.” Today India and the world will mourn the 166 children, women, and men who died in the carnage executed by a Lashkar-e-Taiba assault squad on November 26, 2008. It will honour the sacrifice of the 18 police and National Security Guard personnel and the dedicated staff of the hotels who gave their lives fighting the terrorists. Mr. Chidambaram’s strong words underline the challenge that stares us in the face. Unfortunately, India’s response to the challenges thrown up by Mumbai has been limited. For our cities and their citizens to be protected from future mass-casualty attacks as best as possible, a dispassionate assessment of two issues becomes imperative. First, how well has the country done in meeting the internal challenge of ensuring that its cities are better protected against large-scale terrorist attack than Mumbai was a year ago? Secondly, how much has been achieved in the diplomatic and political effort to ensure that Pakistan dismantles the infrastructure of jihadist groups operating against India from its soil? The answer to both questions, sadly, is less than heartening.
In the wake of the Mumbai attacks, the Union Home Ministry began providing States resources for an ambitious programme of police modernisation. In the handful of major cities where such programmes have been initiated, the results have been mixed. Police in Mumbai have acquired new weapons and mobility platforms — equipment, it must be noted, on the reliability and appropriateness of which experts are divided — but remain woefully deficient in training and emergency-response procedures. Many of the special forces set up in the wake of the attacks have drawn on the resources of military instructors who simply do not have the special skill-sets that counter-terrorism policing demands. Part of the problem is that India does not have adequate numbers of experts in training special weapons and tactics units as well as other emergency response teams. Nor does it have a national programme to redress this capability-deficit. While cities from Singapore to New York have carried out full-scale field exercises to test their preparedness against large-scale terrorist attacks, not one Indian city has conducted comparable rehearsals. Delegates from across the world who visited New Delhi to review security arrangements for the Commonwealth Games were dismayed by their quality. Given the fact that the infrastructure of Pakistan-based jihadist groups remains largely intact, efforts to address the capability deficits in India’s police system must be given top priority.
Dealing with Pakistan poses another kind of difficult challenge. In the wake of November’s carnage, Islamabad assured the United Nations Security Council that it would proscribe the Lashkar’s parent organisation, the Jamaat-ud-Dawa. A year on, it is yet to do so. Key suspects believed to be involved in the Mumbai attacks, like Lashkar military commander Muzammil Bhat, have not been held. Worse, offices of the Lashkar and groups like the Jaish-e-Mohammad continue to function; and their propaganda magazines, so critical to recruitment, are still being published. Last month, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s detectives arrested Chicago residents Tahawwur Rana and David Coleman Headley on charges, among others, of participating in a Lashkar plot to attack the National Defence College in New Delhi. The National Investigation Agency is now exploring the possibility that the men may have run an undercover Lashkar cell in India, which facilitated pre-attack reconnaissance by the Pakistan-based terrorist organisation. Bangladesh authorities, for their part, have held suspects involved in an alleged attempt to attack the Indian High Commission in Dhaka. To their credit, since last year, India’s intelligence services have prevented at least half a dozen jihadist operations. Pakistan’s military-led security establishment seems reluctant to act against jihadists targeting India, partly because of the long-term policy of building such ‘assets’ against a traditional antagonist and also because it is unwilling to confront new enemies at a time when it is engaged in a grinding struggle against Islamist guerrillas in the country’s northwest. While engaging constructively with its neighbour, India needs to find new ways and means to get it to deliver on its promises to shut down terrorism directed at its citizens. This, of course, is easier said than done.
Home Minister Chidambaram’s words point us in the direction of just why these issues need to be taken seriously: another major terrorist attack on India could have consequences that would destabilise both countries, and could conceivably precipitate a regional crisis. In both Islamabad and New Delhi, Mr. Chidambaram’s speech was interpreted as a warning that India would respond to future mass-casualty attacks by targeting jihadist bases and logistical facilities in Pakistan. That, in turn, could snowball into a conflict that would bring misery to all of the peoples of South Asia. No rational person would seek such an outcome, but another major terrorist attack could generate a hawkish public mood in India that politicians would not be able to resist. India, Pakistan, and the world must beware of the possibility that the last shots of last November’s maximum terror attacks on Mumbai might not yet have been fired — and do all that is in their power to avert a far larger tragedy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-challenges-of-maximum-terror/article16894235.ece
26,11,2009,Last mile in the nuclear deal,"There can be little question that the failure to reach agreement on the arrangements and procedures for reprocessing spent American fuel on Indian soil during Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s visit to the United States is a let-down. The official Indian claim may be that the problems in settling the issue of reprocessing spent fuel under the 123 agreement are “minor” and of little practical significance since the U.S. and India have until February 2010 to settle matters. But the fact that the two sides were looking at the agreement as a major deliverable from the visit suggests the bilateral relationship is living on past credit rather than current commitments. The Obama administration has said and done enough in the past six months to raise doubts about its intention of sticking to the letter and spirit of the U.S. obligation to facilitate full civil nuclear cooperation with India. Getting the G8 to endorse a proposed Nuclear Suppliers Group ban on the sale of enrichment and reprocessing technology to India was not a friendly act; nor was Washington’s recent insistence that New Delhi accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The reprocessing obstacles Indian and American negotiators seem to have hit are by no means minor — assuming that India’s nuclear establishment will not dilute its stand on certain key issues. The first sticking point appears to be the U.S. demand for intrusive access to the reprocessing facilities India will be building. The Indian stand thus far has been to accept only the safeguards and protocols of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The second problem relates to the U.S. insistence on limiting the number of reprocessing facilities that can be built in relation to the reactors. If accepted, this will place unreasonable restrictions on India’s civilian reprocessing options. An unrelated but significant issue is the liability legislation that needs to be passed through Parliament and has been delayed on the Indian side. How New Delhi will go about resolving these problems in the next few weeks will be watched closely everywhere. The fact that it has the NSG waiver under its belt means it has, at least on paper, more bargaining power than it did in the past. The Department of Atomic Energy has made it clear that absent a satisfactory agreement on reprocessing under the safeguards procedures of the IAEA, there can be no import of U.S.-made light water reactors. The planned import of Russian and French reactors, and of nuclear fuel from other countries, faces no such problems and must go ahead regardless of what happens with the U.S. India must act on the realisation that there is no reason for it to lose sleep over the delay in settling the reprocessing issue. If anything, it is Westinghouse and General Electric that should do the worrying. Without a reprocessing deal, there can be no question of them setting up reactors on Indian soil.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Last-mile-in-the-nuclear-deal/article16894418.ece
26,11,2009,The wages of exploitation,"The continuing uncertainties felt by Europe’s main ethnic minorities have been highlighted by a recent survey of Germans of Turkish descent. Like most European countries, Germany has an ethnically varied population. Among a total of 83 million, Turkish-Germans form the largest minority, with estimates of the proportion varying between 2.1 per cent and 4 per cent. A recent study conducted in Germany and in Turkey shows that 45 per cent of Turkish-Germans feel unwanted in Germany, with only 21 per cent happy to call it home. Just 54 per cent feel that they have the same educational opportunities as other Germans. They are also ambivalent about their own identity, with 62 per cent saying that in Germany they feel Turkish but in Turkey they feel German — readers of Orhan Pamuk’s wonderful fiction will recognise this phenomenon. Over half the respondents are thinking of moving to Turkey at some point in the future. The survey’s most interesting finding is that younger Turkish-Germans, those aged between 15 and 29, are more conservative than their elders on a wide range of issues like virginity, abortion, and believing in heaven. Many of them ascribe their hardline attitudes to the pressure of trying to fit into German society.
The sense of unwantedness within this important minority is understandable given the history of Turkish migration to Germany. In the 1960s, with the Berlin Wall ending labour movement from the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany imported large numbers of Gastarbeiter or “guest workers” from Turkey and Yugoslavia. They were denied residence and other rights, and even their German-born children were denied citizenship for a long time. The Turkish contribution to the German economic miracle, however, was acknowledged especially by the big corporations. As for cultural integration, while Germany does not prescribe views for individuals, the fact that the majority of Turkish-Germans have origins in the poorer regions of Turkey may account for a tendency to continue speaking Turkish and celebrating traditional festivals. This exacerbates white racism, which in turn contributes to the feeling of exclusion. That young Turkish-Germans are becoming more traditionalist is, in good measure, the result of cynical and exploitative policies dating back nearly half a century.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-wages-of-exploitation/article16894417.ece
27,11,2009,"Oh yes, it’s cricket too","An old-fashioned cricket lover’s reaction to Thierry Henry’s handball — an obviously unsporting act that helped catapult France into the World Cup football Finals at the expense of a luckless Ireland — might have been, “it isn’t cricket.” The talented French striker did take less than exemplary advantage of a refereeing error, one of omission rather than commission, at a crucial stage in the game. But then, on the same scale of judgment, much of cricket “isn’t cricket.” Would a similar incident in a major, high-stakes international cricket tournament elicit as much invective as Henry’s transgression did in the British press? A cricketing equivalent might be the case of a top-rated batsman not ‘walking’ after edging to the keeper. (The rationalisation would essentially be the same as Henry’s, “I’m not the ref.”) Just as there is nothing in the laws of cricket that compels a batsman to ‘walk’ following an umpiring error, there is no rule in football that required Henry to call the attention of the referee to his own handling of the ball. For a Brian Lara or Adam Gilchrist or Kumar Sangakkara — three ‘walkers’ — there have been dozens of batsmen who have stayed put to take advantage of their good fortune. Gundappa Viswanath, a gem of a sportsman, recalled Bob Taylor at a critical stage in the Golden Jubilee Test between India and England in Bombay in 1980.
When it comes to chivalry, the track record of sport is actually mixed. To be fair to today’s players, their counterparts in the old days were not subjected to the scrutiny of multiple camera angles, Super Slo-mo, Snickometer, and Hawk Eye. As the stakes have skyrocketed in an era of hyper-commercialisation, sportsmen have often struggled to maintain high standards of fair play in the constant glare of spotlight. Relying on proven technology to minimise, if not to eliminate, subjective human error will certainly help. The Decision Review System being tried out in the ongoing Test series between New Zealand and Pakistan is a step in the right direction. The DRS delivered on the first day of the Dunedin Test when TV umpire Rudi Koertzen reversed Simon Taufel’s leg before wicket verdict against Brendon McCullum. In football, Michel Platini’s proposal to place more officials behind the goal for spotting errors holds a lot of promise; it has been put on trial in the UEFA Europa League. It would be naïve to expect sportsmen to be moral exemplars in the heat of battle. But review systems would help keep them on the straight and narrow and might eventually even lead to self-regulation. Who knows? Maybe, we will see more Laras, Gilchrists and Sangakkaras in the future.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Oh-yes-itrsquos-cricket-too/article16894657.ece
27,11,2009,Political lessons of Philippine violence,"On November 23, 57 people travelling to nominate a gubernatorial candidate, Ismael Mangudadatu, for the 2011 elections in the southern Philippine province of Maguindanao were slaughtered in an armed attack by about 100 members of another faction, the rival Ampatuan clan, and the local police. The victims were herded on to a remote hillside, where some were shot, some beheaded, and some buried alive by an earthmover. Many women were raped before being murdered. Among the dead were Mr. Mangudadatu’s wife and two of his sisters. The dead are also thought to include 18 journalists, and the episode may be the largest single killing of journalists yet known. It appears that Mr. Mangudadatu had received death threats but thought fellow-Muslims, the majority in Maguindanao, would not harm his relatives if they filed the papers for him. The region, one of the poorest in the Philippines, has seen about 120,000 people killed in fighting between Islamist insurgents and state forces since the 1970s.
Even in a country where remote provinces are run by Afghan-style warlords and over a million unlicensed firearms circulate freely, the event has caused enough shock and outrage for President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to declare a state of emergency in Maguindanao and another southern province. Troops have spread out across both regions; five police officers, including the Maguindanao police chief, have been relieved of their duties and will be questioned in the national capital, Manila. The Philippines independent commission on human rights, however, says the effect of the murders on provincial prosecutors is “chilling.” The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines says that past investigations of political killings have produced few results; the Ampatuans are among Ms Arroyo’s political allies. The current scandal has, nevertheless, been partly responsible for the Ampatuans handing over the apparent prime suspect, Andal Ampatuan Jr., to a regional presidential adviser -- but only after the risk of fighting between their supporters and government forces became clear. Mr. Ampatuan is to be charged with murder. International human rights groups are watching the developments closely. The European Union and the U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon have come out strongly against the barbaric crime. Yet the causes are primarily political. Substantial amounts of central government money are at the disposal of regional administrations, and for local politicians and officials the spoils are considerable. The combination of ethno-religious tensions, money, and a catastrophically weak state is deadly -- and carries lessons for all developing countries.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Political-lessons-of-Philippine-violence/article16894656.ece
29,11,2009,HIV entry ban repealed,"By announcing the end of a 22-year-old ban on the entry of people with HIV into the United States, President Barack Obama has once again shown that scientific considerations alone would shape decisions concerning science. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has followed up promptly, by publishing the rule in the Federal Register. The U.S. was one of a dozen countries that have archaic laws barring the entry of people infected by HIV. Although President George Bush amended the Immigration and Nationality Act last year, the HHS did not remove it from the list of communicable diseases. The ban in the U.S. was enacted in 1987 amidst widespread fears that HIV, like tuberculosis, was a communicable disease and spread through physical or respiratory contact. Accordingly, HIV infection was enlisted as a “communicable disease of public health significance” and the entry of visitors and immigrants with the infection banned. Despite the aetiology and routes of transmission of HIV becoming clearer over the last two decades, and UNAIDS and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) concluding, in 2004, that “HIV/AIDS-related travel restrictions have no public health justification,” the irrational bar remained.
In fact, the illiberal law has not served the purpose of containing the spread of a virus that has become endemic in the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that the virus has infected about one million people. The entry ban has also ended up creating stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS, and this in turn has kept people away from getting tested. According to the CDC, about one in five are not aware of their infection status and are responsible for 50-70 per cent of all new sexually transmitted infection cases. The fear of discrimination is one reason why the CDC 2006 recommendation that everyone between 13 years and 64 years should be routinely tested for the infection in medical encounters has not been heeded. An offshoot of the ban is that no international HIV/AIDS scientific conference has been held in the U.S. for the past 20 years. All this is likely to change. The U.S., which has played a pivotal role in fighting the war against the virus in Africa, can now set its house in order. Nearly half a dozen sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhoea have been wrongly classified as communicable diseases of public health significance. The CDC may remove them from its list in due course after a scientific review.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/HIV-entry-ban-repealed/article16894926.ece
29,11,2009,A manageable crisis,"There are two sharply divergent views on the Dubai debt crisis. One, put out largely by western pundits and reflected in the international media, is signified by evocative phrases like ‘boom to bust’, ‘this desert-dream-turned-nightmare,’ and a potential ‘major sovereign default problem.’ The other is the less alarmist view we incline to. Let’s look at the basic facts. The unexpected announcement by the government-owned company Dubai World that it needed until May 2010 to clear its debt of $59 billion, instead of paying it on schedule, threw global financial markets into a tizzy last week. At the root of this panic was the apprehension that this could be the start of a Lehmann-like domino sequence, which would choke the nascent global economic recovery. But the markets overlooked a crucial difference: whereas Lehmann was privately owned, Dubai World is owned by the government. So unless the Government of Dubai goes broke, which can be ruled out, and unless cash-rich Abu Dhabi fails to stand by its sister emirate, which seems most improbable, the creditors’ money is safe. Waiting a little longer for it should not be such a great hardship, especially if interest is paid on the overdue amount. Indeed, had the debt been repaid on schedule, investors would have had to look for potentially riskier investments. In that sense, the jitters were completely unwarranted and typical of financial markets, which tend to respond before thinking things through fully. The real problem for Dubai is that real estate, which accounts for a substantial proportion of the emirate’s GDP, has been in the doldrums for the last 18 months because of the global economic slowdown. But with economic recovery now starting, things should get better. Tourism is likely to make up for the shortfall in income from the dip in real estate and financial services.
What about the impact of this crisis on India? Around 40 per cent of Dubai’s population is made up of Indians, but the country’s financial exposure is quite small. The Indian banks and real estate companies that operate there have not reported major outstanding debt. The State Bank of India has an exposure of about Rs.1,700 crore and the Bank of Baroda has lent Rs.4,000 crore. The private sector banks have larger exposures but not so much as to cause worry. Likewise, India’s large real estate companies are not in any danger of losing their shirts in Dubai. However, what the country does need to worry about is inbound investment from Dubai, especially in ports. Dubai World’s subsidiary, DP World, is an important player in India, and its $500 million investment plan for the country might be affected. The larger lesson for India relates to the risks of opening up its financial markets with reckless speed and without building in regulatory safeguards.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-manageable-crisis/article16894925.ece
30,11,2009,Revisiting bank consolidation,"Consolidation among the dominant public sector banks has been on the policy agenda ever since the Narasimham Committee-II recommended in 1997 the creation of four or five large banks to take on international competition. But not much progress has been made so far, although there were occasions when the government tried to force the agenda. Any merger dictated by the government met with opposition from the trade unions and independent banking experts; in their opinion the costs far outweighed the likely benefits. Of late, the government has taken the position that the initiative for consolidation should come from the boards of the banks concerned and its own role, as the majority shareholder, would be a supportive one. There is an all-round realisation that the merger process cannot be hurried through or compressed into a short time frame.
The heads of the top five nationalised banks consulted recently by the Finance Ministry have done well to point out that the government should look for genuine synergies in terms of geographical coverage, and cultural and technological fit. However it is not going to be easy to lay down specific parameters for a merger. For instance, after nationalisation some of these banks became truly pan-Indian. A merger would result in duplication of bank branches at a number of centres. Theoretically speaking, the creation of larger units through mergers may sound attractive. Still, it is not just prudent but necessary to be circumspect while preparing the road map.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Revisiting-bank-consolidation/article16895118.ece
30,11,2009,Sri Lankan drama,"To say that the decision by Sri Lanka’s major opposition parties to field Sarath Fonseka, the prematurely retired general, as their consensus candidate in the January 26 presidential election against the incumbent President Mahinda Rajapaksa is opportunist is to state the obvious. The more serious question is what kind of political and ideological message the United National Party, the Janatha Vimukthi Perumana, and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (Mahajana wing) are sending to the people, the Sinhalese, the Tamils, and the other ethnic groups. Is this an invitation to yet another South Asian variant of Bonapartism? This is the first time in the 61-year-old history of independent Sri Lanka that a mainstream effort is being made to politicise the military, which has unswervingly stuck to its job unlike some of its counterparts in the region. The island nation stands at a crossroads of history following the comprehensive military defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. There is a new opportunity to redefine and settle the terms of unstable relationship between the 75 per cent Sinhalese majority and the Tamil and Muslim minorities on the basis of genuine devolution, equality, and justice. President Rajapaksa, who has remained cool and confident in the thick of this drama, says he chose to advance the presidential election by two years in order to restore to the people of the Northern Province the right to a free vote that was snatched away by the Tigers. There is absolutely no reason for any one to grudge him the sentiment.
Opposition parties have a lawful right to go for their best shot at the top political job, especially when the odds seem stacked against them. Moreover, the combined Sri Lankan opposition can be given some credit for placing on the agenda the issue of the long-promised abolition, or at least whittling down of the powers, of the executive presidency. To be fair, Army Chief Fonseka commanded the respect of his men and had a reputation for professionalism — as long as he stayed a soldier. The problem was that, from time to time, he crossed the lines and betrayed quirkiness, triumphalism, chauvinism, and hints of political ambition. At the height of the Eelam War IV (August 2006 to May 2009), he went on record with assertions like “I strongly believe that this country belongs to the Sinhalese” and that the minority communities “can live in this country with us but they must not try to, under the pretext of being a minority, demand undue things.” Immediately after the final victory over the Tigers, he went completely over the top — publicly demanding a 50 per cent increase in the Army’s numerical strength for the peacetime challenge! Nor were the general’s political transgressions confined to domestic issues. He caused diplomatic embarrassment to the government he served by characterising sections of Tamil Nadu political leaders as a “bunch of jokers.” His most recent political pronouncement — that the 13th Amendment, which provides for devolution of powers to the provinces, needs “a re-look in the present context” — has mystified political observers. Ironically, Fonseka-in-uniform was waging a parallel war with his current political sponsors, some of whom dubbed him a racist and went so far as to accuse him of manipulating the data on Tiger cadres killed in the fighting to bolster the ‘sagging morale’ of the Army. Opportunism may be the norm in piquant situations such as the one that has arisen in Sri Lanka. But for the combined forces of the Opposition to be essaying into political adventurism, with a maverick and unpredictable retired general (in fancy dress) at their head, is to court humiliation and possibly trouble.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Sri-Lankan-drama/article16850730.ece
2,12,2009,Learning from Kaiga,"The recent incident at the Kaiga Atomic Power Station in Karnataka, where workers drank water that turned out to have been spiked with a radioactive substance, raises disquieting issues. Most of the nuclear power plants in the country that are currently operational, including the one at Kaiga, run on natural uranium. These nuclear reactors also use large quantities of heavy water, whose molecules incorporate a heavier form of hydrogen known as deuterium. With the radiation inside the reactor, some of the deuterium turns into a still heavier form of hydrogen called tritium, which is radioactive. At Kaiga, the first sign of trouble came when a routine urine analysis showed that workers at one of the nuclear plants had ingested tritium. All the nuclear plant’s systems were found to be functioning normally and there had been no heavy water leaks. The tritium was traced to a water cooler in the building that houses the reactor. Small samples of heavy water are drawn daily from the reactor to check its purity. The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board said in a press release that, as the cooler’s water tank was kept locked, “some mischief maker” had added a small quantity of tritiated heavy water to the cooler through its overflow tube.
Officials believe that some insider is the culprit. But even if that turns out to be the case, the incident must be treated with the utmost gravity and the appropriate lessons learnt. There are computerised access control systems to make sure that only authorised individuals enter key areas of the nuclear plant. Close-circuit TV cameras keep watch over activities in critical areas of the reactor building. The tritiated heavy waters samples are also supposed to be guarded. Such surveillance, as it is currently practised, obviously has significant blind spots. How else would even an insider be able to steal a radioactive substance and then introduce it into a water cooler in the reactor building without being detected? The ongoing investigation will hopefully shed light on these issues. But it is not a matter of simply identifying and punishing the guilty individuals. It also goes beyond preventing pilferage of tritiated heavy water in the future. Just a few years ago, an employee at the Waste Immobilisation Plant at Tarapur in Maharashtra was found to have deliberately hidden a tiny bottle containing minute quantities of highly radioactive waste in a chair cushion; three people who later sat on the chair were exposed to low levels of radiation as a result. What is needed now is a thorough review of security procedures at nuclear facilities across the country. The biggest challenge lies in finding ways to guard against insiders bent on making trouble.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Learning-from-Kaiga/article16850995.ece
2,12,2009,A persistent issue,"The Telangana statehood issue just refuses to go away. By embarking on a fast-unto-death protest, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and its leader K. Chandrasekhar Rao have whipped it up yet again. While the ruling Congress party has desisted from taking a clear stand on this sensitive, divisive question, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao has not exactly covered himself with glory the way he has handled the latest phase of agitation. The first two days of his fast saw four men, including a policeman, committing suicide and violence breaking out on university campuses in the Telangana region. As for the Congress party in the State, it stands divided both at the government and organisational levels, with sections from Telangana supporting the statehood cause. The main opposition party, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), which was founded by N.T. Rama Rao on the plank of ‘Telugu pride’ and had for long stood against any division of the State, switched its stance on the eve of the general elections and favoured statehood for Telangana .
At the national level, the Congress leadership has been ambivalent in its approach. It talked of evolving a political consensus on the issue and announced the setting up of a panel headed by Pranab Mukherjee for the purpose. At one stage, it even promised a Second States Reorganisation Commission to take a holistic view of demands for separate States countrywide. Precious little has been heard on both fronts since then. Given the inter-dependent nature of the three regions in Andhra Pradesh — Telangana, Rayalaseema, and coastal Andhra — chipping off Telangana will undermine the State’s integral character. More importantly, the question of capital city will prove highly contentious since Hyderabad, the State’s capital is part of the Telangana region. Considering that the recently created States — Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Uttarakhand — are still in need of special attention and support on the development front, there is no way the Centre will venture into another round of reorganisation involving the dismemberment of larger States in the foreseeable future. In the specific context of Andhra Pradesh, the Congress party, ruling the State and heading the government at the Centre, is in no hurry to take a clear stand on carving out a separate Telangana State. Unless a political consensus emerges in favour of the statehood demand, the Central government will be under no pressure to act. Meanwhile, the Telangana statehood, an emotional and divisive issue, will remain alive and erupt periodically, disturbing public peace and order.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-persistent-issue/article16850997.ece
3,12,2009,Limits of the Afghan surge,"The 30,000 additional troops President Barack Obama is sending to Afghanistan may provide tactical relief to American commanders on the ground but whether this surge will help guarantee victory against terrorism and extremism in America’s war there is an open question. The American campaign against the Taliban and the al-Qaida suffers from four deficits — political attention, military doctrine, Afghan capability, and a Pakistani commitment. The new Obama policy has hopefully ended the attention deficit triggered by the Bush administration’s foolish and criminal invasion of Iraq in 2003. But the other handicaps still remain. Over the past few years, American military doctrine has leaned too heavily on the deployment of overwhelming firepower, deployed from afar, rather than on the granulated application of force. Thereby, U.S. casualties have been low but an unconscionably large number of Afghan civilians have died in what the Pentagon euphemistically calls “collateral damage.” If the Taliban are to be defeated, the U.S. and its allies will have to be far more intelligent in their military methods than they have been so far.
The Obama package is supposed to address a part of the third deficit — Afghan national capabilities in the security field — but the kind of emphasis we have seen so far does not inspire much confidence. If the U.S. is serious about setting 2011 as the date by when the American combat presence in the country will start thinning out, the Afghan National Army will have to be staffed, trained, and equipped at a much higher level, a task that requires a higher magnitude of funding. By far the biggest weakness of the new Af-Pak policy is Mr. Obama’s inability to craft an effective strategy to deal with the Pakistani side of the equation. Today, it is not just India that says the roots of the terrorist problem lie in Pakistan and that Afghanistan is a victim of instability emanating from across the border. In his speech on Tuesday, the U.S. president spoke of a cancer that has spread on both sides of the Durand Line. If he stopped short of identifying where the malignancy was worst, it was not for lack of information. Rather he hopes to cajole or even threaten Islamabad into taking action against the Taliban and other extremist groups which operate from its territory. The only problem is the 2011 exit date that Mr. Obama announced alongside the surge. With very little indication that the Pakistani military is ready to jettison its strategic patronage of terrorist groups, there is the possibility that Rawalpindi might well be tempted to instruct the Taliban to lie low till the appointed hour only to emerge triumphant once U.S. troops begin to leave.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Limits-of-the-Afghan-surge/article16851218.ece
3,12,2009,Counting the tigers,"India is among the few countries that still have the opportunity to nurture the health of their tiger populations. But estimating the number of tigers in the wild was a serious challenge for the Ministry of Environment and Forests until recently. Last year, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) acknowledged the need for the best science to come up with a credible population estimate; the census technique of the past, primarily relying on pugmarks, was accepted as faulty. The NTCA has now chosen to partner experts outside the government system in making the next assessment. In July, its consultation with scientists and other experts led to the conclusion that tiger presence is possible in a vast 310,000 sq km in India, with the core source populations of the cats spread over 40,514 sq km. Although tiger numbers have generally declined, a determined effort to secure habitat and end the poaching of tigers and their prey can help the populations bounce back. The value of good baseline data for effective conservation cannot be overstated. Since many States lack such data, success will depend on the readiness of their governments to start the process of assessing the health of forests from a wildlife perspective. For this, the field staff must become familiar with scientific sampling techniques such as camera-trapping, line transect sampling (for prey), and occupancy surveys (for all animals). These methods will produce credible estimates of tigers, co-predators such as leopards, and prey species — mainly deer, wild pig, and bison.
The Internet, remarkably, makes it possible to train field staff and students in far-flung areas in modern sampling methods at low cost. A good example is a training video titled “Monitoring tigers and their prey” produced with international support by research scientists K. Ullas Karanth and James D. Nichols, and filmmaker Shekar Dattatri. This visual resource, made available free by the producers on YouTube, should encourage forest departments of tiger-range States to start training the field staff immediately. It is important to remember that protocol-based sampling of large landscapes for signs (pugmarks, scat and tree scratch marks) to determine the presence of tigers requires validated techniques, not large funding. Conversely, intensive monitoring of reserves to arrive at population estimates needs investments in camera traps, and research support. The NTCA has been promised all the resources it needs to protect the tiger. It must deploy them fully to make the next status report on the tiger both comprehensive and accurate.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Counting-the-tigers/article16851217.ece
4,12,2009,Beyond expectations,"The Central Statistical Organisation’s estimate of a robust GDP growth of 7.9 per cent during the second quarter of the year (July-September 2009) has come as a surprise to policy makers and the markets alike. It compares very favourably with the 7.7 per cent recorded at the same time last year. During the first quarter, the economy grew by 6.1 per cent and even that appeared respectable considering that practically all advanced economies and most developing countries were at that time still mired in recession and were posting negative growth rates. At one level, the acceleration seen in the second quarter seems to reinforce the forecasts of the IMF and the World Bank that India and China, along with a few other developing countries, will be in the forefront of a global recovery. It is more than likely that growth projections for 2009-10 by official as well as non-official forecasters will be revised upwards. That would be a significant development, considering that barely three months ago most of them were lowering their projections in the wake of inadequate rainfall during the early phase of the South West monsoon. The Reserve Bank of India stuck to the forecast of 6 per cent growth with an upward bias made in its annual credit policy statement. The Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council was slightly more upbeat with its projection of 6.5 per cent.
The second quarter growth has been driven by strong performances of the manufacturing sector, which was up by 9.2 per cent compared to 5.1 per cent last year, and the mining and quarrying sector that registered 9.5 per cent as against 3.7 per cent. The growth in the services sector too has been impressive with the Community, Social and Personal services sub-segment posting a 12.7 per cent growth. The impact of the stimulus measures is continuing but there are signs of private consumption expenditure reviving. While there are reasons to be optimistic, a word or two of caution will be in order. Agriculture and allied activities have grown by just 0.9 per cent, down from 2.7 per cent a year ago and 2.4 per cent in the previous quarter. Even that does not take into account the estimated fall in the production of rice, pulses, and oil seeds during the Kharif season. The consensus is that agriculture will fare worse in the third quarter. To place the current growth rate in perspective, the economy grew by 7.2 per cent on an average between 2000-01 and 2004-5 and by 9.2 per cent between 2005-06 and 2007-08. While the current growth rate is in line with the trend over the longer period, regaining a 9 per cent growth momentum will be a task for the medium-term.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Beyond-expectations/article16851423.ece
4,12,2009,Bigotry in Switzerland,"In a referendum called by general popular initiative on November 29, the Swiss electorate voted by 57.5 per cent for a constitutional ban on the building of minarets throughout the country. This deeply unsettling result has caused a ripple of tension in this usually tranquil region. The vote went against all expectations and against the wishes of all the major political parties including the referendum’s instigators, the Swiss People’s Party (SVP). This disturbing indication of a prejudice against Islamic symbolism sits oddly with Switzerland’s image as a leader in human rights advocacy and international mediation. The result has also been condemned by ministers in the European Union governments, by the Vatican, and by Islamic authorities around the world, many of whom have also advised calm. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navanethem Pillay, whose office is based in Geneva, has called the result discriminatory and divisive. Switzerland may also face action in the European Court of Human Rights; it currently chairs that court’s parent body, the Council of Europe.
The ban will not affect the four minarets already standing in Switzerland, and the vote has no connection with the facts of such Muslim presence as there is in the country. The population of about 7.6 million includes approximately 400,000 Muslims; almost all are Europeans or have strong European cultural connections. The 160 or so mosques in Switzerland are also said to be almost invisible. The ban, however, has nothing to do with forms of Islam or with whether minarets and domes are essential to Islamic devotional architecture; mosques without them exist all over the world. Instead the SVP campaign for the ban focussed on the burkha, on the Sharia law, and on the allegedly widespread oppression of women in Islamic cultures and countries. The main campaign poster showed black minarets standing together like rockets against the background of the Swiss flag. In front of the flag, a woman in a black burkha stared towards the viewer. The clear and inflammatory message was that Switzerland had been or was about to be taken over by Islam. Such a message would almost certainly resonate with other European electorates. A German tabloid says that if given the chance German voters would probably vote the same way as the Swiss. This victory for fear and demagoguery shows clearly the failure of mainstream European politicians to deal decisively with xenophobia, bigotry, and racism among their own populations.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Bigotry-in-Switzerland/article16851422.ece
5,12,2009,CHOGM misses key opportunities,"The 2009 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) that took place in Trinidad between November 27 and 29 was presaged with ambitious statements from some of the major participants. Indicating a high degree of hype, the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Kamalesh Sharma dramatically claimed that it was a crisis summit. Sure enough, with the Copenhagen climate summit looming large on the horizon, the subject dominated the proceedings. At the instance of the host, Trinidad Prime Minister Patrick Manning, a special session on climate change had special invitees such as U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, Danish Prime Minister Lars Rasmussen, and French President Nicholas Sarkozy. The summit did produce a strong statement on climate change reflecting the view of the developing world. But other than that, the conference had little momentum.
Ahead of the summit there was considerable talk of CHOGM positioning itself as an effective platform of developing countries at a time of significant global changes. But there was little evidence of such a summoning up of a collective commitment to evolving a common position on other critical issues. Fiji remained suspended and Rwanda gained admission after it changed its language to English from French in 2007. Yet the overall tone was a far cry from the robust exchanges that preceded the expulsion of South Africa over apartheid, the 1995 suspension of Nigeria for executing Ken Saro Wiwa, the suspension of Pakistan in 1999 and again in 2007, respectively for a military coup and the delayed lifting of martial law, and the suspension of Zimbabwe in 2002 over flawed presidential elections. Critics say the Commonwealth has ceased to commit itself to upholding human rights and civil liberties. Despite brave words from certain of the leaders present, the organisation seems to be under-funded and under-supported. Its civil-society arm, the Commonwealth Foundation, has caused disappointment by transferring most of its funding from the prevention of HIV/Aids to cultural activities. CHOGM 2009 had a curious listlessness portending increasing irrelevance. It would have been far more useful had the grouping of 53 nations with a shared history of colonialism used the occasion more imaginatively. It would be worthwhile for the Commonwealth to transform itself into an enduring platform lending itself to consensus building on some core issues of global importance. That would have sent a clear message to the world about the high value of a multicultural, multi-faith, and multilateral body. It is a pity that instead it did precious little to stop what could be a slide to ineffectuality.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/CHOGM-misses-key-opportunities/article16851593.ece
5,12,2009,Commemorating Krishnadeva Raya,"“A perfect king...a great ruler and a man of much justice,” recorded Domingos Paes, a Portuguese traveller of the 16th century. The king was Krishnadeva Raya, who ascended the Vijayanagara throne in 1509 and died, of unknown natural causes, in his forties. But it is for very good reason that these encomiums were showered on him, and his coronation is being celebrated half a millennium after the event. He was a great warrior but also an able administrator, a tolerant statesman, and a learned patron of the arts. In a relatively short reign of 20 years, Krishnadeva Raya expanded the Vijayanagara kingdom into a vast empire. Aggressive military campaigns might have enabled this, but it was his administrative acuity and farsightedness that checked the authority of territorial chiefs and strengthened the core of the empire. His ambitious expansion plans often brought him into conflict with the Deccan sultans. He fought them bitterly, but neither he nor the other Vijayanagara kings were anti-Islamic, as they are made out to be by the communally minded. Duarte Barbosa, another Portuguese traveller visiting Krishnadeva Raya’s court, confirms this by recording that every one was permitted to “live according to his own creed.” Muslim soldiers were acknowledged for their superior archery and cavalry skills and were an integral part of the army.
Hampi, the capital of this empire and now a world heritage site, owes much of its magnificence to Krishnadeva Raya. The vastness, wealth, “infinite trade,” and sophistication of life within this 30 sq km metropolis never failed to impress a visitor. Hampi, in fact, was frequently compared to Rome. It was significantly expanded, with six of its 12 sectors built during his reign. The art and architecture of South India reached its apogee. Tall gopurams, pillared halls, and sculptural columns are some of the architectural contributions of the Vijayanagara Empire. In fact, the hybrid architecture combining Hindu and Islamic elements, seen in the Lotus Mahal at Hampi, served as a prototype for what came to be known as Indo-Saracenic architecture. Krishnadeva Raya’s reign has also been described as a “glorious epoch of literature” and inscriptions attest to his support to poets, particularly Allasani Peddana. Legends, with a wide popular appeal in South India, recall the king’s literary prowess, the eight great intellectuals of his court, and the wit of Tenali Ramakrishna. The State of Karnataka may have taken the lead in celebrating the 500th year of Krishnadeva Raya’s coronation but his enduring legacy can be found in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu as well.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Commemorating-Krishnadeva-Raya/article16851592.ece
6,12,2009,Copenhagen: seize the chance,"Today 56 newspapers in 45 countries take the unprecedented step of speaking with one voice through a common editorial. We do so because humanity faces a profound emergency. Unless we combine to take decisive action, climate change will ravage our planet, and with it our prosperity and security. The dangers have been becoming apparent for a generation. Now the facts have started to speak: 11 of the past 14 years have been the warmest on record, the Arctic ice-cap is melting, and last year’s inflamed oil and food prices provide a foretaste of future havoc. In scientific journals the question is no longer whether humans are to blame, but how little time we have got left to limit the damage. Yet so far the world’s response has been feeble and half-hearted.
Climate change has been caused over centuries, has consequences that will endure for all time, and our prospects of taming it will be determined in the next 14 days. We call on the representatives of the 192 countries gathered in Copenhagen not to hesitate, not to fall into dispute, not to blame each other but to seize opportunity from the greatest modern failure of politics. This should not be a fight between the rich world and the poor world, or between east and west. Climate change affects everyone, and must be solved by everyone. The science is complex but the facts are clear. The world needs to take steps to limit temperature rises to 2C, an aim that will require global emissions to peak and begin falling within the next 5-10 years. A bigger rise of 3-4C — the smallest increase we can prudently expect to follow inaction — would parch continents, turning farmland into desert. Half of all species could become extinct, untold millions of people would be displaced, whole nations drowned by the sea.
Few believe that Copenhagen can any longer produce a fully polished treaty; real progress towards one could only begin with the arrival of President Obama in the White House and the reversal of years of US obstructionism. Even now the world finds itself at the mercy of American domestic politics, for the President cannot fully commit to the action required until the US Congress has done so. But the politicians in Copenhagen can and must agree the essential elements of a fair and effective deal and, crucially, a firm timetable for turning it into a treaty. Next June’s UN climate meeting in Bonn should be their deadline. As one negotiator put it: “We can go into extra time but we can’t afford a replay.”
At the deal’s heart must be a settlement between the rich world and the developing world covering how the burden of fighting climate change will be divided — and how we will share a newly precious resource: the trillion or so tonnes of carbon that we can emit before the mercury rises to dangerous levels. Rich nations like to point to the arithmetic truth that there can be no solution until developing giants such as China take more radical steps than they have so far. But the rich world is responsible for most of the accumulated carbon in the atmosphere — three-quarters of all carbon dioxide emitted since 1850. It must now take a lead, and every developed country must commit to deep cuts which will reduce its emissions within a decade to very substantially less than its 1990 level. Developing countries can point out they did not cause the bulk of the problem, and also that the poorest regions of the world will be hardest hit. But they will increasingly contribute to warming, and must thus pledge meaningful and quantifiable action of their own. Though both fell short of what some had hoped for, the recent commitments to emissions targets by the world’s biggest polluters, the United States and China, were important steps in the right direction.
Social justice demands that the industrialised world digs deep into its pockets and pledges cash to help poorer countries adapt to climate change, and clean technologies to enable them to grow economically without growing their emissions. The architecture of a future treaty must also be pinned down – with rigorous multilateral monitoring, fair rewards for protecting forests, and the credible assessment of “exported emissions” so that the burden can eventually be more equitably shared between those who produce polluting products and those who consume them. And fairness requires that the burden placed on individual developed countries should take into account their ability to bear it; for instance newer EU members, often much poorer than “old Europe,” must not suffer more than their richer partners.
The transformation will be costly, but many times less than the bill for bailing out global finance — and far less costly than the consequences of doing nothing. Many of us, particularly in the developed world, will have to change our lifestyles. The era of flights that cost less than the taxi ride to the airport is drawing to a close. We will have to shop, eat, and travel more intelligently. We will have to pay more for our energy, and use less of it. But the shift to a low-carbon society holds out the prospect of more opportunity than sacrifice. Already some countries have recognised that embracing the transformation can bring growth, jobs, and better quality lives. The flow of capital tells its own story: last year for the first time more was invested in renewable forms of energy than producing electricity from fossil fuels. Kicking our carbon habit within a few short decades will require a feat of engineering and innovation to match anything in our history. But whereas putting a man on the moon or splitting the atom were born of conflict and competition, the coming carbon race must be driven by a collaborative effort to achieve collective salvation.
Overcoming climate change will take a triumph of optimism over pessimism, of vision over shortsightedness, of what Abraham Lincoln called “the better angels of our nature.” It is in that spirit that 56 newspapers from around the world have united behind this editorial. If we, with such different national and political perspectives, can agree on what must be done then surely our leaders can too. The politicians in Copenhagen have the power to shape history’s judgment on this generation: one that saw a challenge and rose to it, or one so stupid that saw calamity coming but did nothing to avert it. We implore them to make the right choice.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Copenhagen-seize-the-chance/article16852016.ece
7,12,2009,Tackling a jobless recovery,"Even as the Obama administration pushes forward with its Af-Pak and healthcare reform policies this month, joblessness in United States will increasingly dominate the attention of the President, Congress and the ordinary Americans. Unemployment may have fallen marginally in November after touching a 26-year high of 10.2 per cent in the month before, but the Federal Reserve has projected that even with positive economic growth it will hover around 8.3-8.7 per cent during 2010. Over the coming months, President Obama will worry that four states that are all Democratic bastions — Michigan, Nevada, Rhode Island, and California — will see the highest rates of unemployment. He will have to also struggle with the limited room for manoeuvre in public finances implied by staggering levels of public debt and the overall budget deficit. Given the elevated spending commitments in the Af-Pak region and subsidies for the proposed healthcare reform, there is practically no fiscal leeway to tackle America’s jobless recovery through further stimulus-like measures.
Yet the deterioration in labour market conditions for middle-class Americans is an ominous threat to President Obama’s already-falling popularity. With the entire House of Representatives and a part of the Senate facing elections next year a decisive strategy to create jobs quickly has become imperative, even urgent. The government has a range of relatively inexpensive policies to choose from. For example, the House will soon pass a bill that may include an extension of transport-related spending, a tax credit for expanding company payrolls, and incentives for credit to small businesses. Some Senators have proposed a plan, at an estimated cost of $600 million, whereby the government could share employers’ labour costs temporarily in a bid to avoid layoffs. If a financial transactions tax is introduced to address the issue of excessive risk-taking by financial institutions, the additional revenue could be productively deployed via local government to create new jobs. Public services such as education would benefit from this type of support. Additionally, policies of the last one year are likely to begin producing results: literally thousands of job-creating projects financed by the $787 billion stimulus package are still in the pipeline. Even the flourish of fiscal dexterity may not, however, save President Obama from politically motivated accusations of profligacy, typically from conservative lobbies opposing big government. The President needs to hold his nerve and soldier on regardless, only ensuring that he is transparent in outlining his plans to those who stand to gain from them.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Tackling-a-jobless-recovery/article16851870.ece
7,12,2009,Peace prospects in Assam,"“Frankly”, Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram told the Rajya Sabha last month, “in my assessment of the situation, talks with the United Liberation Front of Asom are leading nowhere”. Part of the reason for that, he explained, was that the group’s three key leaders — Paresh Baruah, Arabinda Rajkhowa, and Raju Barua — were based overseas, and, moreover, divided on the way forward. But just days after Mr. Chidambaram’s speech, events have raised hopes that a new peace initiative could be possible. On Friday, ULFA chairman Rajkhowa, and the group’s deputy military chief, Barua, were held on the Bangladesh-India border in Mizoram. India claims the ULFA leaders surrendered along with their families. But the ULFA chairman, Mr. Rajkhowa angrily rejected the suggestion of talks, insisting that he and his colleague Mr. Barua had been arrested. Whatever the truth, many observers believe the men could now conceivably be persuaded to join in negotiations on the terms laid out by Mr. Chidambaram in the Rajya Sabha: “give up violence, give up arms, give up any claim for sovereignty.”
How likely is it that such talks will come about — and what might their ground level impact be? No one knows for certain. Dialogue with leaders like Mr. Rajkhowa could help marginalise ULFA hardliners. But many in ULFA are bound to see such a dialogue on Mr. Chidambaram’s conditions as a sell-out. Like other pro-dialogue ULFA leaders, Mr. Rajkhowa and Mr. Barua have little influence over their organisation’s military assets. These are controlled by its still-fugitive military chief, Mr. Paresh Baruah. A former Dibrugarh University soccer player, Mr. Baruah says he is willing to hold talks, but only if they are focussed on securing a sovereign state — something the Government of India is not prepared to discuss. India’s intelligence services believe Mr. Baruah, who is claimed to be hiding out along Myanmar’s border with China, has been making efforts to reorganise and re-equip his cadre. If talks do begin, they could precipitate a determined terror offensive by these forces. There are also difficult ethical issues to be considered in granting amnesty to ULFA leaders, a likely precondition for a dialogue. Mr. Raju Barua, for example, is alleged by the Assam Police of personal involvement in several terrorist attacks, including an attempt to assassinate the State’s Revenue Minister, Bhumithar Burman. Nonetheless, any movement forward on ending a conflict that has consumed thousands of lives since ULFA was born in 1979 can only be welcomed. It must be hoped that all the key actors will display more wisdom — and concern for human life — than they have in the past.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Peace-prospects-in-Assam/article16851869.ece
8,12,2009,Kashmir’s bloody road to peace,"Hunched against the bitter December cold, as he walked home alone from Friday evening prayers at his local mosque, it is unlikely that Fazal Haq Qureshi saw the man who fired the shot that shattered his skull. Mr. Qureshi was, however, well aware that death would stalk his journey along the road to peace in Jammu and Kashmir. The veteran secessionist leader, who was playing a key behind-the-scene role in the ongoing secret dialogue between the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, had seen many of his closest friends pay the price for walking that path. APHC chief Mirwaiz Umar Farooq’s father, Mirwaiz Mohammad Farooq, was assassinated in 1990 for trying to end the violence that had torn the State apart. Pro-dialogue Hizb-ul-Mujahideen commander Abdul Majid Dar was assassinated by his one-time comrades in 2003. A year later, the Hurriyat’s most vocal peacemaker, Abdul Gani Lone, was murdered by a Lashkar-e-Taiba hit squad.
New Delhi and the APHC must do all they can to make the sacrifices of the doves worthwhile. The odds against success, it is evident, are enormous. In the wake of the Kargil war, the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee initiated an ambitious effort to make peace with secessionist groups in the State. Later, after the 2001-2002 India-Pakistan military crisis, both countries renewed their peace efforts. Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf ensured jihadist infiltration across the Line of Control was scaled back; in turn, India opened dialogue with the APHC. In 2006, envoys representing the two governments agreed to shape a resolution of the conflict on the basis of five mutually-acceptable principles. But General Musharraf’s political position had deteriorated by this time, making it impossible for him to sell the deal to Pakistan’s military. Islamabad’s reluctance to be seen as compromising on Kashmir at a time when it is engaged in an unpopular war at home has made further progress on the ‘five principles’ deal difficult. Mindful of the imperative to move towards a solution in Kashmir, New Delhi has begun a quiet dialogue with the Hurriyat. Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram and Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar hope that their secret dialogue will help craft a consensus around the five principles within Jammu and Kashmir, and thus put pressure on Pakistan to move forward. The attempt to assassinate Mr. Qureshi was obviously to warn moderate leaders to stay away from talks with New Delhi. New Delhi and the APHC must not waver and must stay the course. It is imperative that the murderous conflict that has claimed thousands of lives be ended soon and peace allowed to return to the Kashmir Valley.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Kashmirrsquos-bloody-road-to-peace/article16852057.ece
8,12,2009,India scales Test summit,"India’s ascent to the top of the ICC Test rankings after the 2-0 series triumph against Sri Lanka is a reward for the consistency and the quality of its cricket, both home and away. A powerful batting line-up with the supremely gifted Virender Sehwag providing the innings momentum at the top of the order and a buzzing bunch of pacemen to complement the spinners have made India a threat away from the subcontinent. The side has bucked the odds, shown self-belief in times of adversity, and is less dependent on conditions to force results. Since defeating England away in 2007, India has never slipped below the third rank. It is a great credit to the side that Australia and South Africa are the only other countries to top the rankings since the ICC Test championship was introduced in 2001. India’s feat gains even greater significance when one considers that the rankings take crucial factors into account — more points are awarded for defeating a team on foreign soil or beating a side that is ranked higher. This momentous achievement has been made possible by the concerted effort of several men.
Mahendra Singh Dhoni, a promising leader of men, and the quietly efficient Gary Kirsten have teamed up well in a captain-coach association. Others have weighed in. Sourav Ganguly instilled self-confidence in the side and the decision to open with Sehwag — a move that added a different dimension to the side — was his. John Wright put together a competent pace attack, a crucial element in India’s away success. The visionary Greg Chappell groomed the younger cricketers; he saw the spark in the now-prolific Gautam Gambhir. Maestro Sachin Tendulkar has been an inspiration while Rahul Dravid has brought with him technical expertise and cricketing acumen. Anil Kumble played his part as a captain and a champion leg-spinner. V.V.S. Laxman brought grace and elegance to the middle-order and despite fluctuations in form, Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan have added value to the side. The selection panel’s emphasis on stability has been vital to India’s success. In the last six years, India has drawn a Test series in Australia, and defeated Pakistan, England, the West Indies, and New Zealand away from home. India, though, is yet to win a Test series in Australia and South Africa. Those should be the final frontiers for the side. But matters of concern persist. Although India will end 2009 as the best Test team, that status is endangered by the fact that it will play very little Test cricket over the next 12 months. The onus is on India’s cricket administrators to ensure Test cricket’s primacy isn’t eroded by the IPL’s success.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/India-scales-Test-summit/article16852056.ece
9,12,2009,Limiting salt intake,"The association between excess salt (sodium) intake and raised blood pressure is well established. According to the World Health Organisation, 62 per cent of all strokes and 49 per cent of heart disease events can be attributed to high blood pressure. Yet, not much medical literature is available to establish a direct link between salt intake and strokes and cardiovascular disease. A recently published meta-analysis of 13 studies involving more than 175,000 individuals across six countries and followed up for 3.5 years to 19 years has thrown up strong evidence of such a link. An increase of 5 g in daily salt intake was found to be associated with a 23 per cent higher risk of stroke and 17 per cent risk of cardiovascular disease. The average intake in many developed countries is above 9 g., as against the WHO recommended (1985) norm of 5 g. While processed food is the dominant source for salt in the developed countries, discretionary use also contributes, in addition to the processed food, to the higher salt intake in India and other developing countries.
Several studies, including the latest, have shown that a restriction on salt intake is an important and non-pharmacological public health intervention for preventing and controlling hypertension. A 3 g per day reduction can bring down blood pressure by 2.5/1.4 mm Hg, and a 6 g per day reduction by 5/2.8 mm Hg. Many countries have already taken the lead in cutting down on salt consumption. Finland, Japan and the United Kingdom have mandated reductions in salt content in processed food items. The United States requires mandatory labelling of sodium content. Three-decade-long effort by Finland to reduce sodium levels by about 30 per cent has resulted in 75 per cent reduction in cardiovascular disease in those under 65 years; stroke rates have fallen by more than 70 per cent in Japan. As for India, the 24-30 per cent prevalence of hypertension in urban areas, and 12-14 per cent in rural areas, and the rising trend in the consumption of processed food call for urgent steps to limit salt levels in processed food and to build public awareness on the need to take less salt.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Limiting-salt-intake/article16852264.ece
9,12,2009,"Correct diagnosis, wrong cure","Legitimate socio-economic grievances can take problematical political forms. Decades of neglect and denial of opportunities, especially in education and employment, have left the Telangana region of Andhra Pradesh underdeveloped and backward. This inescapable reality explains the militancy of the movements that surface from time to time for a separate State. The region, which broadly corresponds to the areas that were under the princely state of Hyderabad, continues to fall behind both coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema in development indices. Dams and irrigation projects have helped to some extent, but the rural hinterlands on the Deccan plateau have resisted attempts to boost agricultural productivity and income. Rural unemployment and poverty are rampant. Leaders of the Telangana region, including many from the time of the first major agitation in 1969, have sought to frame these deprivation and development-related issues in the language of regionalism — as wilful, oppressive neglect of an entire region by those in power belonging to other regions. The Telangana Rashtra Samithi, the party behind the current agitation, is of the same mould. Although the TRS fared poorly in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections earlier this year, its president K. Chandrasekhar Rao has now managed to rally support by going on a protest fast. Such is the volatility of Indian politics that the mass mood can change within months, especially when an emotive issue is worked up by clever political footwork. The mishandling of the students’ agitation by the police has clearly aided Mr. Rao’s cause.
Sound political diagnosis must of course factor in the mass mood but cannot be determined by it. In most cases, the real answer to problems of under-development and backwardness lies in big efforts aimed at development and progress. Aside from the unwisdom of breaking up South India’s largest State, a separate Telangana will fuel demands for a separate Rayalaseema, for a separate coastal Andhra, and, maybe, even for union territory status for Hyderabad — and there will be no Pradesh left. The problem of uneven regional and intra-State development is one of the major challenges rising India faces but there is little to suggest that smaller States will make for a more even process of development. Surely, regional imbalances can be corrected without recourse to bifurcating or trifurcating a stable and potentially prosperous State — which came into being through historical struggle and sacrifice and showcases the virtues of post-Independence linguistic reorganisation. For a start, the Regional Development Boards could be given more resources and more powers. Successive chief ministers have avoided resourcing the boards with sufficient funds, for fear of creating regional power centres and undermining their own authority. This must necessarily change. The diagnosis is right: Telangana is backward and cries out for rapid development and the regional autonomy needed for this. But the cure pressed by a succession of militant movements — a separate Telangana State — will do serious harm to the patient.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Correct-diagnosis-wrong-cure/article16852258.ece
10,12,2009,Clear and commendable,"The Bharatiya Janata Party’s raucous slogan-shouting in the Lok Sabha could not drown out the clear message from Home Minister P. Chidambaram’s reply to the debate on the Liberhan Commission’s report on the December 6, 1992 demolition of the Babri Masjid. His oration was in the best traditions of truth-telling — a cool lawyerly marshalling of facts punctuated by sharp punches but also by honest self-criticism that is rare in Indian political discourse. True to form, the BJP leaders defended the indefensible — defiant in their insistence that the “disputed structure” met its brutal end because kar sevaks were at the end of their patience. Mr. Chidambaram, on the other hand, must be commended for showing the mirror to the BJP and also turning it inward, admitting on the floor of the House that the P.V. Narasimha Rao government — which made a “wrong political judgment” — was partly to blame for the demolition. Assembling his facts with care and targeting the protagonists with precision, the Home Minister made out an unassailable case against the sangh parivar and the BJP, accusing the latter of breaking “every single promise” made to the Supreme Court, the Central government, and the National Integration Council. The assault on the disputed structure was “pre-planned, calculated, and cold-blooded.” The evidence lay in the variety of tools and ropes ready at hand for destroying the structure, the inflammatory slogans that encouraged the rampaging kar sevaks, and the passivity of the BJP leaders as well as the police and district administration, which “remained a mute spectator to the demolition.”
Even as Mr. Chidambaram laid bare the details of the Babri conspiracy, which could not have possibly succeeded had the Congress central government done its job, the party’s rising star, Rahul Gandhi, was away in Lucknow, refusing even to acknowledge that he had read the Liberhan report. Had he gone through the 1,000-plus pages, he might have learnt that there were other omissions in the report, besides Prime Minister Rao’s tragic culpability. History will record that the Congress in power made two earlier key contributions to the process that led to demolition. It was Rajiv Gandhi’s government that, under pressure from a VHP-led mobilisation, facilitated the opening of the locks of the makeshift temple in February 1986, and enabled the performance of shilanyas in November 1989. One provided fresh impetus to the Ayodhya movement, the other legitimised the Ram mandir project. It was not part of Mr. Chidambaram’s remit to go into this pre-history of the demolition. But the Congress would do well to follow his lead and complete the much-delayed exercise in truth-telling on Ayodhya — so that full closure can be applied to a benighted chapter in independent India’s socio-political history.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Clear-and-commendable/article16852459.ece
10,12,2009,The ethanol challenge,"The Cabinet has once again decided that the Petroleum Ministry must ensure mandatory blending of 5 per cent ethanol with petrol. Deadline after deadline has passed since 2006 and the ambitious programme is yet to take off. A complex set of factors involving the sugar industry and the ethanol market is at play. In recent months, the oil marketing companies have been unable to contract for even half the quantity of ethanol needed for 5 per cent doping. And the quantities offered are at rates as high as Rs.41 a litre. The oil companies have until now offered Rs.21.50, although they are open to paying a little more. One of them has meanwhile planned to invest in sugar mills to ensure a captive source of ethanol. The cost of petrol is Rs.23 a litre and the blending of ethanol obtained at a price that is any higher will be uneconomical. But the sugar industry evidently finds better price yields and guaranteed demand in the beverage, industrial, and fuel sectors. There just may not be enough ethanol available in India to meet the blending requirement unless the acreage under sugarcane goes up significantly, and sugar mills are given the option to process sugarcane juice directly into ethanol instead of sugar. Both these moves will have an impact on sugar production and sugar prices. Given the rising price of sugar and the insistence by the State governments that the sugar mills meet first the demands of the beverage industry, finding enough ethanol is going to be difficult.
Sugarcane-based ethanol is indeed “the most successful alternative fuel to date.” As an excellent oxygenate and octane booster, it clearly has technical advantages. But in India, the world’s second largest producer of sugar, almost 90 per cent of ethanol comes from cane molasses, spelling dependence on a single feedstock. Sugarcane production has historically been marked by a certain cyclical volatility, with bumper years followed by years of low production. In order to reduce its dependence on oil imports, rather than setting much store by ethanol, India should look more aggressively at other options including hybrid fuels and CNG. Several countries of the world, notably Brazil — which introduced ethanol-blended petrol as early as in 1931 — have come a long way here. But India has several limitations including land availability constraints and food security concerns that may leave a limited role for the biofuel option for now. It is time the realities of the situation were factored into ethanol policy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-ethanol-challenge/article16852460.ece
11,12,2009,A time-tested friend,"The inter-governmental agreement (IGA) on nuclear cooperation signed during the just-concluded visit to Moscow of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh further cements Russia’s role as a vital and trusted partner of India and its civil nuclear energy programme. Although the details of the agreement have not yet been made public, Indian officials have confirmed that it provides the basis for broad cooperation across the full spectrum of the nuclear fuel cycle without any of the unreasonable conditionalities attaching to nuclear commerce with the United States. The ‘123 Agreement,’ for example, provides for lifetime fuel supply guarantees for any American reactors sold to India but also allows Washington to demand the return of fuel stocks and even nuclear components in the event that it chooses to terminate cooperation for any reason. In contrast, the Russian agreement says the termination of cooperation would be without prejudice to the implementation of ongoing contracts. The crucial international relations principle involved here is that there shall be no unilaterally determined disruption of agreed fuel deliveries. The new IGA also grants India upfront and unqualified consent rights to reprocess spent Russian fuel so long as this is done under international safeguards. In contrast, while the 123 text speaks of upfront consent, the detailed arrangements and procedures, including the conditions under which the U.S. can suspend this consent, are still being negotiated, with the deadline only some weeks away.
The Russian willingness to accommodate Indian concerns about fuel supply and reprocessing is of a piece with Moscow’s long-term strategic approach to nuclear cooperation with India. In 2001, Russia defied the U.S. by supplying low-enriched uranium to India for use at Tarapur despite being a party to NSG rules prohibiting this sale. This happened again in 2006, when the U.S. and India were still working through the fine print of the July 2005 nuclear deal. Though Russia lacked the confidence and heft to get the NSG to change its rules, its strong support for the lifting of sanctions allowed India to extract a better deal from the 45-nation cartel than Washington, and especially Congress, might like to have seen. Armed with the NSG waiver and the new IGA, not to speak of the equally advantageous Indo-French agreement, India knows nuclear cooperation with Russia and France will be more fruitful, predictable, and secure than what the U.S. offers. As New Delhi enters the final round of talks with the Obama administration on reprocessing, it should remind the American side that the more onerous and unreasonable its demands, the less likely India would be to buy American reactors. It would be foolish indeed on India’s part to commit tens of billions of dollars on American nuclear equipment if there was even the slightest chance that fuel supplies or components or reprocessing consent would be suspended. Least of all when there are better alternatives in hand.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-time-tested-friend/article16852643.ece
11,12,2009,Evaluating support prices,"Recent government announcements on support prices for wheat, pulses, oil seeds as well as sugarcane may not have the beneficial effects on agriculture that a well thought-out farm price support system should ensure. All countries provide support to farmers either through subsidies or fixing minimum prices for important crops. This system guarantees a certain minimum earnings to the farmers and, to a large extent, reduces the uncertainty inherent in the market mechanism. It protects livelihoods and has a direct bearing on the availability of food articles in the public distribution system. Also, through price signals, the government can encourage farmers to grow a particular crop which is in short supply or environment-friendly. But all these benefits will accrue only if the support mechanism is operated efficiently. While extra-economic considerations can never be kept out of the decision-making process, attempts must be made to minimise them. The government has not been successful in this regard as the two recent price announcements on wheat and sugarcane show.
In India, price intervention has been in two forms. The government announces a minimum support price (MSP) for staples — wheat and rice — as well as oil seeds and pulses. This in effect is an open-ended commitment to pay a fair price for whatever quantity is offered. The other method that applies to sugarcane is for the Centre to fix a statutory minimum price (SMP) that sugar mills have to pay the farmers. The States have been fixing a higher price (SAP) which in practice becomes the floor price. The MSP mechanism has become inflexible. And this stands in the way of encouraging specific crops such as pulses over the water-thirsty paddy. This year, there has been just a token increase of Rs.20 a quintal for wheat, no doubt prompted by the fact that the Centre has adequate buffer stocks from last year’s crop. The new MSP of Rs.1,100 is well below market prices and the private trade is expected to play a much larger role than last year. The government’s policy towards trade has been inconsistent. The recent fiasco over sugarcane prices is due to an ill thought-out plan to shift the burden of state-advised prices to the States themselves.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Evaluating-support-prices/article16852642.ece
12,12,2009,Lashkar-e-Taiba’s long arm,"“Very few things,” United States counter-terrorism official David Benjamin said in a recent speech, “worry me as much as the strength and ambition of the Lashkar-e-Taiba.” The arrest of Pakistani-American jihadist David Headley, alleged to have carried out the reconnaissance that enabled a ten-man assault team to kill over 160 people in Mumbai last November, could prove a significant step forward in delivering justice to the victims of the horrific attack. But the arrest has also underlined the reach of the Lashkar’s transnational networks, which give South Asia’s most dangerous jihadist group global lethality. British-born Dhiren Bharot, held in 2005 for attempted bombings in the U.S., had trained with the Lashkar and fought with it in Jammu and Kashmir. French national Willie Brigitte, held for planning terrorist attacks in Australia, was another product of the Lashkar’s transnational operations. Lebanese national Assem Hammoud, held in April 2006 for planning to target Port Authority Trans-Hudson commuter trains running between New Jersey and New York, was preparing to travel to Pakistan to acquire the expertise he needed to do so. And just this week, five Washington, D.C. men were picked up in Sargodha, Punjab, where they had travelled to acquire military training.
Sadly, policy-makers across the world have been muddled in their responses to the threat. Like all violent crime, terrorism rests on two pillars: the intention to carry out terrorist acts, and the capabilities needed to do so. That the Federal Bureau of Investigation believes it arrested Mr. Headley on the eve of another attack in India demonstrates that Islamabad lacks either the influence or the will to rein in the Lashkar. The threat will remain until Pakistan finally acts to eliminate Lashkar capabilities, in the form of its training camps, recruiting tools, and finances. In the wake of the November attacks, Pakistan promised the United Nations Security Council that it would proscribe the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, the Lashkar’s parent organisation. It is yet to do so. Mr. Headley’s upcoming trial on 12 terrorism-related charges, including the murder of six U.S. nationals in the Mumbai attacks, will cast substantial new light on the planning and conception of the carnage. The American trial is also likely to proceed with un-Indian speed. India would do well to facilitate the rapid progress of these legal proceedings, and to focus its investigative resources on discovering whether elements of the network, of which Mr. Headley was a part, are still active here. The wider challenge for New Delhi will be persuading the world to work with it to compel Islamabad to give up its rationalisation of inaction and deliver on its promise to dismantle the infrastructure of terror.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Lashkar-e-Taibarsquos-long-arm/article16852836.ece
12,12,2009,"Discard the cloak, Tiger","Tiger Woods’ extreme obsession with off-course privacy has now been exposed, among other things, to be a cover for his serial, exploitative philandering and a pattern of personal behaviour that has inspired at least one British expert in instant psychology to publicly offer a diagnosis of ‘sex addiction.’ Even if you ignored the voyeuristic feeding frenzy in the global print, broadcast, and online media that Tiger’s “transgressions” and betrayal of “family values” have set off, it is clear that this preternaturally talented golfer with his 14 Major titles has been living a lie. Unfortunately, the world’s richest athlete cannot take cover behind this being a private affair, separate and a world apart from the magic he works on the golf course. It is well established that, in general, sporting, artistic, and literary reputations are little affected by knowledge and exposure of the private peccadilloes of the stars. The problem in the present case, aside from the involvement of the police, is that this one-man mega business has earned an estimated $1 billion largely by endorsing products targeted at young people and, in parallel with his game, seeming to live up to the ideal and values of a role model, a golden boy who, in his case, has overcome barriers of race, nationality, and class. So much so that the January 2010 issue of Golf Digest features on its cover “10 Tips Obama Can Take from Tiger.”
The akratic story that emerged from the gated community of the rich and the famous in Isleworth, Florida, and the chain of allegations of sleaze it has triggered, has changed this. Nobody can take away from Woods his golfing genius, his magnificent fighting spirit, his gift for reinventing his game. A golfer’s competitive playing life is much longer than that of any other sportsperson and the best of Tiger probably lies ahead on the world’s golf courses. Not a single television channel in the United States might have aired an advertisement featuring him since news broke of his early morning car crash and his golf club-wielding wife. But it would be naïve to write off Tiger’s huge endorsement value or the world of difference he makes to the game and to television ratings. The case of David Beckham, who rode out his troubles in a space of about nine months, does offer some kind of parallel. Then there is the estimable American belief in redemption that Woods can rely on. To redeem himself, he needs to reinvent not his game — but his persona. He can start by shedding the cloak of inaccessibility, the duplicitous intolerance of every attempt to glean his off-course life.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Discard-the-cloak-Tiger/article16852847.ece
15,12,2009,Copenhagen’s indifferent start,"It is too soon even to second-guess the outcome of the Copenhagen climate summit. The re-set goal is to produce an ‘operationally binding political agreement’ on how and under what terms the actions needed to prevent dangerous global warming will be distributed globally, across 192 countries. The hope is that such an arrangement, which needs to be a major advance on the Kyoto protocol within the parameters set by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), will eventually lead to a fair, just, and workable legal instrument. Unfortunately, the signs and indications from the first few days of Copenhagen have not been auspicious.
What needs to be done was succinctly presented in the common editorial published on December 7 by 56 newspapers, including The Hindu, in 45 countries. To reiterate its key argument: Climate change affects everyone, and must be solved by everyone. The science is complex but the facts are clear. The world needs to take steps to limit temperature rises to 2C, an aim that will require global emissions to peak and begin falling within the next 5-10 years. At the deal’s heart must be a settlement between the rich world and the developing world covering how the burden of fighting climate change will be divided.
It stands to reason that the key principle that should guide the settlement must be the UNFCCC formulation of “common and differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.” The majority of developing nations continue to push for a legally binding agreement in which the developed nations would lead with drastic emission reductions (25-40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020) and significant efforts to provide financial assistance (well above the $10 billion a year that is on offer) and technology transfer to the developing nations. But the prospects of such an agreement do not seem bright at all. There is frustration over the experience of the past two years, when developed nations focussed substantially on shifting an unjust share of the global mitigation burden to the developing countries. The major developing economies have sought to meet, at least partially, the legitimate concerns of developed nations. Several, including India, have announced voluntary mitigation actions with quantified targets in the form of significant deviations from business-as-usual growth rates in emissions or as reductions in the emission intensity of their economies.
There are however indications that the developed nations, instead of reaching across the trust divide, are contemplating the imposition, through political arm-twisting, of a solution that safeguards their key interests while overriding developing country concerns. Faced with an impasse in the negotiations, the developed nations, in a move initiated by the United States, have begun working towards an operationally binding political agreement that has the potential to be converted into a legally binding agreement at an unspecified future date. Promoted ostensibly as a means to ensure some kind of positive outcome at Copenhagen, the move has also been justified by arguments that global climate action need not await the ratification of U.S. commitments by their domestic legislative process. Media leaks of the contours of such an agreement, known to be promoted by the Danish Prime Minister, suggest that the idea is to saddle developing countries with legally binding obligations through conditionalities on climate finance and to leave developed nations with no comparable legal commitments. The parallel process, also initiated by the host nation, to ensure the presence of a large number of world leaders at Copenhagen in the final ministerial phase has come under a cloud. Given the prospect of no agreed text emerging from the hard-nosed negotiations, the stage would be set for the introduction of new texts at the political level. Such a move, based on formulations that have not been vetted by experienced negotiators or discussed in broad consultations, could set the stage for the extraction of substantial concessions to the detriment of developing country interests.
The major developing economies have done well to anticipate such a biased outcome while adopting a forward-looking attitude themselves. The draft text agreed to by China, Brazil, India, South Africa, and other developing nations gives them a reasonably strong negotiating hand. India, which in the Bush years used to be comfortable about bringing up the rear in the international debate and action on climate change, went through a phase of confusion during the run-up to Copenhagen. The policy disarray that framed the government’s announcement of a projected cut in emission intensity by 2020 suggested political unpreparedness and uncertainty. Crucially, sections of the government did not seem to grasp the fact that if there was ‘flexibility’ in the emission reduction targets for developed countries, the burden of mitigation action on developing countries would increase significantly and inequitably. In the climate arena, it is coordinated, not unilateral, action that holds the key to the realisation of the global common good. Smaller nations do and can influence the course of the negotiations but a great deal will depend on the kind of role the U.S., the European Union, China, and India end up playing in the negotiations and the high-level political parleys. President Obama especially needs to walk his climate talk with a new multilateral vision. Whatever be the Copenhagen outcome, India’s climate policy must do what a country with the world’s second largest population needs to do: reorient itself towards a green path of economic growth in a much more earnest, ambitious, and internally equitable way than the National Action Plan on Climate Change envisages.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Copenhagenrsquos-indifferent-start/article16853346.ece
16,12,2009,Justifying the unjustifiable,"In a recent interview to a religious programme on the BBC1 TV channel, Tony Blair asserted that he would have ordered an invasion of Iraq even if he had known that Iraq no longer had weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). The former British Prime Minister added that he would have used different arguments to “justify” the invasion but he “would still have thought it right to remove” Saddam Hussein. He also tried to locate the invasion in the context of what he calls a “major struggle going on all over the world” about what is happening within Islam. Quite apart from Mr. Blair’s self-arrogated authority on Islam, the contradictions are breathtaking. From 2001 onwards, western intelligence services repeatedly informed Mr. Blair and George W. Bush that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction. The United Nations weapons inspectors publicly acknowledged that Iraq had been substantially disarmed by 1998. A decade of brutal sanctions had wrecked Iraq’s economy, and even Iraq’s neighbouring states no longer regarded Saddam Hussein as a threat. Moreover, Mr. Blair’s senior civil servants advised him that an invasion without explicit U.N. approval would be illegal. Yet the big lie that Iraq had WMDs and could mount an attack on the U.K. within 45 minutes was fed to the western media. Without such manufacture of consent, Mr. Blair would have found it much harder to win the parliamentary vote on the invasion.
It now turns out, via the Iraq Inquiry (the Chilcot inquiry), that the 45-minute claim was probably obtained by western intelligence from an Iraqi taxi-driver who had overheard two Iraqi military officers talking in the back of his car, and that the British government ignored written warnings about the claim. Furthermore, Mr. Blair told Parliament in February 2003 that Saddam Hussein could save his own regime by complying with U.N. resolutions, despite the fact that no material breach had been proved. Nevertheless the British Prime Minister ordered Attorney-General Lord Goldsmith to alter significantly an interpretation of international law so as to protect invading British troops against criminal charges. Mr. Blair is clearly indifferent to the invasion’s illegality and its consequences, among which are more than 100,000 Iraqi deaths and enormously intensified global instability. That Mr. Blair will be allowed to give part of his evidence to the Iraq Inquiry in secret only compounds his evasions. His contempt for the very idea of accountability is shown by the fact that he offered his explanation to a TV interviewer and not to those whom he should answer — the British Parliament, the electorate who put him in office, and the International Criminal Court.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Justifying-the-unjustifiable/article16853534.ece
16,12,2009,Worrying trend,"There has been no let-up in the rising trend of food prices. For the week that ended on November 28, the wholesale price index for food articles rose 19.05 per cent over the corresponding period last year. A week earlier, it was at 17.47 per cent. Indeed, arresting the price rise of essential commodities has been a challenge to the government for quite some time now. Some recent developments have aggravated the price situation. Over the last year, the rise in prices of food articles has been the highest in 11 years. These wholesale prices do not fully reflect the rise in prices at the retail level. Items of mass consumption such as potatoes, eggs, and dairy products have registered the highest increase. While the common man has been reeling under the impact of high food prices, the weekly WPI index did not quite gauge the severity of the burden. That was because food and other primary articles are assigned a relatively low weight of 22 per cent in the WPI index. As a result any rise in food prices got offset by the fall in the prices of manufactured goods, fuel, and power. Such a misleading picture has now been corrected: since mid-October, the government has started announcing the WPI inflation once a month; weekly announcements are confined to food and fuel inflation. The new system has not only infused a measure of transparency in the official economic data but it is also in line with what ordinary people experience every day. The WPI index for November shows inflation at 4.78 per cent on a year-on-year basis, the highest in 11 months.
The weekly inflation figures showing a sharp upward movement have naturally increased the concerns of the government, which has so far failed to articulate a coherent strategy to step up the supply of food articles and other essential items. Agricultural production is set to decline sharply in the third quarter of this year. The Kharif season has been affected badly by delayed monsoons, drought, and flooding in different parts of the country. The anticipated sharp decline in the production of major crops, coarse grains, pulses, and oil seeds is one of the principal factors fuelling inflationary expectations. Moreover, the shortfall is expected to be such that even a bumper wheat crop in the Rabi season is unlikely to make up for it. From a monetary perspective, sustained high prices of essential goods will harden inflationary expectations and also lead to a clamour for higher wages. Monetary intervention might then become necessary to counter the effects of supply side problems.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Worrying-trend/article16853533.ece
17,12,2009,Curbs on financial excess,"After dedicating most of 2009 to jump-starting financial markets through stimulus packages, developed countries are now turning their attention to reforming the basic architecture of those markets, especially the incentives for risk-taking. In a major step towards regulating systemic risks, the United Kingdom last week announced a one-off 50 per cent “super-tax” on bankers’ discretionary bonuses exceeding £25,000. The move could raise £550 million, which would be used to help reduce unemployment, according to Chancellor Alistair Darling. However it has generated, as expected, a torrent of resistance from financial services firms, including threats that they would mass-migrate to other countries. By way of response, an aide to the Chancellor has asserted that the solution was for the banks to “pay less in bonuses” and to realise that this tax was “about changing their behaviour, not raising revenue.” Other members of the European Union such as France and Germany have come out in support of the policy, with France imposing a similar super-tax on bonuses exceeding €27,000. Executive pay has come under fire in the United States too. Kenneth Feinberg, President Obama’s pay czar, has sharply cut cash compensation, requiring instead that 175 most-paid executives in bailed-out companies hold stock compensation for two to four years.
Yet pay is only one dimension of a culture of excessive risk-taking, which precipitated the credit crisis on the back of lax regulatory standards and the availability of cheap credit. Only a comprehensive overhaul of regulatory oversight, of the kind passed by the U.S. House of Representatives last week, stands a reasonable chance of changing deeply entrenched attitudes towards risk. The reform proposals, which mirror some of the policies enacted in the EU, include tighter regulation of derivative instruments, procedures for managing collapse at large banks without resorting to taxpayer money, and the creation of a Consumer Financial Protection Agency to monitor lending practices. The bill also seeks to empower lawmakers to oversee the functioning of the U.S. Treasury — not a bad thing considering it was the Treasury, under Alan Greenspan, that stubbornly held interest rates at artificially low levels, setting off credit-driven asset bubbles. Finally, the reforms seek to extend the powers of the Securities and Exchange Commission to aggressively patrol the fringes of the financial universe, including hedge funds, with the aim of foiling would-be Madoffs and Rajaratnams. Even as the U.S. and Europe struggle to get unemployment under control over the coming years, they would do well to persist in their mission to curb financial excess through serious institutional reforms.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Curbs-on-financial-excess/article16853717.ece
17,12,2009,Moratorium on executions,"The Russian Constitutional Court decision to extend a decade-old moratorium on carrying out death sentences reflects a global trend among states to halt executions forthwith, pending commensurate reform of the criminal law. If the global trend has evolved in the face of mounting evidence undermining the presumed efficacy of capital punishment, the Russian judicial initiative is consistent with that country’s strong backing for a 2007 United Nations General Assembly Resolution that called upon states still having the death penalty on their statute books to suspend the execution of sentences. This should facilitate the country’s early ratification of Protocol 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, stipulating the abolition of capital punishment. The elimination of this most barbarous punishment is a requirement for membership of the Council of Europe. However, going by the precedent of Chechnya adopting a procedure of trial by jury under which death sentences may be awarded, there is a chance that other Russian provinces may follow suit. This has put the legal status of this issue in the spotlight. Notwithstanding the introduction of jury trials, the Constitutional Court has now extended the moratorium on executions until the ratification of Protocol 6. The ratification however is subject to the deletion of the death penalty from the country’s criminal code.
The Russian leadership’s attempts to dispense with the death sentence progressively have met with a strong public opinion that places a high premium on its perceived deterrent effect, especially in the context of rising challenges to rigorous law enforcement and the perception of an increase in terrorism-related crimes in recent years. While the popular appeal of such ruthless solutions may be understandable, removing the death penalty from the statute book should be the eventual aim. Abolitionists, more than anybody else, should remain alive to the need for ensuring maximum transparency and accountability in the entire debate over the death penalty. The last execution in the Russian Federation took place way back in 1996 and recent developments augur well for the future of democracy in Russia, notwithstanding the upheavals the people have encountered in the post-Soviet Union era. Russia has shown a greater sensitivity than many other democracies that retain the death penalty. It is time all civilised societies ensured that their criminal jurisprudence was in tune with liberal values and respect for human rights.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Moratorium-on-executions/article16853716.ece
18,12,2009,A weaker Zardari,"The Pakistan Supreme Court >verdict striking down the National Reconciliation Ordinance as unconstitutional and void ab initio did not come as a surprise. The NRO that was promulgated on October 2007 by former President Pervez Musharraf, a day before the presidential election, had been widely perceived as a “deal” struck by him with the former Pakistan People’s Party leader, Benazir Bhutto, to provide her relief from the corruption charges she faced. The “deal” was that the NRO would enable Bhutto to get back to Pakistan and actively participate in its politics and that, in return, her party would not oppose the General’s election. The NRO benefited, in all, over 8,000 people, most of them low-ranking officials. The list of politicians who benefited is short, but President Asif Ali Zardari is among them. Earlier this year, while declaring Gen. Musharraf’s November 3, 2007 emergency unconstitutional and illegal, the Supreme Court had asked parliament to take a decision on the NRO and a clutch of other ordinances that he had promulgated. But in the National Assembly, where the PPP does not have a majority of its own, even its allies baulked at legislating an ordinance seen as “legitimising corruption.” The ordinance lapsed and the ball was back in the Supreme Court where petitions against the NRO were pending. Mindful of the inherent indefensibility of the NRO, the government decided not to defend it in the court. The only remaining issue was how far the court would go in confronting the beneficiaries, especially Mr. Zardari.
The full court comprising 17 judges that heard the case made no person-specific ruling. But its directive, contained in a short judgment, that all cases and investigations cancelled under the NRO would stand revived, as the steps taken under the scrapped law are deemed never to have occurred, is trouble enough for Mr. Zardari. Although as President he is protected from prosecution in criminal cases, the judgment now opens the way for petitions both challenging his eligibility as a candidate in the election to the office, and his constitutional immunity. Also, the Supreme Court has made it clear that the government must revive the cases against Mr. Zardari in Swiss courts, where he and his late wife were accused of laundering and stashing millions of dollars. In the coming days, as a result of the Supreme Court verdict, Mr. Zardari will come under tremendous pressure to resign. He is the least popular of the country’s political leaders, already weakened by several controversies. It is unfortunate that Mr. Zardari is also the only Pakistani leader today who has articulated a bold new vision for ties with India and has had the courage to stand up to jihadist militancy.

18,12,2009,The twilight world of ethnic minorities,"The institutions of the European Union are belatedly accepting that official statistics on racial discrimination and racist crime in the EU are only the “tip of the iceberg.” Its Agency for Fundamental Rights has recently published the first detailed survey of the ethnic minorities, covering 23,500 respondents in all 27 member states and examining their experience of employment and recruitment, accommodation, health and social services, education, financial services, and even shopping. The findings are bleak. For example, 82 per cent of respondents do not report racial discrimination to the police, mainly because they feel nothing would be done. Even the police account for much racial oppression in the form of disproportionate questioning of ethnic minorities. Under-reporting of racism is found in most public bodies, including those created to investigate racism. The groups that encounter racism least are of Russian or Eastern European origin; as an earlier EU study on illegal employment notes, they are primarily white. In contrast, Somalis, of whom 40 per cent experienced at least one racist episode in the previous 12 months, and various North African groups are the most common victims, as are Brazilians in Portugal.
The findings reveal several cruel ironies. In the last two centuries, millions of Europeans have fled famine, poverty, and oppression to make new lives in the United States, Australasia, Southern Africa, and elsewhere. Yet the recent study finds that those now treated worst are Roma, who are European-born. The worst countries in this regard are the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Greece. In Greece, respondents revealed 174 incidents for every 100 Roma in the population. Furthermore, the EU’s ethnic minorities are more likely to be victims of certain kinds of crime than the white majority, contrary to the widespread racist stereotyping of ethnic minorities as criminals. The report recommends improvements in rights-awareness and notes the weaknesses in official attitudes and resources. It is, however, clear that EU ethnic minorities live, or rather exist, in some kind of a twilight zone largely unknown to the white majority. They form 20 per cent of the Union’s 500-million population, and for them everyday life carries a constant risk of racism, from violence and public abuse through official hostility and neglect to the subtle ways white employers evade anti-discrimination law in every walk of life. Sensitive people on the continent wonder how European society can confront others with principles it does not even uphold.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-twilight-world-of-ethnic-minorities/article16853909.ece
19,12,2009,Containing the damage,"It is the right decision, but one that took a bafflingly long time to arrive at. The procrastination of the collegium of judges headed by the Chief Justice of India, K.G. Balakrishnan, in virtually withdrawing its controversial August 27 recommendation to elevate Karnataka Chief Justice P.D. Dinakaran to the Supreme Court has done incalculable harm to the image of the judiciary. The delay was accompanied by a surprising attempt to pass the buck, with Chief Justice Balakrishnan requesting the Centre to conduct an independent probe into certain allegations against Justice Dinakaran, which the Law Ministry politely — and quite correctly — turned down. With the Centre rejecting the recommendation to accommodate Justice Dinakaran in the Supreme Court, the sustained campaign against his elevation by members of the bar, and the impeachment process set in motion by Opposition MPs in the Rajya Sabha, there was considerable pressure on the collegium to withdraw its recommendation. It would have been far better if the collegium had taken a quick decision on merits rather than give the impression that it was forced to act in the face of an escalating controversy.
The allegations against Justice Dinakaran remain unproven as of now. Yet they are extremely serious and two reports from a district collector have lent credence to at least the ones relating to land encroachment in Tamil Nadu. His refusal to resign in the face of the ugly controversy and erosion of public confidence has called attention once again to the need for a quick, fair, and effective statutory mechanism for enquiring into judges’ conduct and suggesting appropriate action. The process of impeachment is cumbersome and uncertain, and is often overwhelmed by political considerations. No judge has ever been impeached and the uncertain nature of the process stood out in 1993, when the motion against Justice V. Ramaswami was defeated, with the Congress abstaining. In the light of the Justice Dinakaran controversy, Law Minister Veerappa Moily has suggested a Judges Standards and Accountability Bill. The in-house enquiry system put in place by the Supreme Court has proved wholly inadequate, and a more effective mechanism is needed to enquire into charges against judges. The question of removing a judge always invites another: why was he or she appointed in the first place? Proposals to set up a broad-based and independent National Judicial Commission with the power to appoint, and enquire into the charges against, judges have been made time and again. The Justice Dinakaran controversy is a warning that no further time should be lost in putting in place a more transparent appointment process and in strengthening judicial accountability.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Containing-the-damage/article16854078.ece
19,12,2009,Europe’s far-right,"The pan-European outfit floated recently by the political parties of the far-right fringe may only stand a distant chance of capturing the popular imagination in the European Union. However, the potential for long-term damage from the ultra-nationalist and majoritarian ideology represented by these forces, feeding on the xenophobic and anti-immigrant constituency in the aftermath of the global economic crisis, should not be underestimated. The failure of the extreme right parties to qualify as an official grouping in the EU Parliament after the June polls provides the background to the formation of the European Alliance of National Movements, led by the first-time entrant to the legislature, the British National Party (BNP). Whereas a formal political bloc within Parliament is entitled to positions in influential committees shaping policy, a pan-European body such as the latest alliance is eligible for substantial public funds. If the BNP wears on its sleeves its brazenly racist “only whites” membership policy, in clear contravention of the EU and many national anti-discrimination laws, the anti-federalist platform of the new alliance also counts among its champions the Holocaust denier Jean Marie Le Pen of the French National Front, besides the Italian and Hungarian parties that oppose abortion and gay rights.
It is ironic that a narrow, sectarian, and divisive agenda, disguised as a defence of national identity and sovereignty, should be sought to be advanced through a transnational front, and one that is staunch in its opposition to closer European integration. The contradictions inherent in such a coalition of convenience stood exposed as the short-lived far-right caucus in the previous Parliament collapsed when certain highly provocative remarks were directed against the Romanian nationals as a whole in the context of the influx of the Roma minorities into Italy. The lessons in this for mainstream political parties in different member states are significant. There is need to refrain from pandering to populist sentiment, or indulging in political one-upmanship in the face of domestic pressures and instead engage the genuine concerns of citizens over the real implications of greater integration. The recent controversy over the appearance of the BNP leader on prime time show highlights the difficulties of foreclosing an arena of public debate for elected representatives, quite apart from the arguments over the appropriateness of such means to counter any group, including the far-right, in a democracy.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Europersquos-far-right/article16854077.ece
20,12,2009,Far from inspiring,"In any reasonable reckoning, the outcome of the Copenhagen climate summit falls far short of what the nations of the world, particularly the industrialised countries, absolutely need to do to combat global warming. The Copenhagen Accord, the product of personal negotiations between President Obama and the political leaders of China, India, Brazil, and South Africa, marked the end-run of a concerted U.S. strategy to corner the major developing economies in the climate negotiations. The terms suggest that the BASIC Four have successfully resisted, for now, the core strategy of the developed nations to set aside the Kyoto Protocol in its entirety and to alter the architecture of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The unscripted follow-through to the last-minute submission of a draft accord in the summit plenary allowed a few determined nations to ensure that the Accord has less than full formal recognition. It remains an accord between interested parties that is “taken note of” under the UNFCCC process and “operationally commits” only those that declare their adherence. However, the developing countries have made some significant concessions in exchange. The Accord postpones any global quantitative commitment to climate mitigation, particularly any commitment to drastic emissions reduction by the developed nations. It pays disproportionate attention to the responsibilities of developing countries. The most serious import of these concessions is evident from the UNFCCC assessment that the current global mitigation effort allows for a significant probability that global temperature rise will reach 3 degrees Celsius. The report further observes that in the mitigation commitments currently made, the contribution of developing countries is greater than that of the developed countries. The cry of many small developing countries, led by tiny Tuvalu, that the promise of $100 billion in annual climate finance by 2020 amounts to asking them to trade their future “for thirty pieces of silver today,” is a call to conscience that must not be ignored.
It is arguable that in the state of play at Copenhagen, the developing nations had little room to ensure drastic emissions reductions by developed countries without risking the total collapse of the summit. The U.S. came with no offer of enhanced commitments nor were the others willing to bring this issue to the fore. From the ranks of the developed countries, there was no attempt to stand up to American high-handedness, typified by Mr. Obama’s take-it-or-leave-it speech wherein he mangled the well-known UNFCCC principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities” into a new formulation of “common but differentiated responses.” The later lament of the European Union that the Copenhagen Accord missed out on ambitious emission reduction targets need not be taken seriously. The political challenge before the BASIC Four, especially India and China, is to redefine the task of drastic emissions reduction globally, led by the developed nations, in a manner that refuses to counterpose the global public good to the development imperative. Climate laggards in the developed as well as developing world need to be pushed aside in a dialogue that has both the scientific case and the ethical imperative in focus. This demands a stronger display of political will that goes beyond firm negotiating stances and forces all major players in mitigation action to do their due share for humanity.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Far-from-inspiring/article16854357.ece
20,12,2009,Narrow vision,"If Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee’s white paper is to be taken as her “Vision 2020” document, there are no real insights into what she envisages for the Railways. The aim, unfortunately, seems to be to detract from the achievements of the Railways under her predecessor, Lalu Prasad. The white paper, reportedly prepared by a consultant under the supervision of the Railway Board, asserts that the accumulated surplus of Rs.90,000 crore claimed for the period 2004-09 was the result of a change in the accounting system. The real surplus, after allowances are made for the new system and the outgo due to the implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission report, was only Rs.39,500 crore. Strangely, the Railways has decided to continue with the same system of accounting which, the report says, exaggerated the surplus. While Ms Banerjee is known for playing such type of politics, it is a mystery that the ruling coalition should have allowed one of its partners to take a dig at an erstwhile constituent that is still supporting the government.
Whatever the quantum of surplus, there can be no denying that Mr. Lalu Prasad and his team did turn the Railways into an efficient enterprise. It is widely acknowledged that he, while insisting on his priorities, gave the administration enough space to shuffle around and tone up the operational efficiency. The facts speak for themselves. Despite the serious competition from road transport, more revenue was generated through innovative measures, even while keeping the basic passenger fare untouched. Freight tariff was restructured. Loading as well as originating passenger traffic rose significantly during the five years. Ms Banerjee will do well to concentrate on consolidating the gains and finding ways of raising the Rs.14 lakh crore investments the Railways needs, keeping petty politics out of the sound and successful public sector undertaking.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Narrow-vision/article16854356.ece
21,12,2009,Unfulfilled quest,"When a seven-decade long career, marked by game-changing initiatives, comes to a close, hyperbole is hard to avoid. It was truly the ‘end of an era’ last week when the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Lal Krishna Advani, passed the baton to Sushma Swaraj. Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his deputy loomed so large and for so long over the Bharatiya Janata Party that its fortunes became inseparable from their own personal triumphs and losses. The Atal-Advani presence was the prism though which any outsider watched the party’s rise and fall, its raging internal battles, its ideological struggles, and its increasingly awkward relationship with mentor Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Mr. Advani himself would see his long innings as an incomplete journey. “I am not about to retire,” said the formidable rath yatri, the light touch he sought to impart to the moment failing to obscure his disappointment at the way things turned out. Unlike Mr. Vajpayee who reached the pinnacle of success, his deputy lost out more than once. At the peak of his career in 1995, Mr. Advani overrode objections from the BJP rank-and-file and the Sangh to take a backseat to the more ‘moderate’ Mr. Vajpayee. That proved a masterstroke for the BJP and future coalition-builder, but it would be 14 years before Mr. Advani was cast in the role of shadow Prime Minister.
Yet by 2009, the wheel had turned a full circle. The BJP, now deprived of the charismatic and reassuring presence of Mr. Vajpayee, once again faced isolation and rejection, with a resurgent Congress on course for a second term in office. The irony would be greater for Mr. Advani’s interesting effort towards the end of his political career to overcome his fiery rath-yatri persona. The praise he lavished on Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s August 1947 secular orientation was a necessary course correction -- as much for himself as for his party. For the BJP’s minder in Jhandewalan, however, there was no sacrilege worse than praising Jinnah, in however qualified and nuanced a manner, on Pakistani soil. It speaks to Mr. Advani’s towering stature in the BJP that he was the automatic choice to lead the party into the 2009 election. But other political factors aside, at 82, Mr. Advani was no match for the Congress troika of Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi, and Rahul Gandhi. He also knew he had reaped as he sowed. He could not dismount the Ayodhya tiger and his party was constitutionally incapable of giving up its divisive communal agenda. With the RSS blessing the installation of Nitin Gadkari as party chief in place of Rajnath Singh, the former Deputy Prime Minister seems destined to watch his party drawn deeper into the embrace of its saffron mentor.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Unfulfilled-quest/article16854572.ece
21,12,2009,Optimistic assessment,"The mid-year review presented recently to Parliament exudes confidence in the state of the Indian economy while simultaneously being circumspect on inflation. Economic growth is likely to be higher than what many official agencies had forecast earlier. The RBI has not revised the forecast of 6 per cent growth (with an upward bias) it made in its July credit policy review. The Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council had pegged its forecast at 6.5 per cent. The Economic Survey released ahead of the Union Budget had predicted a rate between 6.25 per cent and 7.75 per cent for 2009-10. According to the mid-year review, GDP growth will be nearer the upper band. Such robust optimism is based on two related factors. As the global economy shows signs of finally moving out of the prolonged recession, India, China, and a few other developing countries that are in the forefront of recovery have posted growth rates higher than projected earlier. More specifically, the Central Statistical Organisation’s estimate of a robust GDP growth of 7.9 per cent during the second quarter of the year (July- September 2009) exceeded all expectations and prompted many professional forecasters to mark up the growth projections. However, it is doubtful whether data from just one quarter can be the basis for predicting an increase in growth that is clearly above the more recent trends. The economy grew by 6.7 per cent in 2008-09 and by 6.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2009-10.
The second quarter growth has been driven by the strong performance of the manufacturing sector and some specific segments of the services sector that have clearly benefited from the stimulus packages and the implementation of the pay commission report. Although the government has said that the stimulus measures will not be withdrawn in a hurry, they cannot also be continued for very long. Also, while industrial growth led by the manufacturing and services segments is spurring the growth momentum, the performance of agriculture is causing serious concern. With a disappointing growth rate of 0.9 per cent in the second quarter, agriculture is expected to fare worse in the third quarter when the full impact of the shortfall in the output of major Kharif crops will be felt. The surge in inflation might dampen growth expectations. Even though the supply side factors have been underpinning inflation, monetary policy will also have to kick in to control the situation. Once again the RBI faces a stark choice of continuing its soft interest rate stance or tackling inflation through tighter money.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Optimistic-assessment/article16854571.ece
22,12,2009,Breakthrough on health care,"At 1 a.m. on December 21, the United States Senate voted 60-40 on a closure motion to cut off a Republican filibuster over amendments to the health-care bill. The debate had been fierce and partisan, and the voting was strictly on party lines, with all 58 Democrats, supported by the two Independents, for the motion and all 40 Republicans, including the previously wavering Olympia Snowe of Maine, against it. The move to end the debate is, in fact, not stated anywhere in the U.S. Constitution, and has been imposed by the Senate on itself. That shows how seriously Democratic Senators take the bill, which is indisputably the most significant legislative measure President Obama has initiated so far. Republican opposition to the proposed law, however, is so fierce that the Senate Democrats will have to get 60 votes on two, if not four, more occasions; the final vote may in fact be taken as late as 7 p.m. on Christmas Eve. The key point is that the Republican Senators can no longer block the bill.
The bill still faces serious obstacles. Its final form is uncertain, as the version the Senate -- if all goes to plan for the Democrats -- passes could go to a Conference Committee of Senators and Representatives for reconciliation with the version passed 220-215 by the House of Representatives on November 7. Serious problems will almost certainly arise at that stage. First, the House version contains a government cover plan, the so-called public option, for the low paid, but Senate majority leader Harry Reid has had to drop that in order to gain the vote of the Independent Joe Lieberman. Secondly, there will be sharp disagreements over abortion. The Senate text excludes federal funding for insurance plans that offer abortion services, but it does not ban individuals from paying separate insurance cheques to cover abortion; the House version bans all insurers who receive federal funding from offering any such services. A third area of dispute is overall funding for costs estimated to be close to $900 billion over a decade. Furthermore, angry things are being said about the Senate’s removal of the public option by those like Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean and Senator Russ Feingold. The issues are so complicated that the House and the Senate may not even appoint a Conference Committee but instead hold negotiations involving Democrat leaders and committee chairpersons from both chambers. White House officials are likely to play a substantial part in such negotiations. The health-care bill still has a long way to go but that its proponents have succeeded in taking it even this far is, as economics Nobel laureate Paul Krugman says, an “awesome achievement.”",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Breakthrough-on-health-care/article16854807.ece
22,12,2009,Pandemic vaccine is safe,"The recent announcement by the World Health Organisation that no serious and unexpected adverse effects have been seen in the nearly 65 million people who have been vaccinated for the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) in 16 countries is encouraging. Apprehensions about the vaccine’s safety were raised by the medical fraternity in a few countries and parents were unwilling to get their children vaccinated. The vaccine was seen as a new and experimental drug hurried along in fast-track mode, tested on a small number of volunteers, and followed up for an inadequate duration. Though fast-tracking flu vaccines is routine as the basic ingredients remain the same, a frontal objection was raised by the New England Journal of Medicine in an editorial: “any association of uncommon adverse events with this vaccine cannot be ascertained in studies of this size.” Reports from following up millions of people after vaccination have now put at rest the safety concerns. The side effects -- swelling, redness, pain at the site of injection, fever, and headache -- were the common and anticipated ones; they resolved themselves spontaneously soon after vaccination. Although a small number of deaths occurred in people who had been vaccinated, investigations have shown that no direct link could be established between vaccination and the deaths; underlying medical conditions were found to have caused these deaths. The risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome -- a rare autoimmune disorder that damages the peripheral nervous system, and in rare cases can cause permanent paralysis or even death -- following vaccination was one of the most feared serious adverse effects. According to the WHO, fewer than ten suspected cases of this rare syndrome were encountered and all the patients recovered eventually.
According to the world body, the safety profiles were no different in inactivated and live attenuated vaccines. Likewise, there was little difference between adjuvant (a substance added to a vaccine to improve its effectiveness) and non-adjuvant vaccines. The safety profile of adjuvant vaccines, which the WHO recommends, is particularly important. The use of adjuvant reduces the amount of vaccine used in a dose, which means a greater number of people to be vaccinated under constrained circumstances. While A(H1N1) adjuvant vaccine is used in many countries in Europe, and adjuvant has been routinely used in seasonal influenza vaccine for over a decade, the U.S. has not approved it. Despite the safety profile of A(H1N1) vaccine matching the seasonal influenza vaccine, the need for continuous monitoring of those vaccinated cannot be over-emphasised.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Pandemic-vaccine-is-safe/article16854806.ece
23,12,2009,Another bout of instability,"Jharkhand seems headed for another five years of political instability with the three main players, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress, managing to deny one another a clear majority in the Legislative Assembly. For a stable coalition to take shape, two of the three parties must come together. Since a BJP-Congress coalition is unthinkable, the JMM and independents are in an enviable position. Thus, to nobody’s surprise, even as the election trends were firming up, the JMM reinforced its reputation as an unpredictable and opportunistic ally, up for sale to the highest bidder: senior leaders insist that the party’s support to any combine would depend on its chief Shibu Soren being made Chief Minister. Steeped as it is in a history of cases relating to corruption, the most notable being the bribery of JMM members of Parliament during a no-confidence motion in 1993 to vote in favour of the Narasimha Rao government, and violence, the JMM will be a difficult political partner -- ready to do business at any point with either the BJP or the Congress. That the party continues to command a sizable section of the tribal votes in Jharkhand speaks poorly of representative politics in this underdeveloped State. Jharkhand is yet to emerge out of semi-feudal backwardness, and for large sections of people, tribal loyalties tend to override other considerations on polling day.
The BJP, which bagged 30 seats in 2005, is the biggest loser this time, managing only 18. Evidently, the loss of Babulal Marandi, the first Chief Minister of Jharkhand, is still hurting. Mr. Marandi’s Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik), in alliance with the Congress, won 11 seats. The BJP’s ally, the Janata Dal (United), also suffered reverses, winning merely two seats against the six won last time. The Congress, with 14 seats, got five seats more than in 2005. The JMM retained its support base, increasing its tally by one to 18. The Rashtriya Janata Dal, a small player in Jharkhand, held on to 5 seats, down two. Even if the Congress wins over the RJD in the name of a broad secular alliance, the coalition would still be far short of the 41 MLAs needed to constitute a majority. Shibu Soren has thus emerged as kingmaker yet again, and he will make his decision solely on the basis of who makes the better offer. The Congress, as head of the United Progressive Alliance government at the centre, can obviously offer more than the BJP. But what is clear is that no matter what Mr. Soren decides, Jharkhand is set for a repeat of the political volatility of the last four years, which witnessed the bizarre spectacle of an Independent, Madhu Koda, reigning as Chief Minister between 2006 and 2008.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Another-bout-of-instability/article16855000.ece
23,12,2009,Receding hopes,"The World Trade Organisation’s seventh ministerial meeting held earlier this month at Geneva ended without anything substantial to show. But then the meeting was not meant to be “a substantive negotiating round.” It did not face the kind of controversies that marred previous ministerial meetings at Seattle (1999) and Cancun (2003), which collapsed amidst intense acrimony. At Geneva, trade ministers were given an agenda that deliberately skirted the substantive issues plaguing the WTO and the stalled Doha round. However, the WTO’s own assessment of the ministerial is more upbeat, as has been the case every time a meeting — official or non-official — ended in a failure. According to its official statement, the conference sent a strong signal of convergence on the importance of Doha round talks to economic recovery and poverty alleviation in developing countries. The ministers reaffirmed the need to complete the Doha round by 2010. A stock-taking exercise is to be held by March next year. The one point on which the member countries have agreed upon since the Hong Kong ministerial meeting (2005) is that the Doha round should be kept alive. However, with each successive failure, hopes of salvaging it are fast receding.
India has special reasons to feel disappointed over the lack of real progress in the eight-year-old Doha development round. The two-day Delhi mini-ministerial in September paved the way for restarting active trade negotiations at the level of trade ministers. Chief negotiators and trade officials were asked to prepare an agenda for action. Like the subsequent Geneva ministerial with a broader participation, the Delhi talks were about processes rather than substantial issues. Despite considerable improvements, the refined texts of the drafts on agriculture and non-agricultural market access (NAMA) remain contentious. For India, an important outstanding issue is that of bringing negotiations in services on a par with those in agriculture and NAMA. There is very little indication, even from the Geneva ministerial meeting, that services negotiations will move to the centre stage. It will be unrealistic to expect the Doha round to be wrapped up soon. There are a number of divisive issues that can be deal-breakers. For instance, the framework of a special safeguards mechanism in agriculture that will satisfy all is yet to be worked out. There is an all-round realisation that a successful completion of the Doha round will strengthen the multilateral trading system and boost orderly trade. That, however, seems quite some distance away.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Receding-hopes/article16854999.ece
24,12,2009,Way out in Andhra Pradesh,"Union Home Minister P.

The backtracking and throwing up of the central government’s hands are understandable. They have had the immediate effect of calming a volatile situation in the coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema regions, which together account for 175 of the State’s 294 MLAs. But predictably, the statement has produced the opposite effect in Telangana. While it may be too soon to get the measure of the violence unleashed in this region, the early incidents of bus burning, stone pelting, attacks on shops and government offices, and sporadic targeting of properties belonging to ‘settlers’ from the Andhra region do not augur well for the State. Nor does the fact that more than 60 of the 119 MLAs from the Telangana region have initiated ‘resignation’ moves. (By the time Mr. Chidambaram made his second statement on December 23, 143 of the 175 MLAs from the coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema regions had submitted their ‘resignations’; many of them are now believed to be ready to withdraw them.) There can be little doubt that by announcing — without wider political consultations at the national level and without assessing the public mood across the State — that “the process of forming the State of Telangana will be initiated” and “an appropriate resolution will be moved in the State Assembly,” the central government made a costly blunder. Overnight, a difficult situation created in the State capital by the fast of Telangana Rashtra Samithi leader K. Chandrasekhar Rao was transformed into a first-rate political crisis for the whole State. The legislature has been paralysed and the executive branch reduced to dysfunctionality despite sensible attempts by Chief Minister K. Rosaiah to moderate the situation.
But in terms of what went wrong and what needs to be done, Mr. Chidambaram’s latest statement does the service of restoring the political balance by placing the crisis in perspective. What is now clear is this. Not just the Congress party and the central government but most political parties concerned with the long-festering Telangana issue miscalculated and blundered badly. They must therefore accept special responsibility for correcting the situation through constructive responses rather than by exploiting the political troubles of the ruling party. The minutes of the meeting convened by Chief Minister Rosaiah on December 7 reveal that all parties, with the exception of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the All-India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), and the Lok Satta, supported the move to initiate the process of forming a State of Telangana by tabling a resolution in the Andhra Pradesh Assembly. The Telugu Desam Party and the Praja Rajyam Party might have done a total volte face under the pressure of mass constituency revolts but that does not absolve them of a special responsibility to cooperate with the State and central governments in the efforts to resolve the political crisis.
What then is to be done about the future of independent India’s first linguistic State? The first thing the central government needs to do is to firm up its political resolve not to capitulate on a vital issue under the threat of orchestrated militancy and violence. But it also needs to show political imagination and good footwork. Setting up the long-promised Second States Reorganisation Commission will be a good idea. The best way to strengthen Chief Minister Rosaiah’s hand in dealing with the crisis will be a combination of political clear-headedness and practical support in the form of adequate central forces to deal with the public order challenge. Everyone knows that long-festering problems do not allow for easy solutions. The Telangana issue as we know it has been around for half a century, and there is also a pre-history of a revolutionary struggle against landlordism in the region. The Congress party has always had an ambiguous stand on this issue. While recent Congress election manifestoes have bought time by either proposing a Second States Reorganisation Commission (in 2004) or remaining silent (in 2009), it is notable that under the pressure of coalition politics, the National Common Minimum Programme of May 2004 made this promise: “The UPA government will consider the demand for the formation of a Telangana state at an appropriate time after due consultations and consensus.” The party’s strongest and most resourceful State leader of recent times, Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, managed to keep the problem under control by first forming a committee under Mr. Rosaiah to study it, and then by trouncing the TRS in its own region in the 2009 Lok Sabha and Assembly elections. But YSR’s death in a helicopter crash changed everything, including the rules of the political game in Telangana. The Maoist presence in the region may be a cause for concern but it should not be allowed to cloud clear thinking. One lesson to be learnt is that on an intractable issue like Telangana, the need to arrive at a national-level political consensus through democratic consultations is inescapable. Recent events have only strengthened the logic of the argument presented in >The Hindu’s editorial of December 9, 2009 that while the diagnosis of the backwardness and neglect of the Telangana region is sound and must be empathised with, a just and progressive solution can be found within an undivided Andhra Pradesh on the basis of regional autonomy and big, concentrated development efforts.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Way-out-in-Andhra-Pradesh/article16855145.ece
25,12,2009,How to face security challenges,"“By a quirk of fate,” Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram said in a December 23 lecture to the Intelligence Bureau, “India in the twenty-first century has turned out to be the confluence of every kind of violence: insurrection or insurgency in order to carve out sovereign states; armed liberation struggle motivated by a rejected ideology; and terrorism driven by religious fanaticism. Never before has the Indian state faced such a formidable challenge.” Drawing on the lessons of the November 2008 carnage in Mumbai, he proposed a new architecture for India’s internal security administration. There would be a single-point source of authority for all counter-terrorism-related issues. Key counter-terrorism elements of organisations as diverse as the Intelligence Bureau, the Research and Analysis Wing, the National Intelligence Agency, and the National Security Guard would be brought under the supervisory authority of a National Counter-Terrorism Centre. The NCTC, in turn, would be accountable to a Ministry dedicated to internal security — and a Minister with internal security as her or his primary task.
The case for a new administrative architecture for security is compelling. It starts with the identification of a longstanding malaise in India’s security bureaucracy — the use of administrative deux ex machina to evade the kinds of sustained work and attention to detail that are needed to fix deep-rooted problems. The great November 2008 tragedy in Mumbai provides a useful prism to reflect on the problem. India possessed a copious mass of intelligence leads suggesting the Lashkar-e-Taiba was planning an attack on Mumbai. But it failed to capitalise on these leads not because there was no single-point authority but because the intelligence services lacked the necessary technological and human resource capabilities. The Mumbai Police made strenuous efforts to deal with the attacks but clearly lacked the resources and the training. The NSG’s less-than-brilliant response to the fighting stemmed from poor training and leadership issues. None of these failures, and others too numerous to enumerate here, have been properly audited by an independent, public enquiry. Even had there been an NCTC in place during the Mumbai terror attacks, it would have lacked the capabilities to handle events with any greater efficiency than what was on display. Setting up an NCTC and an Internal Security Ministry may facilitate the development of capabilities to face the challenges the Home Minister has described. But without a highly professional and dispassionate assessment of precisely what India’s security weaknesses are, and how they must be addressed, the creation of new administrative machinery will achieve little.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/How-to-face-security-challenges/article16855300.ece
25,12,2009,Factor in climate refugees,"The world is familiar with refugee movements caused by war, famine, and natural disasters. It is overwhelmingly the poorer third world states that do not close their borders and accept millions of refugees, some of whom remain for years. Today, among developed countries, the United States, Sweden, and Finland offer temporary shelter to victims of natural disasters, and Denmark accepted some Afghan drought victims from 2001 to 2006. Global warming, however, is already on the point of creating a new category — the climate refugee. According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), current mitigation efforts could result in a global average temperature rise of 3 degrees Celsius rather than 2 degrees. In that event, the Economic Review of Climate Change (the Stern Review) suggests, 550 million more people would be at risk of hunger, and 170 million more would suffer severe coastal floods. Crop yields would fall sharply, and there would be more droughts interspersed with more severe flooding. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says that climate change may displace 150 million people by 2050; the Stern Review puts the figure at 200 million.
Larger climate changes pose potentially gigantic refugee problems. To start with, it is harder to identify the victims of slower processes than those of sudden natural disasters. Secondly, the victims of wider climate change fall through the net of definitions in international law. The current U.N. treaty, the Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, dates from 1951, and applies only to those who fear or flee persecution. As for internal displacement, the current U.N. document, Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, dates from 1998 and is not legally binding, though it seems to cover most of those who flee natural disasters but do not cross national borders. The problem with more severe climate change is that those who cross national borders will not be covered by any U.N. instrument, as they will not satisfy the 1951 definition of refugees. A senior U.N. official says that reopening the 1951 convention would be legally risky because the original negotiations that brought it into being were very difficult, and it may be no easier to reach an agreement now. The difficulty of reaching, let alone enforcing, any agreement will be compounded by the fact that it is the poorest in the poorest countries who will suffer most and in the greatest numbers.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Factor-in-climate-refugees/article16855299.ece
28,12,2009,The wonder that is Rajarajesvaram,"Only a few monuments of global importance have received the kind of attention the Brihadisvara temple at Thanjavur has from historians, archaeologists, artists, dancers, and epigraphists alike. The grandest of South Indian temples, an architectural masterpiece, enters its millennium year in 2010 — an occasion to celebrate its importance and contribution to world heritage. The monumental scale, clarity in design, and structural innovations set it apart from all other temples. When Rajaraja I, the illustrious Chola emperor (985-1014 CE), completed the building of the temple in 1010, it far exceeded anything that was built before. The high point of design is the vimana (tower over sanctum). This unusually tall vimana was a structural innovation of the first rank. Designing a 60-metre-tall tower was a great challenge that was ingeniously resolved. For the first time in temple history, a double-walled sanctum that coalesces at the third tier to support the tower was built. On top of good design, the choice of granite contributed to its endurance. About 50,000 cubic metres of granite were utilised to build this complex. This was a stupendous effort considering that there was no granite quarry in the surrounding region.
Debates on the construction of Rajarajesvaram, as the temple was known during the Chola period, remain inconclusive. Stories abound about how a simple linear ramp stretching to a distance of seven kilometres was built and workers dragged the stones to the pinnacle. Alternative versions that suggest the construction of concentric short ramps around the tower are also in circulation. However it was built, there is no disputing the unsurpassable precision of the temple’s layout and the perfection of design compliance. The abundant and richly detailed inscriptions found on the temple walls make it a treasure-house of historical information. Various aspects of medieval society and temple management were revealed by assiduously studying these inscriptions. The sensational discovery of Chola frescoes in 1931 in the dark passage around the sanctum, under the light of a ‘Baby Petromax,’ enhanced the importance of the temple. Seven panels were revealed when later-period paintings hiding them were removed (and safely transferred for conservation elsewhere). Rajarajesvaram’s contribution to the history of dance is no less important: it is the only temple to have 81 of the 108 karanas or dance postures carved on its walls. Happily, the conservation efforts within this world heritage site, one of the wonders of the medieval world, are commendable. However, the experience of the diligent heritage-tourist can be enriched if the site museum can be designed better and comprehensive information provided in an accessible manner.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-wonder-that-is-Rajarajesvaram/article16855635.ece
28,12,2009,Disquieting fall in collections,"The data on tax collections released recently by the Finance Ministry provide an interesting snapshot of the state of the economy as a whole. During the first eight months of the year (April-November 2009), indirect tax receipts were down 21 per cent from a year ago. On present trends, the budget estimate for all indirect taxes is unlikely to be achieved. Taxes under all the three major heads — excise, customs, and services tax — have reported significantly lower growth. Customs duties have yielded a little over Rs.52,000 crore, against the budget estimate of Rs.98,000 crore for the whole year. Excise collections at Rs.60,000 crore are 56 per cent of the budget estimate, Rs.1,06,500 crore. Taxes on services are close to the half-way mark but, under all heads, considerable ground will have to be covered in the remaining four months. Even granting that tax collections are generally more robust during the last quarter, there is likely to be a significant shortfall in indirect taxes. The Finance Minister’s hope that direct tax collections during the year will offset the decline in indirect taxes is unlikely to materialise. Direct tax receipts during the first eight months are at Rs.1,83,822 crore. If the budget estimate of Rs.3,70,000 crore is to be met, tax collections during the last four months should exceed this figure.
In what is optimistically seen to be a harbinger of things to come, advance tax collections till December have increased by 20 per cent. Buoyancy in this area can be attributed to the rebound in specific sectors rather than broad-based recovery. There is evidence that some companies have cut costs, boosted productivity and rode the downturn better than many others. Economic growth, which during the second half of 2008-09 slipped below 6 per cent, has since been climbing — it posted an impressive 7 per cent during April-September. It is likely that the growth rate is as high as 8 per cent for the whole year. As economic growth becomes more broad-based, tax revenues will certainly pick up. Already, the recovery in exports, reversing a prolonged decline, should augur well for higher customs duty collections. It remains to be seen how the government will balance the need for continuing the economic stimulus provided by way of tax cuts and the need for higher revenue and fiscal consolidation. With major tax reforms on the anvil, it is hoped that the tax system will capture the gains from economic growth more accurately.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Disquieting-fall-in-collections/article16855636.ece
29,12,2009,The rot beyond Rathore,"If the appalling facts surrounding the case of sexual molestation of a 14-year-old girl by a senior Haryana police officer, S.P.S. Rathore, have transfixed the nation, this is because of the blatant manner in which the accused was able to use his position to subvert the course of justice. Even in a country inured to the rich, powerful, and shameless getting away, the full spectrum dominance unleashed on the helpless girl’s family by Rathore set a new low. And yet, the instant case is not just a morality play about the criminality of one man. It is a cautionary tale about the multiple layers of protection that well-connected offenders enjoy in the Indian criminal justice system by design and default. Subversion begins right after the offence is committed, when the victim finds it impossible to get the local police to register a first information report. Despite numerous court rulings and official guidelines on this matter, police stations around the country routinely refuse to file FIRs against police officers, politicians, and other influential notables. And even if a case is filed, the police often join hands with the accused person’s lawyers to ensure the matter gets delayed for years on end. The foisting of false cases on the family of Rathore’s victim was another old trick the police officer resorted to.
Rathore and men like him are able to get away with such abuses of authority because they are ever ready to commit similar illegalities for their political masters. Unless meaningful police reforms are introduced, this problem will not go away. The Indian system is also surprisingly lenient towards law enforcement officers who try and frame innocent citizens. In the Shopian case involving the suspicious death of two Kashmiri women, the Central Bureau of Investigation, which investigated the circumstances of their death, went a step further and filed criminal charges against a number of individuals who had allegedly sought to incriminate the security forces in the incident. But the same CBI, which took up the Rathore case and came across indisputable evidence of police vendetta against his victim’s brother, did not see fit to file charges against Rathore and all the subordinate policemen involved in the malicious prosecution of the young man on bogus accusations of auto theft. Even at this late stage, it is essential that the CBI be tasked with unearthing the identity of the dozens of bureaucrats, policemen, and politicians who conspired with Rathore to pervert the course of justice. Haryana’s former DGP must get his legal comeuppance; but those who helped him all these years must also get their due.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/The-rot-beyond-Rathore/article16855983.ece
29,12,2009,Disgrace at Ferozeshah Kotla,"The fiasco at New Delhi’s Ferozeshah Kotla, where the playing surface was deemed too dangerous for play during the fifth ODI between India and Sri Lanka, showed Indian cricket in unflattering light. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) have several uncomfortable questions to answer. Despite curators at the Kotla as well as the BCCI’s pitches committee stating that the wicket square, re-laid after the IPL was shifted to South Africa, required at least a year to settle, the ground hosted the Champions League T20 and an ODI between India and Australia in October. The pitches for both occasions were criticised (although for a different reason — for being low and slow). A damning indictment came in November when an ICC team, inspecting the stadium in connection with the 2011 World Cup, found that the pitch block required further improvement if it were to be acceptable for the match on December 27. Despite the many warning signals, disaster was invited. The question is: are India’s administrators, who proudly proclaim their success at monetising the game, really up to handling cricket’s intricacies?
As is the case with failure, the episode contains significant lessons. Disbanding the centralised pitches committee, as the BCCI has done, seems little more than an exercise in deflecting the blame. The Board would do better by investigating the ICC team’s observation of differences in opinion between the local curators and the centralised committee. Detail is everything in matters as complex as pitch preparation, and the administration must have in charge of the investigation impartial experts aware of the subtleties of the subject. The Board also owes the public an explanation of why it scheduled cricket at the Kotla despite being cautioned against it. Delhi’s future as host of the World Cup is deservedly in jeopardy: should the ICC find the surface “unfit,” which is match referee Alan Hurst’s assessment, Kotla’s international status could be suspended for a period of between 12 and 24 months. But if the ICC’s evaluation finds the surface merely “poor,” a less serious offence, the venue will at most incur a fine not exceeding $15,000. India’s administrators don’t deserve to get off on a technicality. What they do next will be followed closely. Already a dismaying example has been set by the DDCA: association member Kirti Azad walked out of Tuesday’s annual general meeting, alleging he was insulted. It now falls on the BCCI, the world’s richest cricketing body, to show it can act with transparency and accountability, virtues it is rarely credited with.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Disgrace-at-Ferozeshah-Kotla/article16855984.ece
29,12,2009,An opportunistic coalition,"Past political animosities often melt away in the context of present political exigencies. Given the fragmented nature of the electoral verdict in Jharkhand, a post-election pact between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha was waiting to happen. The BJP wanted to keep the Congress out at any cost, and the JMM wanted itself in, no matter what. All that remained for the two parties to do was to rope in the All Jharkhand Students Union and to decide on the ministerial berths. Since the JMM would not settle for anything less than the post of the chief minister for its leader Shibu Soren, it was decided to have two deputy chief ministers, one from the BJP and the other from AJSU. With all the three parties clear and firm on their minimum demands, not much time was lost in bargaining. Even before the Congress could explore its options, the JMM and the BJP had lined up 44 members on the other side, three more than the required 41 in the 81-member Assembly. Despite making significant gains in the election, the Congress was pushed to the Opposition benches, along with its ally the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik). Given the way the numbers fell in place, Governor K. Sankaranarayanan had little difficulty in inviting Mr. Soren to form the government.
But the manoeuvring and manipulation that Shibu Soren displayed in forging the alliance will not help him in governance. Working together in government is never as easy as joining hands to capture power. In his third term as Chief Minister, Mr. Soren will have to tackle Jharkhand’s chronic underdevelopment and the challenge from the Maoists. Tapping the mineral resources of the State without unsettling tribal populations will be a tough ask. The Scheduled Tribes constitute 28 per cent of the population and the Scheduled Castes 12 per cent. Forests and woodlands occupy about 29 per cent of the geographical area. The economy is dependent on mining and heavy industry, and only 25 per cent of the total area is under cultivation. The new government will have to work hard to improve the social indices of the State. Large sections of the population have been left behind even as Jharkhand was mined for its natural resources. Mr. Soren’s two previous terms were short-lived, the first in 2005 because he did not enjoy majority support in the Assembly, and the second in January 2009 when he could not muster the voter support to win an Assembly seat. If his new term is not to be similarly aborted, Mr. Soren will need more than the single-minded pursuit of power he has displayed so far to see him through. He will have to focus on development without letting the divisive agenda of his coalition partner, the BJP, rear its head.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/An-opportunistic-coalition/article16855852.ece
29,12,2009,Saving the vultures,"Vultures may not win mass support as candidates for aggressive wildlife conservation, but there is renewed concern that three endemic species of the critically endangered bird among the nine recorded in South Asia could perish without active support. The scientific community has been examining the effects of ‘ketoprofen,’ a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) given to livestock, on Cape griffon and African white-backed vultures. These species are surrogates for the three endangered ones in the sub-continent — the oriental white-backed, slender-billed, and long-billed vultures. The scientists’ findings, published in the journal Biology Letters, indicate that this NSAID is deadly for Gyps vultures. Moreover, it is detected in livestock carcasses in India at toxic levels. The new evidence is cause for worry as it is the second such veterinary drug with serious consequences for the health of vultures. Earlier, ‘diclofenac’ administered to livestock was linked to a massive decline in Gyps vulture populations and this led to a ban on its use for veterinary purposes. Hearteningly, the Ministry of Environment and Forests is responding to the concern with support for conservation efforts. The chemical threat of course is by no means the only factor decimating vultures. Ornithologists point out that these birds are generally unaffected in protected areas. Preservation of habitat is therefore as critical as elimination of harmful veterinary drugs and captive breeding initiatives. As natural forests and other habitat shrink, the birds seek carrion over a wider area, including cities. They are then fatally exposed to carcasses that have toxic drug residues.
The first step in a long-term vulture conservation programme should be to produce a comprehensive population estimate of the birds. This will help map the areas that show declines and identify the cause of mortality. There is some useful baseline data in the form of transect surveys done since 1990, but there are gaps in the areas surveyed. Making a comparison of population estimates thus becomes difficult and the results remain tentative. Secondly, conservation measures need to address the question of availability of safe veterinary drugs for the millions of livestock distributed across the country. Going by recent research findings, NSAIDs for livestock that do not affect vultures are available and the challenge is to distribute them widely. Many vultures also die after feeding on carcasses of animals that were poisoned by people for revenge. An awareness campaign on the consequences of avoidable human-animal conflict can raise their survival chances.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Saving-the-vultures/article16855851.ece
30,12,2009,Developing the western corridor,"The project to build a Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) got the much-needed push, with the signing of two Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) between the Japanese and Indian institutions. The DMIC Development Corporation and the Japanese JETRO are to promote 24 eco-cities or smart communities along the corridor, while the Japan Bank for International Cooperation has offered a $75 million loan facility to help establish a Project Development Fund to kick-start the project. The DMIC project comprises a host of sub-projects for infrastructure development — for instance industrial estates, power plants, and logistics parks — which are to come up on either side of the proposed 1,483 km Delhi-Mumbai railway freight corridor. The foundation stone for the rail corridor was laid by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh way back in October 2006. This Rs.22,000 crore project is expected to change the face of the western corridor, with the DMIC developing the entire hinterland. The Gujarat government has embarked on a vigorous drive to attract foreign investment for the project and it can be expected to gain momentum as a result of the recent visit of Japanese Prime Minister Yokio Hatoyama. In addition to harnessing Japanese investments and interests, the States along the western corridor will also be tapping foreign and domestic investments for the overall development of the region. The western rail freight corridor will link the Jawaharlal Nehru port and other ports in Gujarat to the industrial belts in the western, central, and northern regions extending up to New Delhi. A separate dedicated corridor to the east has also been planned by the Indian Railways, and the work on it was launched in February. The dedicated corridor is meant to focus exclusively on carrying freight, and the project, conceived in 2004-05, envisages 2,700 km of new freight lines and about 5,000 km of feeder lines.
The western corridor will connect Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Palanpur, Jaipur, Rewari, Tughlakabad, and Dadri. It is now for the Government of India, and all the agencies involved in the massive project — including the Railways, the State governments, and even the Planning Commission — to work in close coordination and ensure that it does not suffer undue delays and the consequent cost over-runs. Japan wants to showcase the DMIC as a model not just for India, but the whole world. To begin with, the Indian agencies need to expedite the basic work on the feasibility report, environmental clearances, land acquisition, and preparation of a blueprint for the whole project. The prospective investors will need a definite time frame and a detailed plan to finalise their investment plans.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Developing-the-western-corridor/article16856169.ece
30,12,2009,A worthwhile programme,"The National Biomass Cookstove Initiative launched recently will for the first time put the user at the centre of the efforts to develop improved chulhas. The programme that was started in 1986, and discontinued in 2002, aimed at providing improved chulhas to reduce indoor pollution and fuel consumption. It is a classic example of how developing a product for the rural masses without the involvement of actual users is destined to fail. The abject failure to understand the cooking habits and the lack of facilities to maintain the chulhas were the primary reasons for the improved chulhas not evoking widespread interest. While the programme helped in spreading awareness about the need to improve cooking practices to reduce smoke, it failed to achieve the primary objective of reducing indoor pollution. The government appears to have finally learnt from its mistakes; the latest initiative makes it abundantly clear that the cookstoves will be “easy to use and maintain” and will “conform to local cooking habits.” It also does not see the cookstoves to be “free handouts” but as “economically sustainable business solutions.”
If reducing indoor pollution was the main objective of the earlier programme, the latest initiative seeks to achieve the twin objectives of reducing indoor pollution and cutting the amount of soot emitted. Indoor pollution from stoves is a major public health issue. According to the World Health Organisation estimates for 2002, nearly 400,000 deaths were attributable to indoor pollution from chulhas. Soot arising from incomplete burning of fossil fuel and biomass used in chulhas is seen as a contributory factor to climate change, whose effects are manifesting themselves in the melting of the Himalayan glaciers and the erratic behaviour of the monsoons. The potential to slow down the pace of global warming by reducing the soot emitted from chulhas has caught the attention not only of India but of a few developed countries as well. Chulhas are used in many developing countries leading to the continual emission of soot. However, unlike carbon dioxide, the life span of soot in the atmosphere is only a few days or weeks. Hence any solution that would cut soot emission has the potential to quickly bring about discernible changes in atmospheric pollution. With climate change issues coming to the fore, it is small wonder that the quest for improved chulhas should get a fillip. Under the new programme, apart from testing the commercially available cookstoves and processed biomass fuels, work are to be taken up on developing the next-generation cookstoves and biomass-processing technologies.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/A-worthwhile-programme/article16856168.ece
