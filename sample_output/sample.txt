<|START|><[PROMPT]>Women and Elections for the People[RESPONSE]The Uttar Pradesh Assembly election was a toss-up between the BJP and the Congress, with the Congress and the BJP winning each time, while the BJP lost the Assembly by a substantial margin of 20 percentage points. The results were not entirely surprising, given that the BJP has not won a single vote since the 2014 Lok Sabha election, and the Congress in the past has won only four seats in the Assembly. The BJP won all 11 Assembly seats in the Assembly, and its tally was even more impressive when compared to the tally of the other parties. The BJP, which has a history of polarisation, has been in power since the 1990s, and has won seven of the six Assembly seats in the State. The BJP was the dominant party in the State, and it managed to win all eight Assembly seats, including three from the Congress. The BJP, on the other hand, won only two seats in the Assembly, the only one from the Congress.

<|START|><[PROMPT]>Women and Elections[RESPONSE]It has been a long time since the Election Commission of India (ECI) first asked the Election Commission to probe the BJP’s election strategy in Gujarat. But now, with the BJP’s victory in the Assembly elections, the ECI has confirmed that a total of 13 candidates are on its watch list. This is the first time the ECI has been asked to probe the BJP’s electoral strategy in Gujarat. The ECI’s own polling figures, which were released on Wednesday, have been far from encouraging. The ECI’s Election Commission’s latest tally is a sharp improvement on its earlier tally of 16 candidates, including three BJP candidates. But it does not include the two BJP candidates, including two former Chief Ministers, who have been on the watch list. The ECI’s tally is not the first to show that a BJP candidate has been given the nod for the election. In the previous election

<|START|><[PROMPT]>Women and Elections: On the latest poll[RESPONSE]In a campaign that has seen the BJP-led Bharatiya Janata Party dominating the polls, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s win in the Delhi Assembly election was a welcome development. The BJP’s victory in the Delhi Assembly elections was one of the biggest surprises in the polls, as the BJP was able to retain its majority in the Lok Sabha, and its support from the wider electorate. The BJP has been in a constant state of crisis since the State Assembly elections last year. The first two years of the Assembly election saw a series of elections that were held in the Lok Sabha. The BJP won the one-two punch of the Lok Sabha elections, but the results were not entirely unexpected. The BJP won the Lok Sabha elections in 2004 and 2007, but was unable to achieve the ‘national’ status of the BJP’s national leadership. The BJP’s strength in the Lok Sabha election

<|START|><[PROMPT]>Time for India to take center stage for peace talks[RESPONSE]The United Nations Security Council has called for talks on the implementation of the Geneva Conventions on the elimination of the use of cluster munitions in conflict zones, and for a comprehensive and transparent process of international cooperation on humanitarian and humanitarian law. It has also called for an end to the indiscriminate use of cluster munitions by members of the Indian armed forces, in violation of the Geneva Conventions and the International Convention on Cluster Munitions. The resolution, which was passed by the Security Council, calls for a “complete and transparent investigation into the use of cluster munitions, including by the use of force, in conflict zones, and for the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction, including cluster munitions, in conflict zones”. The draft resolution does not address the question of whether the use of cluster munitions is “unlawful, or lawful”; there is no mention of whether the use of cluster munitions has been authorised by the U.N.

<|START|><[PROMPT]>Time for India to take center stage[RESPONSE]It has been a long time since India’s Premier League season ended. The tournament was over a year ago and it was not just the loss of the title that had caused India’s woes. But by winning the title, the country has come close to a fourth successive Asian Cup final, and is on course to complete the feat of qualifying for the tournament in 2013. The series, which was held in the United Arab Emirates, had been in the works for a while, but the World Cup came along. The U.S. was eliminated in the final by a fourth-place finish. It is difficult to ignore the fact that India’s recent success has been a tribute to its international spirit. It’s a phenomenon that is being replicated in the United States, which has done well to make the tournament a success story. The U.S. has a huge amount of international experience to offer, and the Americans have the best record

<|START|><[PROMPT]>Time for India to take center stage[RESPONSE]In a speech to the Hindu Congress Conference last April, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh reiterated that he would not allow India’s current political environment to lead to a “more inclusive society”. But it is not clear if he has come out in support of the idea of a “new India”. In his speech, Mr. Singh also made a reference to the “new India” — “a new India” — and called on the Indian people to “take the lead” in moving towards a more inclusive India. In the same speech, Mr. Singh said that there was no need for a new “India”. But, he said, he would not allow the current political situation to lead to a “more inclusive society”.
The BJP’s recent stand in the Lok Sabha election has exposed the disquiet in the U.S. Congress, which is seeking to
